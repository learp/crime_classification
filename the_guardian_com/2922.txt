Detectives investigating the brutal murder of two Chinese students in Newcastle appealed yesterday for an unidentified lodger to come forward.A Chinese man who was due to move in with Xi Zhou and her boyfriend Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, days before their death might be able to help the inquiry, police said. The couple, both graduates of Newcastle University, were attacked in their ground floor flat in the city's West End with a knife and another sharp weapon and suffered severe head injuries. The couple's cat had also been drowned.Police said the victims had advertised a bedroom for rent on a local Chinese website. Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, who is leading the inquiry, said Yang had told his mother in China by telephone that he had taken on a lodger, a student from the northern city of Dalian. "We urgently need to identify this unknown lodger who could have vital information to assist the murder investigation, and to eliminate him from our enquiries."It is not certain the lodger ever moved in. None of his possessions were found. It has emerged that Yang may have been involved in an internet betting scam but Wade said the couple's ordinary lifestyle was "not what could be expected of anyone involved in organised crime". He added: "The level of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couple's computer."
