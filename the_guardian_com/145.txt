A businessman was crushed to death after interrupting a gang of professional burglars as they ransacked his property, a court has heard.Julian Gardner, 52, was woken after intruders entered Bush Barn Farm, near Robertsbridge, East Sussex, where he ran a car repair workshop.Gardner, who was a member of a shooting club, picked up one of his shotguns before setting off "to protect his hard-earned property", jurors heard.Christine Laing QC, opening the prosecution case at Lewes crown court on Tuesday, said the decision cost him his life.It was likely that he was either crushed between two vehicles – a Jeep Cherokee bought days earlier and his own Land Rover – or between one of them and a water bowser, she said.His injuries were so catastrophic that he stood "no chance of survival" and it must have been clear to those responsible that he was badly hurt, jurors heard. Laing added that it was unclear which of the six defendants charged with his manslaughter was driving the vehicles, but that it did not matter.She said afterwards the men and a seventh defendant tried to pervert the course of justice by destroying evidence.Terrence Bristow, 41, and Marcus Bristow, 32, of Great Chart, Kent; Lee Delay, 23, and Oliver Payne of Tunbridge Wells; and Christopher Leek, 30, and Paul Dunn, 33, of Cranbrook, are charged with manslaughter.The six men also face charges of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.Terrence Dunn, 57, of Sandhurst, Kent, is charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.Gardner had lived at Bush Barn Farm for most of his life, and his 92-year-old mother, Molly, also lived there with two lodgers, the court heard.Expensive spare motor parts and tools were housed in the workshop which was the target for the burglars, Laing said.She said: "Given the location it was clearly planned well in advance and, we say, was highly organised and carried out by the first six defendants at least so that there was sufficient manpower to move large quantities of items and drive away a number of vehicles that they had planned to steal from the scene."The intruders' plan was to steal Land Rovers once they had filled them with expensive items from the workshop, the court heard. Laing said one trailer had been loaded with quad bikes stored there.But the burglars overlooked the fact that Gardner's house was nearby, concealed by a copse of trees, Laing said. She said that as the intruders nosily ransacked his belongings, Gardner would have been woken from his sleep.She went on: "Using the Jeep that they bought and the Land Rover belonging to Julian Gardner they were interrupted and ran him down, killing him by crushing him between the two vehicles or one of the vehicles and a water bowser and by running him over."Despite Gardner's injuries, one of the gang was "callous enough" to steal the shotgun Gardner had carried out with him to confront them, she said.The Jeep and the Land Rover were later taken to different locations and burned.Gardner's body was found by his business partner later that morning and an investigation was launched by police.Laing said much of the case would centre on mobile cell site analysis showing that in the hours after Gardner's death the movements of the defendants were within a limited area around Bush Barn Farm, Sandhurst and Cripps Corner, where the vehicles were disposed of.Laing said the Bristows were brothers and the Dunns were father and son.The seven men deny the charges. The trial continues.
