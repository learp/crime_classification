An innocent teenager studying for his A-levels was murdered after a gang hunted him down and stabbed him 14 times, in the mistaken belief he was part of a rival gang, a jury heard on Tuesday.Kwame Ofosu-Asare, 17, was killed as he walked with a friend through a council estate in Brixton, south London, in broad daylight.The jury at the Old Bailey heard the murder was "cowardly and merciless".Nelson Idiabeta, 18, of no fixed address, and Nathaniel Okusanya, 19, of Lambeth, south London, deny murder.The crown claims they went to the Moorlands estate for a revenge attack on a member of a rival gang.When Kwame, the son of a sports journalist, from Catford, south-east London, and his friend were set upon, they ran into a side road to try to seek safety at a relative's house.But the relative was not at home, and Kwame and his friend ran on and became trapped in a cul-de-sac.His friend climbed a high wall and escaped, but Kwame was caught and stabbed repeatedly in the back.Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said: "Kwame's death was but a part of a poisonous and senseless feud between two rival gangs of youths in south London."Kwame was in fact not a member of either gang. He was killed for no reason other than that his murderers had come upon him on an estate which they considered to be enemy territory and at a time when they were looking to take revenge for the stabbing of one of their own only hours earlier."In other words, Kwame was murdered for being in the wrong place and at the wrong time – a glib phrase that does not even begin to describe the suffering of his family and friends that has resulted from his murder."Aylett said the attack had its roots in a feud between the TN1 (Trust No-One) gang from the Tulse Hill area of south London and Brixton-based GAS (Guns and Shanks).It is claimed that Idiabeta and Okusanya were members of the TN1 group out to avenge another TN1 member who had been stabbed in a bus garage attack by GAS earlier in the day."The prosecution allege that the murder of Kwame was an attempt by members of the TN1 gang to take revenge on the GAS gang," Aylett said."The estate on which Kwame was murdered, the Moorlands Estate in Brixton, is associated with members of the GAS gang – they consider it to be their territory – and the prosecution suggest that Kwame was stabbed in the mistaken belief that he was a member of the GAS gang."The trial continues.
