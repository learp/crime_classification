The parents of suspected "honour" killing victim Shafilea Ahmed were granted bail on Thursday after being charged with their daughter's murder.Iftikhar Ahmed, 51, a taxi driver, and his wife, Farzana, 48, a housewife, from Warrington, Cheshire, were charged with murder a fortnight ago.They appeared in court via videolink. Their daughter, Shafilea, disappeared from her home in September 2003 and her badly decomposed remains were found by the flooded river Kent in Cumbria five months later. Her parents vehemently deny any involvement in her death and once tearfully protested their innocence at a police press conference.Mr Justice Richard Henriques said at the bail hearing at Manchester crown court: "Both applicants were granted police bail and remained on police bail until 7 September 2011 when both applicants answered their bail and were charged with murder and remanded in custody as the law requires."Henriques said he would grant the couple bail as they had not absconded or sought to interfere with witnesses while on police bail previously.The bail conditions include residing at their home address, observing a curfew between midnight and 7am and reporting to the police station every day and surrendering their passports.Shafilea, 17, was most likely strangled or suffocated, a pathologist told her inquest.South Cumbria coroner Ian Smith later recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, saying he believed the teenager was probably murdered and was the victim of "a very vile murder".The inquest was told that Shafilea had drunk bleach in an apparent cry for help after she was introduced to a potential suitor on a family holiday to Pakistan.A preliminary hearing has been listed at Chester crown court on September 26.
