Prison educators have been given guarantees that their pensions will remain unchanged under a new employer, the Universities and Colleges Union (UCU) said today.The teachers, who provide the Offenders' Learning and Skills Service (Olass) in prisons in Kent and eastern England, had feared that the transfer of their contract from colleges to a private company, known as A4E, would damage their pensions.The staff are members of the Teachers Pension Scheme (TPS), a final salary scheme in which A4E is not eligible to participate. The company is obliged by legislation to offer a "comparable" scheme, but staff had been unhappy with the proposed options, which they considered inferior to the TPS.Prison educators warned they would quit prison work for other teaching jobs if A4E failed to guarantee pension parity with staff still employed by colleges. However, A4E today agreed to an arrangement that will see teachers' pensions match their former pensions.Christiane Ohsan, a national official at the UCU, said: "This is a good solution and a sensible end to the problem. It shows that persistent pressure and lobbying by the union can achieve results but it also exposes the weakness of the national arrangements for the protection of pensions."There is a lack of clarity about what 'comparable pension' means, and it would be worrying if any private bidders for Olass or other education contracts felt this ambiguity could provide space for costcutting. UCU has made it clear we will challenge any such effort to diminish our members' pensions."
