Scotland Yard was yesterday accused of trying to mislead the jury deciding whether it made catastrophic errors leading up to the shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes. The Old Bailey trial heard claims that the force had manipulated a picture presented to the jury which had been intended to illustrate the difficulties officers faced in telling apart the Brazilian victim and the suspected terrorist they were actually looking for.Last week police produced a composite of one half of Mr De Menezes's face placed next to one half of the face of suspect Hussain Osman. But Clare Montgomery QC, prosecuting, told the court that it had been altered "by either stretching or resizing, so the face ceases to have its correct proportions". The judge, Mr Justice Henriques, told the jury: "A serious allegation has been made that a picture has been manipulated so as to mislead."Mr De Menezes was shot dead on July 22 2005, while being held down by police on a tube carriage at Stockwell station, south London. Officers believed they were shooting Osman, who the day before had detonated a bomb aboard a tube train. It failed to go off.A forensics consultant, Michael George, told the jury he had tried to recreate the Met's picture using the Powerpoint software program, but could not. The effect of what the Met had done was to make Mr de Menezes and the terrorist suspect look more alike. Mr George said that in the police composite, the picture of the Brazilian appeared to be have been brightened and lost definition compared with the original. The brightening also appeared to have "got rid of the definition of some of the characteristics" in the original picture, including areas around the left nostril and the chin, he said.Ronald Thwaites QC, defending, said the prosecution's attempt to show the photograph had been manipulated was a "pseudo-scientific exercise", and added that the Met denied the allegation.The prosecution closed its case and the defence will start its case today.
