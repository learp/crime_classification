The UK record industry has widened its anti-piracy net to the corporate world with an investigation into allegations of an illegal music filesharing network at a British office of the US industrial and aerospace company Honeywell.In its first investigation into suspected digital music piracy in the workplace, the BPI record labels group said yesterday it was working with Strathclyde police at premises owned by the company in Motherwell.The BPI said: "The operation follows a two-month investigation into alleged music filesharing at Honeywell, which began after an employee of the company provided the BPI with evidence of thousands of music files being shared illegally on the company's servers."A number of employees were assisting the police with their inquiries.BPI chief Geoff Taylor stressed that the investigation should be taken as a warning by other companies. "Filesharing music in the workplace is illegal, misuses company resources, wastes employees' time and introduces network security risks," he said.On conviction for piracy offences, company directors face unlimited fines and up to 10 years imprisonment if convicted on indictment, according to the BPI. On summary conviction, they face up to six months in prison and fines of up to Â£5,000.A Honeywell spokeswoman said: "Honeywell considers copyright infringement a very serious matter and has rigorous policies intended to prevent activity taking place on its premises."Similar to the recording industry, Honeywell vigorously protects its vast portfolio of intellectual property from others attempting to capitalise on their value and the strength of the Honeywell brand. We will continue to fully cooperate with investigators and the BPI."
