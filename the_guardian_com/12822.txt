A millionaire architect accused of murdering his wife nearly eight years ago was violent towards her before she disappeared, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Gracia Morton, 40, went missing after visiting her husband at his west London home in November 1997, a few weeks before she was due to divorce him. She has not been seen since and no body has ever been found. In court yesterday, Michael Morton, 67, denied murdering his wife. Brian Altman, prosecuting, told the jury: "There was a dark and sinister side to the relationship. On occasions, the defendant had been violent towards her." Mr Altman alleged Mr Morton killed his Argentine-born wife after they rowed over her plan to send their four-year-old daughter to a private school. Other tensions in the relationship included a dispute over Â£460,000, and her new boyfriend, he said. He outlined a series of incidents which he said demonstrated his violence towards her. A year before she disappeared, Mrs Morton's psychotherapist had seen her with a black eye which she said Mr Morton had given her. In February 1997, around the time Mrs Morton left her husband, a friend had seen her. "She saw bruises on Gracia's face and was in no doubt that the defendant had caused them and this was her reason for leaving him." Mr Altman said Mrs Morton originally petitioned her husband for divorce, saying he had been verbally abusive and from time to time had been physically violent. But the reference was removed on Mr Morton's request in return for him letting the petition go through undefended. The trial continues.
