A man who was aggressive and abusive towards cabin crew during a transatlantic flight was today jailed for 10 and a half months.Graham Smith called an air steward a "poof" on the flight from Manchester to the Dominican Republic, Manchester crown court heard.The court was told the 36-year-old, who pleaded guilty to drunkenness on an aircraft, became abusive after drinking heavily before and during the New Year's Eve flight.Prosecutor Adam Lodge said Smith, of Burnley, Lancashire, was one of several passengers whose bad behaviour caused the plane to be diverted to Bermuda.The court heard that Smith, who was accompanied by his girlfriend and another couple, consumed alcohol he had carried onto the Thomson Airways flight.The plane took off after a three-hour delay, and Lodge said problems began an hour into the flight when air steward Tim Burrow's wallet was taken and thrown around the Boeing 767 by some of the 253 passengers.Smith retrieved the wallet and gave it back to Burrows, but then became abusive and demanded food, the court heard. He later got into an argument with a friend before being issued with two warning letters by the captain, which he ripped up. "He was also found by a door, saying: 'I'm not sure what I'll do, I'll fucking kill somebody,' or words to that effect," Lodge said.Jon Oultram, defending, said his client admitted calling Burrows a poof but denied it was meant as a homophobic comment. "It's a phrase that's used in some areas less for comment on someone's sexuality but more on the way they're behaving," he said.Oultram said Smith, a single father whose teenage daughter is expecting a child, had gone on holiday following the death of a close friend and accepted he had drunk too much."On sober reflection, he accepts he handled it badly," he said. "If it hadn't been for the fact he was drunk much, or all, of what happened would not have taken place."He said Smith had not been the only rowdy passenger, adding that he had been threatened by another group of passengers during the flight.Judge Elgan Edwards told Smith homophobic comments were "not acceptable," and said he hoped he would be banned from travelling with the airline. "Passengers and crew travelling on aircraft are entitled to do so without being confronted by drunken behaviour carried out by people like yourself," the judge said.A charge against Smith of interfering with staff and cabin crew was withdrawn by the prosecution.
