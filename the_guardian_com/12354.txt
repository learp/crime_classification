Hundreds of criminal cases are being reviewed by forensic experts amid fears that crucial DNA evidence could have been missed.Differences in the way forensic laboratories tested for DNA samples between 2000 and 2005 may have meant some vital evidence slipped through the net.It has been claimed that the government-owned Forensic Science Service (FSS) may not have been using the latest techniques when testing for microscopic traces of DNA on exhibits. As a result, vital evidence could have been overlooked.At the end of last year, the Home Office asked the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) to conduct a review of the issue.However, news of this review has only begun to emerge in the last few days - leading to claims that there has been an attempt to cover up the latest controversy to embroil the beleaguered department.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said it was an "incredibly serious" matter that meant there could have been a large number of miscarriages of justice."It is another flaw in our criminal justice system that will leave dangerous people at large and put a lot of people at risk," he told Sky News."It opens up the prospect for a large number of miscarriages of justice for reasons that are squarely at the door of the Home Office.Mr Davis said the Home Office knew about the problem last year and it now appeared as though it had tried to mount a "cover-up".The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "Given that the government is asking us to rely so heavily on DNA technology to detect crime, it is extraordinary that the necessary methods are not being deployed to use it to its greatest potential."However, the Home Office said the review had not been made public earlier because the police wanted it kept secret for operational reasons.A spokesman said: "Towards the end of 2006 we became aware that a small percentage of DNA samples may need to be re-examined as a result of differences in the way forensic suppliers were using new techniques to analyse forensic material between 2000 and 2005."On operational advice from the police, the initial stage of this operation has been kept confidential."As soon as ministers became aware of this issue they asked Acpo to undertake an operational review to secure the nature and extent of it and to take remedial action."Acpo is very close to completing that work and has found no evidence that we should be concerned about standards being used today."We cannot speculate on the numbers involved until the full review is complete."Acpo wrote to all 43 chief constables in England and Wales this morning about the DNA testing blunder.It is asking them to look for cases between 2000 and 2005 - during which their detectives sent exhibits to the FSS expecting its scientists to find DNA evidence - only to get back a negative result.The alleged blunder relates to cases where the FSS analysed tiny samples of blood or saliva for a DNA profile. As a result of advances in DNA testing techniques, it was possible, from 2000, to find this DNA evidence in very small traces of bodily fluids.The FSS was apparently using this new "low copy number" technique, but for five years was applying it in a different way. This meant its scientists failed to locate the vital DNA evidence that other private forensic laboratories could have picked up. These are the cases that may need to be reviewed.The Home Office insists that only a small minority of criminal cases will have been affected by the blunder.However, until the chief constables reply to Acpo, the exact number of criminal investigations caught up in the controversy will remain unknown.It has emerged that the Rachel Nickell murder case may have been one of them.Miss Nickell, 23, was stabbed 49 times and sexually assaulted in front of her young son on Wimbledon Common in July 1992.The case was reviewed in 2001 and dozens of items recovered from the murder scene were re-examined. Small samples of DNA were reportedly missed.
