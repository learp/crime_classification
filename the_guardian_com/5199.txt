An unemployed chef whose wife was found dumped in a wheelie bin was charged with her murder tonight. The body of Melanie Wallner, 32, was discovered hidden among rubbish outside a house in Cobham, Surrey, last Saturday afternoon. Her husband, Peter, 33, who was stopped by officers at Gatwick Airport, was charged with her murder and with preventing the lawful and decent burial of her body. Wallner, of no fixed address, will appear at Woking magistrates' court tomorrow morning. Police said it was still unclear when Mrs Wallner had died. Her body was discovered only when a human foot was spotted protruding from the bin at the semi-detached house.Detective Chief Inspector Maria Woodall, of Surrey Police, said: "Although someone has been charged with Melanie Wallner's murder, the exact time of her death is still unclear."Therefore, I remain keen to hear from anyone we haven't spoken to who has seen her since August 2006 or who knew her well around that time."The public response to this investigation has been very helpful and I would ask people with any information that could be useful to still get in touch."Police activity in Cobham will shortly be coming to a close, so I thank local residents for their support and patience this week."
