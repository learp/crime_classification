The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, was under growing pressure yesterday as the leader of London's 24,000 beat officers announced they had no confidence in him.Detective Constable Peter Smyth, chairman of the force's constables branch, made a scathing attack on Sir Ian at the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth.There was further discomfort for Britain's top police officer as the constables' national chairman, Bob Elder, said he did not see how Sir Ian could survive.As Mr Smyth challenged the new policing minister, Liam Byrne, over the lack of confidence in Sir Ian, conference veterans said they could not recall such a devastating public attack on a police chief from his own rank and file.Police sources said the disquiet was not confined to the lower ranks but that several of Sir Ian's senior managers were also highly critical of his leadership.Hundreds of delegates applauded when Mr Smyth said a series of gaffes and ill-advised policy decisions by Sir Ian had undermined public confidence in the Met. "There is deepening discontent within my organisation and quite evidently among the wider public," said Mr Smyth. "Policing minister, on behalf of the 24,000 constables in London, I am telling you that we have no confidence in this commissioner. As a first priority in your new office, can you tell us what you are going to do to restore police and public confidence in the commissioner?"Mr Byrne defended Sir Ian, saying: "There is a track record of delivery in the Met in which I think a lot of people can take a lot of pride. This hasn't happened by accident. There is a strong leadership in the Met." But he promised he would raise the criticism with the home secretary, John Reid, who is to address the conference today.Detective Constable Mark Strevett, from the Met special branch, said his colleagues were furious over plans to amalgamate the 123-year-old unit with the anti-terrorist branch."Morale in special branch, and I speak on behalf of the majority of my colleagues, is at rock bottom, as they see it as being badly thought out and will leave us vulnerable."Mr Elder, who represents 120,000 constables in England and Wales, said he did not see now how Sir Ian could continue in his job."I don't think he can turn it around. I don't think he has any choice."But there was staunch support for Sir Ian last night from the Met Police Authority, who praised his "strong and focused leadership", and from the mayor of London's office. Lee Jasper, director of policing and equalities at the Greater London authority, said: "Sir Ian Blair is doing a first-class job as commissioner."
