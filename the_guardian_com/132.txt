Max Clifford will face trial over 11 indecent assault charges on 5 March next year for an estimated four weeks, an Old Bailey judge has ruled.The celebrity publicist, who was not in court for the short hearing on Wednesday morning, may be tried before a high court judge.In May, Clifford pleaded not guilty to the 11 charges that arose out of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree investigation into sexual offences by Jimmy Savile and others.The charges relate to assaults allegedly committed between 1966 and 1985 against teenage girls and women aged between 15 and 19.Clifford, 70, was not in court because of a pre-arranged trip to Spain for a charity golf tournament. He is due to take part in the three-day Max Clifford Celebrity Golf Challenge for the children's charity the Rhys Daniels Trust in Costa del Sol on Thursday.He will next appear at the Old Bailey for a plea and case management hearing on 4 October, when it is expected to be decided which court and judge will hear next year's trial.Mr Justice Nicol told the court: "While I have excused his attendance this time, he will be required to attend in October."The judge granted permission for Clifford to stay at a different address within England and Wales provided he give the police 48 hours' notice. He must seek permission from the court should he wish to stay outside the jurisdiction, Nicol ruled.Rosina Cottage QC, for the prosecution, told the court the crown "loosely" estimated the trial to take four weeks, but that it would be "two weeks, three, plus".As part of his bail conditions, Clifford must live and sleep at his home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and have no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18. He is also prohibited from contacting any prosecution witnesses.At his previous court appearance last month, Clifford maintained that the charges were "totally without foundation".He told reporters outside Westminster magistrates court in London: "This has been a nightmare for myself and my family and I'm totally innocent of these allegations. Since December I've been in the dark, and anonymous people have made accusations from a long, long time ago. They are without foundation."
