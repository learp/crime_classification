The girlfriend of the owner of a Chinese takeaway who was beaten to death by a gang of youths, four of whom were sentenced yesterday to up to 10 years each, has condemned police for failing to prevent the "racist" murder of her partner.Mi-Gao Huang Chen, 41, known locally as Michael, was beaten to death in April outside his takeaway in Scholes, near Wigan, by a gang of up to 12 youths wielding a garden spade, a hoe, a tree branch and heavy wooden stakes.Sentencing Anthony Dunleavy, Joe Sankey, Jason Hughes and Jamie Stephens, all from Wigan and aged between 15 and 16 at the time of the murder, Mr Justice Royce said at Manchester crown court that they had acted "far worse than a pack of wild dogs".Mr Chen's girlfriend and the co-owner of the takeaway, Jia Ming Yah, known as Eileen Jia, told the Guardian she believed that his death could have been averted had police responded sooner to months of complaints about racist attacks on their takeaway, Superb Hut. She and her boyfriend took over the restaurant last year because the previous owner, also Chinese, could not tolerate the harassment.Ms Jia said that in the months leading up to Mr Chen's murder, Superb Hut had been attacked around 10 times by local youths who threw eggs and glass bottles into the premises, urinated in the restaurant, smashed the shop windows and shouted racial abuse at staff.According to Ms Jia, Mr Chen's murder was the "direct result of police wrongdoing" because officers had failed to respond to several warnings about escalating racist attacks. She claims that, despite months of pleas for help, the first time police interviewed the couple about the attacks was the night before Mr Chen's murder.On that night, April 22, Superb Hut was attacked on three occasions and at one point the takeaway's window was smashed, but Ms Jia says police were slow to respond to her reports.CCTV footage shown to the court showed how the following night, Ms Jia and Superb Hut's chef confronted youths outside the takeaway. Ms Jia chased them holding a wrench, but the gang later returned wielding their own weapons and launched a vicious attack on the couple, punching, kicking and repeatedly stamping on Mr Chen's head. He died in hospital five days later.Two months after the murder, Ms Jia was arrested for affray and assault relating to her confrontation with the attackers on the night of the murder. The charges were eventually dropped.Detective Chief Inspector Steve Crimins, the senior investigating officer in the case, denied the murder was racially motivated and dismissed Ms Jia's accusations of police incompetence as "sheer nonsense", saying officers had responded to several reports of nuisance and increased their presence in the area since January 2005. "To say that any failure to deal with previous incidents led directly to the death of Mr Chen is ludicrous," he said.
