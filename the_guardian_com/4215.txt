· The most compelling evidence against James Hanratty was gathered almost 40 years after his death using forensic techniques that could not have been imagined at the time of his trial. Tests found a match between his DNA and strands that were recovered from Valerie Storie's underwear and a handkerchief that was found with the gun. Claims by Hanratty's supporters that the garments could be contaminated were dismissed.· Valerie Storie picked out Hanratty during an identity parade in which all the men involved were asked to speak so she could hear their voices. Hanratty had a London accent and pronounced 'th' as 'f'. She claimed that she had only seen her attacker's face for a few seconds, but that this was enough for her to see his icy blue eyes. · Two other witnesses said Hanratty was the driver of the grey Morris Minor that the murderer used to escape from the scene. They recalled seeing the car being driven erratically. This agreed with Ms Storie's claim that the man who killed Gregsten and raped her had been uncertain about how to work the car's gears. · Two cartridges from the gun that had been used in the attack were found in room 24 of the Vienna Hotel. The prosecution claimed that Hanratty stayed in the room on August 21 1961 - the night before the murder · The gun was found under the back seat of a bus on a route that Hanratty may have used. It was claimed that Hanratty, a petty thief, had boasted of using the space under the back seat of buses as a hiding place. · The court of appeal's judgment yesterday also referred to a confession Hanratty is supposed to have made to someone while he was in jail. · The appeal court concluded that the "number of alleged coincidences [in the evidence against Hanratty] mean that they are not coincidences, but provide overwhelming proof of the safety of the conviction".
