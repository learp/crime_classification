Six teenagers have been cleared by a jury of involvement in starting a fire that closed the M1 and caused Â£4.5m worth of damage, police said.The fire at a scrapyard under an elevated section caused traffic disruption when it closed the stretch of motorway for nearly a week in April last year.Jurors at Wood Green crown court cleared the youths of conspiring to destroy the scrapyard by fire, but they were convicted with three others of taking part in other arson attacks across Barnet, north London, over a five-day period.The court was told the teenagers carried out four arson attacks in two parks. They photographed themselves next to the fires and uploaded the pictures on Facebook.Luke Matthews, 18, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire; Johno Johnson, 18, of Edgware, north London; and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named, all admitted four counts of conspiracy to commit arson.Jurors found Damien McQueen, 18, of Edgware; Hannah Parker, 18, of Edgware; Jaun Durandt, 18, of Edgware; and a 15-year-old boy guilty of two counts each of conspiracy to commit arson. Durandt had previously pleaded guilty to one count of the same charge.A 16-year-old boy from Edgware was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit arson. Josh Lambe, 18, of Edgware, previously pleaded guilty to one count of the same charge.Superintendent Simon Causer said: "These youths showed complete disregard for the safety of people living in Barnet, as well as putting the lives of those in the emergency services at risk."I believe that I am not alone in failing to understand what drove them to commit and boast about these despicable acts of vandalism, and hope that these verdicts will discourage anyone else from making such irresponsible decisions."Eight of the youths will be sentenced on 4 May. The 15-year-old boy, from Harrow, north-west London, will be sentenced on 9 May.
