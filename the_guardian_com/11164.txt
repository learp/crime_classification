Victims of sex trafficking will get the legal right to stay in Britain temporarily under plans to be unveiled by Tony Blair to encourage women to testify against their captors.The Prime Minister will say fears that such rights could encourage immigration are overriden by the need to tackle a modern-day form of slavery. He will outline his views at a Downing Street reception tomorrow to mark the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade, emphasising the parallels between historical and modern forms of exploitation.Police estimate that 1,400 women a year are trafficked into Britain, many expecting legitimate jobs only to find themselves forced to become sex workers. Violent intimidation is common, while passports will often be taken away to prevent escape. A trade in children is also emerging, with a report showing that up to half of child-trafficking victims put into care subsequently disappeared, raising fears that the smuggling gangs had snatched them back.The government will bow to campaigners' demands to sign the European Convention on trafficking, which entitles victims to secure accommodation, medical treatment, legal and translation assistance and at least a month's right of residence in the country. Trafficked children would also be entitled to education during their time here. Campaigners argue there is no point in liberating victims only to put them on the next plane home - where they may simply be intercepted by their traffickers - and that they need support to testify against the people-smugglers.'This is a modern form of slavery,' said a Downing Street source. 'We believe that, if we give people this period where they can recover and reflect, this will encourage victims to help pursue the traffickers.'The Home Office had refused to sign the European Convention for fears that offering a temporary right to remain would encourage women to allow themselves to be trafficked as a way of winning the right to stay in Britain, or to make false claims of trafficking. But John Reid, the Home Secretary, has decided that illegal immigration is now under sufficient control to permit the move.Denis MacShane, the former Foreign Office minister, who has campaigned on the issue, welcomed the decision to treat trafficked women as victims rather than criminals facing deportation, but added: 'The best way to end sex slavery is to name and shame the men who abuse these women [by buying their services].'The treatment of trafficked women has become controversial in recent months, with prostitutes' organisations complaining that so-called compassionate police raids to 'rescue' captive women in brothels are essentially immigration exercises designed to round up and get rid of foreign sex workers.Studies have also shown that, while some women did not know what they were coming to Britain for, a significant proportion knew they were destined for work in the sex industry - even if they did not realise they would not be able to leave when they wished.
