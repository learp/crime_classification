Winston Silcott will be released from prison next week after ministers backed the parole board's verdict that he poses no risk to the public, his solicitors have announced.Silcott's conviction for the murder of PC Keith Blakelock during the 1985 Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham, north London, was overturned as unsafe by the court of appeal in 1991 because of tainted police evidence.His solicitors, Bindman and partners, said that he remains "intent on proving his innocence" of the murder of boxer Anthony Smith, of which he was convicted in 1984.In a statement, Silcott said: "I am looking forward to returning to my family and to overturning my conviction."He maintains that he was acting in self defence when he fatally stabbed Mr Smith with a knife at a party in east London.In March 1987, 13 months after his conviction for Smith's murder, Silcott - who had been on bail awaiting trial at the time of the riots in Tottenham - was convicted of the murder of PC Blakelock. The policeman had been set upon by a mob and hacked to death.Silcott's solicitor, Tony Murphy, said that the 43-year-old had been "a model prisoner, despite a deep sense of injustice"."He has spent numerous periods of leave in the community without incident," Mr Murphy said. "The real question has always been the safety of the Smith conviction, not least as it coincided with his wrongful conviction on the Blakelock case." He added that Silcott, who is believed to be planning to return to the Tottenham area after his release, has been in jail for longer than the 14-year sentence he was originally given.
