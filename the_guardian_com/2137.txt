Officers involved in the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes could have been lying when they claimed they thought he was a suicide bomber, the high court heard today.Both officers who opened fire on Mr De Menezes had said they thought he was wearing a "bulky" jacket, possibly supporting the belief that he was concealing a bomb.However, it is now known that the 27-year-old Brazilian was wearing a denim jacket, and lawyers acting for his family today told the court it was "highly unlikely" that the two officers had been mistaken rather than dishonest.Mr De Menezes was shot seven times in the head by anti-terrorism officers at Stockwell station, south London, in the aftermath of the 2005 London bombings.His family is asking the high court to overturn the Crown Prosecution Service's decision not to bring criminal charges against individual officers due to lack of evidence, but instead to prosecute of the office of the Metropolitan police commissioner under the Health and Safety at Work Act.The family's lawyers accused Stephen O'Doherty, the CPS officer dealing with the case, of "usurping the role of the court" when he decided against launching individual prosecutions.They said Mr O'Doherty noted both officers had said they shouted "armed police" immediately before firing - but observed that none of the tube passengers at Stockwell had heard this.In a written argument to the high court, the De Menezes lawyers said that was "prime facie evidence that the officers were lying" about what happened before the fatal shooting.A jury could have concluded that the officers did not believe Mr De Menezes was a suicide bomber about to put lives in danger, the written argument said.Patricia da Silva Armani, a cousin of Mr De Menezes, has described the decision not to prosecute individual officers as "shameful"."The Met's organisational failure and flawed tactics led to Jean's death," a spokesman for the family said. "But within the Met, individuals devised the shoot to kill policy, individuals ordered Jean's killing and individuals shot the seven bullets in his head."We are bringing this challenge because we believe that individuals should bear responsibility for this crime. Otherwise a message is sent out that police officers can kill with impunity."The hearing continues tomorrow.
