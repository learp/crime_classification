The claim made in the Observer that the 18th-century obstetricians William Hunter and William Smellie were probably serial killers, given that they obtained the corpses of the pregnant women that they experimented upon through "burking" – having people murdered to order – came as a shock to many medics. Anthony Kenny, for example, curator of the museum of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, described the claim as "absolutely staggering".Yet, why the surprise? The medical profession has regularly been mired in ignominy as far as serial killers are concerned – whether we are discussing GPs from our own time such as Harold Shipman (who murdered at least 215 of his elderly and mostly female patients), nurses like Beverly Allitt or Colin Norris (who also murdered elderly women), or from earlier in our history, Dr Thomas Neill Cream, who liked to poison the prostitutes that he had engaged (and who was once believed to have been Jack the Ripper) or Dr John Bodkin Adams who was suspected of having murdered over 100 of his elderly, female patients in the decade after the second world war.Even those associated with the medical profession get caught up in the gruesome activity that sometimes surrounds medicine – the need to find suitable anatomical material to experiment upon. Consider this extract from the autobiography of Molly Lefebure, who acted as secretary to the Home Office pathologist Dr Keith Simpson, describing the office that they shared in Guy's Hospital:"We did all our filing, report-writing, correspondence and so forth, amidst a gleaming array of specimen jars in which floated grotesque babies, slashed wrists, ruptured hearts, stomach ulcers, lung cancers, bowel tumours, cerebral aneurisms and the like. Here too we generally took afternoon tea."Lefebure catches perfectly the sense of "otherness" of medical culture – of not quite realising that what is being described is in itself macabre, unfeeling and distanced from their fellow human beings, even if her "here too we generally took afternoon tea" is added for comic effect. Indeed, the comedy comes from comparing the very idea of the banality of drinking tea with what she has just described as floating in the "gleaming array of specimen jars".Lefebure also goes on to describe in her autobiography – Evidence for the Crown: Experiences of a Pathologist's Secretary – carrying a dead baby back to Guy's from Southwark mortuary in a suitcase, and the slashed wrists and hands of a dead man in the "pretty little candy-striped paper carrier-bag which a chic shop assistant had given me barely an hour ago".Frankly, the more important question to consider is not whether Hunter and Smellie were serial killers, but rather why so many in the medical profession seem to end up being able to be described in this way. What is it about some of those who join this profession, and who must have at one stage set out to help others, change so much that, over time, they start to kill and begin to take lives instead of saving them? Is this the fault of the individual medical professional (perhaps their motives were always murderous?), or rather the responsibility of the culture in which they are trained, and given power and responsibility?It is of course easier to imagine that responsibility lies solely with the likes of Shipman and his ilk – that rather neatly allows us to ignore broader questions. But the reality is that any professional culture that confers power and status on to its members, and then internally polices those who transgress it within that profession without reference to an outside body, is always ripe for manipulation and cover-up. Anthony Kenny being "absolutely staggered" is frankly a perfect reflection of how those who have been recruited, trained and promoted on the "inside" react when someone from the "outside" – in this case an historian – considers the history and working practices of their profession.So too we should not ignore who it was that Hunter, Smellie, Shipman, Allitt, Norris, Cream and perhaps Bodkin Adams were actually killing. Overwhelmingly, they murdered women – young and pregnant but also the elderly; women who sold sexual services; and women who lacked the same power and status of their so-called medical carers. Seeing their crimes from the victims' perspective should remind us that who serial killers murder in our culture are those who are made vulnerable by dint of our moralising and their age and gender.
