Prisons are unsafe places for women (Shannon's mother held in custody after bail is refused, April 10). Eight women took their own lives in prisons last year. Already this year, a woman has hanged herself in the prison most likely to be used to hold Karen Matthews, and she too was on remand. The Howard League is releasing figures showing that half of all suicide attempts and incidents of self-injury in prison are carried out by women, despite women representing a tiny proportion of the prison population. In the last five years women deliberately mutilated themselves 50,000 times in prisons. We have just secured a public inquiry into the treatment of a young woman who injured herself repeatedly in prison. The response of the prison was to lock her up in solitary confinement. Women who are in need of protection, whether it be from their communities, their families or from themselves, should never be sent to prison.Frances CrookDirector, Howard League for Penal Reform
