The Old Bailey bomber and former IRA hunger striker Marian Price has been charged in connection with the murders of two British soldiers gunned down in 2009 hours before they were due to leave Northern Ireland for Afghanistan.Price has been charged with providing property for the purposes of terrorism. It is understood she is alleged to have provided a mobile phone to the gang responsible for the killings.She is already in custody on charges of encouraging terrorism following her appearance beside a masked member of the Real IRA at a republican commemoration in Derry at Easter.A lawyer for the 57-year-old west Belfast woman said she was first questioned 18 months ago about allegations of supplying a phone.Peter Corrigan also said a legal attempt would be made to have the case against her thrown out as an abuse of process.The charge is related to the murders of Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey at Massereene barracks in Antrim in March 2009.The Real IRA shot dead the two soldiers outside their base as they collected a pizza delivery hours before they were to take a flight to Afghanistan. When shot both were wearing desert fatigue uniforms. Two men, including prominent Lurgan republican Colin Duffy, are due to stand trial accused of their murders later this year.Price, also known by her married name Marian McGlinchy, is in custody following the revocation of her release on licence.She was expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court for a preliminary enquiry.However she was not produced after it emerged that her defence team want to cross-examine three witnesses, including two senior detectives, as part of their challenge to the case against her. A date for the day-long committal hearing is expected to be fixed next month.The former IRA prisoner had served a jail sentence for her role alongside her sister Dolours and the current Sinn Fein minister Gerry Kelly for bombing the Old Bailey back in 1973. The Price sisters later went on a hunger and thirst strike to force the authorities to transfer them to an Irish prison. During their incarceration in England the prison authorities force-fed the two women.
