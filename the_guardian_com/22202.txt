A plane was forced to make an emergency landing when two women tried to open the cabin door mid-flight, police said today. The women were drinking on board a tourist flight from Kos, in Greece, to Manchester on Wednesday afternoon when they became rowdy. The plane made an emergency landing at Frankfurt airport, in Germany, and the women were held in their seats by security staff until their arrest, saidHartmut Scherer, a spokesman for the city's police force.Officials said the women, aged 26 and 27, became violent because they were refused more alcohol when the plane was 30,000ft over Austria. During the incident, the 26-year-old allegedly attacked a flight attendant with a bottle of vodka. Scherer said: "Both the women drunk a lot of alcohol on the plane and it was a risk because they made some trouble. The captain thought it was better to make an unscheduled stop in Frankfurt and get them off the plane. "They wanted to open a door in the plane but that was not possible and someone from the security held them in their seats until the landing." The plane landed at 4.45pm and after a delay of two hours the remaining passengers were allowed to continue home. The women were questioned by police and allowed to return to the UK.Scherer said police were deciding whether to press charges and the women could be fined or forced to pay compensation.
