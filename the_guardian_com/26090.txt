A police officer has pleaded guilty to offering to supply cocaine.PC Sarah Greaves, from Doncaster, admitted a charge of making an offer to supply the class A drug at Derby crown court. The 29-year-old officer has been suspended from South Yorkshire police.The court heard she made offers to supply the cocaine in text messages last year, but no drugs were ever exchanged.Greaves, wearing a black suit and pale green blouse, appeared tearful as she stood alongside co-accused Adam Dickinson in the dock. Dickinson, 31, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, also pleaded guilty to a charge of making an offer to supply cocaine.The court heard the charges were brought following a "lengthy and very complex investigation" by South Yorkshire police into drug dealing in South Yorkshire.Katherine Goddard, defending Greaves, said: "Text messages were exchanged but no drugs were in fact provided. The third party was interviewed by police. She had never received any drugs and was never charged with any offences."Judge John Burgess adjourned sentencing for reports. He said the pair would be sentenced at a date to be set at Sheffield crown court. Granting the pair unconditional bail, Burgess told them a custodial sentence was likely.
