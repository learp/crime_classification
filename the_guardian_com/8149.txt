The senior officer investigating the murder of a 73-year-old convicted sex offender said he was shocked by the attitude of some locals who said he deserved to die.Detective Superintendent Brian Dunn, of Cleveland police, said there had been a hard core of people who had been systematically targeting Arnold Hartley because of his conviction for sex offences. Mr Hartley was found battered to death at his home in the seaside town of Redcar on November 29. "Quite clearly, feelings are running high," Mr Dunn said yesterday. "Feelings have been running high since his conviction for sex offences. "I can understand why people are concerned, but at the end of the day it is not justified to systematically target and bully someone so they are left with nothing of any value and stripped of large amounts of cash. "This is a shocking indictment. Are people really content to let anarchy rule? Are people content to turn a blind eye when someone has been killed?" He said it was a "small minority" who had plagued him and justified doing so because he was a sex offender. Mr Dunn described Mr Hartley as a "sad, pathetic figure". He said his attackers had smashed his front door and windows and pulled the shutters off his house. "People are saying that it is no great loss but we can't expect people to tolerate murder." Mr Hartley was jailed in 2001 for 12 months at Teesside crown court for gross indecency and making indecent images of a girl under 14. On his release in April 2002, he returned to his home and was subjected to repeated attacks.
