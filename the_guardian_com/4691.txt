Up to 24 ringleaders of London's illegal sex and human trafficking trade have been targeted in a crackdown provoked by growing evidence that eastern European crime syndicates are seizing control of the vice industry.Working with the immigration service, Scotland Yard has drafted a list of key suspects based on intelligence gathered primarily from a taskforce called Operation Reflex, which pools information from agencies including the national crime squad and MI5. Two hundred officers from the Metropolitan police have been assigned to the project. Five homes were raided yesterday and two women arrested in the first phase of what Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur promised would be a relentless inquiry. The head of the Met's specialist crime directorate, Mr Ghaffur has grown increasingly concerned about the emergence in London of pockets of criminals from eastern Europe, particularly Albanians. They have been linked to 70 kidnappings in the last 12 months. An initiative codenamed Operation Maxim aims to arrest key figures in the main crime families, and disrupt the supply of women from the Balkans to work as prostitutes. Because many of the criminals use false names, officers have been equipped with handheld fingerprint recognition machines linked to databases across Europe which can match a set of prints in seconds. Mr Ghaffur warned that if the police failed to act now, London could face a vice industry turf war. He said the force and the immigration service had not worked closely enough. The problem could only be addressed with more help from other European countries. "These criminals are causing misery on many levels, particularly within their own communities. They are illegally trafficking women, often into lives of exploitation. They also bring increased violence, guns and drugs." Police have said Albanian criminals have spread to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Cardiff, Telford and Lancaster.
