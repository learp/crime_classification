The uncle of a four-year-old boy who was mauled to death by his illegal pit bull terrier pleaded guilty today to charges of owning and breeding a banned dog.Christian Foulkes, 22, admitted three charges brought following the death of his nephew, John-Paul Massey, in Liverpool last November. The boy suffered multiple injuries after he was savaged by the two-year-old dog, Uno, while he stayed at his grandmother Helen Foulkes' home. She also sustained injuries as she fought off the dog.A district judge told Foulkes, of Wavertree, Liverpool, that the convictions under the Dangerous Dogs Act had been "extremely serious" and he could face jail.He had pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a dangerous dog and one of breeding a dangerous dog.John-Paul's mother, Angela McGlynn, was in court to support him.Joanne Parsons, prosecuting, told the court the little boy had woken up at around midnight and said he was hungry so his grandmother went to get him a packet of crisps. He was already asleep when she returned, so she fed the crisps to the dog."As she did, Uno pounced at John-Paul. She tried to force the dog off her grandson and was attacked herself as a result."Uno was a powerful dog and police had to distract him before ambulance staff were able to enter the house and treat the boy and his grandmother. He was later shot by police marksmen in the garden.The court heard that 10 months before John-Paul's death, Merseyside police had received a complaint from a local housing officer about dog breeding at the Foulkes' home.But the force's call centre operator wrongly told the caller it was "not a police matter" and the complaint was never followed up.The matter remains under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Foulkes was initially arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, but the charge was dropped following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service.Mark Ellis, defending, said Foulkes wanted to thank the police and the CPS for their sensitive handling of the case. His client was "distraught", he said.Foulkes was granted unconditional bail until sentencing next month.He also admitted owning a pitbull bitch, named Lita, which was being looked after by John-Paul's father.The prosecution said the animals were separated because the family felt Foulkes' mother was unable to look after both of them while her son was away with the army.Lita was knocked down and killed by a car shortly after John-Paul's death. A post-mortem examination found that she was pregnant with 11 pups.The prosecution said Foulkes had maintained the dogs were kept as family pets and not bred for fighting or commercial gain.A third dog, named Lucky, had also been kept by Foulkes but was killed by the other two, the court heard.Merseyside Police have destroyed hundreds of illegal breed dogs since the death of five-year-old Ellie Lawrenson on New Year's Day 2007. Her uncle, Kiel Simpson, pleaded guilty to owning a dog banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act and was jailed for eight weeks by Liverpool magistrates three years ago.
