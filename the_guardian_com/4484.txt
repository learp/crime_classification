Police investigating the murder of landscape architect Jo Yeates have said there is no evidence that the 25-year-old was sexually assaulted â€“ but said they have not ruled out a 'sexual motive'.Detectives also appealed for help in tracing a 4x4 vehicle seen near to where her body was discovered on Christmas Day, as they revealed they still do not know when and where the 25-year-old landscape architect died.Detective chief inspector Phil Jones, from Avon and Somerset police, said: "At this stage there is no evidence to suggest that Joanna was sexually assaulted. However, I have not ruled out that there might have been a sexual motive."Appealing for help in finding the 4x4, he said: "We have had a number of reports of vehicles in Longwood Lane during the late Friday evening and early hours of Saturday morning, including a possibly light-coloured 4x4 vehicle."This 4x4 and the other vehicles may be completely unconnected but I urge anyone in that car or any other driver in the vicinity that night to come forward," he said.Detectives warned that the "highly complex" investigation could take a long time to complete.Officers have searched all the bins near Yeates' Bristol flat and are sifting through 293 tonnes of domestic rubbish in an attempt to find a pizza she bought from a supermarket on the evening of her disappearance, seen as key to the inquiry, Jones told a press conference.He was speaking a day after officers released Yeates's landlord, Chris Jefferies, on bail two days after he was arrested on suspicion of murder."This is a demonstration of the level of detail we are pursuing on this inquiry," Jones said, adding that Avon and Somerset police had been sent more than 1,300 items of information related to the crime, from which 900 lines of inquiry had been generated. Officers had examined more than 100 hours of CCTV footage.Police also want to speak to taxi drivers ferrying guests from Christmas parties at two golf clubs and a hotel near Longwood Lane in Failand on the night of 17 December. The 25-year-old landscape architect's snow-covered body was found on the verge of the road, three miles from her home, on Christmas morning.Jones said: "Despite this high number of contacts we still want to speak to anyone who may not have already been in touch with us. I cannot stress enough the fact that every single piece of information is important."Forensic officers will remain at the flat Yeates shared with her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, who raised the alarm after returning from a weekend away, until later this week, Jones said: "We are carrying out painstaking detailed forensic analysis of her flat and the outcomes from this can take a considerable length of time despite prioritising and working closely with all our forensic service providers. It is very difficult for me to say what the outcomes of these will be, and I urge everyone not to speculate as to these possible outcomes."On the night she disappeared Yeates had drinks with work colleagues and was later seen on CCTV in two supermarkets, including a Tesco near her flat, where she bought the pizza. The Tesco receipt was found in the flat, along with the coat she had been wearing that night and her mobile phone and keys.Jones said: "I am satisfied that Jo got back to her flat but I am not going to speculate whether she let someone into the flat, whether someone was already there or whether someone broke into the flat. These are all lines of inquiry which my team are pursuing. At this time I am cannot say where or when Jo was killed or when her body was left on Longwood Lane."The heavy snow on the night Yeates disappeared had made it particularly hard to determine the time of her death, or even whether she had eaten the pizza, he added.He warned that the case would not be completed swiftly: "I can assure you we are determined to solve this crime and bring Jo's killers to justice. However, I have to stress that this takes time. This is potentially a long and complex inquiry involving over 70 police officers and staff. No stone will be left unturned in this investigation."We continue to work with Jo's family and keep them fully updated as the investigation allows us. This is a painstaking investigation that could take time and I appeal to the public and the media to continue to work with us."Police say they have an open mind as to who may have killed Yeates but continue to suggest they do not believe a random stranger was responsible. While officers yesterday advised local women not to walk home alone after dark and warned householders to make sure their homes were secure they emphasised they had received no "specific intelligence" to suggest there was any increased danger.
