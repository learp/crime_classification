Crime victims could be offered therapy, cosmetic surgery or self-defence classes instead of cash payouts under a new compensation scheme being outlined by ministers today.The Home Office is to reform the "arbitrary" cash sums paid by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).Proposals being published later today will sweep away standardised payouts for minor injuries in favour of tailored packages of practical help based on how a victim has been affected by the crime.Meanwhile, the maximum sums payable to the more seriously injured and relatives of people killed by crime will increase.The maximum figure of £500,000 paid to survivors who are seriously debilitated is set to be removed.Today's consultation paper will ask for feedback on whether there should be a new higher limit and, if so, what it should be."Currently, if you get assaulted you get £1,000 or £2,000 a year later," a government source said."A lot of people spend that money on a holiday, a new kitchen or other consumer goods."Is a coarse, arbitrary financial sum they best way to deal with this?"Examples of packages for the less seriously injured could see someone who was psychologically disturbed after being assaulted in the street being offered a course of therapy.Under the proposals, a victim who had lost self-confidence after a crime could be sent on a self-defence course, or offered cosmetic surgery to disguise injuries.Someone whose teeth have been knocked out in a brawl could be given free dentistry to repair the damage. Security upgrades to a victim's home could also be offered, along with personal attack alarms.The government will stress that payments will not being ruled out for the less seriously injured, but they would generally only be paid where necessary, such as to assist a self-employed person unable to work due to injuries suffered in a crime.The proposals come in the wake of criticism about the size of awards made to those affected by the July 7 suicide bombings in London. CICA could only award £11,000 to each of the bereaved families of the 52 people killed.That figure compares with about $2m (£1.13m) for each death claim made by families of September 11 victims to the United States government.CICA has so far made 106 payments totalling more than £1m in connection with the London attacks. The CICA scheme has existed since 1964 and is run in England, Scotland and Wales.Supporters of the scheme argue that the sum given to bereaved families, for which it receives most criticism, should not be seen as the value of a life but as a "token of public sympathy".
