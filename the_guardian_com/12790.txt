Police are treating the death of schoolboy Luke Walmsley as murder, after confirming he died of a single stab wound to the heart.Luke, 14, was stabbed at Birkbeck school, in North Somercotes, near Louth, Lincolnshire, yesterday morning. A 15-year-old fellow pupil was still being questioned at Skegness police station today. At a press briefing today, chief superintendent Phil Carter, of Lincolnshire police, said: "We can now confirm that the victim from yesterday's incident was 14-year-old Luke Walmsley, who lived with his family in North Somercotes. "The post-mortem examination carried out last evening by Home Office pathologist Dr Al Alusiu established that Luke died from a single stab wound to the heart and we are treating the incident as murder. "The incident happened about 10am in one of the corridors of the school, near the science laboratory. Teachers gave him first aid and the efforts to save his life were taken over by paramedics, and then the air ambulance took him to hospital at Grimsby, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later. "We have recovered a knife but we are not prepared to release any description of it." The officer continued: "The 15-year-old boy who was arrested at the school continues to be detained at Skegness police station." The officer said that the scenes of crime examination would continue today and if necessary into tomorrow. He added: "We will liaise with the headmaster and education authority as to when the school can reopen." School governors today described the death as an "almost unbelievable" tragedy. Violence in the classroom or the playground had never been an issue at the school before, said chairman John Stevens.
