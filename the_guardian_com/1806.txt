Nine detectives were suspended from duty yesterday after one of the worst corruption allegations to hit Scotland Yard.The nine, all based in the north London borough of Enfield, were suspended over allegations concerning stolen flat-screen televisions, computers and other consumer electrical goods.Anti-corruption detectives have been investigating claims the electrical goods were taken from criminal suspects.The Metropolitan police, which is Britain's largest force, has fought a decades-long battle against corruption in its ranks. Senior officers had hoped reforms and efforts to drum into officers how crucial their integrity was would make such scandals a thing of the past.Officially the Met said the allegations focused on the "mishandling of property". It said that as well as the nine officers who had been suspended, two more had been placed on restricted duties. All those concerned are detectives in Enfield's crime squad, part of that borough's CID unit, and not of senior rank.The Met said there had been no arrests and that its anti-corruption investigation was continuing. The investigation is believed to have been running for more than a year.In a statement, the Met said: "The MPS demands the highest levels of honesty and integrity from its officers and staff. All allegations of malpractice are taken extremely seriously and are investigated swiftly and thoroughly."Scotland Yard's anticorruption squad is an elite unit of detectives nicknamed the "ghost squad". In the mid-1990s, Scotland Yard began a new drive against corruption, setting up the special squad that included retired detectives and accountants.Their investigation led to a host of trials and several convictions.
