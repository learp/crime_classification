Police said the shooting was 'not random' and appeared to involve a dispute involving 10-15 people eating at the smart city centre establishment. No one was hurt, although officers arrested two men, aged 25 and 40, on suspicion of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.A waitress at a nearby restaurant witnessed men running from Lazeez after shots were heard. 'I saw three people running. Three men. One fell down and got up and carried on running. It was strange. You don't see those type of people around here,' she said.The arrested men were pulled over in a vehicle by police shortly after the shooting. Forensic officers were inspecting the scene inside the Mailbox shopping complex yesterday. Birmingham city centre commander Chief Superintendent Malcolm Coall said there was no evidence to suggest it was a gangland shooting and that it was too early to ascertain how many shots were fired.
