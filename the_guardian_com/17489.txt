A City trader pleaded guilty today to establishing a "ponzi" scheme in which more than 350 victims were defrauded of up to £14m.Investors from all walks of life invested hundreds of thousands of pounds with Terry Freeman, 62, and his company GFX Capital, with the promise of big financial returns. But he admitted fraudulent trading and a string of other offences at Southwark crown court in London.One of Freeman's victims was said to have handed over £1.5m. He received GFX reports stating his investment had risen to £2.7m but later found only £15,000 left in his trading account.Freeman was accused of hiding the fact that he was losing investors' money on the markets for several years while spending their investment on a lavish lifestyle, City of London police said.While his victims entrusted their savings to him in good faith, he was splashing out on holiday homes in Cyprus and France, a top-of-the-range Land Rover, an executive box at Tottenham Hotspur FC and lavish gifts for his new wife, including a £120,000 diamond ring. Millions of pounds also disappeared on botched trades and on the running of Freeman's company from offices costing £14,000 a month.The house of cards came tumbling down in 2008 after he bought heavily into American investment bank Lehman Brothers, thinking the US government was about to bail it out. In one of the biggest dramas of the credit crunch, the company collapsed, losing him and his clients millions of pounds.Freeman was arrested at his home in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, in February 2009 on suspicion of money laundering and Financial Services and Markets Act offences. Detectives found that up to 700 people had invested in Freeman's company, seduced by the promise of no risk and high returns on the foreign exchange markets.As his "ponzi" scheme expanded, Freeman had financiers bringing him more and more investors. They believed they were offering their clients an excellent investment opportunity in a legitimate operation. Some even harboured ambitions to work for GFX.Police later found that one mortgage broker handed up to 100 clients and £3.5m to Freeman, before finally realising the nature of the GFX operation.Freeman initially managed to cover up his crimes by moving funds around Saxo Bank trading accounts and issuing false GFX statements telling investors they were all making healthy profits. To try to ease investor concerns at the height of the financial crisis, GFX announced 12% profits for the month.Freeman also reassured his clients their money was safe after the massive collapse of the Bernie Madoff "ponzi" scheme in the US. But by now his clients were growing suspicious of his run of success and started to demand their money back.In a last-ditch effort to hide his losses, Freeman tried to transfer all the remaining funds from the Saxo accounts into one large hedge fund account held with CIM Bank. Around the same time, posing as an experienced trader, he invited potential new clients to a country manor house and, even as his fraud was crumbling, people continued to invest in GFX.In February 2009 he reported to the Metropolitan police in London that he was being threatened by angry investors and admitted losing about £20m. This was only days before his arrest.As the news spread, anxious investors approached the national lead force for fraud, with 340 victims eventually coming forward to tell their own story of how they had been conned.In October 2009 Freeman was charged with fraudulent trading, engaging in business while bankrupt, acting as a director when bankrupt, acting in contravention of a disqualification order and three counts of money laundering. An extensive investigation culminated in him pleading guilty not only to fraudulent trading but also to engaging in business while bankrupt, acting as a director while bankrupt and acting in contravention of a disqualification order, police said. Three counts of money laundering were dropped.When Freeman is sentenced on 14 February, it will not be the first time he has been punished by the courts: in 1997 he was jailed for four and a half years and disqualified as a director for 15 years after being found guilty of eight offences relating to bankruptcy and being a disqualified director.Leaving prison in 2000, he changed his name from Terrence Sparks to Terry Freeman and quickly established his new financial operation.Detective Superintendent Bob Wishart, from the City of London police's economic crime directorate, said: "Rub away the sheen and you find Freeman is the archetypal fraudster, happy to steal money and ruin lives. People invested their futures with GFX, only to find they had been horribly conned by this criminal."Even after being caught, Freeman was still trying to blame anyone but himself. It was only after a long and painstaking investigation that he finally admitted to the huge amount of personal and financial damage he has caused."One devastated couple who lost well over a million pounds by investing in GFX had planned to buy their dream family home but are now living in rented accommodation, police said.Wishart urged potential investors to be cautious and to carry out proper research before committing to an investment scheme. "In these times of financial uncertainty and low interest rates, investors are looking to maximise returns," he said."Anyone seeking to invest in any form of scheme that offers above-average high yields of return should be mindful that criminals are out there preying on unsuspecting members of the public."
