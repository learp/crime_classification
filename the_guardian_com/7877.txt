Six men were arrested today in connection with the murder of a woman left dying and mutilated in the street. Geeta Aulakh, 28, was found with severe head injuries and one of her hands cut off by a passerby in Greenford, north-west London. The arrests were made at an address in Ealing, west London, a police spokesman said. The move came hours after six other men including Aulakh's husband, Harpreet, were released on bail. Investigators believe Aulakh was attacked shortly after leaving Sunrise Radio, where she was a receptionist, to pick up her two children on Monday evening.
