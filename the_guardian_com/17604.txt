Kafeel Ahmed died in hospital from burns four weeks after a Jeep laden with petrol and gas canisters crashed into the terminal building at Glasgow airport.The 29-year-old engineer was the "brains" in the terror cell and spent months in India working on a design for the car bombs.Born in Bengalooru, India, Ahmed worked with at least one other person during this time, whom he described in internet chats with Abdulla as "my mate".He modelled the devices on those used by insurgent forces in Iraq, but the tests he carried out in India used fuel that was more flammable than that found in the UK, and the bombs failed to go off in London and Glasgow.In May 2004, he began work on a PhD project at the faculty of science and technology at the Anglia Ruskin University, in Cambridge, which he never completed.During his time in Cambridge he lived in rented accommodation. It was here that Ahmed met Bilal Abdulla.He left Cambridge in the summer of 2005 for India, returning only briefly in September the following year to do further work on his PhD.He died on 2 August 2007, after spending five weeks in the Royal Alexandra hospital, where Abdulla worked, and in a specialist burns unit at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.A suicide note he uploaded to the drafts folder of his Google Mail account on 28 June read: "It was time I put my words into actions. I was given an opportunity to do so and I took it up. So rejoice everyone and celebrate because I have achieved one of the two promises from Allah."Me and some brothers were given the opportunity to hit the devil's place, the core, and this is what we have tried by the help of Allah and this was a priority."
