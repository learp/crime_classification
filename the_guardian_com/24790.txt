The owner of two dogs which savaged 10 people in a "horrific and nightmarish" street attack has been jailed for 12 months.Spencer Brown, 22, pleaded guilty to 10 counts of owning dogs which were dangerously out of control in a public place.The attacks happened after Brown's Staffordshire bull terrier crosses, Tilly and Freak, escaped from his home in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, on 22 July.Passers-by suffered bites to their hands, arms and legs as the dogs marauded around the area without leashes, while those who came to the victims' aid were also bitten. Police eventually managed to subdue one of the animals with a fire extinguisher and a dog catcher pole while a passer-by dragged the other one into a cage.Weeks before the attacks, on 16 May, a man suffered multiple cuts, wounds and a broken finger after one of the dogs attacked him during a confrontation between him and Brown. Jason Griggs, has been left scarred and unable to work as a self-employed electrician since the attack.Brown, an unemployed father of one who has eight previous convictions for offences including theft and shoplifting, admitted owning a dog which caused injury in a private place in relation to the attack on Griggs, and possession of cannabis.Neither dog was banned but police recommended they both be destroyed on the basis of reports from the kennels where they were being held that they remained aggressive.Jailing Brown at Lewes crown court on Friday, Judge Anthony Scott-Gall said they were "grave and quite horrific" offences which had left victims "savagely mauled".The sentencing comes days after guidelines were introduced for judges dealing with people convicted of being owners of dangerously out-of-control dogs which harm others in public. The guidelines provide for tougher sentences which could lead to more offenders being jailed or given community orders, and fewer discharged. Owners, or anyone in charge of such a dog, would face up to 18 months' jail, or a legal maximum of two years in exceptional cases.Ordering the destruction of the dogs, Scott-Gall said: "Without rhyme or reason or cause from any members of the public, the dogs acted in tandem and indulged in a terrifying orgy of violence against wholly innocent members of the public who were lawfully going about their business on a warm July evening."It must have been terrifying for them to see these large and feral dogs running amok and attacking anyone they could get close enough to sink their teeth into."He banned Brown from owning dogs for life, saying he was not a fit and proper person to control such an animal, let alone own one.Brown was facing a summons to appear in court over the attack on Griggs when the dogs assaulted the 10 people weeks later having escaped from Brown's home via an open window while he was out.Mark Glendenning, defending, said Brown wanted to apologise for both "unpleasant" attacks.Before the incidents, there had been no concerns about the care or conduct of Freak or Tilly, he said. While Staffordshire bull terriers were sometimes seen as "status dogs", this was not Brown's reason for owning them.Brown had a difficult upbringing, having been asked to leave home aged 15 and spending time homeless before being housed by social services in bed and breakfast accommodation."The dogs were his family. He never took the dogs off a leash. They were always leashed. He is aware of the difficulties of Staffordshire terriers."Subsequently, he tells me that once introduced to other people the animals are well behaved and he has had those animals for three to four years and there has never been any complaint of misconduct."
