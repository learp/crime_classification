The parents of Madeleine McCann are to sue a former Portuguese detective who led the inquiry into their daughter's disappearance.Kate and Gerry McCann are taking action against Gonçalo Amaral because they "could no longer stand by" while he claimed their daughter was dead and that they were involved in hiding her remains.Amaral, who was removed from the case after claiming that British police were at the beck and call of the McCanns, published a book last year saying that Madeleine, who went missing in May 2007, died in her family's apartment in the Portugese resort of Praia da Luz.The McCanns, from Rothley, Leicestershire, said in a statement: "We - together with our three children Madeleine, Sean and Amelie - are taking this legal action against Gonçalo Amaral over his entirely unfounded and grossly defamatory claims made in all types of media, both within Portugal and beyond, that Madeleine is not only dead, but that we, her parents, were somehow involved in concealing her body." The decision was taken in a bid to prevent further publication of Amaral's "deeply offensive" book The Truth of the Lie, his television documentary and his "disgraceful thesis" that the McCanns are involved in their daughter's disappearance.The statement added: "The primary reason for our legal action is simple: to stop any negative effect that these absurd and deeply hurtful claims may be having on the ongoing search for Madeleine."We can no longer stand back and watch as Mr Amaral tries to convince the entire world that Madeleine is dead."Nor can we allow this blatant injustice to Madeleine, with its obvious risk of hindering our attempts to find her, to continue."The McCanns' lawyer, Edward Smethurst, said the first step in their legal action will be to apply for a gagging order at Lisbon's main civil court.
