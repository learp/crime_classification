Photograph: Northumbria Police/PAJennifer Shelton, 56, hit Bertha Martin over the head with the ceramic ornament at their home on 17 June last year.Newcastle crown court heard Mrs Martin, 85, of Cleadon, Sunderland, died of a brain haemorrhage a week later at South Tyneside General hospital.A postmortem examination revealed that Mrs Martin, who had leukaemia, had sustained an injury "with a very specific pattern" on the right side of her head.The bruising was consistent with the shape of the back hoof of the ceramic horse.The broken leg of the horse was later found by police hidden inside a sewing basket in the house Shelton had shared with her mother.Shelton was not in the dock when the jury returned a majority 10-2 manslaughter verdict yesterday, having refused to leave her prison cell.Alistair MacDonald QC, prosecuting, said: "Bertha Martin was killed by the consequences of a blow to the head delivered by her daughter Jennifer Shelton."The blow was made with a weapon in the form of a pottery foal or a horse. The nature of the injury is in keeping with forceful contact having been made with the underside of the horse and Mrs Martin's head."Shelton was cleared of murder during the trial on the direction of the judge, but still faced the lesser charge of manslaughter.Giving evidence during her trial, Shelton said that although she and her mother, who had a history of mental health problems, would often argue, she would never cause her any harm.The court was also told of a letter found on a computer in which Shelton is alleged to have written that she wished her mother "would depart this Earth".Three days before her mother's death, Shelton told nurses: "My mother is dying; my mother will never forgive me. God will never forgive me."A note was also found in the family home, simply reading: "Dear Mam, forgive me."
