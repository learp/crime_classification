Police hunting the killer of schoolboy Rory Blackhall said yesterday that they were trying to identify a man who was near the spot where the 11-year-old was last seen.Rory failed to turn up at Meldrum Primary in Livingston, West Lothian, on 18 August and his body was found three days later in nearby woodland. A post-mortem examination showed he had been asphyxiated.Detectives said they had become 'increasingly anxious' to establish the identity of a man who was wearing a bomber-style jacket and a trapper hat.Detective Inspector Tom Martin, of Lothian and Borders Police, said: 'At about 8.30am on the day before Rory went missing, a member of the public was walking along the pathway that leads from the underpass where Rory was dropped off by his mother.'A man emerged from the bushes and trees beside him near to the electricity sub-station. The man had to push aside some large bushes to exit the wood.'Police, who did not comment on whether the man was a suspect in the murder case, said he was alone and not seen carrying anything. Martin said the witness, who regularly used the route to walk his child to school, had not seen the man before.He added: '[The man] appeared to be completely out of place for the area and the witness was concerned about his presence there.'Martin said the man was seen with the flaps of his hat down covering his neck and ears: 'The witness thought this was particularly unusual given the weather conditions.'The unknown man was described aged about 38 to 40, 5ft 8in tall, with a 'gaunt, very pale appearance' and light or grey stubble on his chin.Rory's parents paid a visit yesterday to the spot close to where his body was found. The couple, who were accompanied by Rory's 14-year-old brother Conal, laid a bunch of thistle and lavender.A card they left read: 'Rory-Pory, you are always with us in our thoughts and in our hearts. Our wee Rory, we love you.' Rory's mother, Michelle, broke down in tears as they saw the dozens of tributes and flowers left by well-wishers.
