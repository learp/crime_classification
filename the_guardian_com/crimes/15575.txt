David Cameron has suggested that a court was too lenient in fining a man £50 for burning poppies at an Armistice day event.The prime minister said Britain should make a "stronger statement" that the incident was "completely out of order and has no place in a tolerant society".Emdadur Choudhury, a 26-year-old member of Muslims Against Crusades, was fined £50 on Monday after burning two large plastic poppies during a two-minute silence on 11 November.In a ruling at Woolwich crown court, district judge Howard Riddle said: "The two-minute chanting, when others were observing a silence, followed by a burning of the symbol of remembrance, was a calculated and deliberate insult to the dead and those who mourn or remember them."At Commons question time, the Conservative MP Jake Berry said: "I'm sure all members of the house would agree that one of the most important jobs we have every year is to go and represent people who have lost their lives in war on Remembrance Sunday."With that in mind, does the prime minister think a £50 fine is an appropriate punishment for those who burn poppies and chant during the silence?"Cameron replied: "I think you would have spoken for many people in terms of people's reaction to that court case. It is difficult unless you're sitting in the court and making that decision yourself."But I think to many of us, you look at something like that and feel that, as a country, we should be making a stronger statement that that sort of behaviour is completely out of order and has no place in a tolerant society."
