A murder inquiry has been launched after a man was attacked in the back of an ambulance by a group of around 20 youths in north London.The victim, who has not been formally identified, is believed to have been 26, of Moldovan origin and a resident of Bounds Green. He had already sustained head injuries after a fight in the Bounds Green Lane area with a group of men wielding baseball bats on Tuesday night, but had reached an ambulance which was in the area on an unrelated call. The group, all of Eastern European appearance, climbed into the ambulance and beat the man before fleeing. One witness said they had sticks, knives, baseball bats and golf clubs. The ambulance crew treated the victim and summoned emergency police assistance. He was taken to North Middlesex hospital but died at 10.30pm on Wednesday night. A post mortem confirmed he had died of a fractured skull. Three men aged 16, 21 and 23, were arrested shortly after the fight. However, police said they were keeping an open mind about the motive and were working on the assumption that some of those involved knew each other. The London Ambulance Service said: "The public expect an ambulance to be a place where you are treated in a safe way. "You expect to receive lifesaving care. You do not expect an ambulance to be a place of violence and fear. It is tragic that this man has died."
