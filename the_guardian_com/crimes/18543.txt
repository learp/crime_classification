A 6% "alcohol-fuelled" rise in violent crime recorded by the police yesterday triggered demands that the government postpone next month's move to relax the drinking laws.Chris Fox, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), said the increase partly reflected police operations targeting alcohol-fuelled violence and warned that the campaign, including the adoption of a zero tolerance approach to drunk and disorderly behaviour, would be stepped up in the approach to Christmas.The crime figures also showed a 5% rise in gun crime to 11,160 incidents involving firearms, but the biggest increase involved the use of imitation firearms such as paintball guns. Deaths in shootings fell during the year from 70 to 60.The rise in violent crime masked a 2% fall in overall crime in the 12 months to the end of June 2005, including continuing falls in burglary (down 11%) and car thefts (down 8%).But the figures also showed a 4% increase in robbery, mostly involving thefts of mobile phones and iPods and a 25% rise in drug offences, reflecting greater use of cautions for cannabis and a campaign to close down crack houses.The separate British Crime Survey (BCS), which is based on the experiences of 44,000 adults and regarded as more authoritative by criminologists, for the same period shows overall crime down by 5%, burglary by 17%, car thefts by 10% and violence stable.Paul Wiles, head of Home Office statistics, said the underlying trend of falling crime had continued for some time and the risk of becoming a crime victim was now at the lowest level recorded by the BCS since the survey began in 1981.He said the 8% fall in the police figures for serious violence, such as murder and GBH, was mainly due to recording changes while the 12% rise in less serious violent incidents involving injury was partly a reflection of increased police activity to deal with alcohol-related violence.More than half of violent crime is believed to be drink-fuelled. There were 318,000 violent offences in the second quarter of 2005 out of a total of 1.4m crimes recorded by the police.Professor Wiles also said the sharp rise of 12% in sexual offences was a result of legislation recategorising indecent exposure as a sexual offence.Charles Clarke, the home secretary, said the government's achievement in cutting crime should not be underestimated, but he conceded that people did not believe the figures. "I recognise that the fear of crime is too high, it is not enough to reduce crime if people do not perceive that reduction. I also accept that this is largely driven by the increase in recorded violent crime," he said.The summer campaign against alcohol-fuelled disorder had led to 700 arrests and almost 900 fixed penalty notices, he added.Hazel Blears, a Home Office minister, acknowledged some police concern from the impending change in the licensing laws but said the police had a range of powers to tackle the problem. A zero tolerance campaign towards drunk and disorderly behaviour by Northumbria police, called The Party's Over, was responsible for cutting violent crime and would now be adopted nationwide.She also said the powers going through parliament to close down pubs which were rowdy or sold alcohol to underage drinkers, orders banning binge drinkers and the declaration of alcohol disorder zones would follow next year.Edward Garnier, the Conservative home affairs spokesman, said the figures showed that violent crime was spiralling out of control. "The government should defer 24-hour drinking until it has got a grip on the problem of binge drinking, which is fuelling violent crime," he said.Mark Oaten, for the Liberal Democrats, also warned that the relaxation of drinking laws could mean violent crime continued to rise in the coming months.But Acpo said changes in recording practices were still affecting the figures. Mr Fox said: "We hope that further targeting will help stamp out the problems faced by all communities in terms of thuggery and low level violence."In the run-up to Christmas, we will be stepping up activity right across the country to combat this growing problem of drink-related violence."This summer's alcohol enforcement campaign targeted 25 areas in July and August and led to the arrest of 780 people and issuing of 858 fixed penalty fines for harassment, being drunk and disorderly and for breach of the peace.
