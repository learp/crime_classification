Pirate radio stations accused of spreading the rape allegations that sparked race riots in Birmingham are being investigated by police under incitement to racial hatred laws. Five of the pirate radio stations under suspicion have closed down since the riots just over a week ago resulted in the murder of 23-year-old IT worker Isiah Young-Sam in the Lozells area of the city.The violence that swept through the streets of the district was sparked by rumours that a West Indian girl had been raped by a gang of Asian men. The rumour was said to have been spread by pirate radio stations broadcasting in the area but police have not been able to substantiate the allegations.The media and telecoms regulator yesterday told More4 News last night that five of the stations involved had gone off air since the riots. Search warrants have been issued for four of them.A spokesman for Ofcom said that the regulator was not specifically targeting the area as part of its ongoing drive to close down pirate stations but that West Midlands police and the Home Office were investigating the stations involved.Pirate radio broadcasts can interfere with emergency services as well as commercial stations and many are suspected of helping to fund gangs involved in drugs and gun crime.Police yesterday charged three men with the murder of Mr Young-Sam, a bystander returning home after an evening out. Two men aged 22 and a 25-year-old, all from the Handsworth area of the city, are expected in court today accused of stabbing him to death.
