Detectives investigating a second GP over claims of deliberate injections of lethal doses of diamorphine, the drug used by Harold Shipman to kill at least 15 women, began examining medical records yesterday.Officers are checking files on two women who died 10 years ago in Doncaster, South York shire, where a 74-year-old doctor had some 2,500 patients on his list until he retired six years ago. A spokesman for Doncaster health authority said: "We are cooperating with South Yorkshire police." The checks involve Julia Price and Alice Bell, who died after receiving 15 and 20mg doses of diamorphine, compared with the usual dose of between five and 10mg. Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Burdis, head of the inquiry, said: "Officers are examining medical and other records to try to establish whether there is any truth in information passed to us by a third party." The force was alerted by Granada TV two weeks ago, when a caller rang a phone-in discusion on the Good Morning programme about the Shipman affair. The material was not broadcast but staff contacted police after deciding that the caller - who is understood to have been the doctor's wife - was genuine. Concern about the doctor's actions was raised at the time by relatives of one of the women, prompting an inquiry by the General Medical Council. The GMC imposed conditions on the doctor's use of the drugs but agreed that he could continue practising. The GP was supported by a petition from 350 patients at the Hollybush medical centre in Edenthorpe, Doncaster. But relatives were upset that no local witnesses were called by the hearing in London and some have remained unhappy with the GMC decision. South Yorkshire police have already interviewed GMC staff.
