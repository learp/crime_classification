A council's decision to divert a country footpath rather than clear it of obstructions, deliberately placed by a landowner to keep the public out, was upheld by the high court today.A judge in London rejected a challenge brought by Kate Ashbrook, general secretary of the Open Spaces Society and chairman of the Ramblers' Association. Ms Ashbrook had accused East Sussex county council of a "perverse and unsustainable" failure to force the landowner to reopen the path, which had been closed for over 10 years. The land, over which footpath "Framfield 9" runs, belongs to Rarebargain Ltd, a company linked to multimillionaire Nicholas van Hoogstraten, who has branded ramblers "scum of the earth" and "the great unwashed". Mr Justice Grigson heard that the Ramblers' Association had prosecuted Rarebargain four times in two years. Lewes magistrates had imposed fines on the company and ordered the removal of obstructions including a barn, a locked gate, barbed wire fencing, and industrial refrigerators. The fines were never paid and Rarebargain's diversion proposals were adopted by the council. Ms Ashbrook argued that the council had failed in its legal duty to protect the public's right to use the footpath and acted against its own policy by implementing the diversion before establishing a safe new route. But the judge said it was clear from the council's policy document that a diversion would be considered if removal of the obstructions was not "reasonably achievable" and it was open to the council to decide that removal of the barn was not reasonably achievable. The council was entitled to act on the diversion proposal if a new route was available, even though it had not yet been made safe and suitable. The judge made no order for costs against Ms Ashbrook, who said afterwards: "The battle continues. If the council thinks this is the end of the matter, it must think again." Press Association
