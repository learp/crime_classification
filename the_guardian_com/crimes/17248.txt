The crown prosecution service is considering charges of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm against the alleged killers of Stephen Lawrence, the 18-year-old black student stabbed to death in Eltham, south London, nine years ago.After a three-year investigation led by Scotland Yard's deputy assistant commissioner, John Grieve, the police believe they have acquired enough new evidence to bring the original five suspects and two of their friends to trial. Gary Dobson, Neil Acourt and Luke Knight were acquitted of Stephen's murder in 1996, when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family collapsed after witness evidence from Stephen's friend Duwayne Brooks was rejected. The case against Jamie Acourt and David Norris was dropped before it reached court. The police have also re-examined other racist attacks allegedly carried out by the gang in Eltham. They include the stabbing of Stacey Benefield a month before Stephen's death. Norris and Neil Acourt were charged with attempted murder but only Norris was sent to trial. He was acquitted, despite allegations of witness and jury bribing by Norris's criminal father. Last year Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said he knew who Stephen's killers were. The problem initially facing the police was the paucity of witness and forensic evidence. But several statements have been obtained, believed to be from former female friends of the suspects. Since the new inquiry began four additional men have been arrested in connection with the murder but not charged. Mr Grieve, who vowed to bring Stephen's killers to justice, is to retire at the end of the month.
