As the most senior officers at the Metropolitan police make their exit from Scotland Yard candidates to replace them are arriving through the revolving doors.Mindful of the need to get chief officers in post quickly the Met hopes to have two assistant commissioners starting their jobs in the New Year. Despite the flack the Met has received over the last year - from phone hacking to the policing of riots - joining Scotland Yard is still seen by senior officers across the country as an attractive challenge - and then there is the salary of Â£181,455 "plus benefits" to provide added impetus.Six strong external candidates have applied for the two assistant commissioner posts at the Yard to replace Ian McPherson in territorial policing - responsible for everyday uniformed policing and Cressida Dick in the specialist crime command - responsible for homicide and serious crime.Appointments will apparently be in made by Christmas.
