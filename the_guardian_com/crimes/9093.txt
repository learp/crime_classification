Myra Hindley's health has suffered throughout her 36 years in jail.Britain's longest serving female prisoner, she suffers from angina, high blood pressure and the brittle bone disease osteoporosis. She recently suffered a suspected stroke in jail at Highpoint Prison, Suffolk, and her mobility was badly hampered when she broke a thigh bone in the gymn.This injury never healed properly, and she relied on a walking stick to get around.But doctors said Hindley's heart was under pressure from her 40-a-day smoking habit and she was warned frequently to cut down.She underwent an operation for an aneurysm - a swelling artery - in her brain after her suspected stroke in January 2000. It is a condition to which smokers are believed to be more vulnerable.Hindley was understood to have given orders to her lawyers before her 2000 operation that she was not to be kept alive artificially if she lapsed into a coma. She also requested that none of her organs should be offered for transplant after she dies.
