An amateur footballer is awaiting facial reconstruction after being repeatedly kicked and beaten as he lay unconscious after an attack during a night out.Richie Robins, the first-team goalkeeper for the non-league side Wivenhoe Town FC and a former Colchester United youth team player, is understood to have stepped in to protect a woman when he was set upon by half a dozen men.The 21-year-old student was punched and knocked out but the attack continued as he lay on the floor, Essex police said.DC Seff Manesh appealed for people who witnessed the attack, which took place outside a Subway store in Queen Street, Colchester, at 3.30am on 21 December, to come forward.He said: "This young man had been out with his friends after returning home from university for the Christmas holiday."We are aware of a disturbance involving a large number of young men and are examining CCTV to establish what happened and who was involved."This student has sustained some very nasty-looking injuries which will affect him for the foreseeable future.

He said he had not been drinking as he had a match the next day.After the incident, Robins was taken to Colchester general hospital by paramedics and was due to see a specialist surgeon this week.Essex police said there were about six attackers who were described as black and in their late teens and early 20s.Officers have arrested a 19-year-old man from Colchester in connection with the incident.
