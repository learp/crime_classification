The parents of missing Madeleine McCann met the Pope today in a new effort to raise worldwide awareness of their four-year-old daughter.Kate and Gerry McCann, devout Catholics, sat in the front row of Pope Benedict's weekly general audience at the Vatican this morning.Afterwards, the couple were among those granted a brief personal audience with the pontiff in St Peter's Square.Television footage showed him grasping their hands. Both appeared to be blinking back tears as he talked to them for around 30 seconds, and Mrs McCann handed the Pope a photograph of her missing daughter, which he blessed."It was very emotional, but it was also a very positive experience," Mrs McCann told reporters afterwards. "He was very kind and very sincere and he said he would pray for us and our family, and pray for Madeleine's safe return."The family believed they would see their daughter again, Mr McCann said, adding: "We understand that there are many different scenarios, but we must believe and do believe that we can get Madeleine back."It was the first time the couple have left Praia da Luz since Madeleine was abducted from their apartment in the Portuguese seaside resort town on May 3.They flew to Rome in a private jet belonging to the retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, who offered it for their use.While Portuguese police have so far uncovered no definitive leads in the case, the McCanns have mounted a hugely successful publicity campaign to spread news of their daughter's disappearance.They also plan to visit Spain, the Netherlands, Morocco and Germany to further raise awareness of their daughter's disappearance.The couple were not about to return to their Leicestershire home, Mrs McCann said. "All I can say is that we don't have any plans at all to return to the UK. I can't actually think about that for the moment," she added.The McCanns - whose two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie, have been left with Mr McCann's sister and her husband - were expected to return to Portugal from Rome.
