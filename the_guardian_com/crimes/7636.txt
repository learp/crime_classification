The stepfather of Shannon Matthews, the nine-year-old schoolgirl who disappeared for 24 days, was last night charged with 10 counts of possessing child pornography. Craig Meehan, 22, was arrested yesterday morning at the house in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire, which he shares with Shannon's mother, Karen Matthews, 32, and three of her seven children. The supermarket fishmonger was driven away in an unmarked car and detectives later took boxes and bags from the redbrick semi and renewed a police guard which was lifted a week ago. A West Yorkshire police spokesman said last night: "A 22-year-old man has been charged with 10 specimen offences of possession of indecent images of children. "In relation to the welfare of the family's children, it is being dealt with by social services. Police policy is we are not commenting on the welfare of the children." Karen Matthews was in the house as Meehan was taken in for questioning but later left with her children on a half-term day trip with other local families. Shannon has not returned home since police discovered her in the drawer of a bed at a flat a mile from her home. The youngster has been in the care of social services since she was discovered at the flat in Batley Carr, on March 14. Michael Donovan, a 39-year-old computer programmer from Dewsbury who is one of Meehan's uncles, has been charged with abducting Shannon and holding her against her will. He faces trial at Leeds crown court on November 11.Shannon is still being questioned by police and is being looked after by Kirklees council social services. No date has been set for her return to Dewsbury Moor, where residents had planned a party.
