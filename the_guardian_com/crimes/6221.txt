A strange media silence greeted Thursday's news that Alan Williams, the pathologist who failed to disclose the results of a test carried out on one of Sally Clark's babies, has been restored to the ranks of Home Office-accredited pathologists, following a panel's ruling that he was "a competent pathologist who made one serious error which he was unlikely to repeat". Such was the widespread indifference to this revelation, in fact, that only Guardian readers were made aware of it.Many myths sprang from the Sally Clark case, among them that at her successful second appeal, in January 2003, her innocence was "proved" and that the true cause of her children's deaths, concealed by Dr Williams from prosecution and defence alike, had finally been revealed to be meningitis.In fact, the only conclusion reached at appeal was that, because the results of post-mortem tests carried out on Harry Clark for the presence of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus had not been put before the jury at Clark's trial in 1999, the convictions "were unsafe and must be set aside".The appeal court limited itself to hearing one expert from each side on this question. A pathology professor called by the defence testified: "overwhelming staphylococcal infection is the most likely cause of death" and could have caused meningitis, toxin-induced damage or toxic shock.A consultant in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology called by the prosecution disagreed. None of the features of the case, he said, were consistent with death from any of those causes."If we had been required to reach a conclusion as to which of their compelling views was correct," wrote the appeal judges, "we should have found it a very difficult decision to make."And there examination of the possibility that Harry Clark's death was caused by bacterial infection ended.On the day Sally Clark was freed, the Crown Prosecution Service issued a statement explaining why it would not be applying for a retrial: "At this juncture it would no longer be possible for the defence or the prosecution to carry out further tests to prove or disprove this theory. We are also conscious of the extensive publicity this case has attracted throughout. For those reasons the prosecution submitted to the Court that it would not now be possible to have a fair retrial."The tragedy of the Clark family was, of course, compounded by the death in March of Sally Clark (from a cause still unknown), but it neither honours her or her children, nor does more credit to one side than the other, to present as facts uncertain theories about the circumstances of Christopher and Harry's deaths.Would Sally Clark have been found guilty in 1999 if the details of the staphylococcus aureus findings had been included in Dr Williams' report? Who knows - but had details of the tests emerged in the normal way, at trial, it seems unlikely that they would have assumed the importance they did later at appeal.What is clear, however, is that without Dr Williams' failure to include the findings in his report, Sally Clark's defence team would have had scant ground on which to mount her second, successful appeal.Sally Clark may, or may not, have owed her incarceration to Dr Williams but, perversely, without doubt, she had him to thank for her eventual, albeit short-lived freedom.
