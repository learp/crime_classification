Plans by the Metropolitan Police to moor a prison ship on the Thames were criticised yesterday as "confused" and "inappropriate".Scotland Yard indicated it would decide in the next two weeks whether to take over the ship in an attempt to end overcrowding in police cells. HMP Weare, berthed in Dorset, holds 400 inmates and was purchased by the government in 1997 as a temporary measure. It was due to close in 2000 but is still in use. Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay said the proposal raised human rights issues as well as questions of planning. "It's indicative of some of the confused thinking and poor decision-making which has become a hallmark of the senior management of the Met in recent times," he said. "The reason why such a proposal was rejected by the Home Office a few years ago remain today." Mr Mackinlay called on the new home secretary Charles Clarke to quash the proposals and said it would hinder the proposed improvement of the Thames Gateway area. Last month inspectors said the ship was "unacceptably cramped and claustrophobic" with no access to fresh air in cells. The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, said HMP Weare was "entirely unsuitable" for its function and pointed out it would require millions of pounds in investment to bring it up to scratch. But Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he believed the ship would only be used for short-term accommodation. The Prison Reform Trust said it was also concerned by the proposal and added: "Our position has always been that the Weare is completely inappropriate to hold prisoners."
