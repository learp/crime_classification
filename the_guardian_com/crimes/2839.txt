Three cabinet ministers last night warned the courts that sending less serious offenders to prison for short sentences could make things worse, as the latest prison population figures reached 72,652.The joint statement by the home secretary, David Blunkett, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, and the attorney general, Sir Peter Goldsmith, follows the warning last week from the lord chief justice that jail overcrowding is a "cancer" that is eating away the ability of the prison service to protect the public from crime. The statement was accompanied by an emergency cash injection of Â£70m for the probation service to expand the alternative programme of community penalties for less serious offenders. The warning follows similar ones in March and in June to the courts in an attempt to "talk down" the historic rise in the prison population - which has soared from 42,000 over the past 10 years. The ministers said that prison should overwhelmingly be reserved for those who commit serious and violent crimes. "Short custodial sentences without post-release supervision, as opposed to community sentences for less offences, provide little opportunity for rehabilitation or to prevent re-offending and can make things worse."
