A man arrested in connection with the death of a woman mauled by a dog at her home was released on bail today.Alex Blackburn-Smith was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter last night, following the victim's death at a house on Wallington, south London.She was named locally as Barbara Williams, thought to be in her 50s and a lodger at the property. The Belgian mastiff, described by one officer as large and ferocious, was shot dead by police marksmen.The 34-year-old suspect was also held on suspicion of cultivating cannabis and taken to a police station. Detective Chief Superintendent Guy Ferguson described the dog as "distinctly large" and said that at the time of Thursday's attack, another woman of similar age to Williams was in the house with a child under five."It was a very ferocious dog," he said."The officers had to use shields to contain the dog."Ferguson added that police would be investigating previous complaints about the dog and what, if anything, was done.Sutton council confirmed it had received a complaint about dogs damaging a neighbour's fence last year."The council and the police's safer neighbourhood team were contacted in connection with another smaller dog and damage to a fence at this address in August 2009," said Councillor Colin Hall, responsible for dog control."At that point there were no legal grounds for the council to intervene on the basis of our statutory powers."There were no subsequent complaints."Earlier, Ferguson said Blackburn-Smith was the main occupier of the premises. It is thought the victim was a lodger at the property which was "controlled" by Blackburn-Smith.Police also removed a puppy from the property after killing the mastiff.Next-door neighbour Burhan Yanbolu, a father of twin girls, said: "We didn't have anything to do with them because of the dog. It was a big strong dog."We started having problems with them in autumn 2009."There were two dogs and the big one would lean against the fence and could see over it on its hind legs."We had concerns it would get over and could get in our garden."Last year, our children couldn't play in the garden at all because the mastiff damaged a big chunk of fence crashing through."Describing Thursday night's horrific events, he said: "The police came through our garden to get access."We could hear them talking about the female, saying she was badly injured and there was lots of blood, but they couldn't get in to secure the dog."Somehow the dog went into a different bit and the police and paramedics worked on the lady."He said police marksmen evacuated neighbours on the other side and considered moving him and his wife as well."They told us to expect 10 rounds to take the dog out," said Yanbolu."But it was only four. We heard three and then 30 seconds later there was one more."â€¢ This article was amended on 4 January 2011. The original referred to Barbara Walters. This has been corrected.
