Two of Britain's most wanted criminals have been arrested overseas, the charity Crimestoppers said today. Stephen Burnell, 56, of Scunthorpe, was tracked down in Crete and Ronald Priestley, 69, of Leeds, in Malaga in Spain. Both men were arrested while on the run after being sentenced to jail in their absence. Burnell was found guilty of attempted rape, indecent assault, and taking indecent photographs of a child in March 2007 and sentenced to six years. Priestley was convicted in February 2006 for his part in the production of counterfeit banknotes and given eight years in jail.
