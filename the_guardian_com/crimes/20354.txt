A ballet teacher has been given a suspended jail sentence after she admitted abducting a teenage boy. Sarah Pirie, 27, committed a "serious breach of trust" when she gave him a lift in her car a week after she was banned from having any contact with him. A judge at Preston crown court said he had accepted there was no sexual activity with the boy, 15. But the judge said Pirie – who met the boy at Clifton Dance Academy in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire – "went past the boundaries" of her employment. She was jailed for 35 weeks, suspended for two years, after she admitted child abduction.
