Police are investigating allegations of a multi-million pound match-fixing scandal involving football clubs across Europe, it was revealed yesterday.But European football's governing body denied claims that qualifying matches for the Euro 2008 tournament, from which England were eliminated last month, are under scrutiny.Uefa said it had asked Europol to examine 15 matches played mainly in the qualifying rounds of their club competitions in the past two years after an early-warning system detected suspicious betting patterns, but would not name teams involved for fear of jeopardising the investigation.Graham Bean, the former head of the English FA Compliance Unit, warned that football could be facing a major scandal. 'These are exceptionally serious allegations,' he said.A German magazine reported that Uefa was looking into up to 26 matches dating back to July 2005, and said the majority involved teams from eastern and south-eastern Europe. No British team has so far been linked with the inquiry.According to Der Spiegel, the matches under scrutiny include three fixtures from a preliminary round in the Champions League, two in the Uefa Cup and a Euro 2008 qualifier. But, Uefa insisted none of the Euro 2008 qualifying games was under suspicion.
