Dear Colleague, The Whips message which gave the impression that the Minister has done a deal with the prime movers of the New Clause 2 is simply untrue. No such deal has been done and New Clause 2 will therefore still be put to the vote. I and its other prime movers would be most grateful if you could support or abstain as you had originally decided.

Labour has led calls for a proper statutory code with teeth on pub companies, giving tenants the protection they need and putting an end to the unfair treatment they’ve received from large pub companies. Our plans have won support from a broad coalition of campaigners including Camra, the Federation of Small Business, trade unions and the cross-party BIS select committee.Over the past three years ministers have been dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way on this issue, and now they have been dealt a resounding and humiliating defeat in the House of Commons. Ministers must now act immediately to ensure there is a proper statutory code with a free-of-tie option to protect local pubs, and must not ignore the will of the House of Commons, after their desperate and shambolic attempts to stave off defeat have failed.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.11pm GMT17:11Sam Coates from the Times says Matthew Hancock, the business minister, has been apologising to David Cameron for the vote.Sam Coates Times (@SamCoatesTimes)Matt Hancock reportedly seen grovelling to the PM after he oversaw the first loss of a vote on a government bill since 2010November 18, 2014FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.10pm GMT17:10The pubs vote does represent an incident of “yellow on yellow” friendly fire.Greg Mulholland, the MP who tabled the amendment, is a Liberal Democrat. The department in charge of the bill is business, which is run by Vince Cable, and the minister handling the bill when MPs debated pubs was Jo Swinson, a third Lib Dem.In an attempt to avert the rebellion, Swinson offered to amend the bill in the Lords to ensure the MRO option (Mulholland’s option - see 4.42pm) started coming in after two years if a review showed that the reforms in the bill were not working. But MPs rejected that.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.02pm GMT17:02Here’s more from the pubs debate.Adrian Bailey, the Labour chair of the Commons business committee, explained why he was backing the Mulholland amendment. We know that behind every closure there is a personal story, often heart rending of people investing their life savings, and working all hours, and then having to close their businesses because the imbalance and the fundamental economic relationship between them and the pub company was so unfair that they just couldn’t keep going.I believe that this new clause is not only vital for the future of thousands of pub tenants who will be watching this debate knowing that their future could depend on the outcome of it, but it is also actually potentially a milestone in our democracy.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.54pm GMT16:54Back to the pub vote.It marks the first government defeat on legislation in the Commons where collective responsibility was not suspended.Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh)Pubs vote is 1st time since 2010 Govt defeated on its own bill (where collective resp not suspended).November 18, 2014Philip Cowley (@philipjcowley)@paulwaugh On a bill, yes, but somewhat less significant than the European budget vote or Syria (where collective responsibility held).November 18, 2014FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.53pm GMT16:53Alex Salmond's resignation statement - SummaryAlex Salmond’s resignation statement was rather gracious, and the exchanges overall were polite and generous. Of the responses, Ruth Davidson and Patrick Harvie’s were the best, and Jackie Baillie’s was poor. There was not much politics in it all, but there were a few sharp moments. Here are the main points.Salmond used his resignation statement as first minister in the Scottish parliament to say that devolution, and the independence referendum, has given Scotland “the most energised, empowered and informed electorate of any country in Europe”. This Parliament was reborn out of the realisation that we could no longer afford to have our domestic politics dictated by governments without democratic legitimacy.We progressed because people became impatient with politicians who wanted to administer rather than to govern. And we will grow further yet because people wish to shape the circumstances around them and are demanding a Parliament fully equipped for that task ...Scotland now has the most energised, empowered and informed electorate of any country in Europe.We have a new generation of citizens who understand that their opinion matters, who believe that their voice will be heard, and who know that their vote can shape the society they live in. He hinted that he intends to stand for parliament at the general election, so that he can use SNP votes to put maximum pressure on the government to offer concessions to Scotland in the event of a hung parliament. I have led a minority administration and a majority one. Minority government requires negotiation – to recognise honest disagreement, and then compromise in the public interest.And Presiding Officer, I have no idea if that experience of minority government in this place will ever again come in handy in another place.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said implied that Salmond was being hypocritical in criticising Labour and the Lib Dems for siding with the Tories over independence. Mocking his attack on Alistair Darling for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with the Tories, Davidson said that Salmond relied on Tory support when he ran a minority government. On Thursday the first minister joked that working with the Conservatives [in the referendum] was electoral suicide, despite the small matter of us having defeated him in the referendum, despite also one of the reasons for his administration gaining a reputation for confidence and stability during those first four years being because he needed, he sought and he received support from the Scottish Conservativese to pass his budgets and to keep his government on the rails. One might say that the first minister and Annable Goldie [the then Conservative leader] stood shoulder to shoulder to make the government work. I would not go so far as to say that they were Better Together, but such a close working relationship was no drag his electoral prospects in 2011.Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said Salmond had left a divisive legacy. For too many families, friends and communities, the referendum was divisive. [Salmond] may not wish to accept it, but that will be as much his legacy as all the positive attributes that he would describe. It will take many years for those wounds to heal and the unity we once enjoyed to return.

Mulholland is chair of the Save the Pub campaign.I’ve taken this from the Press Association.Mulholland said: At the moment the bill and the code [of conduct] doesn’t deliver what the government has set out courageously to deliver. Don’t take my word for it - take the word actually of one of the two companies who is particularly vociferously lobbying against it - Punch Taverns. In their own prospectus for potential investors, dated October 6 2014, they say ‘Punch does not believe that the reforms currently proposed would materially adversely affect the Punch group’. In other words it would be business as usual, they would continue to charge excessive beer prices, often 70% more than actually MPs could get from the brewery as well as entirely unregulated rents.Mulholland stressed that his plan to allow pubs a “market rent only” (MRO) option from their parent company would come in gradually over five years and only be triggered at key points in the cycle of a lease or tenancy, such as rent reviews, lease renewals or on the sale of the title of a property, or if there was a substantial change in prices or change in circumstances such as a cheaper pub opening next door. This period would then be followed by two potential periods of negotiation between the pub and the larger owning company with an independent surveyor to adjudicate over any differences in opinion, he said. This is a reasonable gradual process that will simply bring back market forces into a sector that frankly has become grotesquely anti-competitive, it’s closed to many smaller breweries and it is not working for publicans, it’s not working for those communities losing pubs, and actually frankly it’s not working for those large companies themselves.Mulholland also launched a stinging attack on large pub companies and the British Beer and Pub Association for scaremongering about his proposals with “utterly baseless comments”. There has been a shameful campaign of misinformation against (my amendment) and the market rent only option. The usual suspects, the large pub companies and their mouthpiece the so-called British Beer and Pub Association, in reality the big brewers and pubco association, and they have been lobbying vociferously with a whole stream of utterly baseless comments, simply scaremongering to suggest that somehow the idea of these companies simply offering a fair commercial rent to their would somehow cause collapse, chaos and closures and all the rest of it.If you do believe in competition then you should not be afraid of allowing brewers of all sizes to compete.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.33pm GMT16:33My colleague Patrick Wintour points out that this was a victory for a campaign run on a shoestring.

The government has been defeated over proposals to allow pub tenants tied to big companies to demand a market rent only (MRO) agreement from their parent company. A broadly-backed amendment to the small business, enterprise and employment bill, signed by MPs from all three main parties, was approved by 284 votes to 269, majority 15. Liberal Democrat Greg Mulholland (Leeds North West), who proposed the amendment, said his option had been broadly backed in a consultation run by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS).It is thought to be the government’s first defeat on one of its own bills since the 2010 election. The government’s majority is usually around 60. Loud cheers from the Labour benches greeted the result while shouts of “resign” were also heard. A shout of “well done chief whip” was aimed at Conservative Michael Gove.Senior Liberal Democrat Tim Farron patted a smiling Mr Mulholland on the back.
