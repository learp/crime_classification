Home Office ministers have postponed plans to invite private companies and voluntary organisations to run probation services in England and Wales after official consultation revealed widespread criticism. Instead, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, has ordered as a matter of urgency that a rigorous performance assessment of every probation area in England and Wales take place in the next 18 months.Hit squads of managers will be sent in to help failing probation services improve before any attempt is made to put them out to competition. Separately, probation "intervention" programmes with offenders will be put out to competition once a new network of business-oriented "probation trusts", under the direction of the home secretary, is created.The redrawn proposals are part of a government plan to cut reoffending rates by 10%. "We believe that we must do more to protect the public against dangerous people, and that levels of confidence in the ability of the probation service to do this are worryingly low," says the Home Office response to the consultation on the proposals. "We are to introduce an enhanced performance regime for probation services as a matter of urgency."The decision comes as a cluster of high-profile murder cases by offenders under probation supervision has severely dented public confidence in the service. It follows an official consultation which the Probation Boards' Association said produced 748 responses, of which 740 were against the restructuring plans."There was general support for the increased involvement of alternative providers in delivering probation services. However, many respondents from the probation service saw the proposed forms of contestability as privatisation," says the Home Office summary of the consultation.The inspection of the 42 probation areas in England and Wales is to improve performance now and to prepare for the use of new powers for the home secretary to take over local probation services."Providing each probation area meets the standard we would expect, the public sector will be awarded a contract to deliver offender management services in the first instance," the Home Office response said. "Where failings are identified we will work with the area to improve performance in order to protect the public and reduce reoffending. However, if the required standard is still not met the work will be put out to competition."Mr Clarke had to postpone legislation introducing a competitive market this year because of opposition from backbench Labour MPs. He is to try again in May. The Home Office denies that the timetable has slowed down but this time senior departmental sources are making clear that no "contestability" competitions are likely to be held for at least five years. The proposals published in October suggested the first could come as early as 2008."The legislation will reflect the proposals outlined in the consultation paper but take into account the responses," said Lady Scotland, the Home Office minister.Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation service union, said they would continue to oppose the expected legislation as it could lead to large-scale privatisation of the service, but the move to performance testing and offering help to failing areas was a step forward.The Probation Boards' Association said it was disappointed the government still intended to take away responsibility for probation services from local probation boards and introduce competitions for interventions - the work done with offenders.But the Confederation of British Industry said that the expertise of business had to be brought to bear if the government's targets for cutting reoffending rates was going to be met.
