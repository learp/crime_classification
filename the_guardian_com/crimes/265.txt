Musicians from such diverse groups as Pink Floyd and Boyzone have joined forces in a last-ditch campaign to halt the extradition to the US of north London computer hacker Gary McKinnon.The family and friends of McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, are hoping that a campaign also supported by well-known names including Terry Waite, Boris Johnson, Sting, Lord Carlile and Jane Asher, will finally bear fruit.Next month, McKinnon is due to have what is likely to be his final legal appearance in a judicial review over the decision of home secretary, Jacqui Smith, to send him to stand trial in the US for hacking into the US defence department and Nasa computer systems in a search for evidence about UFOs.An earlier judicial review ruled that Smith had failed to take adequate consideration of evidence of McKinnon's medical condition. If McKinnon failed in this bid for a reconsideration of the extradition decision, he could be sent immediately for trial in the US and face a lengthy jail sentence.To help the case, Graham Nash has authorised a reworking of his song Chicago, written when he was part of Crosby, Stills and Nash in the wake of the violent 1968 Democratic party convention in Chicago and the subsequent trial of the so-called Chicago Seven.David Gilmour, the Pink Floyd musician and political activist, has agreed to produce a fresh recording of the song to publicise McKinnon's plight.Boyzone singer Keith Duffy has also expressed his support for McKinnon. "As the parent of a child with autism I know only too well that getting support at the right time can be crucial," said Duffy.
