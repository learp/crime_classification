An explosion in the use by the courts of a new indeterminate "life" sentence has been sharply criticised by the head of the parole board as a "futile exercise" which will only increase prison overcrowding.Judges' enthusiastic use of the new indeterminate public protection sentence - under which no release date is fixed for an offender still assessed to be dangerous - has far outstripped expectations, with more than 1,890 offenders jailed without a fixed release date since it was introduced 18 months ago, in April 2005.Sir Duncan Nichol, chairman of the parole board, has revealed official projections show the number of prisoners on the new indeterminate sentence at any one time is expected to accelerate even faster and reach 12,500 within five years - far outstripping the 8,252-strong traditional "lifer" population in England and Wales.But Sir Duncan told an audience at the King's College centre for crime and justice studies in London that judges are recommending such short minimum terms to be served that the parole board is being asked to consider their release almost as soon as they are being received into custody.He said the impact of the new sentence will be increased prison overcrowding, prisoners denied early release while they wait for a scarce place on an "offending behaviour" course, and increased resources needed to deal with a quadrupling of the board's case work on indeterminate life sentences.Sir Duncan said the new sentence simply was not the same as the previous "two strikes" automatic life sentence. The "two strikes" sentence was triggered by a repeat conviction for 11 specified offences while the new punishment can be triggered by a first offence of any of 153 listed violent or sex crimes, ranging from stalking, exposure and racial assault to manslaughter, as long as the offender is deemed to be dangerous."Because the specified offence that led to the indeterminate public protection [IPP] sentence may not in itself be serious, very many such prisoners have unusually short tariffs [the minimum period to be served]," said Sir Duncan. This was compounded by many judges halving the minimum term and then giving a further discount for a guilty plea."I understand that half the offenders recently sentenced to IPP sentences have received tariffs of 20 months or less and 20% under 18 months. The effect of this is that he is entitled to be considered for release almost as soon as he is received into custody following trial," he said."The practical effect can often be that not only has the prison no time to assess the individual ... but that the board's role in assessing his risk to the public is rendered almost academic by the fact that nothing has changed in the very short period between the sentencing judge deciding he is a significant risk, and the board considering his case," he said.The introduction of indeterminate public protection sentences by the then home secretary, David Blunkett, in the 2003 Criminal Justice Act was a major departure in British criminal justice as it sentenced people based on potential risk rather than simply on the facts before the court.A Home Office spokeswoman said the median tariff set during the first year of the sentence until March last year was 30 months. The numbers in prison without a release date was set to rise to 12,500 by 2011. The Home Office estimates this will add 3,500 to the daily prison population.
