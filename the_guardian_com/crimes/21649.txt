A teenager who squirted bleach over a woman after she complained about noise during a Harry Potter film was placed in detention for a year today and stripped of his legal anonymity.Jordan Horsley, 16, planned the attack after tracking the woman and her family to a nearby restaurant after the film and buying the bleach from a nearby garage.The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier QC, lifted an order made earlier under the Children and Young Persons Act which prevented Horsley, who lives near the Vue multi-screen in Kirkstall, Leeds, from being identified.He expressed concern about social services' previous involvement with Horsley, who suffered violence from his father after his mother died when he was young.The 190cm (6ft 3in) teenager, who pleaded guilty last month to causing actual bodily harm to Annette Warden, 46, the mother of two children, was sentenced to 12 months' secure detention and training. A jury convicted him at the earlier hearing of the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm.Inspector Richard Baildon, of West Yorkshire police, said Warden had been "mentally scarred" by the incident, although prompt action had got her to Leeds General Infirmary in time to avoid serious burns. The Domestos bleach ran down her face and into her eyes and temporarily turned her hair white and grey. She now suffers sleep problems and is scared to go out without her husband.Horsley was one of a group of teenagers whose mobile phones repeatedly rang during the screening of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince in July last year. Warden first asked them to be quiet and then called a member of staff, who threatened the group with eviction from the cinema.The judge told Horsley, who has a previous conviction for hitting a man in the head with a brick, that he accepted that he had originally intended to throw eggs at Warden, but that the garage had none. "You have not been well-served in your life by your father and there must be some concerns as to the intervention that was attempted as you were growing up, which never resolved the issues which you still have," he said.Horsley is likely to be released on licence after serving half of his sentence. He was issued with a caution after the brick assault.
