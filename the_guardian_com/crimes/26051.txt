A disgruntled son who burgled his mother's home and stole £50,000 of goods after she criticised him for forgetting her birthday was sentenced yesterday to nine months in a young offenders' institution. Thomas Bradley, 19, stormed out of the family home in Bournemouth but later returned with a bin liner while his mother, Susan Taylor, and stepfather Peter were at work. After turning off the burglar alarm he sawed a wardrobe door off to get to a safe and helped himself to Taylor's jewellery, including a £7,500 ring. He also took a guitar worth £5,000, and pawned the lot. When Taylor got home she suspected her son was responsible as the alarm had been switched off using a secret code. She immediately phoned the police. Outside Bournemouth crown court Taylor, a medical secretary, said she had no regrets about informing on her son. She said: "We didn't consider shielding him for one moment. We are not strict disciplinarians but we know the difference between right and wrong."We asked ourselves if we had done anything wrong but the honest answer was no. Our other four children are respectable people with good careers. We knew we had to be cruel to be kind."But I've visited Tom in prison twice. He has written letters saying he is sorry and seems to be on the right track. "Tom is my son and I still love him but he's in the right place." Bradley pleaded guilty to burglary. Iain Ross, defending, said: "The enormity of what he has done has only just now come home to roost."
