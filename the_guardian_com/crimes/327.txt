Katharine-I-predict-a-riot-Birbalsingh has been raising hackles again . She has said the recent events were"completely predictable, I've been saying for months that our young people have been completely let down by the system, particularly the education system, but also by some of their families. ... If families are not teaching our young people the difference between right and wrong the schools need to do it. We have had a lack of authority ... we have been teaching them all about their rights and nothing about their responsibilities."According to Tottenham resident and Conservative party member David Allan: "the roads to these riots has been paved by the good intentions of the British left and the liberal establishment. I'm afraid in local and national government in education throughout the public sector and goaded on by the media led by the Guardian and the BBC our minority ethnic communities have been completely failed in the last 30 years" and by "horribly feminised" schools which have made education uncool for young men."We need to try and create a culture where black youth who are feeling alienated from education actually find education cool. ... Even I as a middle-aged semi-intellectual gay man living in London find schools horribly feminised places. God knows what a rumbunctious small boy who wants to be out playing football thinks."Birbalsingh pitches in "We have to recognise the problems in our schools. All of these children are in our schools. We keep saying there is no behaviour problem, but do we really think that children that are going around with baseball bats and setting stores alight are behaving themselves? We need to establish authority. 17% of our 15-year-olds are functionally illiterate. We need to teach them things. We're not teaching them properly."Teachers on Twitter erupted:@LeeDonaghy @BBCr4today will you please stop giving Katharine Birbalsingh a platform to spout rubbish? There are 1000s of sensible teachers out there@pivotalpaul "Birbalsingh does not speak for me, the profession or any teacher. Give her a free sch and get her off the media"A suggestion which @frdragonspouse quickly corrected "For damage reduction, can we give her one with no pupils?"But the Tories aren't the only ones pointing the finger at teachers for the riots, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams also thinks the nation's schools are to blame (according the Daily Telegraph, which ran the story under the headline "Anarchy shames our 'failing' schools"). Oh, and capitalism if you read the same story in the Guardian. During a debate in the House of Lords Williams said schools had for too long concentrated on turning out "consumers" and "cogs in an economic system". Here are some quotes from the debate:"Over the last two decades, many would agree that our educational philosophy at every level has been more and more dominated by an instrumentalist model; less and less concerned with a building of virtue, character and citizenship"."Are we prepared to think not only about discipline in classrooms, but also about the content and ethos of our educational institutions – asking can we once again build a society which takes seriously the task of educating citizens, not consumers, not cogs in an economic system, but citizens."Meanwhile at the BBC headteachers are blaming the parents:"Parents are not willing to say 'no'. That short, simple word is an important part of any child's upbringing," says Mr Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders."It's desperately important that children have a sense of right and wrong. But we often come across children who have never been told that something is wrong."Emma Jones, a Tottenham resident and former teacher has written a blog for EducationGuardian.co.uk on the practical things that schools can do to strengthen their local communities.Schools must work together more closely. Instead of only competing with each other in sport, they can ensure that sport, music, drama and other activities are enjoyed together. This builds mutual respect and understanding, and a sense of community. ... Mental health and emotional literacy must be a priority. Part-time, fully-funded nursery education from age two should be compulsory in identified areas.Education news from the Guardian• Student debt nears £60,000 for 2012 university freshers, Student Union predictsHear them debate it on the Today programme here. It's not a "debt" apparently, it's a "tax" but they had to call it a "debt" because the Conservative backbenchers wouldn't have stomached any new "tax." So that's ok then. A tax bill of £60,000 for going to university is far less off-putting than just a plain old bill of £60,000.• Laura Laker gives her top tips on how to get more children cycling to schoolOn the Guardian higher education networkAaron Porter's first or fail: Newcastle and Durham colleges kick off competition at the lower end of the tuition fees price scale, while Carol Vorderman miscalculates the launch of her mathematics taskforceEducation news from around the web• "It's only three weeks till the start of term: what on earth are schools going to be dealing with on their return?" asks Susan Young in a thoughtful blogpost that aims to prepare teachers for what they will have to face when the schools reopen. (Thanks to @warwickmansell for alerting us to this) Here's a flavour:Younger children are likely to be traumatised in many areas. They'll have been woken by the sounds of the riot, or by parents preparing to get out of their homes for fear of what may happen next. They will know other families who have been affected. A walk to the local shop will perhaps involve going past looted shops, burned-out cars or devastated buildings. ...Schools will find themselves on the front line in many of our city districts within a month: they're going to need all the support they can get in dealing with this new reality, whilst remembering their core purpose – to help these kids do the best they can in life without using violent affray to get new trainers.Tell the Guardian about your school's A-level and GCSE achievementsThe Guardian would like to highlight your pupils' GCSE and A-level success this summer.
