The home secretary, John Reid, today denied that plans to expand the use of "talking" CCTV cameras across the country were akin to "Big Brother gone mad".Loudspeakers are being fitted to cameras in 20 areas, allowing CCTV operators to bark commands at people committing antisocial behaviour.An existing scheme in Middlesbrough which has been used to stop vandals and tell litterbugs to pick up their rubbish has received widespread support from locals, Mr Reid said."It helps counter things like litter through drunk or disorderly behaviour, gangs congregating," Mr Reid told GMTV. "They are the sorts of things that make people's lives a misery. Anything that tackles that is better."Council workers in a control centre can monitor pictures from 12 talking cameras in the town, and communicate directly with people on the street at the flick of a switch.The scheme has been criticised by opponents as "Big Brother gone mad".But Mr Reid insisted it was proven to work, and that the communities sharing nearly Â£500,000 in grants to adapt cameras would feel the benefits.Mr Reid denied that this new scheme was being used instead of putting more police officers on the beat.The home secretary said that since 1997 there were 14,000 more police officers, and the Labour government had introduced 11,000 police community support officers and street wardens."We've got more powers than ever before, more resources than ever before. This is just an additional thing," he said."The vast majority of people are pretty decent. But if people persistently refuse to do this we have got pictures, which provide evidence and the police can be called."We hope it doesn't come to that. Again it saves police time and of course it is not a substitute for having police on the beat. It complements it, and it is another way of using technology, which is why we are introducing it to 20 other places."Competitions are being held at schools in many of the areas for children to become the "voice" of CCTV cameras.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "This could be a useful tool against anti-social behaviour, but it is no substitute for having a real police presence on our streets and communities, detecting and deterring crime. People want real policing, not scarecrow policing. "It remains to be seen whether this scheme goes the same way as night courts and cashpoint fines for yobs."
