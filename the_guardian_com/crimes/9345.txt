A former inmate at Feltham young offenders' institution told the Old Bailey today that the brothers accused of murdering Damilola Taylor had admitted during an induction session at the institution last year to stabbing the 10-year-old boy.The 17-year-old witness in the murder trial said that one of the brothers told him he had stabbed Damilola "for a laugh".The witness, who was sentenced to four months for assault and criminal damage, told the court that he was told by one of the brothers about the incident during an induction session for young offenders last February. The other brother listened and smiled as his co-defendant described what they had done.The witness said: "He explained they had done it for a laugh and it was something to do."He said he had asked the brothers why they had been detained."They said murder. I asked them who they had murdered and they said some kid in Peckham," he said."I asked what they had actually done to murder the little kid and they admitted to stabbing him in the leg, leaving him there to bleed." The two brothers, who are now aged 16 but who were 15 at the time of the attack, and a 15-year-old youth deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob.Damilola died in November 2000 after being stabbed with a broken bottle, which severed an artery, while walking home from a library in Peckham.The court heard evidence from two warders at the young offenders institution yesterday. They also said that the brothers had admitted killing Damilola during the induction session last February.
