A cyclist was stabbed to death in one of London's largest parks at mid-morning yesterday.The victim, aged about 50, was on his bike 200 metres inside Richmond park, in the south-west of the city, just after 10am, when his assailant struck. He was taken to hospital and died three hours later. The dead man has been identified, but police were waiting until his next of kin had been informed before releasing his name. A man arrested nearby in connection with the attack has been taken into custody. Detectives closed the 1,000-hectare park, famous for its herds of fallow and red deer, and people inside the grounds at the time of the stabbing were not allowed to leave until they had been questioned. Forensic experts were trawling the crime scene, close to East Sheen Gate. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "The entire park has been closed and we do not know at present when it will reopen." One Richmond resident, who did not want to be named, said: "Although there would have been fewer children around because the schools are back, the park is used by thousands of people every day, from motorists driving through, to dog walkers, runners and cyclists." She said many people in the area had been unsettled by the murder of a French student a few miles from Richmond a fortnight ago. Am√©lie Delagrange, 22, was bludgeoned to death as she took a short cut across Twickenham Green after an evening out with friends. In a separate incident in Salford, Greater Manchester, a woman died and another was severely wounded after they were attacked by a man with a knife early yesterday evening. The two women suffered serious injuries when they were stabbed on Silk Street at 5.35pm. They were taken to Hope Hospital, where one of them later died. The other was in a critical condition last night. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said a man had been arrested and was being questioned.
