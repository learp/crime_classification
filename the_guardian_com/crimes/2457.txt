The government has rejected growing calls for a major overhaul of the law on homicide, including the creation of a US-style offence of first-degree murder, saying it would create a “murder-lite” category for most killings.The justice minister, Oliver Heald, told MPs the government was officially keeping an open mind on the issue, but that the introduction of a three-tier system would mean downgrading most killings to a second-degree category, which the public would not accept.Heald did, however, tell MPs that he wanted to encourage prosecutors to keep using the much-criticised charge of “joint enterprise”, despite a supreme court ruling in February that judges had been misinterpreting a key element of the offence for the past 30 years. So-called joint enterprise laws allow the accomplice to be treated in the same way as the person who committed the deadly act.There have been growing calls for a review of the law on homicide, with MPs and senior legal figures suggesting the current mandatory life sentence for all murders creates injustices and should be scrapped. Heald, a former solicitor-general, told MPs on Wednesday that the government was not going to order a review of the law on homicide. He said there were no gaps in the current law, the public understood it in broad terms, and currently complex cases involving intention to kill or cause gross bodily harm, partial defences or various forms of manslaughter, could not be simplified by a new system.“I think the public would be concerned about a system in which most murders fitted into a second-degree category. The public rightly thinks murder is the most serious and abhorrent crime, and I have a concern about creating a ‘murder-lite’ category,” Heald told the justice select committee.The Law Commission criticised the current law on murder and homicide in England and Wales as a “rickety structure set upon shaky foundations” as long ago as 2005, and proposed a three-tier system of first-degree and second-degree murder and manslaughter.Heald said there was no consensus on the alternative with many other options canvassed, including a four or five-tiered system suggested by the former director of public prosecutions Lord Macdonald, a refined version of the three-tiered system proposed by the Conservative barrister and backbencher Alex Chalk, and a single offence of homicide with sentencing left to the judges’s complete discretion put forward by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC.The Conservative chairman of the justice select committee, Bob Neill, chided Heald for his response and suggested the whole issue had been in the “too difficult to do box”. Neill said it seemed that the “bureaucracy of government can’t be bothered to put its butt into gear to deal with it”. ThThe minster rejected the charge.Heald did, however, try to encourage crown prosecutors to continue to use the joint enteprise charge. He said it was a useful tool and that the supreme court ruling in February had taken the law back to what it was previously.“The judgment makes clear that joint enterprise is not dead and it is still there for prosecutors to use,” Heald said. He suggested that it was important in cases such as one involving two men kicking a third on the ground and being encouraged to do so by another bystander.
