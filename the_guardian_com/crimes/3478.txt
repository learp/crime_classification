A teenager was arrested tonight over the manslaughter of a man with learning difficulties who his neighbours claim was hounded to death by yobs.David Askew, 64, was found dead outside his home in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, last night after police were told youngsters were causing an "annoyance" at his property.It emerged that police and authorities were warned years ago that he was being targeted by gangs.One neighbour said he had been "tormented to death - like bear- baiting".Tonight, Greater Manchester police said an 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the death.Earlier, Askew's mother, Rose, paid tribute to her son, saying he "wouldn't hurt a fly".She said: "Throughout the day I have seen and heard different reports by the press about my son and about what has happened."I just want to say that David was a very happy person. He was kind and thoughtful. He was a true gentleman and would often help me around the house and with shopping."He wouldn't hurt a fly and he never saw bad in anyone. He always put others first."Police were called to his home in Melandra Crescent at 9.37pm yesterday, by which time the youngsters said to be causing a nuisance had fled.Officers found Askew, who lived with his brother, Brian, and mother, who uses a wheelchair, collapsed outside the property.He had not been attacked and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.Askew's neighbour, Avona Davies, 49, said his torment had been going on for some time.The shop worker said: "This has been going on for about 10 years. We have complained to the police and council and they put cameras in their back garden about three years ago."They tormented David for money and cigarettes. They harassed him every night without fail."For the past two or three weeks, the harassment has moved to the front of the house, which never usually happened."Last night it started really early. I got home about 6.30 and it was already happening."We have stopped complaining for about 12 months because nothing gets done."Detectives insisted they had done "everything" possible to protect Askew.Chief Superintendent Zoe Hamilton, of Greater Manchester police, defended the force's involvement with the Askew family.Gangs - some of whom have anti-social behaviour orders for harassing the victim - had launched a "particular spate" of attacks recently, she said."It's a sad fact that, if people are different in a community, sometimes they end up being targeted."I think we have done everything we can. The level of personal involvement my staff and housing officers have had cannot be stressed enough."I would like to make clear we don't believe David's death was the result of a physical attack and we would urge anyone who might have been involved in the incident before or any members of the community who know what happened and who was involved to come forward please."Due to previous police contact with the family, the force has voluntarily made a referral to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, a spokesman said.Results of a postmortem examination are expected tomorrow.
