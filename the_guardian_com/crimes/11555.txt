 A review by an independent police force is to be carried out into the death of a man found crushed in a cement mixer amid claims his murder has been covered up.The family of Lee Balkwell, 33, have always believed the nature of his injuries indicated he was tortured, killed and thrown into a concrete mixer at the farm in Upminster, Essex, where he was working because he crossed members of an organised crime gang.But Essex police, who investigated the death in July 2002, did not charge anyone in connection with murder and said Balkwell's death was an accident. Last year an inquest jury gave a verdict of unlawful killing as a result of gross negligence in relation to the death and today, after years of pressure from Balkwell's father, Les, it was announced that a full inquiry into Essex's handling of the case would be carried out by West Midlands police.The fresh inquiry means the death has been the subject of three separate investigations into allegations that Balkwell was murdered and his killing not properly investigated.The complaints include claims that forensic evidence was not gathered, items destroyed within days of the death, key witnesses not interviewed, and there was interference with the crime scene, the body and the cement lorry itself.It emerged at the inquest that a paramedic, who was one of the first on the scene had written the words: "Foul play?" in his note book. Another medic told the hearing that her first impression was that the scene was suspicious and these beliefs were endorsed by firecrews on the scene.The pathologist used by the police, Dr Michael Heath, has since resigned from the register after being criticised by a disciplinary panel for bungling two post mortem examinations.The review by West Midlands police is to be carried out alongside an inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the allegations. As part of this investigation the IPCC has sent letters to 17 Essex officers warning them they are under investigation. Essex police has in addition had a full review of all the forensic evidence by the Forensic Science Service.The West Midlands inquiry came after the IPCC recommended that an outside force be brought in to reinvestigate Balkwell's death. That request for a full reinvestigation, was refused by Essex police, who would agree only to a review. The IPCC agreed to compromise and the West Midlands was announced as the reviewing force today.
