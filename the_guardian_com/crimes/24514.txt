A man who carried out a catalogue of attacks on girls and women in Kent has been jailed for life.John Guscott, 43, will serve at least 12 and a half years behind bars before being eligible for parole, after being convicted of 47 attacks.He mostly targeted women as they walked alone in the Medway, Whitstable and Sittingbourne areas of Kent between January and November 2014. Detectives said about half his crimes were sex attacks, a quarter were robberies and many of the rest were assaults, on victims aged from 13 to 88.Some of his victims recalled their attacker wearing just one glove. On several occasions Guscott stole victims’ mobile phones for his own use. Searches of his home uncovered several pairs of gloves, hoodies and a yellow T-shirt matching descriptions given by victims and witnesses.Guscott, of Chatham, was found guilty of 37 counts of assault, sexual assault and robbery following a five-week trial, Kent police said. At a second hearing, he admitted a further 10 offences. Sentencing him at Maidstone crown court, a judge ordered him to sign the sex offender register for life.DI Richard Vickery said afterwards: “Guscott was relentless in his offending and left very little for investigating officers to work with in terms of their inquiries. His attacks were random in nature, and in the times and locations they took place, and he was forensically aware as he often wore gloves and balaclavas.”
