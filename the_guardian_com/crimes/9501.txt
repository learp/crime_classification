A former government vet has been convicted of killing a man during an extreme drug-fuelled sadomasochistic sex session.Kirk Thompson burned and cut David Kochs, whom he met online, and caused him severe internal injuries.Thompson, who played a lead role in the response to the bird flu outbreak while he worked at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), then left the body under a duvet and engaged in sex with another man.Newcastle crown court heard both Thompson, 46, and Kochs, 43, had been taking the drug crystal meth when they engaged in the violent episode at the former's flat in the city's Jesmond area in March last year.The jury was told the defendant "enjoyed inflicting pain on others" and that night he boasted on the internet about the kind of activity the two had engaged in.At some point during the evening, Thompson, a former altar boy, became aware that Kochs was either dead or unconscious, and he covered him with a duvet on the floor of his living room.He then had sex with another man he invited round and had also met online as the body of Kochs lay in the flat.The next morning, after the second man had left, Thompson messaged his father and said: "Can you come down immediately, something tragic has happened, just you not Mum please ASAP."On arriving at the flat, his father immediately dialled 999 and paramedics and the police arrived at the scene.After being arrested, Thompson told police the men had engaged in "extreme no limits anything goes sex" but he believed Kochs had been asleep and that was why he covered him with the duvet.The jury found him guilty of manslaughter and causing actual bodily harm.Mr Justice Globe said sentencing would take place tomorrowand told Thompson he should expect a jail term."There is only one sentence that can be imposed and it is a custodial sentence," he said."I will be giving consideration to what it should be and I will hear submissions tomorrow morning."In other evidence, the court heard Thompson had used the Nazi term "SS" in internet messages with potential partners as part of "a silly game".He explained how he had contracted HIV in his third year of his veterinary medicine degree at Edinburgh University, when he was around 22, but did not take a test for a further 10 years.In the meantime, he studied in the US, graduated from Edinburgh, won a scholarship to Oxford and also worked part-time at a local vets in the city.He eventually moved to Defra, based in Whitehall, in 2003 and during the 2004-5 bird flu scare said he worked on guidelines on how to deal with the threat.But he had to leave Whitehall, despite being tipped for the top role of chief vet by his boss, he said, and moved back to north-east England where his parents lived.
