At last, a sensible and well-balanced comment on the Tony Martin affair (Leaders, July 29).I was the Methodist minister at Emneth at the time of the shooting - I chaired the heated meeting in the village hall and observed how much less secure residents felt after an action which was allegedly intended to teach intruders a lesson and re-establish law and order. High gates and fences went up, attitudes polarised and talk of violence escalated, culminating in a Saturday some months later when almost the whole of the shopping centre in the neighbouring town of Wisbech was boarded up, as rumours of marches and reprisals stoked up fears to unprecedented levels. It is to be hoped that those who use this case to advocate a change in the law will consider the consequences before taking action. An unarmed teenager has tragically lost his life. Civilisation takes a step backwards if law is no longer a matter of common assent, but allows an individual to become jury, judge and executioner. We do not believe that stealing a sheep, nor even some valuable antiques, should be a capital offence. In this incident the travelling community has mostly behaved with dignity and restraint. But it is not difficult to see how injustice, revenge, fierce loyalty and unresolved bitterness can be catalysts that lead to lasting feuds and divisions in society that would ultimately threaten the security of us all. Lest anyone concludes that countryside crime is a new phenomenon, I was a young child when, 50 years ago, my new bike was stolen from the Fenland village where I grew up. The village bobby took the serial number, but it was never found. Rev Rachel Larkinson March, Cambs
