Police failings "more than minimally" contributed to the deaths of a pregnant mother and child who were stabbed to death by the woman's former partner days after she went to the police for help, an inquest jury has ruled.Rachael Slack, 38, and her 23-month-old son, Auden, died in 2010, six days after she asked officers from Derbyshire to intervene when her former partner threatened to kill her and take the child.The police had assessed her and her son as being at high risk of homicide at the hands of her ex-partner, Andrew Cairns, but they failed to tell Slack of the danger she was in, or to discuss with her adequate steps that could be taken to better protect them both – failures that the jury found "more than minimally" contributed to their deaths.As the coroner concluded the inquest by warning of an "epidemic" of domestic violence in the UK, Slack's family repeated calls made by victims and relatives of those affected for a public inquiry into how the state fails vulnerable women.The national domestic violence charity Refuge, wants an official inquiry  to investigate why victims of domestic violence are "still not getting the protection they deserve from the police and other state agencies".The family's lawyers told the Guardian they were suing Derbyshire police, mental health services and social services for failing to protect the mother and child. Slack's partner at the time of her death, Robert Barlow, said that "things need to change" in the way such cases were handled.But it was Derbyshire police in particular who were singled out for criticism by the inquest jury in Derby after a six-week hearing. The jury found that mother and son had been unlawfully killed on 2 June 2010 by Cairns, 44, who went on to take his own life.Cairns – who was the father of Auden – stabbed the toddler to death in Slack's cottage in Holbrook, Derbyshire, before turning the knife on her. He then fatally stabbed himself, positioning himself on top of his former girlfriend, the inquest was told. Slack was stabbed 32 times in the chest and back, Auden was stabbed 16 times, and Cairns inflicted 18 stab wounds to his own abdomen.Six days earlier, Slack had gone to the police for help after Cairns threatened her, saying: "You have no idea what I am capable of … I will kill you and take him."Cairns, who had depression, was arrested for threats to kill Slack, only to be released on police bail after a night in custody. A day earlier a psychiatrist had assessed him as at low risk of suicide and no risk to others.Dr Robert Hunter, the coroner for Derby and South Derbyshire, said he would be writing to the home secretary to call for changes in the law giving police greater powers to detain people suspected of domestic and sexual violence.Hayden Slack, Rachael's brother, said he wanted to see a public inquiry into domestic violence: "The space that has been left in our lives by the tragic loss of Rachael and Auden will never be filled and never should be. Rachael was a devoted mother, a beautiful and truly caring person with a positive outlook on life. We hope any failings identified as a result of this inquest will ensure lessons are learned that could protect the lives of other women and children threatened by domestic violence." His lawyer, Sarah Ricca, said: 'The particular tragedy of this case is that the lives of Rachael and Auden were lost after they were both assessed as being at high risk of homicide. Why did this assessment not lead to steps to protect Rachael and Auden?"Karl Smethem, assistant chief constable of Derbyshire, expressed sympathy for Slack's family but said he was confident his force's procedures for the investigation of domestic violence incidents met national guidelines in 2010.He said the force was actively investigating the threats Cairns made to Slack at the time of the deaths adding: "We did take steps to ensure that Rachael and Auden's home was secure." But he said as a result of two reviews the force had "developed and improved" its domestic violence policies and procedures.After the deaths, Derbyshire police referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Its findings will be released later this month.Cairns's family expressed "extreme disappointment" at the failure to provide him with "the proper levels of care".A statement on behalf of his sister, Diane Belshaw, said: "The family feel they and Andrew were totally let down by the mental health trust; he had mental health issues and was arrested under the Mental Health Act just days before."
