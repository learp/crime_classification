A killer who stamped to death a disabled man who used a prosthetic leg has been told he faces life in prison.Roy Bush, 44, was beaten, stamped on and kicked in his flat in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, in March. Liam Campbell, 26, of Barton-on-Humber, was found guilty of murder by a majority verdict of 11 to one after a trial at Teesside crown court. His co-accused, Joe Harrison, 27, of Scunthorpe, admitted the charge.Adjourning the case until Wednesday for sentencing, the judge, Peter Fox, told Campbell: "The sentence, which is life imprisonment, will be passed on the same occasion as that on Joe Harrison."Following the attack, Bush's prosthetic leg was removed as he was stripped. His attackers took it with them along with other property including his mobile phone, and the leg was later dumped and burned with other items in an area known as Clarky's Wood.Campbell claimed his drink had been spiked while socialising with friends, a claim the prosecution dismissed as nonsense. CCTV images showed him acting normally at a pub, playing snooker and chatting, and later counting out change at an off-licence till.Det Supt Dena Fleming, the senior investigating officer, said: "This remains for us a brutal, entirely motiveless attack. I have never known such a vicious act of violence. He was kicked and stamped upon, and had suffered some really horrendous injuries. The fact they took his leg, took his mobile phone and left him for dead is just so callous."Campbell has put Mr Bush's family through a two-week trial. They have been through a particularly awful time. Hopefully now they can have some kind of closure."
