Two high court judges ruled today that the justice secretary, Jack Straw, has the power to pardon a Liverpool supporter whose conviction in Bulgaria over a killing has been called the "most shocking miscarriage of justice in recent times".Mr Justice May and Mr Justice Maddison ruled that Straw could intervene in the case of Michael Shields, who was found guilty in 2005 of attacking a barman at the Big Ben diner in Varna, Bulgaria, a few days after his club triumphed in the Champions League final.Shields, now aged 22, was initially jailed for 15 years in Bulgaria but was transferred to the UK in 2006. The term was cut to 10 years on appeal in Bulgaria and he is serving the remainder at Thorn Cross open prison in Warrington, Cheshire.His lawyers called on the high court to rule that Straw has the power to exercise the ancient "royal prerogative of mercy" even though Shields was convicted abroad.The judges ruled the justice secretary has power under article 12 of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons 1983 "to consider at least granting pardon to Michael Shields on the facts presented to this court".The judges said the Bulgarian judicial process had been concluded but they had been told fresh evidence was not considered by the Bulgarian courts."It is, in our judgment, open to the secretary of state to entertain a request to exercise the royal pregorative," the judges said.The judges added it was for Straw alone – and not the courts – to decide how to exercise his power, meaning Shields does not have an automatic right to his freedom.Shields was holidaying in Varna, a Black Sea resort, after watching Liverpool win the Champions League cup final in Turkey. He was arrested several hours after the attack but has always denied playing any part – insisting he was asleep in his hotel room at the time and was a victim of mistaken identity.His conviction was based solely on identification evidence with no supporting testimony. Another fan, Graham Sankey, signed a confession – later retracted – that he was the one responsible, but the Bulgarian supreme judicial council said the new evidence did not prove anything and merely introduced doubt. David Kirwan, Sankey's solicitor, said his client was prepared to admit responsibility for the attack but only before a British court."The high court judge has ruled that Jack Straw has the jurisdiction to pardon Michael," said the Shields family's lawyer, John Weate. "We hope that he accepts the court's judgment and will now pardon Michael. The Michael Shields case is perhaps the biggest miscarriage of justice in recent times."Shields' family called on Straw to issue a pardon before Christmas.Straw issued a statement saying he would appoint a senior counsel to advise him on the case. "I will ensure this process is undertaken as quickly as possible, and can assure Michael Shields and his family that I will reach a decision on whether to recommend granting a pardon as swiftly as is possible," he said. "While recognising the frustration of Michael Shields's family and his campaign team, I am also duty-bound to work within the law."Shields' father, also called Michael, said his son was 100% innocent "and Mr Straw knows it"."He shouldn't be in jail and I just hope Mr Straw can realise this is all wrong."Straw's lawyers had argued there was was a lack of jurisdiction to grant Shields a free pardon. They warned that if the justice secretary did intervene, it could be seen as criticism of the foreign court that found him guilty.The judges were told that could "drive a very big hole" through the international convention on the transfer of prisoners that allows convicts to serve their sentences in their home countries.The power to pardon is rarely used but is exercised when a person is deemed to be "morally and technically innocent".Hearing an application for judicial review, the high court was told of strong circumstantial evidence supporting Sankey's confession.The judges heard that Shields had passed a lie-detector test. They were told Straw had taken a close interest in the case and had met the Bulgarian justice minister, Miglena Tacheva, to discuss the matter.Shields' mother, Marie, recently met Gordon Brown's wife, Sarah, at 10 Downing Street to discuss her son. She has said the conviction has "taken its toll" on him. "Three and a half years for an 18-year-old to be locked up for a crime he did not commit, it's heartbreaking and it has destroyed him."The bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev James Jones, has described the case as "a travesty of justice"."I have talked and listened to Michael on a number of occasions and I too believe that he is innocent," he said.Shields has the backing of the Liverpool team.
