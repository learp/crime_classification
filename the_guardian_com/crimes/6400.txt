Detectives have arrested five people in connection with the death of a man who was crushed in a concrete mixer 10 years ago in an incident police dismissed at the time as a tragic accident.Lee Balkwell, 33, was found dead at a farm in Upminster, Essex, on 18 July 2002. His head and shoulders were wedged between the drum and chassis of a cement mixer when paramedics arrived on the scene.The ambulance crews on duty that day thought the death was suspicious but police officers from the Essex force took a different view: within 48 hours of the death, the police had told the family of the haulage driver that he had been killed in a freak accident while cleaning the drum of the lorry at 1am.In the last 10 years Balkwell's father, Les, a retired engineer, has campaigned and fought for the death to be reinvestigated. His pressure led the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to mount a full inquiry into the death.Earlier this year, its final report found substantially in Balkwell's favour. It said his son's death was never investigated properly by Essex police, who it said had failed to secure evidence, failed to take statements, and assumed from the beginning the death was an industrial accident."From the outset, it [the police force] was mired in assumption that what had happened to Lee Balkwell was a tragic industrial accident. Officers failed to secure potential evidence, failed to interview potential witnesses and failed to treat the death with an open mind … the all-important first hours of this investigation, where vital evidence must be preserved, had been lost," the report said.As a result of Balkwell's campaign, the IPCC recommended his son's death be reinvestigated by an outside force. Essex police initially refused, instead asking an external force to review their earlier investigation.The review was led by one of Britain's leading homicide officers, Detective Chief Superintendent Dave Mirfield, of West Midlands police, who made more than 90 recommendations about how the case should be re-examined. His report forced Essex police to begin a new criminal inquiry into the circumstances of Lee Balkwell's death, led by detectives from the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate.On Wednesday, officers from the directorate arrested three men and two women in connection with the death.A 43-year-old man from Upminster was arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter, perverting the course of justice and perjury. A 66-year-old man, a 63-year-old woman and a 49-year-old woman – all from Upminster – and a 38-year-old man from Southend were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and perjury. All five were being questioned at a police station in Kent.A spokesman for Kent police said: "The arrests have been made by officers working under the direction of Det Chief Supt Lee Catling from the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate (SCD), who has been investigating the circumstances leading up to Mr Balkwell's death since August 2010."In its final report in January, the IPCC paid tribute to the work of Lee Balkwell's father over the last 10 years in seeking to have the case reinvestigated."Mr Balkwell has campaigned tirelessly to find the truth, whilst also enduring the trauma and grief associated with the loss of a son," the report said. "His persistence and determination have been admirable, but have undoubtedly taken a massive toll on him and his family."
