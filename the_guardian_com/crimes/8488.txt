The trial of two men accused of killing a Northern Ireland police constable has been adjourned because the mother of one of the defendants demanded a change of solicitor.Sharon Wootton is also on trial, charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with the murder.Wootton's son, John Paul, and former Sinn FÃ©in councillor Brendan McConville are charged with murdering Constable Stephen Carroll in Craigavon, Co Armagh in March 2009. The Continuity IRA admitted responsibility for the fatal shooting.Belfast crown court was told that Wootton applied on Tuesday night to change her solicitor. Lord Justice Girvan described the development as "entirely regrettable" but agreed to adjourn proceedings until Friday in order to ensure that the right to a fair trial was fully protected.Constable Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon while responding to an emergency call on 9 March 2009, shortly after two soldiers were killed at Massereene barracks in Antrim.The 48-year-old policeman had been sitting in the driver's seat of his patrol car and was nearing the end of a 12-hour shift.He was the first police officer killed in Northern Ireland since the Royal Ulster Constabulary evolved into the Police Service of Northern Ireland in 2001.McConville, 40, and 20-year-old Wootton are also charged with possession of a firearm and ammunition.A
