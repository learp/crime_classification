Specialist criminal gangs are targeting NHS hospitals to steal medical equipment to sell abroad, according to a report today.In a spate of raids in the past year, which are believed to be linked, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of hi-tech diagnostic equipment has been taken.BBC Online revealed that the NHS security management service is helping police with the investigation and has sent advice to NHS trusts on how to protect valuable equipment. Trusts have been warned to be alert to the theft of specialised equipment such as scanners and endoscopy devices.The raids included the theft last December of endoscopy equipment worth Â£300,000 from York hospital. Endoscopy devices, which are used for internal examinations, were also taken from Leicester general hospital and Freeman hospital in Newcastle.In separate raids, scanners were also stolen from both West Middlesex university hospital and university hospital of North Durham. And last May, cardiovascular equipment was taken from Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge.Det Sgt Judith Smith of North Yorkshire police, who has been liaising with forces across the country, said equipment was probably being sold in eastern Europe and Africa. She told the BBC: "There are quite a few similarities in the cases we have seen. It seems they are organised by groups or a group of individuals who know what they are doing." Paul Gilderdale, a security management specialist at the service, reportedly said: "It certainly seems like hospitals are being targeted by organised criminals. We are getting details of more and more thefts."York hospital chief operating officer, Mike Proctor, told the BBC: "It was not like the normal thefts you see in hospitals, it was much more organised than that."
