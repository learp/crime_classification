Detectives have issued a safety warning after 20 bars of silver bullion coated in cyanide were stolen from a factory. The haul of 1kg bars was taken from an electroplating works in Coventry on Monday after four masked men forced their way into the premises.A solution containing cyanide, which could cause burn-like rashes or even prove fatal if accidentally ingested, had been applied to the bars.DS Dean Jones, from Coventry’s Acquisitive Crime team, said: “The company tell us the solution used for electroplating is extremely toxic. The thieves may not be aware of the danger it poses and the unsuspecting public need to be made aware in case the thieves try to sell the silver on.“If anyone has come into contact with the silver bullion, the immediate advice is to rinse with fresh water and seek medical attention. We are eager to speak to anyone who has been offered a large quantity of silver for sale.”CCTV footage is being reviewed as part of the inquiry into the robbery and detectives are keen to trace a grey BMW used by the offenders.Anyone who can assist the inquiry is urged to call Coventry police on 101 or pass on information anonymously to the Crimestoppers service on 0800 555 111.
