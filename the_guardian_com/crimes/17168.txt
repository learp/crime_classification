A former professional rugby player involved in a family-run, Breaking Bad-inspired crystal meth gang is expected to be sentenced in December, the Metropolitan police have said.Lorenzo Bocchini, 36, appeared at Southwark crown court on Thursday having already pleaded guilty to six drug-related charges stemming from a police raid on his home in the Little Venice area of London in July. His case was adjourned for sentencing on 1 December.Bocchini’s brother Alessandro, 45, and his wife, Justine Bocchini, 33, who were arrested in November last year, were jailed for six and four years respectively last month after pleading guilty to drug offences including possession with intent to supply crystal meth. During the July raid, officers unearthed a home laboratory and drugs with a street value of £200,000 including crystal meth, some of which was dyed blue in an apparent homage to a practice adopted by dealers in the TV show Breaking Bad.The Bocchinis claimed to run a high-end lighting company but Scotland Yard said CCTV footage of their home office taken hours before their arrests showed a group counting thousands of pounds of loose cash out of carrier bags.Financial analysis revealed £100,000 had been funnelled through the couple’s bank accounts in the six months before their detainment, police said.Samson Mebrahtru, 42, a minicab driver used by the dealers to courier drugs, was given a suspended prison term last month for his role in the scheme.Lorenzo Bocchini played as a prop for Italian sides, including in the Heineken Cup, during a career spanning from 2003 until 2010.
