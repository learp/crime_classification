It seems as though we may never know how many elected politicians have been monitored by the police's 'domestic extremism' unit.And the reason? Police say that they have not counted how many there are.In response to a freedom of information request from the Guardian, Scotland Yard said that the national 'domestic extremism' unit "has not conducted any research to count how many elected politicians are currently recorded in any way in its files."We know that at least two elected politicians have been monitored by the unit - Jenny Jones, the Green Party's candidate for mayor of London at the last election, and Ian Driver, a Green Party councillor in Thanet, Kent. (Read this and this for more background)The pair only found out through their own efforts. They submitted requests under the data protection act to get copies of the files held on them by the unit, which is run by Scotland Yard.The documents showed that the police had kept a log of the political movements of Jones, a London assembly member, over an 11-year period while she sat on the official committee scrutinising the Metropolitan Police.The file included a tweet she sent about possible police tactics at a pro-cycling protest, and details of public meetings she addressed about issues including police violence and Conservative cuts in public spending.The file on Driver recorded 22 occasions on which he helped organise public meetings and demonstrations about animal exports and gay marriage between June 2011 and June last year.The way is still open, however, for other politicians to lodge a request under the data protection act to find out if the police have been keeping files on them. (This here and here gives guidance on how to submit requests).And there's another sensitive question that police chiefs can't (or perhaps don't want) to answer.The police have been recording the political activities of thousands of political activists. They say they are doing this in order to identify individuals who have broken, or are about to break, the law in order to promote their political aims.However a number of individuals, such as 89-year-old pensioner John Catt, have complained that the Met's 'domestic extremism' unit has been logging their political movements, even though they have no criminal record. Both Jones and Driver have not committed any crime.Last year, Jones asked Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police commissioner how many many people on the database kept by the national 'domestic extremist' unit had no criminal record.Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Greany, the unit's co-ordinator, replied :"The system is not designed to search for how many criminal records exist. This information is also often changing and therefore I am unable to provide that particular detail."Still, it's worth bearing in mind what one of his predecessors, Anton Setchell, said when he conceded that protesters with no criminal record were recorded in the files."Just because you have no criminal record does not mean that you are not of interest to the police. Everyone who has got a criminal record did not have one once."
