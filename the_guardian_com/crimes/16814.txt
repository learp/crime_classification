The fastest speeding motorist ever caught in Britain was jailed for 10 weeks today after he admitted driving a Porsche at 172mph.Tim Brady, of Harrow, north-west London, was caught in a random speed check as he drove a £98,000 3.6-litre 911 Turbo, Oxford crown court heard. Brady was also given a three-year driving ban and ordered to pay £474 costs."Your driving was criminally self-indulgent and utterly thoughtless of the danger you might be creating for the innocent," Judge David Morton Jack said.In January, 33-year-old Brady was stopped by a police constable with a speed gun on the A420 near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The court heard how he said at the time: "Oh shit, oh shit, I've lost my job."Brady resigned from his job as a delivery driver at Helphire, a luxury car hire firm with a base at Kingston Bagpuize, near to where he was caught, shortly after the incident.He had taken the Porsche from his workplace without permission on January 27, the court was told.John Reilly, representing Brady, said in mitigation that his client had later described his 172mph drive as "foolhardy, stupid and done in a moment of weakness".Police were attending to another motorist who had been doing 115mph on the same stretch of road when Brady was caught, the court heard.Experts said a Porsche of this type, travelling as it was at 77 metres per second, would have needed 501 metres in which to stop. Brady, who was driving a colleague, managed to stop in 681 metres with the car wobbling due to the heavy braking, police said.A staggered crossroads, parking layby areas and a pedestrian access were among the hazards on the stretch of dual carriageway.Brady had asked his boss, Bill Maclachan, whether he could take the Porsche out on the previous day but was repeatedly told he could not, the court heard.He then returned the next day - his day off - and took the car out, claiming his boss "did not say no to that idea" the day before.Mr Reilly said that, although Brady had been refused permission to take the vehicle for a spin, employees at the firm often drove such cars."It was not company policy but sometimes blind eyes were turned," he told the court. "It was almost an allurement that went with the job. He won't be able to find employment for a number of years doing what he likes to do, which is driving."Brady, who admitted dangerous driving at a hearing last month, was told he would have to sit an extended driving test before taking to the road in the future.His parents, with whom he has been living in Harrow since losing his job, were in court to see him sent down.The previous record for the fastest car clocked by a speed camera to result in a conviction was 156mph in 2003, when Jason McAllister, a car dealer, was caught on the A90 between Aberdeen and Dundee.The fastest convicted speeder in Britain was Daniel Nicks, a motorcyclist who filmed himself travelling at 175mph on a Honda Fireblade in 2000. He was jailed for six weeks and banned for two years.
