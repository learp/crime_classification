A woman was found guilty today of attempting to murder her husband by putting anti-freeze in his curry.Kate Knight's husband, Lee, fell into a coma for 16 weeks and was left blind and deaf after she poisoned his food and wine on their 7th wedding anniversary in April 2005. He also suffered brain and liver damage. A Stafford crown court jury took eight hours to convict the 28-year-old from Meir Hay, Stoke-on-Trent, after a three-week trial. The court had heard Knight stood to receive Â£250,000 on her husband's death and was hoping to clear mounting debts. Lee Knight told the court he knew nothing of loans, taken out by his wife in 2003 and 2004, which motivated her desire to kill him and claim a windfall from his employer. She had confided in her neighbour, Sarah Johnson, who initially dismissed her talk as attention seeking. But when Johnson found out Lee Knight had been in intensive care for three weeks she went to the police. Knight denied murder. She claimed her marriage was an unhappy and violent one. The court heard how she had hoped her husband's death would be blamed on his heavy drinking. She used the internet to find a method of killing, settling on anti-freeze after considering using ecstasy or iron tablets. Judge Simon Tonking told Knight: "I will be imposing a very considerable term of imprisonment." In a statement read outside court by a Staffordshire police spokesman, Lee Knight said he had "hardly any independence" anymore and had lost "everything I worked for". He also expressed his concern about the impact on their son."Kate has ruined my life and what she has done will have a big effect on [our son's] future," he said.DC Martin Smith described it as a "cowardly crime" which had "tragically affected" Lee Knight.
