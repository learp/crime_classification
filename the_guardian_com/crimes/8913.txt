Detectives hunting the killers of two women at a premises that they believe may have been a brothel today appealed for drinkers at a nearby pub to come forward.The bodies of the women were discovered lying next to each other on the floor of Rachaels Massage in the Frankwell area of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, at 2.45am on Sunday.Both of the women, one in her 20s and the other in her 40s, had suffered severe head injuries. They have not yet been formally identified.Today, Detective Chief Inspector Sheila Thornes, from West Mercia police, urged a number of people seen drinking in the neighbouring Wheatsheaf pub to speak to police.She said: "We believe there are a further 30 or so drinkers who were at the pub on Saturday evening that we need to speak to. In particular, at least four people - two men and two women - remained in the pub's beer garden after the premises closed."She said officers thought that the two male drinkers, both thought to be aged in their 40s, initially sat on their own but may have started chatting to the two women drinkers.Ms Thornes said: "One of the men was wearing a purple bandanna and said he had taken part in some kind of pirate re-enactment."We also believe a number of cricket players were in the Wheatsheaf following a match between Quayside cricket club and a team from Wellington."She said Frankwell was a busy part of Shrewsbury, one of the main routes into the town, and the murder scene premises has its front on the main road.She said the period officers were interested in stretched from around midday on Saturday up until the bodies were found early yesterday morning.The bodies were discovered in the same downstairs room, lying near a door. The alarm was raised by two passersby who flagged down a passing police vehicle.Ms Thornes said: "There are many people passing this spot on foot and in vehicles at all times of the day and night and we desperately want to hear from anyone who saw or heard anything which might be connected to this dreadful incident."Postmortem tests on the women are due to be carried out later today.Forensic officers are still examining the building and surrounding area. House-to-house inquiries are continuing and more checks will be made on local CCTV footage. More than 40 officers are involved in the investigation.
