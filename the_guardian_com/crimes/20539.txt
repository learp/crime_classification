The former Labour MP for Bury North, David Chaytor, will challenge his 18-month jail sentence for falsely claiming more than Â£22,000 in parliamentary expenses. An application for leave to appeal will be heard at the appeal court next month. Chaytor, 61, a former lecturer, initially denied the charges but pleaded guilty at London's Southwark crown court to three counts of false accounting between November 2005 and January 2008. The fraud involved bogus documents to support claims for IT services and renting homes in London and his Bury North constituency.
