I was advised this morning and I have heard some evidence about it in your absence to confirm that he is deceased.“You are thus discharged of course from any further deliberation in this case and an appropriate order will be made.“I can see from your faces that comes as quite a shock. It came as a shock to me this morning.”Earlier, a detective from Humberside police confirmed Heald’s death.Detective Chief Inspector Matthew Baldwin told the court: “At 10.40 hours this morning I attended I wing at Hull prison where I saw a male I know to be John Heald.“I can confirm that he is deceased having hanged himself during the night.”A Prison Service spokesman said: “John Heald was found unresponsive in his cell at Hull prison at about 5.50am today.“Paramedics attended but he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.“Every self-inflicted death is a tragedy and we make strenuous efforts to learn from each one.“As with all deaths, the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.”The trial heard that Heald stabbed Carter in the chest and stamped on her face before locking her body in a bedroom at the Morayland Hotel in Bridlington.
