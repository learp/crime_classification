Overall crime in England and Wales fell by 3% in the third quarter of last year despite a sharp rise in the number of robberies involving knives, Home Office statistics published today showed.The figures showed a continuing decline in the levels of vehicle-related theft, criminal damage, violent crime and sexual offences between July and September last year compared with a year earlier.But they revealed that the number of domestic burglaries recorded by police rose by 4% in the same period, the number of robberies involving knives leapt by 18%, drug offences were up by 9% and the level of fraud and forgery shot up by 16%.Ministers had previously warned that the economic downturn was likely to fuel an increase in so-called "acquisitive crimes" such as burglary and robbery. Unemployment rose 140,000 to 1.82 million in the same period – July, August and September – reaching an 11-year high."Today's statistics show overall crime is stable and the risk of being a victim remains historically low," the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said."Since 1997, crime has fallen by 39% and violence is down by 40%."I welcome the figures which show that overall recorded violent crime is down 6%. Knife crime remains a concern, particularly for young people."The Conservative home affairs spokesman, Chris Grayling, highlighted the categories in which crime had risen, describing them as a "harsh consequence of Gordon Brown's economic downturn"."This is made worse because the home secretary clearly has no idea how to deal with this credit crunch crime wave," he added."It is particularly alarming that robberies involving knives have soared and that fatal stabbings are at an all-time high. The government's complacency in this area is proving fatal."The figures do not include a detailed breakdown on many violent crimes, including rape, murder and serious assault. These are being excluded from official statistics until the summer because of a row over their undercounting by police forces.The names of the 18 police forces that wrongly categorised offences, downgrading those where there was an intention to cause serious injury but none was inflicted, were released today.The country's largest forces may have been misreporting such figures for more than 10 years, a Freedom of Information request revealed.The full list identifies the forces as Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Cleveland, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Humberside, Kent, Lancashire, Norfolk, North Wales, North Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Thames Valley and the Metropolitan police.The undercounting came to light last October when quarterly crime figures for the 43 forces in England and Wales were published.The figures revealed a 22% jump in the number of serious violent crimes over the previous year.Ian Johnston, the chief constable of the British Transport police, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on statistics, played down the significance of the omission."This does not affect the overall violent crime figure. The overall violent crime figure remains robust," he said."What this does do is affect a small subset – a very important one indeed – that represents about 2% of overall violent crime," he told the BBC."We do want as accurate data as we can get. Changes in the data set don't help us to achieve that aim, but they sometimes, like the injury/non-injury changes, are quite helpful to the public to understand the picture."The idea of separating out injury from non-injury violent crime, which they have done this time, I think actually is a good move ... the public do want to understand that many assaults – in fact, more than half in the violent crime figures – don't actually cause any injury to people.Johnston said no measures were perfect, but overall figures gave a good picture of crime levels."Many crimes aren't reported to us," he added. "Punch-ups in pubs don't get in the crime statistics. The British crime survey doesn't cover people who are under 16."Ministers have asked the police inspectorate to examine the way in which the 43 forces in England and Wales collect their data.
