A writer who plotted to have his mother's lover murdered was arrested when the men he thought were hired killers turned out to be undercover policemen, a court heard today."I need him dead," Charles Hills told the supposed hitmen at a meeting, adding: "I just hope you aren't police," the Old Bailey was told.The 51-year-old, of Clapham, south London - who has previously written for the New Statesman and the Guardian - admitted two counts of soliciting to murder Flavio Rosa.The court was told that Hill hatched his plot to have Mr Rosa killed in a Â£15,000 hit because of a bitter dispute over his mother's will.When she died in 2002, Hills was left her villa in the Algarve region of Portugal - but the will stipulated that Mr Rosa, a handyman in his 50s, should be allowed to live there for the rest of his life.The court heard that Hills told the undercover police his reasons for wanting Mr Rosa dead, saying: "He moved in with my mother at her house and gradually took over her affairs."Finally they had sex together, even though he was a young man, and he persuaded her to leave him this [the house]."He is my bitterest enemy, this guy. He took my mother from me, he took my house from me."Duncan Penny, prosecuting, said Hills had two meetings with the policemen, telling them the murder should ideally look like an accident and Mr Rosa's body should be dumped in Spain to complicate the investigation."I am not a natural born killer but I can't get him out any other way," Hills told the officers. "I need him dead."Mr Penny also read from a journal written by Hills entitled The Son's Story Number One. In it, Hills wrote: "Apart from vague thoughts of hiring a hitman, there was not much to do during those months."Hills was arrested when he failed to turn up for a third meeting with the undercover officers and claimed to have given up his plan.Sangita Modgil, representing Hills, said the crime was a "cry for help" and had not been intended for financial gain but was the result of a sense of betrayal.She said Hills suffered from obsessional compulsive disorder, adding: "His mental health took a severe turn for the worse over the course of the last three or four years."Hills was remanded in custody for sentencing on Monday.
