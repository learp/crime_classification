The Crown Prosecution Service today defended its decision to free on bail a man accused of rape who then sexually assaulted and murdered a young mother six days later.Christopher Braithwaite, 22, had been in police custody facing possible rape charges when prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to hold him and advised police to release him.Six days later the crack addict, who has a string of previous convictions including one for wounding, stabbed Stacey Westbury, 23, to death in her own home during a sex attack.Today, after an Old Bailey judge sentenced Braithwaite to serve a minimum of 30 years for murder and sexual assault, a spokesman for the CPS explained why police released him."We thoroughly considered all the grounds for keeping him in police custody and advised that, on the information available, he be given police bail pending further evidence," said the spokesman.He said that prosecutors were aware of Braithwaite's previous offences at the time but still decided there was insufficient evidence to charge him.The rape is one of nine other charges committed against two women by Braithwaite which have not been brought to court because it would not be in the public interest to prosecute him for those charges.The other of Braithwaite's victims came forward after reading about his arrest for Stacey Westbury's murder. Earlier today, the Old Bailey heard of the anguish suffered by Westbury's father since he discovered his daughter's body.Ken Westbury said losing his daughter Stacey was "worse than a thousand heart attacks" and memories of that day would haunt him for the rest of his life. His words were read out at the Old Bailey after Braithwaite admitted sexually assaulting and murdering the young woman he knew from school.Westbury said he was overwhelmed by guilt that he was not there to protect the "little girl" he doted on. He said it was impossible to describe what it felt like to lose a daughter "in such violent and obscene circumstances"."I feel so guilty that I was not there to protect my little girl. This feeling overwhelms me and tears me to pieces inside every day. Any father who has lost a daughter like this will carry the same guilt forever, no matter how unreasonable it seems"."I thank God that [Stacey's son] Kayden is too young to understand fully, but one day in the future we will have to tell him. That is a date I dread."All this pain I carry with me every day and will do until I die."Braithwaite attacked and murdered Stacey in her flat on August 15 last year while she was alone with her 10-month-old son. She was discovered later that day by her father sprawled bloodied and semi-naked on her sofa.Braithwaite was arrested 24 hours later. A 35cm (14in) knife used in the attack was found in a nearby drain.Victor Temple QC, prosecuting told the court the crime was "a particularly grave sexually motivated murder".Oliver Blunt QC, defending, said Braithwaite was suffering from a personality disorder, worsened by his use of drugs."Anybody who is behaving under the amount of crack cocaine that this defendant was abusing at the time is clearly not behaving rationally or sensibly. He cannot offer any sensible explanation," Blunt said.The victim's mother walked out of court as Braithwaite was described as being from a "somewhat disadvantaged family".The court heard Stacey's son now had nightmares and became hysterical if strangers came to the house.Braithwaite pleaded guilty to murder and sexual penetration without consent.Katherine Rake, the director of the Fawcett Society, said the case demonstrated the damage done when allegations of rape were not taken seriously enough."The fact Braithwaite was released on bail despite having had a series of rape charges brought against him in the past shows that criminal justice agencies have utterly failed to implement adequate safeguards. "Research shows that in many cases police do not even check suspects' records for previous sexual offences before discontinuing rape investigations. There is an urgent need for the government to do more to ensure that better evidence is collected and acted upon when dealing with rape cases."
