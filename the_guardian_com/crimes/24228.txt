Vandals armed with explosives have restarted a dangerous campaign of blowing up parking meters in a historic market town.Fourteen machines have been attacked in Lewes, East Sussex, since mid-September, causing more than £20,000 of damage.Police chiefs and councillors are amazed no one has been injured and warned whoever is responsible that they could face jail.The town has been targeted by vandals systematically blowing up meters in the past. The campaign started in 2004 after the local council introduced on-street parking charges to ease congestion in the narrow streets.In the two years that followed, the culprits caused £300,000 of damage by destroying more than 200 meters, leading to higher permit charges and increased pay and display parking costs for residents and visitors.Now it appears the campaign has intensified again, with one machine completely destroyed. No money has been stolen from the machines, which are valued at about £3,000 each.A reward of £1,250 has been put up by East Sussex council, Sussex police and Lewes district council.Chief Inspector Natalie Moloney said: "I can't believe anyone would be so reckless as to carry out such potentially dangerous acts. I'm amazed someone hasn't been injured."Carl Maynard, the county council's economy, transport and environment spokesman, said: "Whoever committed this mindless crime should know they risk jail."As well as the potential to seriously injure a passer-by, this vandalism costs the people of Lewes, who will end up footing the bill."Repairs will cost at least £20,000, which means we are £20,000 further away from being able to put any surplus from the scheme toward transport improvements in the town."
