Three British tourists have been arrested in Cyprus after a teenage soldier based on the island was stabbed to death following a reported fight at a nightclub in Ayia Napa, the turbulent seaside resort which UK troops have long been ordered to avoid.Georgios Economou, a spokesman for police in Cyprus, said a fight took place in a nightclub during the early hours of Sunday between four British soldiers and three British tourists, during which one of the holidaymakers allegedly produced a knife and stabbed the 19-year-old.The Ministry of Defence confirmed later on Sunday that the soldier had died. A spokesman said: "It is with great sadness that the MoD must confirm that a soldier from 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers has died in an incident in Cyprus."An investigation is being conducted by Cyprus police and it would be inappropriate to comment any further. The family has been informed and our thoughts are with them."The MoD said the incident took place in a part of Ayia Napa officially off limits for British soldiers because of past trouble.A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are aware of the arrest of three British nationals in Ayia Napa and we are providing consular assistance."Ayia Napa, on the south-eastern edge of the Mediterranean island, is popular with younger tourists and its pub and nightclub scene has a reputation for chaos, excessive drinking, drug use and intermittent violence.British soldiers have been banned from pubs and clubs at the centre of the resort since 1994 when Louise Jensen, a 23-year-old Danish tour guide, was abducted, raped and beaten to death by three British soldiers from a local base.The soldiers were sentenced to life for the killing, reduced to 25 years on appeal on the grounds that they were too drunk to have planned the attack. The men were released in 2006, despite the protests of Jensen's family.In 2008 Ayia Napa's mayor imposed his own ban on British troops visiting the area after a series of violent incidents. Nine soldiers had been accused of trashing a bar in the resort during a mass brawl, although they were later acquitted by a Cypriot court.The servicemen were celebrating finishing tours of Iraq and Afghanistan as well as their imminent return to the UK.About 3,000 British military personnel are stationed in Cyprus at two bases which remained UK sovereign territory after the island gained independence in 1960.The dead soldier was reportedly from the Dhekelia base, in the east of the island.
