A burglar bailed on condition that he lived in his parents' garden shed was getting used to larger but less comfortable surroundings yesterday.Andrew Bidmead, 27, was transferred to jail in Exeter after the city's crown court heard that he had carried on shoplifting from his end-of-garden retreat. Recorder Brian Lett told him that the unusual experiment ordered after Bidmead's parents said that they would not have him in their house had clearly failed. "You have demonstrated an unwillingness to reform yourself. This is a serious offence and only custody can be justified." Bidmead, who is 27 and steals to feed his heroin addiction, was sent to the shed in Truro, Cornwall, by Judge John Neligan last month, after he was convicted of using his post as a security guard at Alldays store in Exeter to rob the shop. He was caught by DNA matches with bloodstains he left after cutting himself while easing out a metal security grille. The shed was chosen as his mini-bail hostel after his parents told the judge that they wanted to support him, so long as he did not have to share their home. Recorder Letts was told yesterday that Bidmead had carried out three further shoplifting raids since the bail condition was imposed pending sentence for his original stealing of Â£350 cash. He was sentenced to 15 months for the thefts and for breaching a probation order. Nick Bradley, defending, said Bidmead's life was in chaos. He said: "His parents remain supportive of him but they are frustrated by his inability to address his drug addiction."
