A teenager was today given the legal right to challenge one of the key planks of the government's antisocial behaviour agenda.The high court judge decided, in what is being seen as a landmark ruling, that the 15-year-old boy - known only as "W" - can challenge the legality of child curfew zones created by the government in a bid to crack down on antisocial behaviour. Two high court judges granted "W" a declaration that the police have no power to use force to remove young people to their homes under the legislation.  Lord Justice Brooke and Mr Justice Mitting, sitting at the high court in London, said: "If parliament considered that such a power was needed, it should have said so, and identified the circumstances in which it intended the power to be exercised."The Richmond teenager, who has the backing of the human rights group Liberty, and who was described in court as a "model student", had argued that the "anti-yob" legislation should not be used to penalise innocent young people.He went to the high court in May challenging the decision by the Metropolitan police to create two child "dispersal areas" where he lives in the London borough of Richmond upon Thames.The boy had argued that the curfew regime violated his rights to liberty under four articles of the European convention on human rights.But the Home Office disagreed, arguing that he had no standing to bring a claim as he has not been stopped by police and deprived of his liberty inside a dispersal area.  In a statement after the ruling, the teenager said: " Of course I have no problem with being stopped by the police if I've done something wrong. But they shouldn't be allowed to treat me like a criminal just because I'm under 16."The Home Office said that it would be appealing against the decision.It said in a statement that the ruling did not affect those curfew zones already created under the legislation or prevent further zones being created in the future. Police would still be able to disperse groups, it said. But the Home Office said the ruling did affect the police ability to use the law to take children home.The statement said: "We believe the police should have reasonable force to take children home otherwise the police cannot do anything if children refuse to be taken home."Alex Gask, the Liberty legal officer who is acting for "W", said: "This is a victory for the presumption of innocence and the right of everyone, no matter what their age, not to be subjected to coercive powers without good cause." Â· Campaigners are lobbying the Home Office this evening for a change in the law which governs the issue of antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos).Members of Asbo Concern will present a dossier to the home secretary, Charles Clarke, of 100 Asbos that the group claims are either inappropriate or ludicrous.The dossier includes the case of an autistic boy who was given an Asbo that banned him from staring over his neighbour's fence, and the case of a woman with suicidal tendencies who was issued with an Asbo ordering her to stay away from railway bridges and rivers.Asbo Concern was launched in April and its members include trade unions, politicians and academics working in youth justice and social care. The group wants to see the antisocial behaviour legislation reviewed on the grounds that it was ill thought out and is being used inappropriately.
