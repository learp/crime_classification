A newlywed husband murdered his wife and hid her body in a garage while he continued an affair, a court has heard.Michael Roberts, 27, allegedly bound his 25-year-old wife Victoria's body with duct tape and dumped her in the garage of their home in Daresbury, Cheshire, beneath a duvet.Liverpool crown court heard today how, on the day after he killed her, he had told his friends their marriage was over.Roberts allegedly murdered his wife last November, a month after she confronted him over two affairs, the court heard. The couple had married only five months earlier. The court was told that in November 2008 he had begun an affair with Kerrie Hall, a work colleague at a Phones4U shop where he was assistant manager.The affair continued after his wedding. Hall told detectives that on a number of occasions he applied pressure to her neck during sex, causing bruising. Last April he began an affair with another colleague, Karen Wilson. He met his friend Lavinia Tolley for a shopping trip in Chester the day after his wife died, and told her that his marriage was over. Tolley said today that shortly before he was arrested, on 6 December, she urged him to hand himself in to police.The court was told that in the days after his wife was killed, he told her colleagues she had gone to Bradford on business. He took Wilson to a pub in north Wales for a meal where the landlord recalled them being "loved up and all over each other", said David Steer QC, opening the prosecution case. The next day he bought refuse bags, car sponges, insulation and duct tape to bind his wife's body, said Steer.By 2 December last year, Roberts's parents were becoming concerned about her disappearance. Her father, Graham Wynne-Jones, reported his daughter missing and police found the body in the garage. Roberts escaped from police, but was arrested after he fled to Liverpool and later checked into a hotel in Chester.Roberts denies murder. The trial continues.
