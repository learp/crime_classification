The chief constable of Humberside came under renewed pressure last night after it emerged he was twice told not to blame the Data Protection Act for the deletion of records on the Soham killer Ian Huntley.David Westwood ignored the warnings of two senior figures and issued a statement just hours after Huntley's conviction for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, saying that the files had been deleted to comply with the law. The revelations came as the men responsible for enforcing the act gave evidence to the Bichard inquiry investigating how Huntley slipped through the police net. It was only after he was found guilty last December that it emerged that sex allegations were made against him when he lived in Grimsby - and that Humberside police had wiped all the records. Mr Westwood said he had misinterpreted the advice of the UK assistant information commissioner, David Smith, before releasing his statement. Mr Smith told the inquiry that he had discussed the matter with Terence Grange, the chief constable of Dyfed Powys police and the Association of Chief Police Officers' sexual offences representative, who was also against Westwood blaming the act. Mr Smith said: "I advised David Westwood that we could not accept that either our office or the act was to blame for the premature deletion of records by Humberside police." The information commissioner, Richard Thomas told the inquiry: "I will not disguise from you the sense of relief that it was accepted in this particular case _ [that the chief constable] now fully accepts that neither the legislation nor my office were in any way responsible for the deletion of these critical records." ·Cambridgeshire police have asked the Home Office for a further £1.4m on top of £3.5m already given to help cover the cost of the massive investigation into the Soham murders
