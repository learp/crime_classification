A police child protection officer has admitted using thousands of images of child pornography, some involving babies, and pleaded guilty to charges of sending hundreds of abusive images from his home computer.At the high court in Glasgow Iain Duncan, 28, of Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow, admitted downloading more than 3,300 indecent photographs of children and 20 films - including one video with graphic images of babies being abused.The former police officer, who has already resigned from Strathclyde police, was caught after police in Surrey uncovered an email address he had been using. When he was arrested Duncan had just started working for a family protection unit in Glasgow.The court was told by the prosecutor, Advocate Depute John Scullion, that Duncan's identity was uncovered after police had raided the address of an abuser in Surrey, and found his email address among others.After being confronted by fellow officers from Strathclyde in January, Duncan initially denied having pornographic images on his home computers. Investigations revealed he had downloaded more than 3,000 images and films, and was part of a network of 10 to 20 men. Among the films was a 6Â½-minute video which showed abuse of infants. "This video includes information on how to perform such abuse and on how best to disguise such activity," Scullion said.At the end of his police interview Duncan had said: "I know what I have done is wrong. I am sorry and ashamed."Sentencing was deferred until May. The judge, Lord Turnbull, told Duncan, who is on remand in Barlinnie prison, that he would be registered as a sex offender.
