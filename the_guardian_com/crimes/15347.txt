A woman found guilty of murdering her boyfriend by stabbing him in the heart has been jailed for at least 17 years.Emma-Jayne Magson, 23, plunged a steak knife into the chest of 26-year-old James Knight before placing it in a bin belonging to the victim’s brother.Magson was described as “cold, brutal and manipulative” for delaying medical help to her dying boyfriend and in effect “sacrificing” him, Leicester crown court heard.The judge, Nicholas Dean QC, handed Magson a life sentence with a minimum of 17 years after she was convicted on Friday. He said: “This was an act in impulse and anger. Her behaviour is not at all easy to understand.”During the three-week trial, the court heard that the couple – who were in a “volatile” relationship – had been involved in a drunken row in the run-up to the fatal attack at Magson’s house in Leicester on 27 March.The court was played a 999 call Magson made some time after she struck the fatal blow, saying Knight had collapsed but failing to mention he had been stabbed.When she was told an ambulance might be delayed, Magson replied: “No, that’s fine, don’t worry about it.”
