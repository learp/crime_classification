Kenneth Noye has been recommended for transfer to an open prison, the parole board has said.Noye, 68, stabbed electrician Stephen Cameron, 21, to death in a road-rage attack in 1996.He went on the run after the murder on the M25 in Kent but was captured in Spain in 1998 and jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 16 years in 2000.A parole board spokeswoman said: “We can confirm that a panel of the board has not directed the release of Kenneth Noye but has recommended to the Ministry of Justice that he is suitable for a move to open conditions. It is up to the Ministry of Justice whether or not to accept this recommendation.” She added: “In considering a recommendation for open conditions, the parole board is required to make a balanced assessment of the risks and benefits of such a move; the emphasis should be on risk to the public. “A prisoner can be returned to closed conditions at any time if there are adverse developments that make it no longer safe for the prisoner to be held in open conditions.” In a previous incident, career criminal Noye stabbed an undercover officer to death outside his mock-Tudor mansion, after the £26m Brink’s-Mat bullion heist, but successfully pleaded self-defence.
