Simon Turner, 41, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, and Dane Garside, a 42-year-old from Coventry, were found guilty on Monday of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Malcolm Bull, a 53-year-old road sweeper from Milton Keynes, was found guilty yesterday of murder and possessing a shotgun. The remaining defendants, who each deny murder and possessing a shotgun, are Karl Garside, 45, and Ian Cameron, 46, both from Coventry.
