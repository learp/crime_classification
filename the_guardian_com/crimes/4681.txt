In allowing the media to report that Gary Dobson and David Norris will stand trial at the Old Bailey in November for the murder in 1993 of Stephen Lawrence, the court of appeal has recognised the public interest in open justice.The application by the prosecution to quash the earlier acquittal of Dobson was covered by reporting restrictions. So was the fact that David Norris was arrested last September and charged with murder.It would have been possible for the courts to have maintained the restrictions on naming the two defendants until the trial. But the court of appeal chose not to, while reminding the media that Dobson – and, of course, Norris – are "presumed in law to be innocent".In addition to warning the media not to prejudice the forthcoming trial, the court made a detailed order setting out aspects of the case that cannot be reported ahead of it. Inevitably, the terms of that order are themselves covered by reporting restrictions. But it seems safe to report that the order made by the court applies not only to the mainstream media but also to social networking sites such as Twitter.The full reasons for quashing Dobson's acquittal run to nearly 100 paragraphs. They cannot be published until his trial has been concluded.But the court has released a 17-paragraph judgment that is remarkable for its detail. It explains that the application for Dobson's retrial depended on the reliability of new scientific evidence relating to two items of his clothing.The court said that "if reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent application can be discerned".It was argued by Dobson's counsel that "this evidence is unreliable and of no sufficient probative value, just because the results of the new examination of Dobson's clothing are likely to be the product of contamination over the years".Timothy Roberts QC also argued that a jury would be prejudiced by past publicity.But the court concluded that there was "sufficient reliable and substantial new evidence to justify the quashing of the acquittal and to order a new trial".Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the case is that although hearings have been taking place over several months in open court the reporting restrictions have not been breached. Those who believe that court orders are inevitably breached and you can find out pretty much anything these days on the internet will have to revise their opinions.*This article was amended on Wednesday 18 May at 14.48 to correct a typing error
