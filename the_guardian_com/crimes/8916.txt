A man has been charged with the murder of a 77-year-old woman who was battered to death with a hammer. Graeme Jarman, 47, of Consett, County Durham, will appear at Newcastle magistrates court on Wednesday. He was arrested after a nationwide manhunt following the discovery of Judith Richardson's body in the hallway of her home, where she lived alone, in Hexham, Northumberland, on 19 August. Richardson's handbag was found dumped in a bin 25 miles away in Newcastle, and Northumbria police officers initially believed they were dealing with a case of lost property or theft, until they found her body.
