The five-week hunt for the body of the Jobcentre worker Joanne Nelson, 22, who disappeared on St Valentine's Day, had its first result yesterday with the discovery of her handbag beside a railway line.Forensic scientists are checking the bag, which was close to a flyover, less than a mile from her home in Hull. A wood machinist, Paul Dyson, 30, also of Hull, has been charged with her murder, but detectives have been frustrated in their attempt to find her body. Detailed descriptions of a site where it is thought to be buried have been given to farmers and landowners. Humberside police made a further appeal for help after finding the bag, giving details of a white coat, black boots and mobile phone which Ms Nelson is thought to have had with her. Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins said the burial site might be on a short car-track near a copse. A tubular steel farm gate might be nearby, possibly with a number of green bottles close to the right-hand gatepost.
