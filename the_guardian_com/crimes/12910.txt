New European guidance on crime prevention could lead to more socially divisive gated communities in Britain, housing associations warned today.The guidance which is due to be approved next week, is a technical standard aimed at designing out crime in residential areas.It recommends cul-de-sac layouts, "access control devising" at the entrance to housing estates, and minimising public space.The standard will only be voluntary in the UK, but it likely to encouraged by insurance companies.The National Housing Federation, the trade body for housing associations, described the standard as "draconian" in its attitude to crime.Its deputy chief executive, James Tickell, said: "We all want to live in safe, peaceful neighbourhoods. But this standard represents a 'security conscious' approach to urban design in the worst sense of the term: by hermetically sealing off housing estates."He pointed out that the best housing associations were taking the opposite line from the one in the guidance. "Housing associations have show that it's possible to create safe, integrated neighbourhoods by using an open layout which maximises public space," said Mr Tickell.His comments were echoed by Alex Ely, head of sustainable communities at the government's design watchdog, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment.He said: "Gating a development is often seen as a panacea for reducing crime, however there is a danger it simply fuels deeper social problems increasing fear and creating exclusion."He added: "Successful well balanced neighbourhoods simply don't need to be sealed off, imagine gating Islington or Chiswick. We have managed to build successful safe neighbourhoods before without throwing up the barriers, there seems little reason to start now."
