Police said today that the convicted murderer and former royal aide Jane Andrews did not pose a threat to the public, as they stepped up their search for her.Andrews, who was the Duchess of York's personal assistant for nine years, absconded from the East Sutton Park open prison in Maidstone, Kent, on Sunday.At a press conference, Andy Adams, the assistant chief constable of Kent police, said: "We have no information to suggest she is a threat to the general public."However, we must be mindful that, in 2000, she was convicted of murder."Andrews was jailed for life for murdering her boyfriend, Thomas Cressman.The Old Bailey heard that the 42-year-old hit the businessman across the head with a cricket bat and stabbed him through the chest with a kitchen knife at their west London home after he refused to marry her.Andrews disappeared from prison days after an apparent suicide attempt, and police described her as "vulnerable"."We are becoming increasingly concerned for Jane's welfare, and would urge anyone who has any information that will help us locate her safe and well to come forward," Adams said.Officers said Andrews was familiar with the London and Grimsby areas.The former personal assistant, who will be eligible for release in 2012, was moved to an open prison in Yorkshire in July and transferred to East Sutton in the last couple of weeks.Earlier, a spokesman for the prison service said the decision to move people to open prisons was taken by the independent parole board.Andrews was found to be missing when a roll call was taken at 8pm, the spokesman said.When asked how she had absconded, Adams said she had been "in an open prison â€¦ her access in and out of the prison is a matter for the prison service".He added: "You can read into that her free movement in and out of the prison affords her more opportunity than in a closed prison."The jury at Andrews' Old Bailey trial accepted the prosecution's case that she killed Cressman in revenge after he said he would not marry her.They rejected her claims that she had armed herself because she was frightened after being abused by him.After the attack, Andrews went on the run, and Sarah Ferguson left two messages on her mobile phone, urging her to give herself up.Andrews sent messages back claiming she did not know why people were trying to contact her and insisting "everything was fine" when she left.After the guilty verdict, she launched an appeal in which she claimed she had been sexually abused as a child.She said the trauma damaged her personality and meant she was not guilty of murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The appeal was rejected.When last seen, she was wearing a long-sleeved black and white striped top, black jeans, a black bodywarmer and black trainers.She is of slim build with a fair complexion and very long, straight brown hair.
