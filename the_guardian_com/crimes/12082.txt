A senior Scotland Yard commander is to launch his claim of racial discrimination against the Metropolitan police today.Commander Ali Dizaei, the president of the National Black Police Association, was suspended from duty in September after being accused of misconduct. He claims that the former commissioner Sir Ian Blair and Catherine Crawford, the Met's chief executive, colluded to suspend him from duty.A spokesman for the Metropolitan Black Police Association said papers would be served at the employment tribunal office in London today.Alfred John, the MPBA chairman, said: "The Metropolitan Police Authority [MPA] will have difficulty explaining how an officer, who according to very senior police officers performs exceptionally well in his job, has been suspended from duty when white senior officers subject to more serious complaints remain on duty and are, in fact, promoted."Dizaei claims one of the reasons he was suspended was to prevent him from representing his colleague Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, who agreed an out-of-court settlement in a racial discrimination claim against Scotland Yard last month.Calling on the London mayor, Boris Johnson, to learn from the Ghaffur case and to intervene, John said: "The Dizaei case will once again show systematic race discrimination by the Metropolitan police service and the Metropolitan Police Authority and the same individuals as before named as being responsible."We will call on the mayor, Boris Johnson, to learn from the Ghaffur saga and personally intervene before this case spins out of control."It is not the first time Dizaei has been suspended from the force. In 2001, he was suspended after allegations of corruption and drug use. He was cleared of the charges, awarded Â£60,000 in damages and reinstated in 2003.An MPA spokesman said it would wait for official notification of Dizaei's actions. The Met is currently fighting a number of high-profile employment tribunal claims, including one brought by its head of diversity, Yasmin Rehman, who says she suffered racist bullying and victimisation.
