A man suspected of attacking Abigail Witchalls did not mention her in several notes he left before taking a lethal overdose of painkillers, it emerged yesterday.Richard Cazaly, 23, a neighbour of Mrs Witchalls became a chief suspect after apparently taking his own life. Detectives are waiting to show Mrs Witchalls, who was attacked near her home in Little Bookham, Surrey, last month, a photo to establish if she can identify him as her attacker. Police scientists are also carrying out tests on knives found in Mr Cazaly's car. Two detectives are in Australia where they will speak to his former girlfriend, Vanessa McKenzie, from whom he split around the time of the assault. Mrs Witchalls, 26, was attacked on April 20 by a man who held a knife to her 21-month-old son Joseph's throat, before stabbing her. Mr Cazaly was spoken to twice by police as part of routine inquiries, but was not considered a suspect. On April 25, however, after breaking up with Ms McKenzie, he drove to Scotland and took a lot of painkillers. He died in hospital on April 30. He fitted the general description of the attacker, although there were some "puzzling" aspects. He had a goatee beard and short hair, whereas Mrs Witchalls described her attacker as being clean-shaven with scruffy hair and silver loop earrings. Friends believe he killed himself over the split with his girlfriend, and knives found in his blue Volvo may have been because he used to juggle.
