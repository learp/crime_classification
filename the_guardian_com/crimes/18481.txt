She had also suffered serious head injuries, police said.Allen, who is originally from Blackpool, is believed to have known Dunford when he lived next door to him in Leven Street about a year ago, but it is not thought Allen knew Davison.Police linked the two deaths on Thursday and three forces joined the hunt for Allen, with more than 100 detectives working on the case, after sightings of the suspect were reported in Leeds on Friday.On Saturday, police released CCTV images taken of Allen in Scarborough during the week.
