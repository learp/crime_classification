Hollyoaks is to ask a "jury" of viewers to determine the outcome of a rape trial storyline featuring the characters Gilly Roach and Jacqui McQueen.The Channel 4 soap is leaving the details surrounding Roach's alleged rape of McQueen unclear in order to explore issues of consent during the runup to and duration of a week-long trial to be broadcast at the end of next month.In Tuesday's Hollyoaks episode the pair, played by Anthony Quinlan and Claire Cooper, were shown entering a bedroom together and the door closing behind them.Viewers will not see what happened between them before the trial, which turns on the question of whether consent was given, rather than whether the pair had intercourse.An off-screen jury made up of viewers will be shown all the evidence in the case and, guided by a legal professional, asked to reach a verdict on it. Their decision will then determine the outcome of the on-screen story.The decision of the jurors will not be made public to avoid spoiling the story for viewers, nor will their deliberations be broadcast on Channel 4 subsequently. However, once the on-screen trial concludes, Channel 4 will release some information about how the jurors reached their verdict online.The jury will be drawn from a cross-section of society, and will include non-Hollyoaks viewers, who are not aware of the characters."We wanted to open up the thorny issue of how hard it is to be a juror and whether the court room the best place to resolve some of these questions about rape," said Carolyn Reynolds, chief executive of independent producer Lime Pictures, which makes the soap. "Why don't we see what it's like if you're just given the material you'd be given in court?"It is hoped that the storyline will encourage viewers to engage with the issue of consent in a different way."Hollyoaks should be braver and edgier when it wants to be, and do that well," said Reynolds, a former Coronation Street executive producer. "We've talked to a lot of charities about this, but we've tried to stay true to what these characters will go through."EastEnders' recent cot death baby-swap storyline attracted more than 10,000 complaints from viewers, but Reynolds said Hollyoaks will not sensationalise the rape."Hollyoaks has a history of not shying away from some of the controversial stories, but it always does it with the key audience in mind," she added."We plan how to tell quite demanding stories pre-watershed â€“ you just need more care and attention to detail. I'm aware of the EastEnders storylines, but we're applying all the rules we should."Dr Catherine White, clinical director at the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, said: "We are continuing to work with the Hollyoaks production team to ensure the storyline they have developed is a realistic and well-informed portrayal of what happens when someone is raped or sexually assaulted."Detective chief inspector Ben Snuggs, who leads the Don't Cross the Line campaign for Hampshire Constabulary added: "This storyline represents an issue that we see all too often, involving whether consent is clear on the part of both parties involved in sexual activity, and particularly when alcohol and drugs are involved."
