A retired Church of England priest found guilty of a catalogue of historic sex attacks on children at a Barnardo's home has been jailed for 10 years.Canon Gordon Rideout, 74, abused more than a dozen girls and boys at the home at Ifield Hall in Crawley, West Sussex, over a four-year period.The former Anglican clergyman also indecently assaulted two girls at an army site in Middle Wallop, Hampshire, the Crown Prosecution Service said.At Lewes crown court, Rideout was found guilty of 34 charges of indecent assault and two of attempted rape on 16 children between January 1962 and January 1973. He was cleared of one indecent assault on a boy at a second Barnardo's home in Essex.The bishop of Chichester, Dr Martin Warner, said Rideout had caused "immeasurable and destructive suffering" over a long period of time.Most of the charges of which Rideout was convicted related to his time as an assistant curate at St Mary's church in Crawley when he would visit a Barnardo's children's home in the county.Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, told the jury: "It would appear from the evidence that he would wander the house and indeed the grounds unaccompanied, and he would visit children when they were sick and alone in bed."One of his victims said Rideout would visit dormitories at night, put his hands under the covers and "fondle around". Bennetts said: "It was on a regular basis when he came to stay, maybe once, twice, three times a week sometimes."The victims did not complain at the time for fear of not being believed.
