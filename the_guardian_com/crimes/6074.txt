Opposition MPs erupted in anger last night when a two month Whitehall mole hunt failed to find who prematurely leaked the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report but confirmed that it was someone in government.'The most likely route for the leak was not the draft report itself but a summary of its findings and associated commentary which were internal to government,' said the home secretary, Jack Straw, announcing the findings of the investigation last night.'The leak is not, therefore, thought to have come from the inquiry team or from the printers.'The embarrassing disclosure to the Sunday Telegraph of February 21 had caused Mr Straw to attempt to get a high court injunction to suppress pre-publication of the report on racism in Britain. Mr Straw said the official inquiry had accounted for all copies of the relevant papers, established that the restrictions on media briefing had been observed, and found no one had had unauthorised access to the material.'Despite intensive investigation, it has not been possible to establish who deliberately leaked the story to the Sunday Telegraph. I regret that it has not been possible to trace the originator of this deporable leak.'Mr Straw had already given MPs his personal word that he was not responsible.'The only other minister with relevant access was the minister of state, Paul Boateng, who has asked me to relay to the House a similar absolute assurance which he has given me and which I fully accept.'Only a small number of officials and advisers, believed to be around 20, had access to the papers.He said he did not intend to name them as 'it would only serve to throw suspicion unfairly on them as a group when there is no evidence that identifies any individual responsible.'Alan Beith, for the Liberal Democrats, said that the inability to identify the leaker despite so few people involved suggested the inquiry had not been carried out effectively: 'This is a matter of considerable concern. It creates the assumption that it is easy to leak and get away with it.'The shadow home secretary, Sir Norman Fowler, was also unhappy: 'This was a deliberate leak from inside the government. It means therefore that the home secretary sought an injunction on the media even though the information was deliberately leaked from inside the government itself.'
