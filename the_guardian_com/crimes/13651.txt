The plot is too far-fetched even for one of his novels. But the irrepressible Jeffrey Archer is apparently dreaming of a return to politics on his release from jail next week.He is said to have told probation officers he still hopes to lodge an appeal against his conviction for perjury - faking an alibi in the libel case involving the prostitute Monica Coghlan - and then 'pursue his career as an author and his interest in politics'.It is not immediately obvious how Archer, who was expelled from the Conservative Party for bringing it into disrepute, imagines he can bounce back. The very idea will give Iain Duncan Smith nightmares: William Hague's former press secretary Amanda Platell, who had to deal with the fallout when Archer was charged with perjury shortly after being selected as the Tory candidate for London Mayor, recently described him as 'more damaging than 10 Neil Hamiltons, [creating] more carnage than 20 Jonathan Aitkens'.But probation reports suggest Archer's confidence in his own abilities remain undimmed. Mike Lewis, ex-governor of North Sea Camp open jail where Archer served part of his sentence, reportedly notes in his submission to the Parole Board which freed the peer that 'I once had to remind Jeffrey Archer after he had suggested an improvement to the prison that I thought I was the governor and not he'.If he does try to return to politics, Archer will certainly need the 'great capacity for getting to grips with everything that is thrown at him' described by the submission from Chris Moreno, director of the Theatre Royal in Lincoln, where Archer did work experience.Peter Bottomley, the Tory MP for Worthing West, suggested he could campaign on drug use and illiteracy in prison, adding: 'The Prime Minister should ask David Blunkett to call him in for advice.' Archer is to be released on parole this week after serving half of a four year sentence for perjury and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
