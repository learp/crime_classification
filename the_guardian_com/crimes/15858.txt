Police investigating the murder of a 14-year-old boy stabbed to death by a gang in east London have made a third arrest, Scotland Yard said today.Paul Erhahon collapsed in the street in front of his screaming mother after he and a friend were stabbed repeatedly in Leytonstone by a group of up to 15 youths, just before 8pm on Friday.Today, a Metropolitan police spokesman said the latest arrest was of a 14-year-old youth. Officers are continuing to question two others, a 19-year-old man and a 13-year-old boy, in connection with the attack in the foyer of a block of flats. Paul and his friend, who has not been named and who remains in a critical condition, had been cornered in the foyer. They were found in the street, yards from where Paul lived. He later died in hospital, becoming the sixth Londoner under 17 to be murdered since the end of January. Boys of that age group are being shot or stabbed to death in the capital at the rate of one every 10 days.Paul had been transferred to a new school by his concerned parents after "bullies" stabbed him last year, his aunt, Jackie Mustapha, said yesterday.She said her nephew had been attacked last year after a "personal quarrel".Mrs Mustapha confirmed that Paul's mother, Ivy, had been with him as he lay dying in the street. She said: "His mum was there kissing him, cuddling him, trying to see if she could revive him. They are a very responsible, loving, close family and they love their kids to bits."Local teenagers said Paul was moved to Kingsford Community School - the same one attended by 15-year-old Adam Regis, who was stabbed to death last month.Detective Superintendent Andy Dolden, leading the murder inquiry, said he was keeping an open mind about a connection to gang crime, but there were "no obvious links" with the stabbing of Adam Regis or the claims that Paul had been stabbed before.
