Rumpole grumbled about the Uxbridge beak, and libertarian lawyers expect little from magistrates or the district judges that keep them company on the bench of the lowest courts. The critique is that the beaks are over-suspicious of every suspect, always up for sending folk down and – above all – determined to keep the police's wheels turning. But at Salford magistrates court, district judge Jonathan Finestein did something that would have had Rumpole choking on his claret. Applying a doggedly literal reading of the law governing police bail, he ruled that the cops could not alternate between briefly detaining and then bailing a suspect, in the on-and-off manner they have relied on for years, but must instead permanently open the cell door just 96 hours after it was first slammed. His interpretation was dubious, but was upheld by the high court, with consequences that ricocheted to parliament. Reasonably fearing that dangerous men under prolonged investigation would suddenly be free to refuse invitations to the nick, MPs have just rushed through an emergency law. Finestein nonetheless deserves the praise heaped on him by, of all people, local MP Hazel Blears. His obstinate determination to enforce the law's letter as he reads it has shaken power in the land. And by threatening to break bail, he has demonstrated just how important it is. The panicked politicians rushing to restore it ought to ask why the regular bail that protects us all against murderers can't also do the work of all those draconian terror laws.
