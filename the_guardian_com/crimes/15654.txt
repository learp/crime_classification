A police file on the killing of a man who was fatally stabbed while trying to rob a Lancashire shopkeeper will today be passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, officers have said.Tony Singh, 34, was arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of Liam Kilroe, 25, outside Mr Singh's shop in Skelmersdale on Sunday evening. He was questioned and released on police bail until February 29. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire police said he would refer the case to the CPS today but declined to say whether he had recommended that Mr Singh be charged with murder or any other offence. The CPS will make the final decision on whether any charges should be brought. According to officers, Mr Singh had been sitting in his car outside his Lifestyle Express store in Birleywood Road on Sunday evening when he became the victim of an attempted robbery by Mr Kilroe. The driver's window was smashed and a struggle ensued during which Mr Kilroe received a single stab wound to the chest and Mr Singh sustained injuries to his back and neck, police said. Police arrived at the scene at around 9.30pm and found a knife believed to have been used by Mr Kilroe, Det Sup Gradwell said, although he refused to confirm whether Mr Kilroe's wound was consistent with the weapon. Mr Singh was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to hospital for treatment. He was questioned the following day before being released on police bail. Liam Kilroe, from Wheatacre in Skelmersdale, had convictions for robbery, assault and possession of an offensive weapon, according to a spokeswoman for Lancashire police. At the time of the incident he was on bail for two charges of armed robbery and was being sought by police for breaching his bail conditions and failing to attend a court hearing, the spokeswoman said.
