The Godfather retired at 35. By then his years of running probably the most feared criminal gang in the British underworld had earned him so much money he stopped counting at £11m.Today the criminal career of Terence George Adams, 52, has been halted, albeit perhaps temporarily, as he begins a seven-year sentence for laundering £1m.Like Al Capone in 1932, it was not the violence, the extortion or the narcotics that finally put the head of the notorious north London-based Adams family behind bars, but a forensic trail of his dirty millions by a select group of detectives, which took 21 months, cost £10m and involved the transcribing of thousands of hours of surveillance tapes.With his wife Ruth and daughter watching from the public gallery of court 11 at the Old Bailey, Adams remained impassive as Judge Timothy Pontius sentenced him. The judge issued a confiscation order for £750,000 of his vast but uncalculated assets, and ordered him to pay £50,000 towards the prosecution costs of more than £4m.Adams's delaying tactics following his arrest three years ago had caused "colossal and unprecedented costs" to the public purse, the judge said.Because of his persistent refusal to declare his assets, Adams now faces an investigation by the Legal Services Commission and at its conclusion he will be forced to pay all of his defence costs - expected to exceed £5m. His conviction, detectives hope, will finally bring down his massive empire, built on more than 20 years of violently controlled protection rackets, extortion and drug trafficking.As the judge ordered him to be taken down, Adams raised a double handed salute to his wife and daughter, before disappearing to the cells. He will be taken to the category A wing of Belmarsh high security prison.The court heard that having spent the last two decades placing his millions in the hands of third parties, nominees and false companies, Adams confidently told the Inland Revenue in 1996 that all he had was "£50 with no other assets".But the truth was very different. By his mid-30s, Adams was in possession of such a large fortune that he was able to turn his back on frontline criminal activity and retire to his luxurious and numerous homes in London and Cyprus. He left the dirty work to a band of enforcers; hardmen like Gilbert Wynter, known for his extreme violence and now believed to be dead."Adams had reached a point in his career when his name alone had a value from which he was able to profit," said prosecutor Andrew Mitchell QC yesterday. "By reason of his past criminal activity, the name Terry Adams and that of his family had a currency of its own that he guarded closely, like a board of directors would guard a trademark."Seated behind the court's bulletproof glass yesterday, Adams held his head high as, for the first time, official details of his leadership of one of the most "feared and revered" organised criminal fraternities in the UK was outlined to the court.Evidence of the ruthless violence meted out by Adams and his enforcers to prop up his empire was revealed in the transcript of thousands of hours of surveillance tapes.Those who owed money or offended him were beaten, slashed and in one case kidnapped, according to the taped evidence."When I hit someone with something, I do them damage," he was recorded saying. "On my baby's life, his kneecap came right out there ... all bone and white."With the millions he made from crime, Adams supported a lavish lifestyle for himself and his family. As well as his homes in London, he had a yacht and a flat in Cyprus, used first class air travel and sent his daughter to private school. On her birthday he presented her with a Mercedes sports car.Adams pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money after a plea bargain which involved charges against his wife being dropped.
