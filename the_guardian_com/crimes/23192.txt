Electronically tagged young offenders are less likely to breach their bail conditions than those not monitored by the devices, researchers said today.But those with a history of breaching bail did so more often after being tagged, the study by the Home Office found.The survey showed 16% of young offenders breached their bail terms before being tagged. The proportion fell to 9% after they were tagged.But among those who disobeyed their bail terms, the rate of bail breaches rose from 8% to 11% after being tagged.The report, Understanding Electronic Monitoring of Juveniles on Bail or Remand to Local Authority Accommodation, said: "It is possible that the increase in the rate of breach was due to the fact that the tag simply allowed more opportunities for juveniles to be caught breaching."Workers on youth offending teams told the researchers they believed tags could improve offenders' behaviour when used as part of a support package.Some of the tagged offenders in the pilot study said the devices helped them obey their bail terms because it gave them an excuse they could make to their friends to stay out of trouble.The study, which looked at 315 young offenders tagged over 21 months from April 2002, said there was inconclusive evidence that courts were using tagging mainly as an alternative to custody. The researchers found that tagging was usually reserved for repeat offenders.The study also found that nationwide 4% of the electronic tags imposed on young offenders malfunctioned between February and December 2003. This was equivalent to 18 devices failing per month.Electronic tags are usually used to impose a nighttime curfew on an offender. Alarms are triggered at the monitoring company's offices if the tagged person leaves their home during the curfew period.
