A taxi driver accused of a string of sexual assaults today admitted plying young women passengers with champagne and lying to them in the back of his cab.John Worboys, 51, said he craved the attention of women after the death of his mother from cancer when he was a child.He told Croydon crown court he made up stories about winning huge sums of cash at casinos as "banter" to engage their interest before offering them a drink.Speaking in his defence for the first time, Worboys admitted he gave a false name and invented details about his background, such as attending university, to aid conversation.He said: "Basically I thought it would be a good idea to get women's attention. I used to wait until I had a good £2,000 or £3,000 with me and I used to sort of make up a story that I won money in the casino or lottery."I used to show it to them and ask if they would celebrate with me and have a drink, either champagne or wine, just to celebrate my winnings. It was like banter really – just to get their attention."The prosecution claim Worboys spent 18 months preying on young women he picked up outside nightspots across central London in his black cab.The taxi driver, of Rotherhithe, south-east London, doped the women with spiked drinks before sexually assaulting them, it is alleged.Under questioning by his barrister, Jeremy Gold QC, Worboys admitted sexual activity with some customers in the back of his cab, but denied drugging or attacking anyone.
