A London council yesterday denied it was being alarmist in introducing a policy of installing anti-knife arches at random outside its secondary schools to check pupils for weapons.A total of 12,000 students have passed through the arches at 15 of the 19 secondary schools in Waltham Forest, north-east London, since the policy was brought in two months ago. No knives have been found so far. The checkpoints, manned by community police officers, will be set up at least once a term outside every secondary school in Waltham Forest from now on.Although individual schools elsewhere in London have installed arches previously, Waltham Forest is the first local authority in the UK to use them as a routine, borough-wide policy.Chris Robbins, the council's cabinet member for children, said the fact no knives had been found did not mean the arches were unnecessary."We never thought our schools were alive with guys running about with knives. We always knew it was a problem among a very small minority," he added. "But, like many areas in London, knife crime is an issue among young people and it would be foolish to try and ignore this."Robbins said the arches had been brought in after pupils taking part in existing anti-knife education programmes repeatedly requested them.Shona Ramsey, headteacher of Lammas secondary school in the Leyton area, where arches were set up yesterday morning, welcomed the idea. "We don't have a problem here and I want to keep it that way," she said. Last year, 23 teenagers were stabbed to death around London, among them 18-year-old Charles Hendricks, who was killed near a bus garage in Walthamstow in August.
