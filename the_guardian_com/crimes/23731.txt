A soldier fighting for his life in hospital after being attacked in the street probably knew his attackers, police have said.Father-of-one David Grout, 22, who serves with the Royal Signals Regiment, had recently returned from a tour of Afghanistan. He is in a critical condition after he was the victim of an unprovoked attack yesterday.The soldier had been socialising with relatives before he was assaulted near the Eston Institute in Eston, Teesside, around 6.40pm.Detectives said Grout had left the social club to go outside for a cigarette when he was confronted by two men, one of whom punched him to the ground, causing serious head injuries.He was taken to James Cook University hospital, Middlesbrough, where his condition has been listed as critical. His family, including his wife Kerry and 20-month-old son Harley, were at his bedside.Detectives have said they believe Grout knew his attackers, and that they stayed with him for some time as he lay unconscious before fleeing."From witnesses who have told us about David's body language it appears that he knew his attackers," said Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer."I do not think this incident is in any way connected to David's service in the army. This attack was not planned and they have waited with David as he lay unconscious for some period of time before leaving."I believe the person who has done this knows David and knows his family. I would ask this person to come forward."Helyer said there would have been a large number of witnesses to the attack and he urged them to come forward.The signaller, who joined the army straight after leaving school, had recently returned from Helmand province, said his grandfather Bryan Grout.Detectives want to speak to two white men seen running from the area.They were in their early 20s and one wore a white tracksuit while the other had a grey hoodie and white tracksuit bottoms.
