The convictions in one of Britain's most notorious gangland killings are unsafe because a supergrass who gave evidence was helped by police to make a deal to sell his story before the trial, the court of appeal was told yesterday.Lady Kennedy QC, counsel for Michael Steele, one of two men convicted in 1998 of triple killings in Rettendon, Essex, said Darren Nicholls had turned Queen's evidence to get more lenient treatment for his own criminality. Steele, 61, and Jack Whomes, 42, are serving life.The crown "strenuously" denies a police cover-up regarding Nicholls' reliability.
