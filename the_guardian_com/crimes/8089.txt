A plumber who poured a vase of his urine into a hot water cylinder and then rinsed it out in a drinking water tank was spared jail yesterday, after a court heard his business was wrecked, his wife's village post office boycotted, and the family was selling up and moving to another part of Britain.A jury gasped as court officials showed covert filming of Roy Williams, 47, relieving himself in an attic and then whistling cheerfully after sloshing the vase into both tanks while his apprentice fetched new valves from their van for an unnecessary repair at a house in Leatherhead.Unfortunately for Williams - who claimed the incident was a one-off, and triggered by a medical condition and the sound of running water - the building was a Surrey trading standards decoy, with secret cameras throughout, including one in a packet of cornflakes and another in a bottle of bathroom cleaner.Used to trap dishonest tradespeople (estimated at one in four locally) it left Williams with only a threadbare defence to charges of attempted deception, making a false trades description, and making a reckless statement.He was ordered to pay a total of Â£5,038 in fines, compensation and legal costs and given 150 hours' community service by the recorder, Rebecca Brown, at Guildford crown court. Williams' barrister, Roy Taylor, successfully pleaded against a jail term on the grounds that he and his family had been severely punished financially. Williams had broken down in court after watching the film and admitting: "I am disgusted by seeing it myself."Ms Brown told him: "These are serious offences. They are easy to commit and extremely difficult to detect."After the sentencing hearing, Williams claimed: "I knew I was being filmed and would end up in court, and I was hoping to show what Trading Standards are doing. They are out to get the working man who's good with his hands."Steve Playle, of Surrey Trading Standards, who led the sting operation, said Williams' claims were "outrageous".
