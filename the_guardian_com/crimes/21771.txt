Four paedophiles caught after a local newspaper reporter answered an obscene graffiti advert scrawled on the door of a train toilet door were today given lengthy jail sentences.Ruth Lumley, 26, noticed graffiti urging girls aged between eight and 13 to text a mobile phone number as she took a train home from work.Posing as an 11-year-old girl, Ms Lumley - who at the time was working on the Chichester Observer, in West Sussex - replied to the advert and was sent a series of increasingly sexually explicit messages from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone.She alerted police and prompted a complex 10-month nationwide investigation that uncovered "horrific" child abuse on eight victims.The inquiry led detectives to Trevor Haddock, 55, Ian Jones, 43, John Farmer, 68, and 43-year-old Derek Moody.Earlier this month, the four men pleaded guilty to a range of sex offences at Hove crown court. Today, they were sentenced to jail terms ranging from eight years to life.Haddock, of Worcester, was given six life sentences after admitting 14 offences including rape, attempted rape, conspiring to rape and sexual assault. He will not be eligible for parole for at least 12 years.The court heard he charged up to £150 for other men to abuse a young girl he procured. He also plied his victims with sedatives, alcohol and cigarettes.Jones, of Worthing, West Sussex, admitted conspiring to sexually assault, attempting to cause or incite a child to engage in sexual activity and four counts of criminal damage with intent to commit a sexual offence. He was handed a 20-year sentence, with a minimum of 10 years to be served.Farmer, of Pevensey, East Sussex, was jailed for eight years after admitting to arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence.Moody, of Newcastle upon Tyne, was handed a life term with a minimum of four years imprisonment after admitting inciting to rape a young girl.Judge Anthony Niblett described the men as "morally abhorrent, wicked and harmful to those they abused". "Each of you is a paedophile who poses a continued danger to young children specifically to young girls," he said.The judge added he was sentencing the men to deter and protect vulnerable young children from their predatory activities, and awarded Ms Lumley £250 for her "clear-sightedness".The reporter, who now works for the Brighton Argus, was travelling on a train between Chichester and Brighton when she noticed the scrawled message, which said: "Young girls wanted for sex, aged eight to 13. Text this number only."She rang the number twice, but it was not answered. However, within 30 minutes she received a text from Jones which said: "U male or female how old whr u c my number tx bck only."Ms Lumley sent a text message back, saying "Female, on train, 11" and within minutes received the reply "U up 4 it? R U a virgin or not wht skol u go 2 whr u live tx bk."Jones then proceeded to send a number of messages to Ms Lumley.When he got no response, he also telephoned her, leaving a voicemail message inviting her to call him, and another text message inciting her to send a naked picture of herself.She told the Press Association: "After I sent back the reply, I got sent about five or six text messages which got more and more sexually explicit."They were really disgusting. It was at that point that I knew I had to phone the police."Acting Detective Chief Inspector Jeff Lister, of Sussex police, said the sentences "reflected the serious and horrific nature of the sexual offences committed by these men and the damage they have caused to their young victims".He said the investigation had not found evidence that any children had been abused as a result of the graffiti, and the victims had already been known to Haddock."These victims are now being given the appropriate support, but they have undoubtedly had their childhoods taken away from them," he said.Four police forces were involved in the nationwide investigation, which found similar graffiti on a number of trains in southern England and at Euston station, in London.Jones was arrested after police set up a sting operation in which he believed he was meeting an 12-year-old girl at a Burger King restaurant in Brighton. After officers searched his flat and checked his phone records, they discovered calls made to Farmer.Farmer was arrested when police found child abuse pictures on his phone. Two pictures found on Jones's phone were taken in his flat, and included an image of a third man, who Sussex police later identified as Haddock.Examination of Haddock's phone records led to the discovery of a plan to take a young girl to Newcastle so she could be abused by Moody in exchange for cash. Police stepped in before the deal could be completed.During the earlier hearing, it was revealed that Jones had received a 42-month sentence for the attempted rape of a 20-year-old woman in Burgess Hill in 1984.
