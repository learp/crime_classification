Inmates of wooden cabins used in prisons to solve overcrowding have been given their own keys because the buildings are such a fire risk, according to a Whitehall spending watchdog.The National Audit Office says that because it is not possible to lock the prisoners in their cells at night, officers need back-up support to enter the buildings. They also report that the quick-build cabins have been plagued by leaking roofs.The Whitehall auditors have revealed that the pressure to open new accommodation has been so great that at Morton Hall prison one of the units was put into service before it had mains electricity and sewerage systems.With prison numbers reaching an all-time high of more than 77,700 last Friday, home secretary, Charles Clarke, has conceded that the prison system in England and Wales is "very close" to capacity.The NAO report says the Home Office needs to improve its contingency arrangements for dealing with the number of prisoners, which has shot up by 25,000 over the past 10 years. It says modular temporary units, similar to Portakabins, have been built inside the perimeter walls at 22 prisons in the past three years.The report says: "The risk of fire means prisoners have their own keys to get in and out of the building and in category C prisons security is maintained by a security fence around the unit."The Home Office last night denied that prisoners had been given their own keys because the units were a fire risk: "This is not a 'risk of fire' issue. Some low risk prisoners in category C prisons have the ability to lock their cells for privacy and protection of their possessions."Prison visitors' boards and inspectors both told the NAO there was a higher risk of bullying and intimidation in the units. "The prisons we visited confirmed that because they are unable to lock prisoners in their cells at night, it is difficult for prison officers to enter these buildings without sufficient back-up support."The report, published today, says the wooden cabins cost the equivalent of £5,600 per prison place and take 134 days to build on average - despite an estimate of 49 days. The units have provided 1,160 extra places. Alternative brick-clad steel frame units, which take 183 days to build, are better value at £1,700 per prisoner.
