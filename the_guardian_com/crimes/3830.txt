Sex toys worth Â£11,000 have been stolen by burglars who raided a mail order company, police say.More than 400 items were stolen in four large suitcases from a flat in Gilgal in Stourport, Worcestershire, where they were being stored by the locally based mail order company Happy Bunny, which trades online.West Mercia police said the premises were broken into some time between 11.30pm last Wednesday night and 9am the next day.It is thought thieves accessed the property from Baldwin Road and left the scene via the same route.Officers have contacted adult shops in the area to alert them in case they are offered any of the stolen goods.PC Emma Gunnell said: "We would like to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in that area overnight on Wednesday or thinks they know who was responsible."It would be quite difficult for the thieves to sell on these items in any great quantity and so we would ask people to be on the lookout for these suitcases should the thieves have dumped them."Two of the cases were black but the other two were very distinctive, one having pink-and-black stripes and the other a multicoloured flower pattern all over it."
