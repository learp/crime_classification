A police chief yesterday called on forces to advertise the presence of speed cameras by painting them in bright colours and making them more visible to motorists.Ken Williams, chief constable of Norfolk, said he would be taking steps to make the location of cameras in his county obvious to road users, including making them brighter, installing clearer street signs alerting motorists to them, and possibly supplying the media with maps of where they are positioned. Mr Williams, who is chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers' traffic committee, said the police had not been sufficiently inclusive in explaining their position. "My experience tells me that if we are open about our business, then there will be a real change in behaviour." Mr Williams's proposals emerged as a new survey found that half of all drivers would support an increase in the number of speed cameras. Eight in 10 drivers said theydid not believe cameras infringed their civil liberties, and seven in 10 thought cameras should be obvious rather than hidden, according to a Mori poll commissioned by Direct Line, the road safety insurance company. As many as seven in 10 accepted that cameras reduced crashes, saved lives and made motorists slow down, the survey concluded. Andrew Howard, road safety spokesman for the AA said he welcomed "a degree of openness" about the location of speed cameras and that he hoped other constabularies would follow Norfolk's example. But he warned: "The biggest problem is that the pilot scheme running in eight forces, which allows the police to recoup money raised from speeding fines, has left the public wondering what speed cameras are actually for. Mr Howard said he expected the number of speed cameras nationally to increase three-fold (to around 8,000) by 2004. He added that, contrary to the Mori survey findings, the AA's experience was that the public were becoming increasingly wary of their proliferation.
