Villagers have spoken of their shock after a shooting incident left two men dead, including one in a churchyard.Police were called to reports of gunfire at a house in Westbury-sub-Mendip, near Cheddar, Somerset, on Sunday night.One man, named locally as Ray Masters, 58, died shortly after officers arrived.A second body was discovered at the parish church of St Lawrence, where a white police tent was erected outside the entrance.Locals said Masters, a businessman, was shot in his home. The building was described as a large, detached property with its own security gates, situated next door to the church.Robert Wood, 61, who lives opposite the church, described hearing gunfire on Sunday night, followed by a woman's cry. He said: "I was listening to the Masters golf on the radio and heard, I reckon, about four shots. I assumed it was someone shooting rabbits or something on the outskirts of the village."After about 10, I heard a girl running down the road, making a continuous noise. I thought as it was pub closing time it was high jinks or something but, thinking about it now, maybe she'd seen something. The next thing I know, the whole place was lit up with flashlights and flashing blue lights and police cars were crawling all over the place."Wood said a police helicopter was also hovering above the village, in the shadow of Glastonbury Tor.An Avon and Somerset police spokeswoman said: "At 10.39pm on Sunday a call was received by police from someone reporting that a man had been shot at a house in the village."Police attended the scene but the man died shortly after the incident. An investigation was immediately launched to identify the person responsible and inquiries led to the discovery of a man's body in a nearby churchyard."At this stage police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident."Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them on 0845 456 7000.
