A member of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry said today he was not surprised to hear of claims that the Metropolitan police failed to act on evidence alleging the killers of the black student had been shielded by a corrupt detective.According to a BBC documentary to be broadcast tonight, a senior detective in the first police investigation into Stephen's 1993 murder was in the pay of a notorious gangster.Neil Putnam, a former officer, alleges that he warned superiors that John Davidson, a one-time detective sergeant, had corrupt links to Clifford Norris, the father of one of five men who was named by locals as being responsible for Stephen's death in an unprovoked racial attack in south-east London.Richard Stone, one of the four-strong inquiry team that concluded the Metropolitan police service was institutionally racist, said allegations in the documentary were "remarkable" but did not surprise him."Sir William [Macpherson] himself had said at the time of the inquiry that there was a definite smell of corruption around this murder investigation - what he described as the collective failure of the murder investigation," Dr Stone said."We were able to find enough evidence of institutional racism being a significant factor, but we had insufficient evidence produced to us about corruption."Stephen, an 18-year-old A-Level student, was stabbed to death by a gang of five white youths in April 1993. Five men were named by locals as being responsible for the murder, including David Norris, whose father, Clifford, was a convicted drugs trafficker. They were arrested but murder charges were later dropped.A bungled police investigation of the case followed. No one has been convicted of the killing but five men - Neil Acourt, his brother Jamie, David Norris, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight - were arrested soon after the event.Three of them were acquitted of murder after a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family collapsed at the Old Bailey in 1996. Tonight's documentary alleges police corruption may have prevented Stephen's killers being brought to justice.It interviews Mr Putnam, a former corrupt detective turned whistleblower, who claims that former Mr Davidson - who now runs a bar in Spain, denies any wrongdoing and was never prosecuted for any alleged offence - was paid by Norris to obstruct the case.In the programme, the current Met deputy assistant commissioner, John Yates, says he is convinced Mr Davidson was corrupt.The barrister who represented Stephen's family at the inquiry into his death said today that allegations of police corruption could be "potentially extremely significant" to the unsolved case. Michael Mansfield QC said Stephen's parents had accused the police of racism and corruption from the start.Mr Mansfield said a new investigation should look at Mr Putnam's relationship with his "handlers" who used the supergrass to convict other corrupt officers."The central allegation in the film is about the possibility that a critical figure, Davidson - in charge of outside inquiries, in charge of some of the information, in charge of interviewing witnesses - was in fact himself corrupt," he told BBC Breakfast. "It should be pursued... It could be done by the IPCC or the Metropolitan police themselves. Sir Ian Blair should think about that."The Macpherson public inquiry into the first police investigation into Stephen's murder found inept detective work and "institutional racism" in the force. An exhaustive reinvestigation by Scotland Yard took five years but still failed to identify the killers.Mr Mansfield said he was convinced the case would be solved and cited the Birmingham Six who were freed after 16 years in prison."I think the truth will out. Eventually it rises to the surface - people cannot keep a lid on it forever. I feel convinced at the end of the day, for the Lawrence family, that they will get justice."A Scotland Yard spokeswoman insisted there was no evidence to suggest that any corrupt individual tried to thwart the Lawrence investigation."If we had had such information, that would have been pursued," she said. The mindset at that time, as now, was that corrupt officers should be exposed, she added.The Met said it had not yet seen the programme but that it was not expecting any significant new evidence because if there had been, it would have expected the BBC to have already passed it on.The service also insisted that despite an "in-depth" corruption investigation into Mr Davidson there was never any evidence of misconduct in relation to the Lawrence investigation."Following his arrest on corruption charges, ex-DC Neil Putnam gave anti-corruption officers information about ex-DS John Davidson being corrupt," the force said. "He did not provide any details about a corrupt link between Davidson and Clifford Norris."Mr Davidson was subject to an in-depth corruption investigation, during which there was never any evidence of Davidson being involved in corrupt activity within the Stephen Lawrence enquiry or doing anything to thwart that investigation. Had we had such information, it would have been determinedly pursued."Len Duvall, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said he had "serious concerns" about the allegations in the documentary. "We have asked the commissioner for an update at the MPA full authority meeting tomorrow. This case is not closed and if new information comes to light the MPA's expectation is that the MPS will carry out a full investigation."
