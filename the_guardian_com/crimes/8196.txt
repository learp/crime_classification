Direct action protesters were being urged to converge on Westminster today to disrupt a mass police rally against government plans to radically change their pay structure.If any demonstrators heed the call, which went up on radical websites yesterday, then police will be in the extraordinary position of having to separate them from up to 5,000 off-duty officers who are being marshalled for the official event.To add to the paradox, plans for the counter-demonstration appeared on the Urban75 website, where the controversial Metropolitan police commander Brian Paddick recently wrote that he found anarchy attractive.Even if the stunt falls flat, the official rally, organised by the Police Federation as part of its dispute with the Home Office, promises to be an unusual occasion.Officers will lobby MPs to the strains of a New Orleans jazz band and six bagpipers - musical accompaniments organised by federation leaders.The carnival-style atmosphere will be enhanced by trips on the Thames on two pleasure boats, and the use of buses to ferry protesters from one event to the next.Fred Broughton, federation chairman, said yesterday that he did not want the row between police leaders and the home secretary, David Blunkett, to become personal.But he then took a swipe at Mr Blunkett for painting federation members as "wreckers" of government reforms.He added: "To try to portray us as a militant leadership is not only wrong, it is mischievous."The two men met for 45-minutes last week and are due to see each other again today.The minister has given no reason to think that the result of a police ballot, which showed that more than 90% of officers had rejected his pay offer, had swayed his opinion."The overwhelming message is officers feel they are being undervalued and unfairly treated," said Mr Broughton.He added that the pay proposals, which would slash overtime rates and remove the range of allowances, were divisive.He said that the federation supported 95% of the government's police reform package. But he claimed that Mr Blunkett's attempts to rush the federation into accepting wholesale changes to pay and conditions were unfair.In an effort to influence the police demo, the government last night published figures which claimed to show that there are now more police than at any time since records began.
