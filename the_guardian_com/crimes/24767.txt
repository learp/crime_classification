A teenager is facing life in prison after he yesterday admitted murdering a 16-year-old girl and setting fire to her body.Colyn Evans, 18, murdered Karen Dewar in the seaside town of Tayport, Fife, before he attempted to dismember her body and placed it in a wheelie bin, where he set fire to it.In a brief appearance before Lord Philip at the high court in Edinburgh, Evans admitted murdering Karen, a childcare student, and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.Full details of the crime will not be made public until today. The advocate depute, David Young, prosecuting, asked for the case to be adjourned until today to allow families to be in court.On January 20, Evans attacked Karen, who lived in the same street as him, throwing her against a table, stripping her and forcing her to wear underwear belonging to someone else.He then cut her hair, strangled her, cut her with a knife and submerged her in a bath and killed her. The murder took place at a house in Tay Street, close to where the victim lived with her parents.Karen's body was discovered in the burnt-out wheelie bin the following morning, and hours later Evans was charged with her murder.Evans was originally charged with breaking into a nearby home on an earlier occasion and stealing two knives. He was further charged with stealing women's underwear from another house.The crown accepted not guilty pleas to the theft charges.Evans will face a mandatory life sentence when he comes before Lord Philip again today, but the trial judge must also decide the jail term he must serve before he can apply for release on parole.Karen's father, Frank, said the family had been left devastated by the murder but welcomed Evans's guilty plea."She was such a likeable person who was so lovely, smiling and caring. We are completely devastated by what has happened. Our lives can never be the same," he said.Her mother, Allison, said: "The emptiness in our lives and in our home can never be replaced."
