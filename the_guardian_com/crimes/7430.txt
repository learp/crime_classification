Siôn Jenkins, the former deputy head teacher accused of bludgeoning his foster daughter Billie-Jo to death, is to face a third trial after an Old Bailey jury failed to reach a verdict yesterday.The jury of six men and six women deliberated for nearly 28 hours after retiring more than a week ago but were unable to reach a verdict on which at least 10 of them could agree.Billie-Jo was 13 when she was beaten to death with an 18-inch iron tent peg as she painted the patio doors at the family home in Hastings, East Sussex, in February 1997. Mr Jenkins was sentenced to life in jail for the murder in 1998 but released last year having served five years after his conviction was ruled unsafe by the court of appeal.Mr Jenkins, 47, who has been on bail for just under a year, left court hand-in-hand with his new wife Christina Ferneyhough, an antiques dealer. The judge Mrs Justice Rafferty altered the conditions of his £300,000 bail to allow him to live with her in Belgravia, London, until the end of this week, and then at their home in Lymington, Hampshire. He was ordered to report to police once a week and will have to observe a night-time curfew.Justice Rafferty praised the "model" behaviour of the jury and excused them from jury service for life. She told them: "You have done your civic duty in which no one could have done better. I know it is unsatisfactory from your point of view that you have not reached verdicts, but what you should do is remind yourselves of the time, care and dedicated attention you have given this case. This is what you must take away with you."She also praised the conduct of the various family members who had attended the proceedings.Mr Jenkins continued to protest his innocence during his retrial. The prosecution alleged he killed Billie-Jo after losing his temper when he returned from a music lesson with two of his daughters.During 12 weeks of evidence, the jury listened to a mass of complex scientific evidence.A further hearing will be held to fix a date for the third trial. A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said a third trial was "rare but not unprecedented".
