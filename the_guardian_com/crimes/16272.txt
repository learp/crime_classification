Three serving police officers are among 15 people facing charges over the investigation into the murder of prostitute Lynette White 21 years ago.Ten retired police officers and two civilians will also appear before City of Westminster magistrates court on 24 April. White was found stabbed to death in a flat in the docks area of Cardiff on Valentine's Day in 1988.Three men originally convicted of the murder were later freed on appeal and became known as the Cardiff Three. The real killer, Jeffrey Gafoor, a client of White, admitted murder in 2003 and was jailed for life.The Crown Prosecution Service said today there was sufficient evidence to prosecute the 15 people.The offences deal with the original investigation and the trials in 1989 and 1990 of five men accused of the murder. Two were cleared but the other three – Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Anthony Paris – were found guilty. Their convictions were quashed by the appeal court in 1992.Tom Davies, of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said: "It is important for South Wales police and the people they serve that this miscarriage of justice was properly dealt with."In all of this we must not forget that Lynette White died at the hands of Jeffrey Gafoor and my thoughts are with her family and friends."It is vitally important for public confidence in the police service and the complaints process that the full story of this reinvestigation is told in public."The trial of these 15 people will enable that to happen."This has been a long and complex investigation and we and the police have worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to get to today's announcement."Constable John Howard Murray, Detective Sergeant Paul Stephen and Detective Constable Paul Jennings face charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. They are joined by retired officers Graham Mouncher, Richard Powell, Thomas Page, Michael Daniels, John Brian Gillard, Peter Greenwood, John Seaford, Rachel O'Brien, Stephen Hicks and Wayne Pugh, now a police staff member.Civilians Violet Elizabeth Perriam and Ian Albert Massey face two counts of perjury over evidence they gave at the murder trials.Assistant Chief Constable Colette Paul said: "It is now just over 21 years since Lynette died, and her family have endured a great deal of heartache."The serving of summonses marks another crucial phase in this investigative and prosecution process which has seen a total of 34 people arrested, including 15 retired police officers and five serving police officers, and three individuals convicted of perjury and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment."
