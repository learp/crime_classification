A delicate police and Customs operation lasting almost a decade has ended with more than 75 years jail for money launderers based in Yorkshire.The passing of final sentences has also ended a long ban on reporting details of the case for fear of prejudicing trials and putting the patient work of detectives and financial experts to waste.Travel agent Shahid Bhatti, of Shipley in West Yorkshire, was the last to go behind bars for his part in deals involving staggering amounts of plain cash. One money laundering outfit in Bradford took £3.3m in notes in a single day and paid over £80m into the banks for just one client.The precise source of much of the money remains to be discovered, but most of it is certain to have come from the smuggling of drugs and cigarettes.Banknotes seized by police and customs officers at various stages had been contaminated with Class A drugs and one crooked financial deal involving £3.7m in cash was traced directly to George Cockerill, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, a fraudster who was jailed for three years in 2001 and has since died.Others sent to prison are Liaquat Ali of Birmingham, 12 years; Akhtar Hussain of Keighley, 12 years; James Carr, of Liverpool, 10 years; Faisal Malik of Leeds, 10 years; Amer Ramzan of Halifax, nine years; Mohsan Khan of High Wycombe, five years; Imran Syed of Leeds, four years; Shahel Gazi of Kings Cross, London, two-and-a-half years; and Claire O'Brien of Manchester, two-and-a-half years.The ring involved the laundering of some £500m over four years in the late 1990s and early 2000s through abuse of the ancient Islamic financial system of hawala.This essentially involves the safe deposit of cash at one point and its collection elsewhere, on the lines of cabled cash. Travel agencies in cities such as Bradford have found it a popular and profitable sideline."Literally hundreds of thousands of pounds in 'dirty cash' was being ferried up the M1 on an almost daily basis," said David Odd, the head of investigation for HM Revenue and Customs in Yorkshire."The money was then deposited into business and personal accounts at various banking outlets, converted into foreign currencies, then transferred to accounts in the United States, the United Arab Emirates and across Europe."We hope these sentences send a stark message to those who launder the proceeds of crime that we will bring them to justice."The case is also likely to lead to reforms in financial regulations to maintain the generally high reputation of hawala. An earlier financial institution connected with the north of England, the cooperative movement, attracted suspicion of abuse in its pioneering Victorian days.So did the largely northern-rooted building society movement of the 19th century, whose principle of borrowing short and lending long was considered dangerously risky by then orthodox banking institutions.
