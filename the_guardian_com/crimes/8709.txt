Dedicated police staff are to patrol London's youth courts to encourage knife crime victims and witnesses to testify against their attackers.The decision to put police community support officers inside the capital's youth courts is part of a series of special measures to tackle knife crime in London to be outlined by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, later this week.The move comes alongside measures to ensure that every borough police commander briefs local magistrates on the profile of knife crime in their area and the impact of youth violence on the local community.The need to introduce youth court police patrols reflects the "wall of silence" that surrounds some of the recent knife murders in London, in which victims and witnesses have been reluctant to testify in court for fear of reprisals and harassment they might face on the day.Pilot schemes are under way to ensure that early risk assessments are carried out of young offenders in London to ensure that those committing serious crimes are dealt with robustly by the courts.Blair is due to give a detailed briefing to the Metropolitan Police Authority on Thursday on the details of "Operation Blunt 2" - the police response to the growing number of fatal stabbings of teenagers in the capital.The enforcement campaign includes requiring all 32 London borough police commanders to identify the most violent young offenders in their area and the local hotspots for knife crime incidents. Initially "robust intelligence-led anti-knife operations" using stop and search powers under section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act will be mounted in 10 boroughs before being extended across the capital. These operations, under which young people can be stopped without need for reasonable suspicion of an offence, will be carried out in areas where offenders live as well as where knife incidents have happened.The papers for the Metropolitan Police Authority meeting make clear that Scotland Yard is well aware of the possible implications of stepping up the scale of "stop and search" operations, which will disproportionately hit young people from minority ethnic communities. The police say they will monitor the ethnic impact of the new stop and search campaigns and will try to secure a community mandate for this approach by recruiting local community leaders as observers of the enforcement campaign. Safer schools officers are also being deployed in 185 priority schools and colleges across London to work on tackling youth crime. Youth workers and street pastors are being asked to warn young people about the dangers of carrying knives. Blair yesterday urged parents to ask their children if they were carrying a knife. Fourteen youngsters have been killed in the capital in the first five months of this year, compared with 10 over the same period last year.
