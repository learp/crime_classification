The doctor who failed to spot that Baby P had a broken back and ribs days before the child died is suing her former employers over her dismissal.Dr Sabah al-Zayyat, a consultant paediatrician, missed the injuries after deciding she could not carry out a full check-up because the little boy was "miserable and cranky".Two days later, on 3 August 2007, baby Peter died in his cot in Haringey, north London. His mother, her boyfriend and their lodger were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child.Al-Zayyat had her contract with Great Ormond Street hospital terminated after the case came to light. She has now launched a claim for damages.A hospital spokeswoman said: "We can confirm we have received notice of legal action. The trust will vigorously defend its position."We believe we acted fairly and in the interests of patients. Detailed rebuttal of Dr al-Zayyat's claims will have to wait for any hearing."We didn't scapegoat her. The case surrounds her dismissal from the hospital following the decision not to renew her fixed-term contract."A postmortem examination found 17-month-old Peter had probably suffered serious injuries, including a broken back and fractured ribs, before he was examined by Al-Zayyat at St Ann's hospital in Tottenham, north London.The doctor, who qualified in Pakistan and worked in Saudi Arabia before coming to Britain in 2004, was suspended from practice by the General Medical Council in November last year.A report last month by the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, criticised staffing levels at St Ann's.Al-Zayyat had no contact with Peter's social worker before or after the appointment and was given no details about the child's previous hospital admissions, the commission noted.She was one of only two consultants at the specialist children's clinic at St Ann's, when there should have been four.In November, the paediatrician spoke of her distress at what happened to Peter. In a statement released through the Medical Protection Society, which gives professional indemnity to health professionals, she said: "Like everyone involved in this case, I have been deeply affected by the shocking and tragic circumstances of this young child's death."My professional career has been devoted to the care of children. I will cooperate with any investigation to identify whether lessons can be learnt from this case."Peter suffered 50 injuries despite receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police during the final eight months of his life.His mother, 27, was given an indefinite sentence with a minimum term of five years at the Old Bailey last month after pleading guilty to causing or allowing her son's death.Her boyfriend, 32, was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl. He was also given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his "major role" in Peter's death.The couple's lodger, Jason Owen, 37, of Bromley, south-east London, received an indefinite sentence with a minimum term of three years for failing to take steps to save the child.
