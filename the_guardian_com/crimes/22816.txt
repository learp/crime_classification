The home secretary, Theresa May, has sounded the death knell for the asbo after new official statistics showed breaches of the orders had risen above 50%, and that their use has fallen to the lowest level yet.May said it was now "time to move beyond the asbo", with rsimpler sanctions that were "rehabilitating and restorative rather than criminalising and coercive".Her speech in south London marks the end to the system of antisocial behaviour orders, which became a hallmark of Labour's approach to tackling crime, with its "asbo culture" of hoodies, graffiti and noisy neighbours.But her speech also marks a departure from some of the Conservatives' more hardline rhetoric before the election, such as when the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, talked about introducing "grounding orders" to tackle yobs.May said: "These sanctions were too complex and bureaucratic. There were too many of them, they were too time consuming and expensive, and they too often criminalised young people unnecessarily, acting as a conveyor belt to serious crime and prison."She said Labour had introduced a "ludicrous list" of sanctions to tackle antisocial behaviour, among them the ISO [individual support order], the asbi [antisocial behaviour injunction], the asbo [antisocial behaviour order] the crasbo [criminal antisocial behaviour order], crack house closure orders, dog control orders, litter and noise abatement orders, housing injuctions and parenting orders.She said the use of these sanctions varied hugely from one part of the country to another, with police and local authorities focusing on the handful of orders they were most familiar with.May asked: "And if the professionals don't understand them then how on earth are the perpetrators of antisocial behaviour supposed to understand them? No wonder they don't act as a serious deterrent."Instead, she is to launch a Home Office review of the powers available to the police to provide them with tools that are quick, practical and easier to use. "Simpler sanctions, which are easier to obtain and to enforce, will provide the police and practitioners with a firm hand to tackle the problem cases," she said."Where possible, they should be rehabilitating and restorative rather than criminalising and coercive. But where necessary, they should be tough and provide a real deterrent."May added: "Just this morning, the latest asbo statistics have shown that breach rates have yet again increased – more than half are breached at least once; 40% are breached more than once – and their use has fallen yet again, to the lowest ever level."The latest asbo statistics, published today, show that only 2,027 asbos were issued in 2008 – the lowest level since a peak of 4,122 were issued in 2005. In all, 16,999 asbos have been issued since their introduction, in April 1999.The figures also show 1,266 asbos were breached for the first time in 2008, giving a breach rate of over 50%, the highest rate yet. In total, more than 9,247 of the 16,999 issued were breached, fuelling the claim that asbos were often seen as a "badge of honour" by teenagers.
