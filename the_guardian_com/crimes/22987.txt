A judge today said he could not remember why he had granted bail to a policeman accused of murdering his wife.Garry Weddell, 47, was released from custody before his trial and officers now fear he went on to kill his mother-in-law before turning the gun on himself.An investigation is under way into why the Metropolitan police inspector was freed despite being accused of strangling his wife and faking her suicide.Weddell is thought to have shot himself in a field on Saturday after killing his mother-in-law, Traute Maxfield, who was due to give evidence against him.Speaking from his north London home, Judge John Bevan, who granted Weddell bail, said he could not remember the circumstances of the application.He told the Evening Standard: "I hope there will be transcripts of the two bail applications. These would explain things."I can't remember the precise details so it would be wholly inappropriate to comment at this time. I don't know what may happen in the future."Calls have intensified today for an official inquiry into how someone on such a serious charge could have been granted bail.It has also emerged that Weddell's legal team attempted to get his bail conditions relaxed even further once he had been freed.The conditions banned him from entering Bedfordshire and gave him limited, supervised access to his three young children.The shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, said: "This case raises very serious questions and the public will find it extraordinary that anybody on a murder charge should be given bail."Mike Penning, the Conservative MP for Hemel Hempstead, said he would write to the attorney general and ask for an inquiry.He said: "There are so many questions we need to know now as to why this gentleman was not in custody when he was facing such serious charges."The Crown Prosecution Service said it opposed Weddell's bail and subsequent attempts to relax his bail conditions.Weddell's body was discovered on Saturday morning in a field at Broomhills shooting club in Markyate, Hertfordshire.He was a Police Federation representative based in Barnet, north London, with more than 25 years' police experience.The body of his 70-year-old mother-in-law was found on Saturday afternoon, about 10 miles from the shooting club at a house in Gustard Wood.Police had tried to contact her after discovering Weddell's body just after 11.45am. She was listed as his next of kin.A police cordon remained around her £1m Tudor-style home in the affluent Hertfordshire village today.Weddell's wife Sandra, 44, was found dead in the garage of their family home in Dunstable, Bedfordshire on January 31 2007.Postmortem tests revealed that the nurse and exam invigilator was strangled with a cable tie.A hearing at Luton magistrates court in June was told that Weddell discovered his wife was having an affair and wanted a divorce.He feared he would lose custody of their three children and his home so he decided to kill her, the court heard.Detectives were suspicious about the death. Her body showed signs of a struggle and the injury from the cable tie did not look like it could have been self-inflicted.A suicide note had been typed out on the family computer, but a forensic linguistic examination suggested she was not the author.In September, Weddell was granted bail with a surety of £200,00 on condition that he hand in his gun licence and stay away from his mother-in-law.His defence team argued he had complied with the investigation and would be in danger in prison because he was a police officer.A Hertfordshire police spokeswoman said detectives were keeping an open mind about whether both incidents were linked.Detective Superintendent Andy Shrives of Hertfordshire police said: "We are keen to trace the movements of Mr Weddell on Friday and Saturday."
