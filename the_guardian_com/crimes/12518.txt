A courier who helped stage a fake robbery of thousands of UK passports highly valued by criminals and terrorists, was jailed yesterday for four and a half years.Alan Burke, 49, was the driver's mate when the "sham raid" took place in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, shortly after he picked up more than 3,650 passports and visas from a printworks.Two unknown offenders drove off with Burke inside the delivery van, when the driver popped out to a newsagent and left the vehicle unlocked with the keys in the ignition.All but 200 of the passports and 3,600 visas which were destined for embassies worldwide were taken in the supposed raid last July. The vast majority of the travel documents were recovered in January this year, following a surveillance operation by Greater Manchester police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).Sentencing him at Manchester crown court, Judge Anthony Hammond told Burke his role in the conspiracy was "absolutely pivotal", and it could have not been achieved without him. Burke initially told police he was attacked by the raiders before they made off with their haul, but later admitted being the "inside man".Four other men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to handle the passports and visas. Mohammed Bilal Khan, 53, of Werneth, who was described as a "prime mover" in the crime, was jailed for five and a half years, while another key figure, Mohammed Fiaz, 34, of Stretford, was imprisoned for three and a half years.Mohammed Shanawaz, 24, of Chadderton, received a three-year prison sentence and Jawad Karim, 18, of Oldham, was ordered to serve 21 months in a young offenders' institution.Judge Hammond said: "This was a serious offence, because of the nature of the stolen property – a vast quantity of passports and visas extremely valuable to the criminal fraternity, the terrorist fraternity and the illegal immigration industry."Police estimated shortly after the sham robbery that the stolen documents had a black market value of £2.5m.Burke, from Oldham, did not report the incident until he returned to his employers, Knutsford-based company Sameday, about 45 minutes later. He was arrested and later charged with conspiracy to steal. The van driver was cleared of the same offence earlier this month.
