Northumbria police are investigating claims that close-up pictures of hundreds of naked people have been offered for sale in Tyneside pubs.The stills were said to have been taken from closed-circuit TV footage when artist Spencer Tunick photographed 1,500 volunteers in Newcastle and Gateshead last July.Northumbria's deputy chief constable David Warcup said the force was investigating a complaint into the possible misuse of CCTV footage. "We have spoken to a number of officers and police staff and as a result two members of staff are in the process of being suspended."
