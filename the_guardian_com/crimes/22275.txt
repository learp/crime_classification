An NHS worker is facing jail after hundreds of thousands of pounds meant for vital cancer drugs at a world renowned hospital were used to pay for shopping sprees and mortgage payments.Stacey Tipler exploited her job in the accounts department to help orchestrate a scam that resulted in just over £642,000 being diverted from the Royal Marsden in London.The cash was funnelled to a group of co-conspirators, who then passed the lion's share to Tipler's partner, Scott Chaplin, the ringleader.But the couple's associates used the rest to pay their mortgages or spend thousands on luxury items such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton garments and Apple gadgets. One of the perpetrators spent £200 at the London Parachute School.For several months after December 2011, Tipler, 32, substituted account numbers of pharmaceutical firms who were due payment for cancer drugs with the details of men recruited by Chaplin.At one point a firm threatened to stop supplying medication after failing to receive payment because of their actions, Southwark crown court heard.Before sentencing, Judge Anthony Leonard QC described the fraud as "highly professional" and "brilliant".He added: "I've not seen a better one, frankly, in the course of dealing with quite a few years of fraud."While some of the money was recovered after the deception was detected, the hospital remains £310,000 out of pocket, prosecutor Anthony Hucklesby said.He said: "[The hospital's] patients tend to have more complex types of cancer, and this fraud targeted the suppliers of essential cancer drugs to the hospital."There was one stage that one of the main pharmaceutical suppliers threatened to stop supplying drugs to the hospital as a result of non-payment which would have meant that patient treatment could not continue."This was a fraud committed in gross breach of trust on Ms Tipler's part and a repeated targeting of the hospital on those numerous discrete occasions when bank details were substituted in by her."He said there was an "element of sophistication" in the ruse, with Tipler attempting to cover her tracks by running duplicate payments.Tipler, from Carshalton in Surrey, who worked at the hospital for 10 years, was found guilty after a trial of conspiracy to defraud.Chaplin, 33, also from Carshalton, was convicted of the same charge and a count of conspiracy to money launder.Six others, whom Chaplin recruited to the fraud, are also being sentenced for their roles.
