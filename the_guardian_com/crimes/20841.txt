An aggressive patient who claimed he could "haunt people in their dreams" and was deemed a "serious risk" to others killed a woman who had given him a place to stay after he was discharged from a psychiatric hospital with no followup care in place.Health professionals, the probation service and the police were criticised in a report published on Thursday into dealings with John Constantine, who beat and strangled former nurse Karen Welsh to death at her home in Cardiff.The report from the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) said there should have been greater effort to understand Constantine, who was only diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia after he killed the 52-year-old mother of two. It said opportunities were missed to arrest Constantine, 33, and to bring him under the supervision of the courts and the probation service.HIW chief executive Kate Chamberlain said: "Our review highlighted concerns in relation to the assessment and monitoring of [Constantine] by statutory agencies."Constantine was first put on probation after attacking a farmer with a hammer while living rough in south Wales in December 2008 and told he had to attend 10 treatment sessions with mental health professionals.He failed to attend any sessions and in May 2009 was admitted to Whitchurch psychiatric hospital in Cardiff after apparently trying to kill himself by cutting his wrists. He said he was able to commune with spirits and saw "shimmers" that he took to be ghosts.While in the hospital he befriended Welsh, who had been treated for depression and alcohol problems following the breakup of her marriage.The relationship was "platonic", the report said.But in hospital he became aggressive and threatened to "kill someone". A senior nurse judged that he posed a "serious apparent risk" to others. But just five days later he was discharged with nowhere to stay and no followup plans in place for his care.Both South Wales police and the probation service were told that he had been discharged, but it was not until January 2010 that he was seen by a probation officer. He said then he could haunt people in his dreams and changed his name by deed poll from Kevin Astley to John Constantine after a cartoon occult detective.Constantine killed Welsh in March 2010 and after his arrest was diagnosed as being "floridly psychotic" and having paranoid schizophrenia.A year later he was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after admitting manslaughter by diminished responsibility.The HIW report concluded: "We believe that had a greater effort been made to understand [Constantine's] mental health issues during his time at Whitchurch, a different diagnosis to that of 'personality disorder' may have been made."It added: "On more than one occasion opportunities were missed to apprehend [Constantine] and bring him back under the supervision of the probation service or the courts.The chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Ruth Hussey, said: "My thoughts are very much with the families of those affected by this serious and deeply distressing case."In this complex case, there were several key findings of concern. The Welsh government expects the local health board involved to work with other partners to take the appropriate actions and learn from this tragic case."
