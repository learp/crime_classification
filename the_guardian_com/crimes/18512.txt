A year on from the murder of the French student Amelie Delagrange in west London, police have issued new pictures of a van thought to have been used by her killer.It is exactly 12 months since the 22-year-old was found battered to death on Twickenham Green, in a killing that has been linked to a number of other attacks on young women, including the murder of the 19-year-old gap year student Marsha McDonnell.Yesterday, detectives released fresh pictures and CCTV images of a white Ford Courier van, registration P610 XCN, which they believe may have been used by the person responsible for Delagrange's murder. One of the CCTV images shows the van heading away from Twickenham Green minutes before Delagrange was found there, dying.Police also announced details of a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the vehicle.Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, of Scotland Yard, leading the investigation, said: "We still haven't found the white Ford Courier van ... which we believe was used by Amelie's killer."We believe the vehicle was used by the suspect on August 19 last year and he was in possession of that vehicle before that date. The vehicle was registered to Cargo Air Services, Stanwell, Heathrow. They sold the vehicle on and it could currently be in the lawful and legitimate possession of a member of the public."He added: "Locating it is of such vital importance to us that we have taken the unusual step of linking its recovery to the offer of a substantial reward for information leading to a prosecution."He said the van "seemed to have disappeared". It was possible it had been scrapped, burnt out or abandoned."We are absolutely certain that this was the van that was there on the night," he said. "However we have not been able to find it. The trail has gone cold."Police believe Delagrange's killer drove up to Twickenham Green in the van, parked, got out, attacked her and then got back in soon after before driving off. Camera footage has shown that the van was cruising around the area up to half an hour before she was killed.Her murder has been linked to a number of other attacks in the area, including the killing of Marsha McDonnell in nearby Hampton, and the attempted murder of another young woman, Kate Sheedy.It is also being linked to an attack on a 36-year-old accounts clerk, Dawn Brunton, who was hit from behind in Feltham, west London, on November 5 2003.Another linked case is the attempted murder and robbery of Sonia Salvatierra, 26, who was assaulted in Twickenham in November 2002. The team is also investigating an assault in Longford, in which a 33-year-old hairdresser was attacked from behind at a bus stop.It emerged earlier this year that Surrey police were examining links between Delagrange's murder and the killing of the 13-year-old Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler.Just a few days after Delagrange was killed, some of her belongings were found dumped in the River Thames at Walton-on-Thames near where Milly lived.Mr Sutton said tremendous progress had been made in the investigation and he was confident of catching the killer.There was a small group of people who were in the vicinity of the murder scene on the night Delagrange died but had not yet been identified. "We have no suspicion that any of these people were involved in the murder, but it is possible that they still have small pieces of information which could be of enormous help to us," he said.Anyone with information should call police on 0208 247 7911, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
