Relatives of the victims of serial killer GP Harold Shipman have won their High Court battle for an open inquiry. The ruling was announced a short time ago at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London.Over 100 relatives, backed by the media, had sought the order which would force Health Secretary Alan Milburn to hold a public investigation "to restore faith and confidence in GPs and the NHS".Today Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Jackson, ruled the decision to sit in private "contravenes Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights in that it constitutes unjustified governmental interference with the reception of information that others wish or may be willing to impart".Earlier this year Shipman, 54, of Mottram in Longendale, Greater Manchester, was convicted at Preston Crown Court of murdering 15 patients at Hyde, Cheshire, but he is suspected of killing nearly 200. At a recent hearing, family lawyers urged Lord Justice Kennedy and Mr Justice Jackson to intervene over the investigation into the deaths. They argued that Mr Milburn had been wrong to direct evidence to be given in private, and stressed that an open hearing was vital.But earlier David Elvin QC, appearing for the Health Secretary, had said the families had no "legitimate expectation" that the inquiry would be in public. The decision to hold it in private was plainly not irrational, he argued, and Mr Milburn had been entitled to decide that a private hearing was the best way to obtain evidence and implement any recommended reforms as quickly as possible. Richard Gordon QC, appearing for inquiry chairman Lord Laming, said tensions were resulting from the fact that the inquiry was not going to be as broad as the families of those who died would like. The Health Secretary was granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, although Lord Justice Kennedy said: "We don't necessarily encourage him to take advantage of that leave."
