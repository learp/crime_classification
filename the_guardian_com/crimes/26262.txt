At some point this year, with a bit of luck and a good following wind, the new policing and crime bill should finally become law. This is the bill that proposes to change the way we deal with prostitution in this country, creating a new offence of buying sex from a person who has been "subject to force" and doing away with the archaic and offensive term "common prostitute" to describe those, mainly women, who are caught persistently soliciting.In what seems like a torturously long and drawn-out course through parliament, the bill has undergone considerable amendments and provoked a great deal of debate, both on Comment is free and beyond. The original wording of the prostitution clause, which would have made it an offence to procure sex from someone "controlled for gain by a third person", has been replaced by the more watered down and less radical phrase I've cited above, and those of us who welcomed the original rumours, about two years ago, of a significant change in the pipeline to Britain's prostitution strategy are now left feeling ever so slightly disappointed in the end result.But as with any attempt to institute social change, we know that this one's going to take some time. Feminist campaigners may not have achieved everything we'd hoped to through the current bill, but that doesn't mean we're about to give up. We're determined that one day we will be able to live in a society where a whole class of women has not been set aside to be bought and sold, used and often abused, in a global industry of sexual exploitation.It's because of this refusal to give up, and this commitment to exposing the sex industry for what it really is , that on Wednesday afternoon Eaves and the campaign group Object launched their new initiative, Demand Change, in Portcullis House, Westminster. And yes, that is my name on the list of guest speakers: I'm really proud to have been able to contribute to such a great campaign.As it states on its website, over the coming years, because it will take years, Demand Change will be calling on the government to "fulfil its multiple international and domestic obligations to tackle demand for prostitution" and will be lobbying for the government to adopt the Nordic model of prostitution, which decriminalises those who sell sex and criminalises instead those who purchase sex. This is the model that has proved so successful in Sweden, and that has now been introduced in both Norway and Iceland as well. It recognises the multiple reasons women enter the sex trade, and refuses to punish women for the abuses they'd endured, the addictions they've suffered and the force and coercion they've been subjected to. It's a model that instead puts the focus on those who perpetuate abuse and who compound the harms done to vulnerable women by participating as customers in such an industry.As the site says: "It is only through tackling demand – holding the buyers of sex accountable for their actions and challenging attitudes towards the buying of sexual acts – that we will be able to end the sexual exploitation, violence and abuse experienced by many women and girls in prostitution."Those with a vested interest in defending or promoting the sex industry may think they've won a small victory with the amendments to the policing and crime bill, but with the launch of Demand Change and the enthusiasm and commitment to achieving change that we saw at Wednesday's event, any victory for the pimps and the punters is bound to be short lived. As everyone in the room agreed, it's time to bring an end to the selling of women and girls: who could possibly disagree with that?
