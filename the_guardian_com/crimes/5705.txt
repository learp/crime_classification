A man has been detained following an eight-hour stand-off with armed police at an Italian restaurant in Glasgow.Officers evacuated the Amarone restaurant and surrounding buildings after being called to reports of a man "acting suspiciously" at around 3.45pm on Friday.Nearby roads were closed as specialist police negotiators, armed officers and a Royal Navy bomb disposal unit were dispatched to the scene.The stand-off involved one man who was contained alone inside the restaurant.Strathclyde police confirmed the man was detained at around 11.45pm after officers got into the basement level restaurant. He was taken to hospital for checks."One male has now been detained," the police spokeswoman said. "Police are still at the scene and inquiries are ongoing. The man is on his way to hospital."Parts of central Glasgow were closed off and Buchanan Street subway station was shut. A large crowd gathered behind the police cordon on West Nile Street.Ambulance staff wearing helmets and fire crews were also called to the scene and witnesses saw police officers in balaclavas carrying rifle bags.Just before the man was detained three armed officers made their way round the side of the building, and ran into the restaurant shouting.Two police support units were ushered in through the cordon and five minutes later drove off, with blue lights flashing.Michael Irwin, a 19-year-old Glasgow University student from East Kilbride, had been travelling on the underground to Buchanan Street when he and other passengers were told they would have to get off at St Enoch. He said the area had been closed off since 4.30pm.Mr Irwin said: "I saw armed officers with shields in the area and I'd heard something about a hostage situation but I'm not sure if it's true. The dog branch was brought in and there is just loads of emergency services all over the place."
