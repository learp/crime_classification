Anyone who drives after taking illegal drugs should be prosecuted, senior police officers said today.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) called for the law to be changed so that penalties could be imposed on all drug-impaired drivers, not just those whose driving was judged by officers to be impaired.The Acpo spokesman on roads policing and chief constable of South Yorkshire police, Meredydd Hughes, said: "The law needs to be made much simpler, in that it should be made a simple offence to take illegal drugs and drive on the road. At present we have to test for the impairment of a driver suspected of taking drugs."Currently the police ask motorists whose driving they suspect is impaired by either illegal or prescription drugs to carry out a number of tasks to assess their alertness.These checks, known as the field impairment test, include asking drivers to stand on one leg, to walk in a straight line and to place a finger accurately on their nose.In law, drug driving is considered just as serious an offence as drink driving. The law makes no distinction between illegal and prescribed drugs, and does not state any legal limit for drugs as it does for alcohol. But drug driving suspects are not tested for the presence of drugs in their bodies, unlike drink driving suspects who are breathalysed.Senior police officers want roadside swab tests for suspected drug drivers as a deterrent to the growing problem.Mr Hughes said: "Acpo would like to see a way forward to test drivers for drugs rather than impairment."The Home Office said police already had sufficient powers to combat drug driving."We have given police full powers to conduct roadside compulsory preliminary tests for impairment and for the presence of a drug," she said.The spokeswoman added that the department was developing "a specification for roadside drug screening devices", which it hoped to issue later this year. It would then be up to manufacturers to design the test kits and seek approval from the home secretary to produce them for the police.Road safety charity the RAC Foundation said Acpo's proposal was problematic because some drugs could stay in the system long after they had an effect on the user.The executive director, Edmund King, said: "Cannabis can stay in the system for four weeks. A decent lawyer could argue that the driver was not impaired."The dilemma for the police is, do they have to set a legal limit for illegal substances?"Cannabis is known to impair coordination, visual perception, tracking and vigilance.The RAC Foundation also wants better labelling of prescription and over-the-counter medicines so consumers can know whether their driving is likely to be impaired.Mr King said: "We would like to see a traffic light labelling scheme introduced on drug packaging, with red meaning should not drive at all, amber means you should be wary of driving and green meaning you are OK to drive."Recent research has found a substantial increase in the number of road traffic accidents involving motorists under the influence of drugs.A Department for Transport survey on fatal accidents, published in 2000, found traces of drugs in 18% of cases - compared with traces of alcohol in 32% of cases.The Transport Research Laboratory found a six-fold increase in the number of people testing positive for illegal drugs between the mid-1980s and the late 1990s.Over the same period the number of drivers found to be under the influence of either prescription or illegal drugs trebled, and the proportion of those testing positive for multiple drugs also rose sharply.Mr King said: "Young people are twice as likely to have been driven by someone on drugs than they are to have been driven by someone under the influence of alcohol."We've heard reports in Scotland of some drivers using alcohol to disguise their drug use. They've been having half a pint of larger then three ecstasy tablets. The officers smell the alcohol on their breath, breathalyse them and find they're under the limit and let them go."Acpo's call for a change in the law comes as police forces step up their campaign against drivers under the influence of drink and drugs.Throughout the summer, officers will target motorists whose driving is impaired due to the effects of illegal or prescription drugs.Chief Constable Steve Green, of Nottinghamshire police, said: "The police service is not willing to tolerate this type of offending and it is our intention to crack down heavily during this campaign."Chief Superintendent David Snelling, of the Metropolitan police, said drink and drugs not only impaired the ability of drivers to judge speed and distances but also reduced their concentration and delayed their reactions."The chances of being involved in a collision are significantly increased - which may result in serious injury or death," he said.The drink and drug driving campaign will run until September 2.
