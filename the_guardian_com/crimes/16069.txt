Insurers are calling on the government to extend the period in which those hit by the riots can claim compensation from the police.Under the 1886 Riot (Damages) Act, anyone who has property or buildings damaged in a riot can request a payout from their local police force, with no limit on how much can be claimed, but the rules state this must be done within 14 days.While insurers have said they will be paying out on claims from customers caught up in the unrest, those without any cover have been urged to apply to their forces' compensation schemes.However, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said this could be very difficult to do within the 14-day time limit."In many cases the properties, residences and businesses damaged and destroyed are currently crime scenes or are entirely unsafe due to structural defects caused by fire, for example," it said. "In such cases owners are prevented from entering their homes or business premises to assess the damage they have suffered."The ABI has met with the home secretary Theresa May and asked that the claim period be extended to 42 days to give homeowners and business people chance to find out about the scheme and work out exactly how much they need to claim.The ABI said, contrary to some reports, that there was no need for anyone to designate the recent disturbances as a riot for the schemes to pay out. Instead, different criteria could be used, such as the number of people involved.Insurers will also be seeking to pass on the cost of claims to the police. So far, the estimate for damage has been put at tens of millions of pounds.
