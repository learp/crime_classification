Detectives hunting for Suzy Lamplugh, the estate agent who went missing in 1986, will begin a new search for her body today after receiving a tip-off.The 25-year-old disappeared after leaving her offices in Fulham, west London, to meet a mystery client. Her body has never been found and she was officially declared dead in 1994.Police are to search the disused Norton army barracks, near Pershore, Worcestershire, after a potential witness said he saw a mound of earth there around the time Lamplugh vanished.Scotland Yard officers will use ground-penetrating radar to comb the site, which has been previously searched in connection with the inquiry.A spokesman said yesterday: "Officers investigating the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh will be carrying out a search on Tuesday of a small area near Pershore in Worcestershire."The Met remains committed to solving the Suzy Lamplugh case and we will continue to work towards this end. We will follow up any information in relation to this case."John Cannan, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, was once named as the prime suspect in the murder investigation. He was questioned by police, but in 2002 the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to charge him.Lamplugh's mother, Diana Lamplugh, founded a charity in her daughter's name and spent years raising public awareness on personal safety issues alongside her husband, Paul. She was awarded an OBE in 1992 for her work with the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which is a leading authority in the field.After her disappearance, Lamplugh's white Ford Fiesta was discovered in Stevenage Road, Fulham, with the doors unlocked, the handbrake off and the ignition keys missing. Her purse, still containing Â£15, was in the pocket of the driver's door.Thousands of lines of inquiry have been examined by officers since she went missing, with DNA testing carried out on 800 unidentified bodies in the aftermath of her disappearance. The case was first closed in October 1987, but the file remained open and the investigation was officially reopened in 2000.In December of that year, officers conducted a fingertip search at the former army barracks in Norton, Worcestershire.Detectives have apologised for "significant opportunities" that were missed during the original inquiry. They said that if they had been grasped, there might have been a prosecution years ago.
