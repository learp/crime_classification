Serious concerns over the erosion of neighbourhood policing and the viability of some police forces in England and Wales following austerity spending cuts have been voiced by the official police watchdog.HM Inspectorate of Constabulary says that a similar round of spending cuts repeated in the future would put some smaller police forces in jeopardy within the next three to five years.The report by Tom Winsor, chief inspector of constabulary, on the impact of £2.5bn of austerity cuts over the past four years says a national debate is needed on future collaboration between forces and with other public services.The report says the 43 police forces in England and Wales have calculated that they need to find £656m in savings in 2015-16. The inspectors say that there is no immediate end in sight to the substantial cost reductions. If this pattern continues over the next three-year spending round, they have "substantial concerns about the ability of some smaller forces to withstand the anticipated budget reductions while maintaining an effective service to the public".The inspectors say the limited options to implement fresh cuts would inevitably drive some forces to make deeper savings in neighbourhood policing and they may struggle to respond to unexpected events such as riots, demonstrations, multiple murders or kidnaps.The inspectorate, in its fourth report on the impact of austerity cuts on policing, says most forces have risen to the challenge over the past four years by finding £2.5bn worth of savings while protecting their frontline crime-fighting capacity as best they can.But while some forces – such as Avon and Somerset, Norfolk, Lancashire and West Midlands – have been outstanding in their response, three forces – Bedfordshire, Gwent and Nottinghamshire – require improvement.The police workforce, which includes civilians and support staff, will have been reduced by 34,000 people by next March, including 8,500 fewer frontline police officers, with many forces reshaping and remodelling the way they work.The inspectors say they first voiced their concerns a year ago about the potential erosion of neighbourhood policing, which they describe as "the cornerstone of British policing".They say: "We have seen further evidence of this erosion in this year's inspection; as a result, our concern in this area is growing. Although forces have worked hard to protect neighbourhood policing, we have seen the workload and remit of neighbourhood teams broadening still further and higher than anticipated reductions of police community support officer numbers."The inspectors say that many police force leaders have told them that their police service could become "increasingly reactive – responding to 999 calls and investigating crime – rather than preventing and reducing crime".The inspectorate says that the ability of the police to prevent crime will be seriously undermined if neighbourhood policing is materially eroded: "The service must guard against a vicious circle emerging that involves less preventative activity, more reactive policing responses and spiralling demand. It is extremely important that action is taken now to prevent this from happening."Winsor said the likelihood of further savings on the same scale meant there needed to be a constructive debate now "in relation to how further reforms to the operation and efficiency of the police may be made to ensure that public protection is maintained to the highest practicable extent".
