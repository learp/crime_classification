The lead singer of rock band The Zutons, who broke a man's nose after his girlfriend was insulted, was convicted of assault today.Dave McCabe, 29, butted Peter Appleby during an alcohol-fuelled row outside a nightclub, Liverpool crown court was told.McCabe, who wrote the hit song Valerie – later covered by Amy Winehouse and Mark Ronson – reacted after one of Appleby's friends mocked his girlfriend's fur-collared coat, saying it looked like she had a beard.The singer denied assault causing actual bodily harm and claimed he had acted in self-defence.The jury of five women and six men took three hours to unanimously convict him.McCabe – whose songs include Please Calm Me Down and Havana Gang Brawl – looked disappointed.Recorder Alan Conrad QC adjourned the musician's sentencing to 29 October for a pre-sentence report.Conrad said: "I am granting you bail but that is no indication of the sentence I will impose."McCabe, dressed in a suit and tie, asked from the dock: "Does that mean I can leave the country?"
