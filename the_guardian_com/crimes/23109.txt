Jacqui Smith today warned against succumbing to "the counsel of despair" that claims Britain is broken and violence lurks on every street corner as she unveiled plans for a new "strategic vision" for policing.In her first keynote speech as home secretary, Ms Smith announced plans to publish a green paper early next year that will outline measures to deliver improvements in police performance.Speaking at the annual conference of the police superintendents' association of England and Wales, Ms Smith heaped praise on the bravery and professionalism of the police and the "pivotal importance" of their role in protecting the British way of life.Ms Smith said that burglary was down 60% over the last 12 years, violent crime at its lowest level for more than a decade and the chances of being a victim of crime at their lowest for 25 years."Let's not succumb to the counsel of despair that says that Britain is broken, that violence lurks on every street corner," she said.But the home secretary admitted that there was "more we can do" to improve performance and build greater public confidence.Referring to yesterday's publication of Sir Ronnie Flanagan's interim report on policing, Ms Smith acknowledged that the former chief constable of Northern Ireland's police force had set out clear steps for cutting red tape and making the job of every police officer more effective."It is clear to me that we need a change in culture - reductions in bureaucracy, sure, but also less aversion to risk," she said. "I want to work with you to shape this change and deliver the scale of savings that Sir Ronnie is already indicating could be possible."Mrs Smith said she looked forward to Sir Ronnie's final review, but added: "I think we all see the need for wider reform. If the service is to truly modernise and meet the challenges we all recognise, we need to work together towards a more strategic vision for policing."The green paper would "give structure and coherence to the reforms under way now and in the future", she said.
