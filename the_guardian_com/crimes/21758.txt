A man wanted for the murder of a friend whose dismembered remains were scattered round a housing estate in Basingstoke, Hampshire, sent text messages from Heathrow saying he had been in a fight and was going abroad.Police in the US are hunting Richard Markham, 27, who is wanted for questioning about the bludgeoning of Tristian Lovelock, 25, with a samurai sword.Detectives have questioned a taxi driver who was called late on Thursday night by Mr Markham, who asked to be taken to the best airport for getting a last-minute seat on a transatlantic flight. The dealer in oriental furniture bought a standby ticket to New York at 5.30am the following morning and flew to JFK airport six hours later. Police in New York said the flight arrived before an international alert for the fugitive, and no sign of him had yet been found on CCTV film.The alarm was raised in Britain when Lovelock's severed head was found under a hedge in Basingstoke, followed by the discovery of his legs and arms in gardens nearby.Mr Markham told taxi driver Richard Ketteringham that he "had been given his marching orders by his girlfriend and needed to get away".A friend of the missing man, who did not want to be named, said that Mr Markham had phoned a contact overseas about his plans. The friend said: "He texted everyone he knew, saying that he was off abroad. He used his phone to ring one of his friends in Australia and confessed what he had done and said he was leaving Britain. He appears to have been quite clinical about it. He sent text messages to others, saying he had had a fight involving his ex-girlfriend, and was leaving the UK for a while."Lovelock had been drinking on the night of his death with Markham and had gone back to the missing man's house on South Ham estate in Basingstoke. His torso and an arm were found there after police were called by a neighbour who found an arm in his garden.Detective superintendent John James of Hampshire police said: "We have sent an arrest warrant to the New York police and advised them Markham poses a serious risk."
