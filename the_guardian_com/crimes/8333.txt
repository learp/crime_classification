A Labour MP arrested for headbutting a fellow member of the House of Commons during a bar brawl has pleaded guilty to four counts of assault at Westminster magistrates court.Eric Joyce was suspended from the Labour party following a fight in a House of Commons bar on 22 February in which a Conservative MP was headbutted and punched.The 51-year-old former soldier and MP for Falkirk was charged with assaulting Conservative Stuart Andrew shortly before closing time at the Strangers Bar, which is open to MPs and their guests.He also attacked Tory councillors Luke Mackenzie and Ben Maney before turning on the Labour whip Phillip Wilson.He is expected to be sentenced later on Friday.After the incident at the Commons, Joyce also admitted to a relationship with a 17-year-old girl who had volunteered at his campaign office during the 2010 general election.He denied that the relationship had been sexual but confessed it had been misguided and said he would stand down at the next general election.Under parliamentary rules, MPs automatically lose their seat if they are sentenced to more than 12 months in jail, but there is no requirement for them to leave the Commons if they are charged with a criminal offence or convicted and given a lesser punishment.Despite his suspension as a Labour MP, Joyce can continue to sit as an independent with a full MP's salary of Â£65,738 a year, as well as allowances.Confessing to the Daily Record about the relationship with the teenager, Joyce said: "She was young and I kind of got my communications with her wrong."She was super-helpful, very friendly. I was very friendly with her for several months 18 months ago. She was a young, impressionable girl."The disclosure of his relationship sparked an angry reaction from the Scottish Labour leader, Johann Lamont, who said: "This is a man who has abused his position of power and authority. I'm disgusted, regardless of any other issues."
