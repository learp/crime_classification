Four men have appeared in court over an alleged attempt to take control of computers at a Santander bank branch and steal millions of pounds.It is claimed one of the plotters posed as an engineer in an attempt to fit a computer in a London branch of Santander with a "keyboard video mouse" device that allowed them to transmit its desktop contents.The gang allegedly tried to use the gadget to take control of computers at the branch in Surrey Quays shopping centre in south-east London.The attempt failed and the Spanish bank said they were unable to steal any money.Lanre Mullins-Abudu, 25, from Putney, south-west London, Dean Outram, 34, from north-west London, Akash Vaghela, 27, from Hounslow, west London, and Asad Ali Qureshi, 35, from south-west London, spoke only to confirm their names and details at Westminister magistrates' court charged with conspiracy to steal.Mullins-Abudu, Outram and Quereshi were remanded in custody by District Judge Howard Riddle while Vaghela was granted conditional bail.All four will appear at Southwark crown court on September 27. Eight other people have been bailed to a date in mid-November pending further inquiries.
