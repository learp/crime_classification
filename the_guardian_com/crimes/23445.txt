The paedophile gang jailed last year for sexually exploiting girls in Rochdale would have been caught sooner were it not for systemic failures in the borough council's former leadership, according to the council's new chief executive.Jim Taylor expressed disbelief that the nine men were able to operate for so long and said he was profoundly sorry for the failures revealed in a 137-page report into the council's handling of child sexual exploitation cases.Taylor said five council social workers had been suspended pending disciplinary investigations. Eight former employees have also been referred to the Health and Care Professions Council, the regulator for health and care professionals.Taylor, who succeeded Roger Ellis as Rochdale's chief executive in April last year, when the gang was on trial, pledged at a press conference on Friday to ensure the errors would never be repeated.But he said the council was powerless to act against former employees, or to act on Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk's proposal to claw back payoffs and pension pots paid to the former senior managers who were blamed for the culture of complacency outlined by consultant Anna Klonowski in the report.The report found Ellis "did not appear to be interested in children's social care issues" and said there was no evidence that he had any intention of investigating the events that led to the jailing of nine men in May last year for offences including trafficking, rape and sexual assault.Ellis presided over a council with "a lack of consistent senior leadership, or a lack of vision and direction in relation to child sexual exploitation", the report said.Taylor said his overriding emotion in response to the report was disbelief: "Why the issue was never given greater importance is inexplicable – and completely unacceptable."The report demonstrated that children were not listened to, and significant action was not taken. Therefore, the connections between cases were never made. If the pieces of the jigsaw were put together sooner, then I am sure it would have led to an earlier criminal trial."Taylor rejected suggestions from a reporter that the nine men – most of whom were British Pakistanis – were not caught sooner because there was a desire within the council leadership to be seen as being "politically correct". "There is no evidence of a politically correct motivation to ignore what was going on," he said.Taylor said disciplinary options open to the council in relation to the five current staff under investigation included dismissal.Danczuk said: "The council now needs to tell us what package Roger Ellis and other implicated senior officers left with. If Roger Ellis has one iota of decency, he will return this money."
