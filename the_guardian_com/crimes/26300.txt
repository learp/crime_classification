Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, today congratulated Essex police on being the first force to fully implement the government's new "policing pledge".Signed by every force in England and Wales, it includes a police commitment to setting priorities with local communities and updating them on progress at least once a month.Officers are required to respond to calls concerning agreed priorities within an hour and neighbourhood policing teams must spend at least 80% of their time "visibly" working for the community.Smith said: "The public are our strongest weapon in tackling crime and I passionately believe that empowering them to get a good deal through the policing pledge will play a powerful role in driving up the quality of policing for our citizens and in our communities."I congratulate Essex police force for being the first force to fully implement the pledge for their public."For the first time, the public will know the minimum standard of service they should receive and I look forward to all forces making the same, visible commitment to their local communities."All 43 police forces in England and Wales have promised to meet the pledge by the end of 2008.However, the TaxPayers' Alliance has criticised the initiative, saying the pledge was "stating the blindingly obvious". Matthew Elliott, its chief executive, said today: "The police should be genuinely answerable to the public, rather than having to indulge in this costly charade of accountability."The home secretary also announced that 60 areas had signed up to a government drive for high visibility "community payback" for offenders.Each "pioneer" area has appointed a neighbourhood crime and justice coordinator to oversee work projects for offenders.Smith said: "I am grateful to all of the 60 pioneer areas for signing up to take action to open up the criminal justice system so that the public can see the tough consequences for those that break the law and also drive forward the action needed so that the public know what their rights are from the police and other agencies when they are suffering crime and anti-social behaviour."The new neighbourhood crime and justice coordinators will be a dedicated resource to act on the public's behalf to make sure that justice is done and seen to be done in their local communities."
