He had been drinking cider.He slashed Zakaria Zain across the cheek, which needed five stitches, and in the leg.Their friend Khalid Osman suffered a cut hand when he tried to intervene and stop the attack.Sulliman had been watching the TV news with Zain when an item about the Woolwich murder was shown, a source close to the case said after the hearing.Zain expressed his disgust at the killing and he and Sulliman then started to speak in their native tongue, the source said, before a row broke out.Sulliman admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, wounding and having a blade, at a previous hearing at Teesside crown court.Andrew Teate, defending, said Sulliman, of Aire Street, Middlesbrough, was distressed by what he had done to his friends."It is alcohol that has played a very significant part in this offending," Teate said.Judge George Moorhouse jailed him for five years. He said: "These are very serious offences, so serious that a custodial sentence is the only suitable penalty."
