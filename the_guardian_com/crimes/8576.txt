The government was accused of "not so much a U-turn as a full-throttle reverse" yesterday after the justice secretary, Lord Falconer, admitted "we have changed our mind" on proposals last year to throw the family courts open to the media.Lord Falconer said the government had ditched its own proposals, unveiled last July, to open county court and high court family cases to the media. It would also introduce legislation to keep reporters out of family cases in magistrates courts, where their right to attend is currently enshrined in statute. The Newspaper Society said it was disappointed by the "full-throttle reverse". It added: "Given that the initial proposal to allow media access as of right was a government initiative, this volte-face is all the more of concern."The final proposals will continue to bar parents in family cases from talking to the media about court proceedings. Reporting restrictions will be tightened, giving the county courts and magistrates the same power as the high court currently has to impose bans on publishing information about children's cases held in private.The about-turn is a rebuff for justice minister Harriet Harman, who had made opening the family courts a priority to counter claims that miscarriages of justice were happening behind closed doors.Lord Falconer said responses to a consultation from young people, children's organisations, lawyers, many judges and local authorities had overwhelmingly supported keeping the media out. "The clear message was that the media should not be given an automatic right to attend family courts as this could jeopardise children's right to privacy and anonymity."
