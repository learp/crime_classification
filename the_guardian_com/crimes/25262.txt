So are we really in the grip of a knife-crime epidemic? Is it true that 'blade violence' is spreading everywhere or as the Daily Mail front page put it yesterday: "Knives: why no part of Britain is safe."The latest sets of annual crime figures from the police and the British Crime Survey present an apparently clear picture of historic falls in overall levels of violent crime of between 8% to 12% across England and Wales depending upon your chosen measure.We had it officially confirmed for the first time yesterday that in just over 22,000 offences of attempted murder, GBH and robberies, in the year to March 2008, a knife or other sharp instrument was involved. To put that in context - in one in five serious violent incidents someone used or threatened someone with a knife or a broken bottle. But that is only one year's figures and as it is the first time they were collected we have nothing to compare them with.One thing a force by force breakdown of the figures show us is that more than half the serious knife crime attacks happened in Britain's three major cities of London, Birmingham and Manchester. The shadow of 'blade Britain' cannot be said to reach in to Dorset (47 incidents), Norfolk (67 incidents) or North Yorkshire (66).The BCS, which has the limitations of small victim sample sizes as a measure of violent crime, suggests that knives were involved in 6% of all violent incidents in 07/08 which was little changed since the 7% recorded the year before. The national murder figures, which are up by 25 to 784 do not suggest a major surge in knife slayings although a breakdown of the figures in the homicide index will not be available until later this year.This does not mean however that there has not been highly concentrated localised 'spikes' in the number of knife attacks at a time when violent crime is rapidly falling in the rest of the country. But don't mistake those highly publicised and horrific incidents for the national crime picture.
