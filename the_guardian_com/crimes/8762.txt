A "tiger kidnapping" is the term given to the taking hostage of bank or security employees, or their families, to carry out a robbery, as happened at the Securitas depot in Tonbridge. It gets its name from the predatory nature of the crime.Such kidnappings are growing and will increasingly involve "softer banking sector targets as well as cash-rich businesses", according to Control Risks, the security and business intelligence consultants.In 2006, the latest year for statistics, there were 20 tiger kidnappings in the UK, up from seven in 2001, with many more aborted attempts left unrecorded, Control Risks said."As physical security has improved at the traditional heist targets such as major banks, criminals have focused on the human element," said James Lewry, a senior consultant at Control Risks.He said staff with access to safe keys and vaults or security codes are an area to be exploited and criminals also force people to help the crime by threatening family and friends.He suggested most such kidnappings are planned and executed by highly organised and professional criminals. Although violence is always threatened, it is rarely used."We believe that as these gangs shift their focus to softer targets within the banking sector and to retailers with lots of cash on the premises, less experienced criminals will be drawn in. This is particularly worrying as it dramatically increases the chance of things going wrong."Tiger kidnapping is not a crime defined in law but a phrase applied to a collection of offences that describe the abduction or alleged holding of hostages to persuade someone to participate in a crime.The crime is increasingly common in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Just before Christmas in 2004, a gang used a tiger kidnapping as part of the Â£26.5m raid on the Northern Bank in Belfast.
