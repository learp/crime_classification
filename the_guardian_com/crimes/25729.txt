Police forces across the country were frantically trying to round up more than 70 violent criminals last night after the home secretary promised they would be caught within three days.Although Charles Clarke said all 79 of the most dangerous criminals who were wrongly released instead of being deported were listed on the police national computer, it was not clear whether their addresses were current.Mr Clarke said deportation proceedings had begun against 63 criminals, suggesting that officers had some idea of the whereabouts of these men. But given the last publicity of the last few days it is likely that many of them may have absconded, according to immigration lawyers.Roy Ramm, a former commander of Scotland Yard, said: "It is unclear whether the police do know where these people are. Finding these people is the thing, it is not going to be easy."There was also confusion yesterday among senior police officers over the powers they have to arrest criminals who have served their sentence and have not been considered for deportation. While some immigration barristers said police could arrest anyone pending a deportation order, senior officers believe they do not have the power to arrest those released from jail who should have been considered for deportation.A senior police source told the Guardian: "There is no power of arrest for these people.They've served their sentence, they are not unlawfully at large, therefore there is no power of arrest."Mr Clarke's revelation that over the last four days just six of the 79 most dangerous offenders have actually been arrested and are now being deported will not increase public confidence in the ability of the police to find the remaining 73 offenders. The home secretary said further arrests were expected later last night or over the weekend, adding to the pressure on police officers across the country.The missing 73 could include nine rapists, five killers, five paedophiles and seven sex offenders. Mr Clarke's admission that five of the criminals had reoffended will only add to the pressure to arrest those still at large.In all, 1,023 foreign criminals were released between 1999 and 2005 instead of being considered for deportation. As yet Mr Clarke has said little about the 900 lesser offenders who are at large, but it is likely that further checks will reveal that many of these have committed further offences, given that the reoffending rate of prisoners nationally is more than 50%.The offences carried out by the five known to have reoffended and been convicted since being released include grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm, drugs offences and violent disorder. It is these types of offences which the latest crime figures show rose in the last three months of last year. Mr Clarke admitted last night that further checks were likely to reveal further cases of reoffending, though he believed these would be for minor offences.Mr Clarke's admission that at least one of the criminals being hunted has been accused of another rape and two others have been accused of sexual offences was very serious, according to Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman. "One of the tests of the seriousness of all this was whether there had been other convictions and whether these were for serious offences. There have been."Senior officers within the Association of Chief Police Officers have spent the last four days trawling through the police national computer in an attempt to find the most serious offenders, after being passed a list by the Home Office. As and when names came up they were passed on to the relevant police forces and probation boards as the hunt went on.But Jawaid Luqmani, an immigration lawyer, was not optimistic at the chances of catching the missing men within "hours" as Mr Clarke predicted. He said: "It is likely that with all the furore in the media, most people inadvertently released are likely to have gone deep underground and buried themselves where sunlight does not shine."Number crunching· Seventy-nine of the 1,023 offenders wrongly released into the community are considered to be violent criminals· The 79 include nine rapists, four kidnappers, five killers, five paedophiles and seven sex offenders.
