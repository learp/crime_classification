Danny Care, the Harlequins scrum-half, has been arrested for a drink-related offence for the third time in three months. The 25-year-old said he was "caught short" in a taxi on the way home from a night out in Leeds on Sunday morning.He was found urinating against a wall by British Transport Police, who arrested him for being drunk and disorderly before releasing him with a caution."I understand the link that will be made to previous offences but, as with my fine in December in Weybridge, the issue is more one of a small bladder than excessive drinking," Care told the Daily Mail. "I am working hard on and off the pitch to overcome any issues and while this is another small setback, I will continue to do this."Care, who played in Quins' 9-9 draw at Newcastle on Friday night, was thrown out of the England squad by the caretaker coach, Stuart Lancaster, following the two earlier offences and will miss the whole of the Six Nations. He was fined £3,000 and banned for driving for 16 months after pleading guilty to drink-driving on the M3 on New Year's Eve.He was also arrested in December in Weybridge, Surrey, for being drunk and disorderly and was served with an £80 fixed-penalty notice.Lancaster had said it was a difficult decision to drop Care but "I know him well enough to appreciate he will never make this mistake again. I do not think he has a lifestyle problem". The Quins director of rugby, Conor O'Shea, fined Care £10,000 after he was arrested for drink-driving and said the club was "deeply disappointed".
