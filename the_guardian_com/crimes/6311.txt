Two men have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of James Hughes, the severely disabled 22-year-old who went missing at the weekend, police said tonight.A body was discovered this afternoon at a property in the Church Hill area of Redditch, Worcestershire. West Mercia police said a postmortem examination was being conducted to establish the cause of death, and arrangements were being made for formal identification.The two suspects were being questioned at Kidderminster and Redditch police stations.Hughes, who has the mental age of an 18-month-old child, and his mother, Heather Wardle, were reported missing from their home in Loxley Close, in the Church Hill area, on Saturday.On Monday, local teenagers found Wardle's body in an area of "dense undergrowth" off Winyates Way, minutes from the family home. She had a ligature around her neck, police said. The 39-year-old had last been seen by a family member at 6pm last Friday, when she said she was going out to visit a friend. It was not clear when Hughes was last seen. Police said Wardle's death was being treated as "unexplained". Neighbours said Wardle, who had three other sons aged six, eight and 18, had been acting strangely in recent weeks. Sara Hay, 32, said yesterday: "She didn't look her normal self on Friday afternoon, she just looked fed up. She's not the type of person to just walk off and leave her other children, because she dotes on her kids."Lyn Parkes, 48, said: "Poor James can barely walk on his own, so she must have had someone else helping her. It was her who kept the family going."Hughes' natural father, Paul Hughes, 41, a company director, did not live with Wardle.
