Michael Stone had plotted to stab Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness before cutting their throats when he stormed the Northern Ireland Assembly in November 2006, a court was told today.Stone, 53, is on trial at Belfast crown court for attempting to murder the Sinn Féin leaders, on the day McGuinness was designated to become deputy first minister.He has denied the charges, claiming his attack was "performance art". His plan was foiled when he was detained by security at the building entrance.Charles Adair QC, prosecuting, told the court that after being arrested by police Stone said: "My intention was to walk into the debating chamber and look for where Adams, McGuinness and Sinn Féin were sitting. I would have lobbed several nail bombs to cause confusion."I plan[ned] to stab Adams and McGuinness and cut their thoats.''Adair also said Stone had claimed he would use "close-quarter tactics" to slit the throats of Adams and McGuinness.Stone had admitted relying on the fact that assembly members did not carry personal protection weapons in the debating chambers, Adair said.Stone is facing 14 charges, including possessing homemade explosives and an imitation gun with intent; carrying a garrote, three knives and an axe, and assaulting staff members.Adair told the court Stone explained to police why he had planned to kill the men while officers escorted him to hospital after he complained of chest pains following his arrest."I see Adams and McGuinness as republican war criminals," he had said. "Adams and McGuinness don't deserve to be in a devolved government. It would be a bastardisation of democracy.''Stone also said that he "just can't handle" the prospect of republicans in government.The court heard that Stone, who has severe arthritis and walks with the aid of a stick, had spent two hours approaching the building through the Stormont grounds.A security guard then noticed him spray-painting "Sinn Féin IRA war" on the front of the building.When the guard challenged him, the court heard, Stone pulled a gun and said: "You had better fucking run or you're a dead man.''The gun later turned out to be a replica.The guard raised the alarm but Stone entered the main revolving door where he was trapped by another guard.The court heard that Stone dropped a bag and used a lighter to ignite what appeared to be a fuse before flinging the bag into the entrance hall and shouting: "Fucking evacuate. It will go off.''The alleged bomb, which Stone told the guard would explode in five minutes, failed to do so. It is thought to have malfunctioned after becoming damp in heavy rain.Stone told police he had acted alone: "I am a dissident loyalist freelance."He said he had left the Ulster Defence Association the day he was released from the Maze prison under the Good Friday agreement.Stone's defence counsel, Arthur Harvey QC, said a DVD of the events, which had just materialised, would show Stone's actions were performance art.The court has now been adjourned for a week so the DVD can be examined.
