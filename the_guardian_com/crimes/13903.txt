A special constable was stabbed to death outside her home just before midnight last night, it emerged today.Nisha Patel-Nasri was found in the street outside her home in Wembley, north London, with stab wounds.The 29-year-old, who was in her nightclothes, was treated at the scene by neighbours and police officers but was pronounced dead in hospital.Detective Superintendent Julian Worker appealed for witnesses to the "atrocious and horrendous" murder of Ms Patel-Nasri who, in addition to volunteering as a special constable, ran a successful hairdressing business near her home."Nisha was a very well known member of the community," he said. "She was also very popular with her colleagues in the local police station."It is tragic that somebody who gives up their time and serves their community meets their death in such tragic and violent circumstances."Ms Patel-Nasri was off duty and at home alone when she went outside, apparently to investigate a "disturbance".Neighbours said they heard her scream and raised the alarm after finding her in the street. Some said they had seen a man in a hooded top running away.A neighbour and police officers called to the scene gave Ms Patel-Nasri first aid before she was taken to Northwick Park hospital, where she was pronounced dead.One neighbour said he heard a woman screaming and went outside to find the special constable clutching a wound. She was wearing pyjamas and carrying a torch."We asked her what happened ... she was saying: 'Somebody stabbed me, please call the police'," Girish Shah said. He added that another neighbour had tried to stop the bleeding by holding padding to the wound.It emerged today that Mrs Nasri had disturbed three men when they attempted to burgle her home on Saturday night. They fled after she challenged them at around 10pm.Police are investigating whether there could be a link between the two incidents, but detectives said that was only one of a number of potential lines of inquiry.A post-mortem is due to take place at Northwick Park hospital later today. It is thought Ms Nasri died from a single stab wound, although police could not confirm whether the injury was to her stomach or her leg.Detectives are attempting to work out what caused her to leave her house just before the murder, and a police source said: "We are not discounting the fact that she may well have been responding to an incident of some sort."Police said the neighbourhood was a low-crime area in which cases of burglary fell by 32% in the last financial year. Dozens of forensic officers are searching the surrounding area for the murder weapon.Ms Nasri's husband ran a limousine hire company from their home, and police are investigating whether the attacker had been attracted to the house by the expensive vehicles parked outside.They are appealing for anybody who might have seen somebody acting suspiciously just before the murder or who saw a man running in the direction of Harrow Road to come forward.Jan Berry, the chairman of the Police Federation, said the murder demonstrated the dangers faced by officers, whether on or off duty. "Our thoughts are with Nisha's family, friends and colleagues at this time," she said.Last November, PC Sharon Beshenivsky was shot dead and her colleague Teresa Milburn injured as they investigated reports of an armed robbery in Bradford.
