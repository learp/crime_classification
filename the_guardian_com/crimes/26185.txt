By the age of 16, Hughie (not his real name) was a prolific and accomplished car thief. He had already been arrested three times and taken before a children's hearing panel and he knew the patience of the authorities was wearing thin.At his last hearing, the chair of the panel warned him that if he offended again, the matter would almost certainly go before the criminal court and he was likely to receive a custodial sentence.The problem was that Hughie, from a crime-ridden estate in his native Glasgow, loved cars. He says he got a thrill every time he fired an engine up."Other kids were into drink and weed, or heroin. Cars were my drug," he says.He was assigned a new social worker, who tried a different approach: instead of warning him off cars, he arranged for Hughie to spend his spare time working in a garage, where he learned to service and repair motors. The move changed his life."By my 17th birthday, when I got a provisional licence, I could strip an engine down and put it back together again in quick time," he says. He did just that with his first car, an old banger that he "bought for peanuts".Now, 13 years on, Hughie is a long-distance lorry driver â€“ still getting a kick from being behind the wheel. In his spare time, he restores classic cars and sells them on for a profit. What if his law-breaking activities had taken him to a criminal court and probably to prison?Hughie says he would likely have followed a path of crime, as many of his teenage pals had done. He says some people see the children's hearing system as a soft option but for him, it worked."That guy [the social worker] saw behind my offending and aimed my love of cars in the right direction. I owe him, and the system, big time."
