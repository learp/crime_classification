Forensic specialists in Bradford are checking a large black suitcase containing tools which was found by police divers yesterday in the river Aire, close to the weir where the body parts of murder victim Suzanne Blamires were discovered.A small quantity of remains which could be human are also being analysed after they were discovered on the same muddy stretch as the equipment.The tools are thought to include car maintenance and DIY equipment.Police are continuing the river search at Shipley, four miles from central Bradford, in the hope of finding links to two other women believed to have been murdered, Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth.Intense activity, including an excavation, continued near the Bradford flat of Stephen Griffiths, 40, after he was charged with killing all three women, who worked as prostitutes in a red light area nearby.Police, working from a group of marquees in factory and office car parks by the Aire, are expecting plenty of irrelevant material to emerge from an urban stretch of the river often used for illegal dumping.The site remains cordoned off, but people have attached a small collection of bouquets of flowers to nearby railings.A spokeswoman for the West Yorkshire force said: "The tools are to undergo a full forensic examination, and at this stage it is unclear whether the remains found are human or animal. Officers will search areas of Bradford city centre and the river Aire throughout the day and are also proactively following several lines of inquiry. This will continue throughout the bank holiday and into next week."Although no trace has yet been found of Armitage, 31, and Rushworth, 43, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service's complex case unit in West Yorkshire, Peter Mann, approved murder charges against Griffiths in all three cases.He said on Thursday that close examination of police material so far assembled convinced him that there was "sufficient evidence to charge Stephen Griffiths with their murders and that it is in the public interest to do so".Griffiths has not yet entered a plea, after brief appearances on Friday at Bradford magistrates court and the city's crown court. He gave his name to the district judge, Susan Bouch, as the "crossbow cannibal", but agreed to his correct name before Judge James Goss QC at the crown court.Griffiths, who was educated at the independent Queen Elizabeth's grammar school in Wakefield and at Leeds University, will next appear in court on 7 June via a video link from Wakefield prison. He had lived for 13 years in the converted mill on Thornton Road, which also continues to be a centre of police activity.Blamires' partner said yesterday that he had accepted her work as a prostitute to pay for the heroin to which both were addicted. Ifty Hussein, who is 37 and unemployed, denied that he had forced the 36-year-old on to the streets from the rundown house they shared.He said: "I wish it was me who was dead. We were planning to get clean in the next month, make a fresh start and get on with our lives together."
