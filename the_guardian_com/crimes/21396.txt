Police investigating the attempted murder of a Russian banker in London last month have released CCTV images of the suspect. The stills show the man moments after German Gorbuntsov was shot several times as he entered his block of flats near Canary Wharf on 20 March.Scotland Yard is liaising with Russian police on a major criminal inquiry for the first time since the diplomatic fallout in 2006 over the death of dissident Alexander Litvinenko. The suspect is described as white, 6ft, and slim, and wearing a dark hooded top. He was seen running away from the scene and detectives discovered a gun, hooded top and bag nearby.Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor, leading the police investigation, said: "We are continuing to examine CCTV footage from the area, and are keen to speak with anyone who may have information. Were you in Byng Street or nearby, shortly before or after 7.20pm on Tuesday 20 March? Did you see anyone acting suspiciously? Did you see the man in the CCTV stills?"Gorbuntsov, 45, remains in a stable condition in hospital. The attack was not initially acknowledged by police beyond saying a shooting had taken place.It only confirmed the name two days after news of the attack in the Russian media.Gorbuntsov had recently given information to Russian police investigating the attempted murder of another banker, Alexander Antonov, in 2009. Three Chechen men were convicted, but police never established who had hired them.Investigators in Moscow reopened the case earlier last month after information from Gorbuntsov.
