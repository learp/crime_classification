This is the text of the letter Baby P's mother wrote from prison to Judge Stephen Kramer at the Old Bailey. Some sections have been edited for legal reasons.Dear Judge,I am writing this letter as I am not sure of a better way of expressing my regret … I except [sic] I failed my son Peter, for which I have pleaded guilty. By not being fully open with the social workers, I stopped them from being able to do a full job.As a direct result of this, my son got hurt and sadly lost his short life. I am never going to see my lovely son grow into the lovely sweet man he would have been …I have lost all I hold dear to me. Now every day of my life is full of guilt. I am trying to come to terms with my failure as a mother. I punish myself on a daily basis and there is not a day that goes by where I don't cry at some point.I have let down my … family, ex-husband, myself, and most importantly my darling son.Whilst I appreciate I am going to be given a custodial sentence I would like to say I am sorry for the pain and suffering my failure has led to.I can only hope and pray my … family, my ex-husband included, can one day forgive me for my mistakes. However, I can never forgive myself for my shortcomings. I am truly sorry.
