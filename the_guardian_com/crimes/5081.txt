Two alleged hitmen killed an innocent schoolboy when they went to the wrong house, a jury has heard.Ben Hope and Jason Richards were accused of showing "staggering incompetence" by stabbing bright teenager Aamir Siddiqi, 17, in error.The jury at Cardiff crown court heard that A-level student Aamir was knifed to death by masked knifemen in the hallway of his family home.His parents tried to fight off the men – but were also stabbed by Hope, 38, and Richards, 37, the court was told.Hope, of Roath, Cardiff, and Richards, of nearby Cathays, both deny murder.The two were hired to carry out a revenge attack on another man in a street less than 100 metres away, said Patrick Harrington QC, prosecuting."On a sunny Sunday afternoon, this young man was stabbed to death in the hallway of his home," he said."Aamir's father and mother intervened to try to stop that murderous attack but they too were stabbed."Hope and Richards arrived at 1.30pm and that attack came out of nowhere for Aamir. Neither he nor his parents had any expectation that their lives would be shattered by that attack that day."These two men had been recruited to carry out that attack by Mohammed Ali Ege over a debt. Tragically for Aamir and his family, the killers went to the wrong house."They had been contracted to carry out their lethal attack at a different address."But with what can only be described as staggering incompetence, they went to wholly the wrong address and killed an innocent young man who was waiting for his Qur'an teacher."Harrington told the court that Hope and Richards spent some of their "blood money" on a computer and shoes.He said: "While the emergency services attempted to revive Aamir, the defendants went off in pursuit of their blood money."They then went on a shopping spree. It's a chilling thought that in this city there are two men who murdered for the price of a pair of training shoes and a laptop computer."That is what Ben Hope bought later that afternoon – he spent £700 on a laptop in PC World and £100 in a Foot Locker shoe shop."The jury was also told that Hope "howled" throughout the attack to intimidate the victim.Harrington said the two men later blamed each other for the murder. "Ben Hope admits he was in the company of Jason Richards at times during the day and he went to the shops with him," he said."He claims that during the afternoon, having taken heroin, he fell asleep and does not know anything Jason Richards did."Richards blamed the killing on Hope and a man from Sheffield who was in Cardiff on business.Harrington added: "He claims that although he was at Hope's house on the morning of the killing, he did not go with him to the Siddiqi house."He noticed the two men were agitated when they came back. He asked them what had happened and they told him: 'It's better you don't know.'"Two very different stories, but they seem to be agreed about one thing – that the killer is in the dock. What they are doing is pointing a finger of blame at each other."But he told the jury: "These are the two men who went to the home of Aamir Siddiqi and carried out their lethal contract."The court heard that Aamir was stabbed in the neck on the doorstep of his family's large semi-detached home in the leafy Roath Park suburb of Cardiff in April last year.The intended victim was a father-of-four living around the corner, it was claimed.Harrington said: "They were disorientated, possibly because of drugs, when they went to completely the wrong address."The boy's father, Iqbal, 68, and mother Parveen, 55, were both injured as they tried to help their son.Aamir was passionate about sport and planned to take a degree in law at Cardiff University after completing his A-levels at the £9,000-a-year private school he attended.The trial continues.
