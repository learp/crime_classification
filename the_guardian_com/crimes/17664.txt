Crime on Britain's railways was up 5.6% last year, according to figures compiled by the British Transport police (BTP), which were published today.Most of the increase was due to crimes along rail routes. Offences such as obstructing trains and endangering safety more than doubled in England, Wales and Scotland. Police said such offences had been "seriously under-reported" in the past. The figures emerged as a result of improved communication between Railtrack and train operators, and gave a "much more accurate picture of the extent of the problem". BTP chief constable, Ian Johnston, said there had been "real progress" in building an industry-wide strategy to combat track crime. But he added: "Even so, only a fraction of these potentially dangerous events are recorded by the police." BTP's annual report showed that robberies on trains - using violence or the threat of violence - rose 26% to 3,408 incidents last year across England, Wales and Scotland. There were a total of 783 robberies, more than two a day, on the London Underground, a rise of 33%. Some 88% of all robberies on trains in 2001/02 were in the London area. A spokesman for BTP said robbery figures were already falling: in the first three months of 2002/03 they were down 30%. Last year theft from passengers, including pick-pocketing, was up 4%. Theft of railway property was up 18%, while criminal damage and fraud were down 8% and 21% respectively, the report said. Mr Johnston said: "It has been a year of re-building for the rail industry after the Hatfield crash. For BTP it has been a year of considerable challenges, not least in confronting rising violent crime and robberies nationally and in responding to the aftermath of September 11." The report also highlighted an increase in disorder among travelling football fans, with an increase in related organised outbreaks of violence on trains and at stations. BTP spends 8% of its total budget and one third of its overtime budget on football policing.
