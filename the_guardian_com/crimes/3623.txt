They will next appear at Nottingham crown court on 18 June for a preliminary hearing.On Wednesday evening, police revealed that they had been charged with the murders of their children. During their first court appearance before magistrates in Derby on Thursday, a man and a woman had to be escorted from the court by police and court officials after they interrupted proceedings and shouted "scum" and "bastards" during the 10-minute hearing.The children were asleep in their beds upstairs when the fire broke out at the semi-detached property in the early hours. The murder charges were confirmed on Wednesday night by Derbyshire police and the CPS, following a recent appeal for information from the police.Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill, the officer leading the investigation, emphasised that the charges should not be seen as the end of the inquiry.He said: "We are determined to get to the truth of what happened and still want people to speak to us to tell us what they know about this tragedy."
