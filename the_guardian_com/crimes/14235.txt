A council leader has spoken of how he wrestled a gunman to the ground after he shot at two Royal Navy officers on board a nuclear submarine, killing one.The dramatic scenes unfolded during a civic visit to HMS Astute as it was docked in Southampton, Hampshire, at around midday on Friday.A Royal Navy serviceman was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody.Hampshire police are investigating the shootings in co-operation with Ministry of Defence (MoD) police and naval provosts.Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, a weapons engineer in charge of the vessel's missiles, was killed, while Lieutenant Commander Chris Hodge survived and is in a stable condition in hospital.Southampton city council leader, Royston Smith, was visiting the submarine with other dignitaries while it was berthed at the Eastern Docks on a five-day visit to the city.He described how he "wrestled" the gunman to the ground in the submarine's control room as he tried to stop him."Two shots were fired, straight after he entered the control room again and began shooting again," Smith told the BBC."I ran towards him, I pushed him against the wall, we wrestled to take the gun from him. He fired again, I wrestled again to get the weapon from him. I pushed him to another wall, I wrestled him to the ground and managed to take the weapon away from him then others came to help to restrain him."He said a group of schoolchildren had left the submarine shortly before the attack.The MoD said the shooting was not terrorist-related and there was no threat to the wider public.The gunman was believed to have been on sentry duty and the shooting happened during a weapons changeover between shifts. It is understood a SA80 service rifle was used.After the shooting, it is understood the gunman was handed over to MoD police who were there as part of the civic visit. He was then transferred to Hampshire police officers when they arrived minutes later.Sources said the motive for the shooting was unclear but they played down the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder being a factor, pointing out that the longest HMS Astute has spent at sea is 46 days.The MoD refused to comment on claims that it took place after a row over the use of a toilet.The defence secretary, Liam Fox, said: "I am greatly saddened to hear of this tragic incident and of the death of a Royal Navy serviceman."It is right and proper that a full police investigation is carried out and allowed to take its course."My thoughts and sympathies are with those who have been affected and their families."Chief Superintendent David Thomas, of Hampshire police, said the major crime branch investigation would involve obtaining statements from all those on board at the time, believed to number around 30.
