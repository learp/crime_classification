Extra police officers have been drafted in to the hunt for the murderer of Joanna Yeates, as it emerged that she was missing a sock, her shoes and her coat when her body was found.Eighty detectives, uniformed officers and civilian staff are now working on the case along with outside experts on murder investigations who have been brought in to try to make a breakthrough.Police insisted the inquiry was progressing well and reacted to criticism of the investigation by ITV News by barring it from an important media briefing. ITN, which produces ITV News, accused the police of trying to censor it.Detectives are working on around 1,000 lines of inquiry but attention today focused on the missing grey ski sock, which police said could have been kept by the murderer as a trophy or even used to strangle Yeates with.Police have said all along that Yeates's body was "fully clothed" when it was found on a roadside verge on Christmas morning. The landscape architect, 25, vanished from her Bristol flat on 17 December.But Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones, who is leading the inquiry, revealed that in fact she had not been wearing shoes or a coat and one sock was missing. The light-coloured coat she was wearing on the evening she disappeared was hanging on a hook at her flat and the boots she had on were also there.During a press conference at the headquarters of Avon and Somerset's major crime investigation unit, Jones held up a size five sock "similar" to the missing one and told reporters: "I am here this morning to talk to you about a missing sock. When Jo was found, although she was fully clothed, she was not wearing her jacket, she was not wearing her boots and she was only wearing one sock."The jacket and the boots have been found at her home address. That would indicate that Jo had returned home. However, the sock has not been found." Jones said the killer could have the other sock or it could be in a house or in a vehicle.The detective said he had an open mind over whether the sock was kept by the killer as a trophy and whether she may have been strangled with the sock. He refused to say if any other items were missing from the flat in Canynge Road.This afternoon a man approached police outside Yeates's flat and handed over a grey sock. Police said they did not believe it was the sock they were looking for.During the press conference Jones also revealed the police were looking at a theory that Yeates's killer or killers had planned to hide her body in the quarry near where she was found but had ended up dumping it on the verge, possibly because they could not get it over a low wall.There have been increasing concerns that the police appear to be no closer to finding the killer but Jones insisted he was happy with the progress of the investigation and had sufficient staff. An extra 10 officers are now working on the case, bringing the team up to 80.The police confirmed they are bringing in outside experts to help but would not confirm they were using a criminal profiler to build up a picture of the offender.Jones said forensic tests at Yeates's flat could still take weeks. "It is painstaking, meticulous work," he added. He also said they were looking at the movements of hundreds of vehicles over Clifton suspension bridge, the most obvious link between Yeates's home and the spot where her body was found three miles away.Police revealed that since an advert about the case was placed on Facebook on Tuesday it had been viewed nearly 250,000 times and hundreds of people had clicked on the police's contact form.Meanwhile police in Dorset say they are becoming "increasingly concerned" about the disappearance of a 28-year-old woman called Helen Van-Duivenbode who has been missing since December 20 – three days after Yeates vanished. The cases are not being linked.Media rowGrowing tension between some reporters and Avon and Somerset police came to a head today when ITV News was barred from a press conference after broadcasting a report criticising elements of the Joanna Yeates investigation.The force also complained to the media regulator, Ofcom, about what it said was "unfair, naive and irresponsible reporting" on ITV1's News at Ten last night.A spokesperson said: "We must step in if we feel coverage will hamper the investigation."David Mannion, the editor-in-chief of ITV News, called the force's decision "irresponsible" and said it had developed into an issue about the freedom of the press.Mannion said the programme had made numerous attempts to contact the police, before its report went out suggesting that some basic police procedures did not appear to have been carried out, but did not get a response.A spokesman for ITN, which produces ITV News, said: "This decision will result in millions of viewers not being able to see new evidence or hear the latest police calls for witnesses."Our coverage has helped maintain awareness of this case, and we strongly disagree with Avon and Somerset constabulary's attempt to censor what information we can broadcast."Avon and Somerset police later reversed their ban of ITN – but said they would bar other media organisations if they "hampered" the investigation.
