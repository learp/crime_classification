An aristocrat from one of Britain's grandest families has been jailed for two years after admitting beating his wife over a 22-year period.Lord Edward Somerset, 55, admitted four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his wife, Lady Caroline Somerset, between 1990 and 2012.The attacks – in which Lady Caroline suffered bruising, scratching, hair pulling and a fractured finger – took place on the sprawling Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, where the couple lived.Bristol crown court heard Somerset, the third child of the Duke of Beaufort, became enraged and assaulted his wife when she confronted him about his addiction to drink and drugs including heroin and cocaine.In 2011, Lady Caroline received an "incredibly hard" kick to her foot after challenging her husband when he moved his new girlfriend into their home while they were married.She required hospital treatment last year from two attacks after arguing with her husband when he took crack cocaine in front of their youngest daughter.The judge, Mark Horton, jailed the peer, who appeared gaunt and dishevelled in the dock, for two years, telling him the attacks had left Lady Caroline in "emotional turmoil"."This is a case of two tragedies," the judge said. "A tragedy of a man born to privilege and almost limitless opportunities whose life has been marred and destroyed by an addiction to alcohol and drugs and an uncontrollable temper."The tragedy with which the court is concerned is the tragedy caused to your wife by you over a period of 22 years by your repeated and deliberate violence."You abused your position of power over your wife, not only physically but more importantly by psychological and emotional damage caused by that physical control."He also imposed a restraining order to protect Lady Caroline, who is in Australia, from her estranged husband.Somerset remained emotionless as the sentence was passed.Divorce proceedings between the couple, who have two daughters, Francesca and Rose, will be completed soon.In a victim impact statement, Lady Caroline, who initially refused to co-operate with police, said: "I don't know why Edward assaulted me and though he apologised, he never explained."I lost my confidence, my self-esteem and believed everything was my fault. I would state I have suffered enormous emotional and psychological damage."Representing Somerset, William Clegg QC said his client estimated there were two or three periods of domestic violence in the 30-year marriage."He is not pleading guilty on the basis that he hit his wife every day, every week, every month or even every year," Mr Clegg said."For quite long periods of the marriage they were happy and were both living alternative lifestyles."Lord Somerset has not asked for special treatment because of his background."Speaking after the case, Rob Allen, the senior crown prosecutor for CPS south-west, said the investigation into Somerset's actions had been complex."This case is a reminder that domestic violence permeates all sections of our society," Allen said."It also highlights the devastating consequences that this type of abuse has on victims and their families."
