Two police officers investigating a series of shootings and death threats in Northern Ireland were caught in a republican dissident ambush.The policemen escaped injury after their patrol car came under fire at around 6.50pm on Thursday in the Andersonstown district of west Belfast.Up to eight shots were fired at their static patrol car as the police officers were about to question members of the public about a series of violent incidents over the last seven days in the area.The incident happened in Rossnareen Avenue where a shooting occurred a week ago when a member of the travelling community was shot and wounded. This latest attack is not believed to be connected to last week’s shooting and appears to have been a dissident republican attempt to kill police officers.Police Service of Northern Ireland commander Ch Supt Nigel Grimshaw described the attack as a “reckless and mindless” murder bid on his officers. “The two officers were badly shaken but were not physically injured,” he said on Thursday night.First minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson condemned those responsible for the latest attack.The attack also comes after the PSNI revealed earlier this week that a security operation also in west Belfast last weekend uncovered during house raids a significant haul of mercury tilt switches used to trigger bombs and ammunition. The weaponry was to be used, it is believed, by hardline republicans to relaunch their terror campaign in the Greater Belfast area.Justice minister David Ford has condemned the attack, saying: “I unreservedly condemn the appalling attack on police officers in Belfast this evening. This was clearly an attempt to kill police officers serving the community. Those responsible for this cowardly act have also shown absolutely no regard for local residents. I am very thankful that no one was injured. “I would urge anyone with information to pass it to the PSNI on the 101 number or to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111. The sooner these criminals face justice, the safer our community will be.”
