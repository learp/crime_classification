The father of a young woman who died in the Aldgate bomb on 7 July 2005 asked a survivor who helped his daughter whether she was still alive when he left the wrecked carriage.In an emotional exchange at the inquests into the 52 victims of the bombings, John Taylor told Melvin Finn that the young woman Finn had helped was "probably my daughter, Carrie".Finn told the court that her eyes were closed but she "appeared to be alive". He and another woman, who was a doctor, had tried to support her torso and neck, he said.Asked by Taylor whether his daughter had said anything or murmured, he said: "No absolutely nothing, nothing at all."When asked whether his daughter was still with a doctor when he left her, Finn replied: "I think so, yes."Finn, who was in the second carriage of the Circle line train, where Shehzad Tanweer detonated his bomb, told the court Ms Taylor, 24, was "catapulted backwards" after the blast and was lying on the ground."I recollect her face and her eyes were closed," he said. She was not moving but bubbles of blood on her nose "suggested that there was breathing", he said.Earlier, Taylor had spoken movingly about his daughter, and told the court that she had got her dream job at the Royal Society of Arts three days before she died.Finn, who had an injury to his hand after the blast, described how in the immediate aftermath, he had asked himself whether he was still alive.He said: "I had obviously wondered what the hell had happened as I think I did... actually ask myself, am I alive? Bizarrely and then I realised if I'm asking myself that then I must be."He said he had "instinctively" avoided looking to his left.Earlier, a survivor of the Aldgate attack described being knocked out by the blast for 30 minutes as being like falling asleep with the television on and awaking to a "video nasty".Hilary Collyer recalled asking a fellow passenger what had happened and being told: "I think there's been a bomb, love."She said she tried to focus on part of the wrecked carriage to avoid looking at the dead and dying.Collyer also told the court she was classed as a "priority two" for medical aid but had to wait around an hour to be taken to hospital after she was evacuated.She had been travelling to work at Westminster on the Circle line train, in the same carriage as Tanweer.The moment of the explosion was as if someone had "flicked the light switch", she said, and she lost consciousness for about half an hour.Collyer said: "The way I have described coming to was I felt I had fallen asleep on the sofa and someone had put a video nasty on the telly."But I remember coming to with this scene around me just completely disorientated, just wondering what had happened." She said she awoke to "complete devastation".She told the hearing: "I became aware of this lady next to me and I remember asking her, 'What's happened?'"I remember she put her hand on my knee and said, 'I think there's been a bomb, love'."I thought, 'Oh OK.' I suppose that was when I thought, 'Don't panic.'"Collyer lived in Tippenham, near Norwich, in 2005, with her husband, Lewis, and four young children and worked for the Home Office.She tried to concentrate on part of the top of the train, telling herself: "Don't take any of this in, this is horrible."London Underground staff carrying torches passed the train two or three minutes after she regained consciousness.Later, the court was told that the O2 mobile phone network was disabled under protocol ACCLOC – a system allowing police to restrict telephone networks – after the bombs by a senior police officer at 11.40am.The inquests continue.
