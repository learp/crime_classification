Northern Ireland's police ombudsman is investigating the death of a dissident republican in police custody. John Brady died at Strand Road police station in Derry on Saturday night. It is understood the 40-year-old took his own life. He was being held in connection with allegations of an assault. Sinn Fein MP Pat Doherty said: "While the full details surrounding this death are unclear, it is vital that there is a full and open investigation." Brady had been imprisoned for the murder of a police officer in 1989. It is believed that he shifted his allegiance from the IRA to the Real IRA in Derry.
