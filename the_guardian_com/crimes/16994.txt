Two prison officers have been suspended at a privately run jail after an inmate was found dead in its segregation unit. Michael Bailey, 23, from Birmingham, who was serving four years for drug dealing, was found hanged in his cell early on Thursday afternoon. Prisoners at Rye Hill, Warwickshire, who contacted the Guardian claimed that Bailey had threatened to kill himself. The prison service confirmed that he had been placed on suicide watch and should have been checked every 15 minutes. One of the prisoners said there was a "running battle" in the jail between rival gangs, and police had been in the prison on the day of Bailey's death but had not spoken to prisoners. Rye Hill, opened in 2001, is operated by Global Solutions Ltd, (GSL) formerly known as Group 4. Last year the prisons ombudsman, Stephen Shaw, questioned "the fitness of GSL to run any removal centre or prison in this country". His remarks followed an inquiry into allegations of racism and abuse by staff at Yarlswood Detention Centre in Bedfordshire. Ruggie Johnson, from the Sheffield-based civil rights campaign group Monitoring North, said the death was "alarming" and called for a detailed investigation. A spokesman for Northamptonshire police confirmed that two officers at Rye Hill had been suspended. He added that the force was "working closely with the prison service as part of the ongoing investigation into Mr Bailey's death".
