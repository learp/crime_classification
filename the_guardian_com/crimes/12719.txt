Police investigating the murder of three women in Bradford have questioned their alleged killer Stephen Griffiths about a teenager who was battered to death in the city nine years ago, it emerged today.Nobody has ever been arrested in relation to the murder of Rebecca Hall, who was 19 when her body was found dumped in an alleyway in April 2001.Yesterday, her mother Angela Hall, 56, said police had questioned Griffiths about the case.Griffiths, 40, appeared in court on Friday charged with the murders of three prostitutes, Suzanne Blamires, Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth. He identified himself as the "Crossbow Cannibal" during the magistrates court hearing.Hall's mother said she had spoken to the police and they had asked him about Rebecca, but he would not say anything.She told the Telegraph: "I just want this to be over and then we have some closure and Becky can rest in peace. I hope that this goes before the court before I die, as I do not have long left in this world."Rebecca's body was found in the Allerton district of Bradford, close to where Blamires and Armitage lived. West Yorkshire police are searching 128 sites in and around Bradford as they attempt to locate the two remaining bodies. They have confirmed that they may consider possible connections to other unsolved cases.They include missing person investigations into the disappearance of 23-year-old Gemma Simpson in Bradford 10 years ago and Yvonne Fitt, who has been missing since 1992.Rushworth's mother, Christine Thompson, 72, was on holiday in Greece last week, when she learned police were treating her daughter's disappearance as murder. She said she felt as if her world had collapsed and she started screaming.Griffiths will next appear before Bradford crown court, via videolink, on 7 June.
