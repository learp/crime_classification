A man who threatened to kill a top racehorse unless it was withdrawn from a race at Ascot was given a suspended jail term today.Andrew Rodgerson, 26, made the threats after he forgot to place a series of bets on behalf of a syndicate and realised he would owe the group £50,000 if the last bet of the accumulator came in: this would require the race favourite, Conduit, to triumph in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.Rodgerson, of Balderstone near Rochdale, sent text messages and emails to Peter Reynolds, the general manager for the Ballymacoll stud farm in Ireland, which owned the 2008 St Leger winner.Ten days before last July's race he texted Reynolds: "Dear Peter, we would just like to warn you should Conduit run in the King George then the horse will be killed."Five days later, Rodgerson followed with an email saying: "I don't believe you are taking the threat of death to Conduit very seriously."He warned there were people "in and around Newmarket [where Conduit is trained] who are ready and willing. There will also be people around at Ascot on Saturday."Reynolds informed the police and Rodgerson, who had used his own mobile phone and computer to send the messages, was arrested at his home address two days before the King George, which Conduit subsequently won. Rodgerson admitted making the threats and pleaded guilty to threatening to committing damage at an earlier hearing, at Bolton crown court, after an initial charge of blackmail was dropped.Sentencing him to 34 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, Judge Angela Nield said: "If offences such as this are not dealt with seriously, then the [horseracing] industry will be undermined and those who work in it risk their livelihood being damaged and the manner in which they operate being altered for good."Rodgerson was also ordered to perform 240 hours of community service. When interviewed by police, he told them he had had a gambling habit since the age of 19 but the problem had grown worse in the 12 months leading up to his arrest.He was involved in a betting ring that required him to obtain the best available odds for people who would ask him to place money on horses.Joseph Hart, defending, said Rodgerson had mistimed the bet on Conduit when he had had a busy day at work in his job at a local travel agency.He said his client had been "utterly terrified" at the consequences of not paying the money back because he was acting for men he believed to be "shadowy". "He thought perhaps they would be people who would hurt him," said Hart.Conduit was worth £750,000 at the time. He had already won more than £1m in prize money before the King George, and won another £1m after claiming victory at Ascot. He is trained by Sir Michael Stoute, who trained Shergar, the racehorse that was kidnapped in Ireland in 1983, never to be seen again.
