The number of crimes committed by girls has risen by a quarter in three years, a study revealed today. According to figures in the Youth Justice Board's Annual Workload Data report, girls aged between 10 and 17 committed 59,236 crimes in 2006-07, up 25% from 47,358 in 2003-04. This compared to a 2% drop in crimes committed by boys over the same period, although young men still committed the majority of crimes.The most common crimes committed by girls were theft, violent attacks, criminal damage and public order offences. The authors also found that girls comprised less than 10% of those jailed for youth crimes despite being responsible for around 20% of the crimes committed.Around 16,000 girls were found guilty of violent attacks and nearly 20,000 of theft and handling stolen goods. A further 180 girls were convicted of arson. Approximately 1,000 girls were convicted of drug crimes, nearly 1,500 of motoring offences and 5,964 of public order crimes. The board said it had commissioned further research to investigate why crimes committed by girls had increased.
