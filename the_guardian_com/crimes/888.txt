A record 57 new legal highs have been detected so far this year, with the EU's early warning system reporting the appearance of more than one new psychoactive drug on the market every week.The rise and rise of legal highs is being driven by an explosion in the number of online retailers in Europe, which has risen from 170 in 2010 to 693 internet "head shops" identified in a snapshot survey this year.The rapid spread of the market, partly driven by organised crime, is revealed in the annual report from the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, published on Thursday.The experts say that, while cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines continue to be the main players for those taking stimulants across Europe, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs.The EU's drug agency says nearly 10% of 15- to 24-year-olds in Britain have used a legal high – twice the European average of 5%. This is exceeded only by the 16% recorded for this age group in Ireland and matched by similar levels in Poland and Latvia. The report also shows that Britain remains at the top of the European league table for all age groups for lifetime use of ecstasy (12.4%) and amphetamines (12.9%), and second only to Spain for cocaine use (12.8%), albeit at a lower level for young adults than in recent years.But it says Britain has seen a substantial decline in cannabis use since 2008 and is no longer near the top of the table, with the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy and France recording the highest use in Europe.The report says that the proportion of young British adults who have used cannabis in the last 12 months has fallen to the EU average of 12.4%. It adds that traditional hard drugs are failing to find new users in Britain, with a significant decline in the numbers of people entering specialist drug treatment for the first time for heroin.The annual EU drugs report says two-thirds of the newly reported legal highs on sale are synthetic drugs designed to imitate the effects of cannabis or cocaine. It reveals that most of the new psychoactive substances sold as legal highs and appearing on the European illicit market are synthesised in China and, to a lesser extent, India.Organised crime groups are now reported to be involved in manufacturing and marketing the tablets.The survey says the number of new psychoactive drugs being reported in the EU via its early warning system has risen from 24 in 2009 to 41 in 2010, 49 in 2011 and 57 so far this year. The European drug experts say the manufacturers are trying to evade attempts to ban them by using ever more obscure chemical groups to synthesise them; more now include several psychoactive substances. Seizures and test purchases have revealed samples containing legal and illegal substances.Although three natural products – kratom, salvia and magic mushrooms – lead the top 10 legal highs most frequently offered online, the remaining seven places are occupied by synthetic substances.The EU 2012 snapshot survey identified a marked rise in shops offering synthetic cathinones, which can mimic the effects of cocaine, suggesting that online operators are looking for a replacement for mephedrone, which has been banned cross the EU. The UK has introduced a system of temporary banning orders pending full examinations of the harms associated with a new substance.Cecilia Malmström, the European commissioner for home affairs, said she was struck by the speed of developments in this area. "Stimulant and synthetic drugs play a central role in the European drug situation, creating a market that is fast moving, volatile and difficult to control," she said."More than ever before young people are being exposed to a plethora of powders and pills. I think it is clear to all that strong and co-ordinated actions are required if we are to respond effectively."High numbersThe 10 new psychoactive substances most commonly offered for saleKratom (natural) (available in 179 online shops in January 2012)Salvia (natural) 134Hallucinogenic mushrooms (natural) 95Methozetamine (arylcyclohexylamine) 68MDAI (aminoindane) 656-APB (benzofuran) 54MDPV (cathinone) 444-MEC (cathinone) 43Methiopropamine (thiophene) 395-IAI (aminoindane) 38Source: European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
