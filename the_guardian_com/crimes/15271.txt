Defendants fined by magistrates courts may be forced to do unpaid community work if they fail to pay up under a seven-point action plan to tackle fine defaulting unveiled by the government yesterday.The new Department for Constitutional Affairs revealed figures showing that only 55% of outstanding fines were collected nationwide in the year 2002-3, against a target of 68% for the 42 magistrates court areas in England and Wales. The statistics show that failing to collect fines cost the public purse nearly £200m in 2002-3. While fines of £425m were imposed, only £236m was collected. The success rate has dropped from 59% in the previous year to 55% in 2002-3. A "name and shame" table of magistrates courts showed that only a third of fines were paid in Merseyside, compared with 87% in Warwickshire, the most successful area for fine collection. Under the new approach, fines will no longer be written off after 12 months, which often happens now, but will be chased until paid. It will be made easier to deduct a fine directly from the defaulter's pay or benefits, and those unable to pay will have to do unpaid work in the community. Private debt collectors will be brought in to enforce payment, and there will be a new offence of failing to provide details of income and expenditure to allow deduction orders to be made. Courts will also be able to offer reductions for earlier payment or increase the fine if payment is late.
