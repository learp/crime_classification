Police are hunting for a murderer after a decomposing body was discovered at a woodland beauty spot. The remains of a man were found at Hollow Ponds in Epping Forest in north-east London on Wednesday night, Scotland Yard said.The body, partially buried and wrapped in plastic, was spotted by a passerby at around 7pm in undergrowth off Whipps Cross Road, in a wooded area close to Whipps Cross University hospital. A postmortem carried out on Saturday revealed he was murdered, with detectives saying the body could have been there for several weeks. DCI Jamie Piscopo, who is leading the investigation, said: “Hollow Ponds is a busy and popular local beauty spot, with a cafe and a boating lake. “It is also surrounded by a number of busy roads, including Whipps Cross Road. We would like to speak to anyone who may have been in the area the last several weeks, and may have witnessed any unusual or suspicious activity, to come and speak to us.” Police have identified the victim, whose body was removed on Thursday, saying his next of kin have been informed.
