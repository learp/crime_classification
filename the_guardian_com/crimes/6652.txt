A disqualified driver fleeing police was jailed for 10 years and six months on Wednesday for killing a couple he mowed down in a car as they rode their tandem bike.Nicky Lovell, 38, pleaded guilty to causing the deaths of "perfect couple" Ross Simons, 34, and wife Clare, 30, by dangerous driving in the crash at Hanham, near Bristol, on 27 January.Lovell, of Oldland Common, Gloucestershire, was also banned from driving for life when he was sentenced at Bristol crown court. He had also admitted driving while disqualified during a previous hearing.Lovell's partner, Louise Cox, 35, who owned the Citroen Picasso he was driving at the time, was jailed for one year after pleading guilty to a charge of perverting the course of justice.Cox, also of Oldland Commonprovided police with a false name and description when she was asked to identify who had been driving her car. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating as Lovell was driving away from an Avon and Somerset police patrol car moments before the collision.Officers had indicated for Lovell to pull over as he was driving at speed along the residential street. But Lovell sped off and officers followed the Citroen, which hit another vehicle before ploughing into the Simons's tandem, causing fatal injuries.The couple, from Staple Hill, Bristol, were killed less than 24 hours after celebrating the news that they had been accepted for fertility treatment to start a family.Speaking after their deaths, Ross Simons's sister, Kelly Woodruff, described the pair, who had been married for 18 months, as "two peas in a pod". She added: "They were such a magical couple."Prosecuting, Andrew Macfarlane described them as "the perfect couple".He said they had met through a mutual friend in 2001 and married on May 20 2011 - meaning they would have celebrated their second wedding anniversary on Monday.Macfarlane told the court: "Ross, who was 34, and Clare aged 30, have been described by those who know them as special people with special qualities."It was said they were the perfect couple. They loved each other unconditionally. They were never heard to say a bad word about anyone."Friends said they were like two peas in a pod. You could never stop them from having fun."The prosecutor said the couple had bought the tandem - "something they had always wanted" - shortly before Christmas.On the day of the tragedy, they had been cycling to a family birthday party after buying a birthday present for their nephew earlier that day.Lovell, who has 69 previous convictions, was driving in Lower Hanham in Bristol with his partner of four years, Cox, her 12-year-old son and their 16-month-old son.He was spotted on the road by PC Philip Busvine, who was driving a marked Mercedes Vito van, after conducting inquiries in the area on another matter.Busvine had known drug addict Lovell for two years and knew him to be disqualified - so put on his blue lights and began to follow him.He pulled behind the Citroen Picasso at a junction, where it was indicating right, and believed it would pull over.But instead the car pulled left and fled down the busy High Street - increasing speed before driving down a narrow lane.Macfarlane said Busvine put on his lights and siren and had his "accelerator pedal to the floor" but could not catch up with the Picasso.Busvine later described Lovell's driving as "exceptionally erratic, fast and dangerous".The car veered at a fast speed across the road, hitting a parked car.It then spun out of control and hit the tandem side on, with the bike breaking into pieces.Cox's son, who was a rear passenger in the car, told police Lovell drove at speeds of between 50 and 60mph.Macfarlane said that after the police attempted to flag the car down, the boy heard Cox tell Lovell to pull over in order that she could get behind the wheel."He believed that Lovell was having trouble with steering and it collided with a parked vehicle, veered across the road and hit the tandem," he said."He said the vehicle came to a stop on a grassed area."He had struggled to get out of the vehicle because he couldn't get his seat belt unlocked."Lovell then fled from the vehicle, leaving Cox and her two sons by the car.Macfarlane added: "He then said that his mother informed the police that the person driving the vehicle was called 'PJ' and she gave a description that didn't fit Lovell."Witnesses at the scene desperately tried to help revive the Mr and Mrs Simons but they had sustained horrific injuries and were pronounced dead at the scene.
