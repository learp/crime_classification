A youth was arrested today for questioning about the brutal double rape of a 15-year-old girl in Belfast.He was detained in the early hours in the border city of Newry, Co Down, police said. The arrest came three days after a 16-year-old appeared in court charged with aiding and abetting rape, robbing and assaulting a female and assaulting a male. He was remanded in custody. The teenage girl, on holiday in west Belfast from the north of England, was attacked and twice raped and robbed by two males the weekend before last.Three teenage boys who were with her were beaten, stripped to the waist and forced to watch while she was raped. One of the girl's attackers used her stolen mobile phone to call her mother to gloat over what had happened. The girl and the boys were attacked in the Black's Road area after slipping out unnoticed by parents from the house where she was staying to go to an all-night shop. The girl was dragged into an empty petrol station forecourt on Black's Road and raped, and the boys were hit with an iron bar. All four were then taken to a nearby golfing complex where the second rape took place.
