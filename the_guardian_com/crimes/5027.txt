Gordon Brown said today he did not believe serial killer Peter Sutcliffe would ever be release from jail.The prime minister spoke out following reports that the "Yorkshire Ripper" – who murdered 13 women and tried to kill seven others in the 1970s and 80s – may eventually be freed.The Sun reported that doctors at Broadmoor, the high-security psychiatric hospital, had told lawyers for Sutcliffe that he was no longer dangerous.But Brown said today: "I don't think Peter Sutcliffe will ever be released." He said that mental health laws meant the killer could be detained permanently.A former police officer who worked on Yorkshire Ripper cases said he was "staggered" at the suggestion Sutcliffe may one day be allowed out of jail.If Jack Straw, the justice secretary, agrees to classify him as low risk, Sutcliffe could be moved to a medium security prison and eventually released back into society, the paper said.But Chris Gregg, a retired detective chief superintendent with West Yorkshire police, who worked on four of the Sutcliffe murders, as well as high-profile cases such as that of Wearside Jack, said that surviving victims would be "aghast" at the thought.He said: "Like many people, I was staggered at the suggestion that Peter Sutcliffe could be considered for release. It is an affront to common sense if that does ever happen."He killed 13 people and attempted to kill seven others. If that doesn't warrant serving a whole life behind bars I don't know what does."Sutcliffe, from Bradford, Yorkshire, was jailed in 1981 for his murder spree across Yorkshire and in Manchester.He was given 20 life sentences and was told by the judge that he would serve a minimum of 30 years.He began his sentence in prison but three years later was diagnosed with schizophrenia and transferred to Broadmoor.Doctors treating Sutcliffe were more concerned with the threat posed to his safety by members of the public than the threat he could pose to them, the Sun claimed.
