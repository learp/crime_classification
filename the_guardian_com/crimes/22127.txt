Firearms laws should be strengthened in the wake of the murderous rampage in Cumbria by Derrick Bird, an independent report said yesterday. But only "far more fundamental changes" on private ownership of guns could have prevented the tragedy, the UK's senior firearms licensing specialist concluded.The report clears Cumbria police of mishandling licences for three shotguns and a rifle granted to Bird, who murdered 12 people and seriously injured 11 others before killing himself in June this year.It says that officers carried out the process "robustly and professionally" and had no legal grounds to ban Bird from gun ownership despite his criminal record of theft, drink driving and allegations of threatening behaviour.The Whitehaven taxi driver's six-month suspended sentence for stealing decorating equipment from his former employer, British Nuclear Fuels, prompted the main proposal in the report: a five-year ban on owning guns by anyone with a suspended sentence of more than three months.Assistant chief constable Adrian Whiting, the head of the firearms and licensing working group of the Association of Chief Police Officers, also proposed more compulsory liaison with mental health services, GPs and other family members before the granting of a firearms certificate.Neither measure would have stopped Bird, who had few dealings with the health service and gave relatives no sign of the apparent breakdown which overwhelmed him – probably because of an impending tax inquiry. Whiting told a press conference at Penrith yesterday: "I do not think there are any immediate changes that could be implemented urgently that would have prevented these appalling offences. Improvements can be made, as I suggest, but even these would not have applied directly to this case. They are general rather than case specific."To prevent circumstances of this type a far more fundamental change in respect of the private ownership of firearms and ammunition would be necessary, and this would be something I anticipate would require far more significant debate and consultation."The hard truth is that the system of certification is designed to reduce the risk of lawfully possessed firearms being misused criminally, not to eliminate it altogether. To achieve that would require a very different approach from parliament and a different agreement between a government and the people it governs."Whiting's report also reveals that Bird, 52 and a father of two, tried to get hold of a more effective weapon during his three hours on the run. After shooting his brother and the family solicitor, he hammered on the door of a fellow licence-holder to whom he had given his Winchester automatic ejector shotgun gun only the night before. After a two minute conversation, which gave no clue as to what had happened or what lay ahead, the man refused. Bird made no attempt to attack him but drove off to pick the rest of his victims at random.The report shows that he was given his first shotgun licence at the age of 16 and had always kept to the system's requirements. As he expanded his small arsenal to include the other weapons, he gave the reason as clay pigeon shooting and vermin control on local farmland. The landowner sent a supporting letter for the most recent five-year renewal, in November 2005, which has a photograph of Bird smiling amicably.The certificate includes the 12-bore Fisher shotgun used with the 0.22 rifle in his killings, which took place between Whitehaven and the remote Lake District hamlet of Boot where he shot himself in a wood. Bird had treated the weapon properly until the night before the killings, when he sawed off its barrels, which is illegal.The report notes that the telescopic sight for the rifle was also legal, as a fitting which does not come within the scope of the licencing system. The licence was next up for renewal in mid-November this year.Bird was also allowed a sound moderator and up to 1500 rounds of ammunition for the guns. The report adds that it was "likely" that the licence was reviewed because of Bird's criminal record, but does not find a definite record.He was fined £100 and banned for a year after drink-driving in 1982, given six months' suspended in 1990 for stealing and handling decorating materials belonging to BNFL. Police were also called after an argument in 1998 with a girlfriend and he was arrested in 1999 after claims of menacing behaviour over a taxi fare. Neither incident led to prosecution.Cumbria's chief constable, Craig Mackey who commissioned the report said: "It is important to ensure that firearms certificates are issued in line with national guidelines and legislation and I wanted to ensure our decision making and actions in respect of Bird's firearms certificates were appropriate."I wanted Derrick Bird's victims, the families of those who were killed, the local community and our police officers and staff to be confident that our firearms licensing procedures were robust and fit for purpose."This review has confirmed that Bird owned his firearms lawfully and that we could not have used our Firearms Licensing process to identify him as a risk or prevent the tragic shootings in west Cumbria."Bird fired 54 rounds of ammunition during his rampage, 23 rounds from his .22 rifle and 31 from the sawn-off shotgun.A second independent review will report in January on the police response to the emergency. A coroner's inquest will then be held.John Canning of the British Medical Association said that doctors supported closer co-operation with the police and had a duty to breach confidentiality if they felt a patient presented a serious risk to themselves or others.Bill Harriman, director of firearms for the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said: "The UK's firearms laws are among the strictest in the world. Sadly, you cannot legislate for the moment when a switch flicks in someone's head."
