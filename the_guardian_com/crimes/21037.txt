Police yesterday named the two Newcastle University graduates who were murdered in their flat after putting up a fight against unknown intruders.A motive has yet to be established for the killing of Xi Zhou and her boyfriend Zhen Xing Yang, both 25 and Chinese nationals, who were praised by academic staff as friendly and very hard-working.Forensic scientists are continuing to check the ground floor flat in Newcastle upon Tyne's West End for any sign of forced entry. One theory is that the couple, who graduated two years ago with good degrees, might have known their attacker and let him or her in.Leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Steve Wade said Yang had been bludgeoned to death and Zhou hit about the head and suffocated. The couple also had injuries showing they had defended themselves and their attacker would have been covered in blood."It was a vicious attack, there was a lot of blood and I think in any interpretation that was something frenzied," said Wade. "We will work around the clock to catch those responsible. We have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case, we have the support of the local community, the area command policing and the people of Newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime."Relatives of Zhou, who was a popular member of staff at the local Wagamama restaurant, have been traced to Hunan in southern China with the help of friends in Britain. She completed her MA in applied linguistics in September 2006, the same time as Yang took an MA in international human resources.They had valid visas, which were due to run out later this year. Wade appealed to the city's Chinese community to come forward if anyone had any idea about reasons for the attack.Pastor Eddy Tang of the International Christian Fellowship in Newcastle, who is helping police liaise with members of the north-east's 10,000-strong Chinese student community, said: "People are very subdued at the moment. They are in mourning."
