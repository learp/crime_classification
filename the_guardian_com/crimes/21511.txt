Shamed police commander Ali Dizaei was assaulted while in prison, sources said today.The senior Metropolitan police officer is serving a four-year jail sentence for assaulting and falsely arresting a young businessman before trying to frame him.Another inmate at HMP Edmunds Hill, Suffolk poured a slop bucket over Dizaei's head on Monday, the Daily Mirror reported, and the former police officer was then punched in the face and knocked out.The newspaper said the former police commander Dizaei was only moved to the jail on Friday amid fears for his safety, and is now in even safer quarters.Dizaei was convicted earlier this month for his treatment of Waad al-Baghdadi, 24, and branded a "criminal in uniform" by the chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, Nick Hardwick.Dizaei could be officially sacked within weeks after Scotland Yard disciplinary proceedings are complete. He is appealing against his conviction.A justice ministry spokeswoman said: "A prisoner at HMP Edmunds Hill was assaulted. Staff intervened and he was moved to a place of safety."
