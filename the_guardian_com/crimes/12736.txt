A man has been jailed for two years for killing four of his children by dangerous driving.The children, aged between two and eight, died when Nigel Gresham's dangerously modified Land Rover plunged into the river Witham, Lincolnshire, in September 2007.Gresham was found guilty last month of four counts of causing death by dangerous driving after a trial at Lincoln crown court. He was sentenced today.During the trial, the court heard how four of his children – Willow, two, Angel, four, Thor, six, and eight-year-old Keavy – died in the crash at Tattershall Bridge.Gresham, formerly of Chapel Hill, Lincolnshire, kept his head bowed as the sentence was passed in front of a packed public gallery.The judge, Michael Heath, told Gresham he would serve at least half of his two-year sentence and would be disqualified from driving for five years."The simple fact is that your Land Rover should not have been on the road. It was, to coin a phrase, an accident waiting to happen."The vehicle was in appalling condition, its many and various defects were plain from the expert evidence given at trial."The judge said collision investigators had never seen such a badly maintained vehicle before.He said some of what Gresham told police when interviewed about the state of the vehicle went "beyond complacency into arrogance"."Not only would it have been blindingly obvious that driving the Land Rover in that condition would be dangerous, but you also drove it in a dangerous manner. You were driving that Land Rover too fast for that road."The inescapable fact is that the blame for this accident lies entirely with you. I have not the slightest doubt, for it is obvious, that you desperately regret what happened."The best expression of remorse would have been a plea of guilt."I find it hard to understand how you could place the lives of your partner and seven children in grave danger by allowing them to travel in such a vehicle."
