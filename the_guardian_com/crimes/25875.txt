Police have launched a cold case appeal over the murder of a soldier who died saving his family from an arson attack.L/Cpl Neville Richards, 22, was on leave from the army for Christmas in 1982 when petrol was poured under the front door of his family home in Battersea, south-west London, and set alight, Scotland Yard said.Richards, known as Noddy, woke his mother who was then rescued with his stepfather from the balcony, and the soldier’s wife Martina, 20, escaped through the lounge window, the Metropolitan police said.But Richards was overcome by fumes in the flat, collapsed in the hallway and died despite firefighters’ efforts to save him, the force said.No one has been charged over the attack nearly 34 years on and his widow, now Martina Lewis, remains desperate for answers, a police spokesman said.DI Susan Stansfield, of the Met’s special casework investigation team, said: “Noddy was a decent young man who had built himself a promising career in the army and was popular among his comrades.“He was home for the festive season and had spent Christmas Day with his family before the horrific events of the following morning.“Noddy put the safety of his family ahead of his own and sadly he was overcome by fumes before he could get out of the flat himself.”A 28-year-old man was arrested in connection with the fire at Ramsey House, Maysoule Road, which was ignited by a piece of fabric, but he was released with no further action, the Met said.Richards, who was with the 2nd Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment, posted in Munster, Germany, was a “lovely, caring and gentle human being”, his former wife said.Lewis, who met and married Noddy in Germany and now lives in Hampshire, said: “After 33 years the pain of Noddy’s loss remains as painful as ever.“He was denied a life with family and friends, having children, grandchildren and a whole life full of opportunities.“There’s not one day that goes by that I don’t think of Noddy.“Because of all this I appeal to anyone from the bottom of my heart who knows anything, no matter how small, to listen to their conscience so the person who did this awful crime can be brought to justice. I didn’t even get to say goodbye to Noddy or hug him one last time.”Scotland Yard asked witnesses or anyone with information to contact police on 020 7230 4294 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
