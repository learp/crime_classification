One of three men arrested today by police investigating the murder of two soldiers in Northern Ireland is the high-profile republican Colin Duffy, official sources said.The 41-year-old former Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoner had broken away from mainstream republicans and is part of a protest group that criticised Sinn Féin's decision to back the new Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).Duffy came to prominence in the 1990s after being acquitted of the murder of a soldier when it emerged a key witness against him was a loyalist paramilitary. He was later arrested over the murder of two police constables, but that case collapsed.His solicitor, Rosemary Nelson, received threats after representing him in court and was murdered in a loyalist car bomb attack at her Lurgan home in 1999. Her death is now the subject of a public inquiry.Police teams in forensic suits were today searching Duffy's house on a private estate in Lurgan, Co Armagh.Two other men, aged 21 and 32, were arrested after police raids in Lurgan and Bellaghy, Co Derry.Official sources, as well as republicans in the Lurgan area, said Duffy was among the men arrested.The three were detained by police investigating the murder of two soldiers gunned down by members of a dissident republican group as the pair collected pizzas at the gates of Massereene barracks in Antrim last Saturday night. Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, were killed in the Real IRA ambush hours before they were to fly to Afghanistan.Two other soldiers were injured and two pizza couriers were seriously wounded in the attack and remain in hospital.A prayer service organised by the Antrim borough council and local clergy was due to be held at 5pm today near the murder scene.Detectives are examining CCTV footage from the barracks and they have found what is believed to be the gunmen's getaway car 7 miles from the scene of the murders.The green Vauxhall Cavalier, with the registration TDZ 7309, was found in Randalstown, Co Antrim, and had been bought two weeks earlier.It is understood the gunmen had tried to set fire to the car, but it had not ignited. The claim has led to speculation that the discovery of the car may have provided police with opportunities to secure forensic evidence.The two soldiers were the first to be murdered in Northern Ireland in 12 years. Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick was killed by an IRA sniper in 1997.Meanwhile, police were continuting to question three people over the murder of police constable Stephen Carroll, 48, who was killed by gunmen from the Continuity IRA in an attack in Craigavon, Co Armagh on Monday.His funeral yesterday was attended by senior officers, politicians and leaders from across the community.The Continuity IRA and the Real IRA broke away from mainstream republicanism in opposition to the peace process. They reject the decision of the mainstream IRA to end violence, decommission weapons and use peaceful means to pursue republican political goals.Duffy is a member of the republican protest group Eirigi, which has not supported the new police service, but insists it is a peaceful pressure group. He attracted criticism last year when serious rioting over two days in the Lurgan area led to attacks on police, which he failed to condemn.After police came under gun and petrol-bomb attack he said the episodes were a symptom of a section of the nationalist community refusing to accept the PSNI. But in the wake of the murders this week, Duffy and Eirigi were challenged to condemn the killings.Eirigi, which is Irish for "rise up", released a statement in response to the pressure, insisting it did not support violent groups. Earlier this week it said: "Eirigi is an open, independent, democratic political party which is not aligned to, or supportive of, any armed organisation."While supporting the right of any people to defend themselves from imperial aggression, Eirigi does not believe that the conditions exist at this time for a successful armed struggle against the British occupation."As can be seen from the recent attacks on Britain's armed forces it is clear that not all republicans agree on how the British occupation should be resisted at this time. Those who carried out those attacks are best placed to explain their own rationale."Eirigi includes Breandan Mac Cionnaith, who came to prominence in the 1990s as the leader of the nationalist Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition that opposed Orange Order parades through the Catholic enclave in Portadown, Co Armagh. He resigned from Sinn Féin in protest at its decision to back the new police service, but has in the past said Eirigi is a peaceful political group. He was unavailable for comment today.
