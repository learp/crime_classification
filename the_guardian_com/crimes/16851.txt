The crown prosecution service was yesterday accused by the Howard League for Penal Reform of "leaving children unprotected" after it announced none of the prison officers alleged to have beaten up offenders at Portland youth jail would stand trial. Last August, Dorset police were called in to investigate allegations that officers at Portland had brutalised inmates over a 14 year period, carrying out physical assaults and terrorising inmates in their charge. The CPS yesterday confirmed it had decided there was insufficient evidence for any prison officer to stand trial. Sources with knowledge of the investigation told the Guardian it was hampered by a number of prison officers refusing to cooperate with detectives. Concern over Portland persuaded the Home Office this year to stop sending inmates under 18 to the jail. Police sent files regarding 31 allegations to the CPS, dating back five years. Five prison of ficers are still suspended. The prison service said that following the CPS decision it would launch an internal investigation. A decision on whether the five prison officers will remain suspended will be made today. The police investigation followed a dossier of allegations gathered by the Howard League.
