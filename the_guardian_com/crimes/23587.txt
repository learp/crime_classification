Detectives were today continuing to question a 19-year-old man arrested near a field where the bodies of a 16-year-old girl and a 20-year-old man were found.The bodies were discovered near the village of Woodsetts, close to Rotherham, South Yorkshire, after a 17-year-old girl alerted a farmer on Tuesday night.Officers confirmed that a gun was recovered nearby, and a spokesman for South Yorkshire police said post-mortem examinations showed both victims had died from gunshot wounds. The identities of the people involved have not been released.The 19-year-old man was arrested in a car found a short distance from the bodies.Police believe the two victims, the teenager who raised the alarm and the detained man had all driven to the remote area together following a night out in Sheffield.The spokesman said the dead girl was from Sheffield and the dead man was from the Lincoln area.Police and forensic officers spent yesterday searching the field for evidence, and the spokesman added: "A firearm recovered close to the bodies has been taken away for forensic examination." Some people living in the Woodsetts area said they had seen a car that looked suspicious, but knew nothing more about what had happened.John Bramah, the farmer who contacted police, said the 17-year-old girl had arrived at his home in a confused and frightened state."She was very agitated. She was confused," he told ITV's Calendar news programme. "She had run what was probably three-quarters of a mile, a mile, in the moonlight in high heels. It was muddy, she had climbed fences, barbed wire fences. She must have been very frightened."Mr Bramah is quoted in today's Sun newspaper as saying: "When I asked her what was happening, all she could say was: 'He's got a gun. He's threatened me and my friend is in danger'."
