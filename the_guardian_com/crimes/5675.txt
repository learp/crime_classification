Nottinghamshire policeman Diederik Coetzee, 48, made a record-breaking 309 arrests this year, once logging 11 in one day. But his superiors told him to be a little less earnest.A Mansfield police commander has reportedly told the constable, known locally as Robocop, to curb his proactive approach to arrests around the Sherwood Street Day Centre, which incorporates a YMCA hostel.According to chief inspector John Eyre, managers of the hostel have raised concerns that PC Coetzee's zealous approach is scaring away vulnerable members of the community from their service.
