The death of Kiyan Prince follows a series of high-profile knife, blade and bottle attacks against schoolchildren, including Shanni Naylor, 12, who was slashed across the face last year with a blade thought to be from a pencil sharpener, and Damilola Taylor, who died after being stabbed in the thigh with a broken bottle in 2000.Last month a 13-year-old boy was stabbed with a penknife during a playground fight in Northern Ireland.In legislation before the Lords, the government hopes to increase the age at which someone can buy a knife from 16 to 18. The violent crime reduction bill will also permit staff in schools and colleges to search pupils for weapons.Some schools have already begun to use metal detectors to search pupils. In London, the mayor, Ken Livingstone, has announced the deployment of police teams to "every London neighbourhood" to target knife carriers. He has called for them to receive "maximum sentences".Stabbing is the most common method of killing. More than 240 murder victims were killed that way last year, 29% of those deliberately. In 2004, more than 20 teenagers died as a result of knife attacks in the UK. In a Mori survey 29% of young people in London schools admitted having carried a knife; one 16-year-old boy in five had attacked someone with a knife, intending to hurt them seriously. Sixty-five per cent of people who carry knives have the weapons used against them.Next week, the government will launch a month-long knife amnesty allowing individuals to hand in weapons to police stations without facing prosecution.Tony Melville, the Association of Chief Police Officers' lead on knife crime and assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, said: "Taking knives off our streets will save lives and cut crime. Every weapon that is handed in is one that cannot be used in causing horrific injuries or even worse ... we hope this amnesty will be a catalyst in changing the culture of routine knife possession."
