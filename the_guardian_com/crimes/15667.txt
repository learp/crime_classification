A man and two teenagers have been charged with theft after a £1.2m antique violin was stolen from outside a London railway station.The 300-year-old Stradivarius was taken from Euston station when classical musician Min-Jin Kym, 32, went to buy a sandwich. Today John Michael Maughan, 26, of no fixed abode, and two boys aged 16 and 14, from Tottenham, north London, who for legal reasons cannot be named, were charged with theft at West London magistrates court. Maughan was remanded in custody while the teenagers were released on court bail, said British Transport Police (BTP). They will appear again at the same court on 20 January.Investigating officer Detective Inspector Andy Rose said along with the 1696 Antonio Stradivarius violin there was a Peccatte bow, valued at £62,000, in the case and another bow made by the school of Bazin, valued at more than £5,000.A BTP spokesman said there was a £15,000 reward, issued by Lark Insurance Broking Group and certain underwriters at Lloyd's, for information leading to their safe recovery.DI Rose said that despite being extremely valuable, the sell-on value of the items in monetary terms was "practically nil because they are so unique"."Our enquiries currently lead us to believe the items could be held within the travelling community and it is also possible that they will be offered for sale within the antique or musical trade, either in England or in Ireland," he added.Anyone with information should contact BTP on Freefone 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference B9/LNA of 23/12/10.Information can also be passed anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
