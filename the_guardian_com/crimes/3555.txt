At Tesco's Barrhead store, East Renfrewshire, Scotland, staff were escorted outside and sent home for the day shortly after 12.30pm. A worker at a neighbouring shop said: 'Police came and told us it had received a bomb threat. They suggested we might want to close.' Police refuse to comment on who was behind the scare. No one was hurt in the incidents.Tesco stores in Lancashire, Suffolk, Dyfed Powys in Wales, Fife and Strathclyde in Scotland, Leicestershire, Humberside, West Mercia, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and London were affected.
