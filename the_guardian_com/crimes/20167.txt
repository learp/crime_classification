Hopes were raised yesterday that the missing schoolgirl Shannon Matthews may have survived one of the coldest nights of the year away from home, after a man told police that he was sure he had seen her yesterday morning.Detectives said that the report from a street close to the nine-year-old's home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was "significant". The man did not know Shannon but recognised photographs. Scores of neighbours joined more than 250 police officers searching for the girl yesterday.Police confirmed that friends of the family had said that Shannon, who lives with her mother and several half-sisters and half-brothers, had told schoolfriends that she was thinking of running away from home. Her 11-year-old half-brother Tony has run away twice.Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan, of West Yorkshire police, said that a team of 60 detectives was checking out half a dozen possible sightings of Shannon since she left her primary school on Tuesday afternoon after a swimming lesson.
