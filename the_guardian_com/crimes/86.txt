The great train robber Ronnie Biggs was treated in hospital for the second time in 48 hours yesterday for dehydration and vomiting caused by a chest infection.On Tuesday night, he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, where he was treated before being returned to Belmarsh prison on Wednesday afternoon. But it is understood the prison authorities were not happy with his condition and he was taken back to hospital yesterday. His son, Michael, said his father's ill health meant he should be moved from the high security jail. Biggs, 74, was jailed for 30 years for his part in the Â£2.6m heist on a Glasgow-to-London train in 1963. He escaped in 1965 and fled to Brazil before voluntarily returning to the UK in 2001 after developing medical problems.
