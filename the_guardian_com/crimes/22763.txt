The National Union of Journalists has condemned an alleged attack on two photographers at the Climate Camp in Blackheath, south-east London.Today the NUJ claimed the two freelance photographers, Jonathan Warren and Marc Vallée, were assaulted as they took pictures of climate campers arguing with supporters of the Socialist Workers party.The union called on the organisers of the camp, which began last Wednesday and is due to come to a close tomorrow, to condemn the incident.Warren said: "As my colleague, Marc Vallée, and I were leaving climate camp we found a group of people arguing around the SWP stall that was selling newspapers and leaflets outside the entrance to the camp."As we went in to take photographs, the group arguing with the SWP quickly turned their attention to us, shouting loudly that we had not asked their permission before photographing them."They were immediately aggressive and threatening, I managed to calm the ones around me and walk away, however, one young man was persistently threatening towards Marc. He repeatedly threatened to grab Marc's camera and delete the pictures himself or smash the camera."After a while we felt that the situation had calmed. Marc said that they should both shake hands and walk away and offered his hand. The man did not take it and as we turned to leave he tried to grab the camera off Marc's shoulder."When Warren attempted to intervene he claimed he was kicked "hard in the stomach".In an open letter to the camp organisers, the two photographers said: "We ask the man who assaulted us to come forward and apologise and that the camp's organisers unequivocally condemn his actions."The NUJ freelance organiser, John Toner, added: "The NUJ condemns this attack on two of our members, who were legitimately going about their work as photographers. Nothing justifies an assault, and we are incensed that both photographers suffered injuries in the line of duty."Jeremy Dear, NUJ general secretary, said: "In the past, journalists have exposed heavy-handed policing of climate protests. Demonstrators need to understand that photographers must do their job without showing bias."I join with Marc and Jonathan in calling for the Climate Camp organisers to condemn this attack."• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
