Police stop and search powers are to be extended to allow officers to deal with people suspected of carrying paint spray cans or marker pens to write graffiti, the Home Office announced yesterday.Ministers believe that the power will help in their pledge to crack down on anti-social behaviour, despite figures showing stop and search has been used disproportionately against people from the Afro-Caribbean and Asian communties. The proposal was part of an overhaul of a cornerstone of the criminal justice system in England and Wales, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE), unveiled yesterday. Critics said the overhaul marked another government extension of police powers, with the time a suspect could be held in custody being extended from 24 to 36 hours. Only suspects for serious offences can be held for 36 hours, and can be detained further without charge if a magistrate grants permission. The government says the proposal will help officers tackling street robbery when problems with identification can make the limit of 24 hours too short to complete an investigation, especially when the suspect is a juvenile and a social worker has to be found. Launching the review, Home Office minister John Denham said graffiti was a "serious social nuisance". The proposal will see stop and search extended to offences of criminal damage. Police can arrest if they see someone carrying out a graffiti attack, believe they have done so, or believe they are about to. John Wadham, director of Liberty, said that the police were abusing their existing stop and search powers, and opposed the planned extension: "This is another proposal by this government which is going to damage human rights and civil liberties. "There's considerable argument that the power for stop and search should be abolished, it certainly should not be extended. To extend it to graffiti and criminal damage is a retrograde step."
