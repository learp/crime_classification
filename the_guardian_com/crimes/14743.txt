A secret “smoking watermelon” file seized by police investigating an alleged terror plot to target Tony Blair or carry out a Mumbai-style attack stored instructions on how to make a bomb, a court heard.The password-protected zip file was uncovered after armed police stopped law student Erol Incedal’s black Mercedes car near Tower Bridge on 13 October last year.The file, entitled smokingwatermelongrapeandmint.7Z, was on a memory card stashed inside the cover of Incedal’s iPhone, jurors at his Old Bailey trial were told.Although police were unable to crack the code, a computer forensics expert discovered it had the same “unique fingerprint” as two documents about bombs which were also on the memory card.Detective Constable Stephen Ball said one of the files, named Goodstuff.doc, contained bomb-making instructions and CB.pdf related to car bomb recognition.On the likelihood of the “smoking watermelon” file being used to store these two documents, Ball said: “It would be like me winning the lottery without me buying a lottery ticket.“That’s how unique it is.”All the files were put on the memory card on 6 September last year, the officer told the court.Identical documents were found with the mobile phone belonging to co-defendant Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar who was arrested at the same time.Ball told the court that an Acer laptop computer was also found when police searched a bedside cabinet at the address in Sussex Gardens, near Paddington, where Incedal, a married father-of-three, stayed from time to time.Although it was set to have all its internet search history automatically deleted, he could still retrieve “fragments” of emails with the use of forensic software, he said.The computer was set up in July last year with two email addresses and Skype but had none of the signs of “normal use”.Ball said: “I have been doing this for some time. This had no commonality with normal use. It is quite common to see CVs and people’s pictures. This computer was totally devoid.”Incedal, 26, formerly known in the partly-secret trial as AB, denies charges of preparing acts of terrorism and possessing a document entitled Bomb Making on a memory card.Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, also 26 and from London, who was known as CD, has pleaded guilty to possessing a terrorist document.The trial continues.
