False documents produced by David Chaytor, the first former MP to be convicted over the expenses scandal, prove he knew he was breaking the rules, a court heard today.Chaytor – who last month admitted three charges of false accounting – is due to be sentenced today at Southwark crown court, where lawyers are currently submitting arguments.The 61-year-old former Bury North Labour MP faces a maximum of seven years in prison but is expected to receive a more lenient sentence in view of his guilty pleas.At the Old Bailey last month, he admitted false accounting involving a total of £18,350."We say Mr Chaytor knew the rules, and we say why else would he produce false documents in support of his claims otherwise?" Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said.Chaytor submitted bogus invoices to support claims totalling £22,650 for IT consultancy work and renting homes in London and his Bury North constituency, although not all the money was paid to him. He has agreed to pay back all the money he received.Wright said: "It is maintained by the defence that his purpose in creating those documents was in fact to short-circuit the route by which expenses could be claimed. We, on behalf of the crown, do not accept that."The prosecutor said the bogus documents were "designed by him [Chaytor] to siphon money off from the public purse to which he was not entitled".The defence said Chaytor had deep and genuine remorse and his actions were wildly out of character.Chaytor submitted claims totalling £15,275 and was paid £12,925 for renting a flat in Hide Tower, in Regency Street, near Westminster. But he and his wife had bought the property in 1999 and paid off the mortgage on it in 2003.He also falsely claimed £5,425 between September 2007 and January 2008 for renting a cottage in Summerseat, near Bury.A police investigation later revealed that this house was owned by his mother, Olive Trickett. She had lived in the cottage for about 40 years before her dementia meant she had to move to a care home in May 2007, the court heard. She died in May 2009 at the age of 81.The third charge related to a £1,950 claim made by Chaytor for IT support services provided by a man named Paul France in May 2006.The claim was never paid to Chaytor because he had already exceeded his allowance for this kind of expense, the court was told. But it came as "something of a surprise" to France when he learned of the claim, because he had not billed the former MP for any work.Chaytor changed his plea to guilty at the Old Bailey last month – days before he had been due to stand trial – after the supreme court, the highest in the land, rejected his attempt to stop his case being heard in the criminal courts.Together with the former Labour MPs Elliot Morley, 58, who represented Scunthorpe, and Jim Devine, 57, formerly the MP for Livingston – who face separate trials at a future date – he argued unsuccessfully that criminal proceedings would infringe parliamentary privilege.
