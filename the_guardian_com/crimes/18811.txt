A 64-year-old woman was being questioned by detectives last night about the remains of three babies discovered in the attics of two houses in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales.A murder inquiry has been launched and more properties are likely to be searched. The arrest is the latest development in a police investigation which began six weeks ago when a resident, seeking the source of an unpleasant smell in his recently acquired terraced home, found the remains of a baby concealed in an old suitcase in the loft. The decayed body, which was wrapped in a towel and had been put inside a bin bag before being sealed in the case, was examined by forensic scientists who failed initially to obtain a DNA sample. It was not known whether the child was a boy or a girl. South Wales police appealed for the mother to come forward and interviewed several former occupants of the property, which was built 10 years ago.Yesterday the 64-year-old woman was detained at her home nearby on the Gurnos estate in Merthyr Tydfil. After searching her home, South Wales police revealed they had uncovered two more bodies wrapped in a similar fashion in the house's attic. In a statement issued yesterday evening, police said: "The local woman is currently helping police with their inquiries."
