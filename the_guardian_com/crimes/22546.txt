An innovative scheme to reduce offending by young people tempted by gangs, guns and knives was praised by the home secretary during a visit today. The X-it programme is run by former gang members who become peer mentors to prevent others being drawn into violence.Jacqui Smith praised Lambeth council, south London, backing for the scheme, which won the children's services category at this year's Guardian Public Services Awards."This sends a powerful message that gangs and weapons on our streets will not be tolerated," she said."I am pleased to see such positive action being taken to tackle gang culture, particularly when the action is led by the young people themselves. "The young people I have met today have turned their lives around and the X-it project has played a vital part in offering them an alternative to crime."Gangs of young people can cause fear in our communities and members are often involved in criminal activities which can lead to serious violence. I am committed to helping young people find alternatives."Smith has set up the Tackling Gangs Action Programme to fight gun and gang crime in problem areas of London, Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool.The X-it scheme was praised by Guardian judges earlier this month for their success in targeting young people at risk of social exclusion, one of the hardest groups to reach.The project offers intensive support and self-esteem building through group work sessions, residential courses and leadership programmes. It is run by Lambeth's children and young people's service with the police, community safety teams, tenant associations and youth workers.An evaluation of the programme found 72% of participants had stopped offending during their involvement with the project. The Lambeth council leader, Steve Reed, said: "The X-it programme does fantastic work. The young people here today, many now working or off to university, are proof that when given the opportunity they can achieve great things. "Not many of our young people get involved in crime but, when they do, it has a huge impact on their families, friends and neighbours. We will continue to do all we can to help young people reach their full potential."
