A former royal protection officer and his wife screamed death threats at a childhood friend for "betraying" them over a Â£3m spread-betting and property scam, a court heard yesterday.Paul Page, 38, who allegedly spent years funding a life of luxury with cash from colleagues and friends, allegedly threatened Fahim Baree after learning he had spoken to police."He was angry. He considered his close friend had betrayed him," Douglas Day QC, prosecuting, told Southwark crown court in London. He said the officer first pushed Baree against the house, shouting: "I know what you did, basically you're dead," before telling the man's brother: "If he talks to my solicitor, we'll pretend like tonight's never happened."He said Page, who "smelt strongly of alcohol", then returned to his car as his wife, Laura, allegedly leaned out and yelled: "He's dead, tell him he's dead."Jurors have been told the former constable, who was based at Buckingham palace, turned to crime after his sideline "currency club", a spread-betting operation he ran for fellow royal protection officers, ran into debt.He then began gambling heavily in an attempt to recoup losses. Eventually, he set himself up as a property developer.Day said that although the operation was "bogus" from start to finish, his "veneer of credibility", coupled with promises of massive returns, soon saw the money flooding in once more.He said that faced with all the signs of Page's apparent success - large house, expensive lifestyle, and a fleet of luxury cars - colleagues, relatives and friends handed over their savings.The court heard that he allegedly either refused to answer the door to concerned investors or fobbed them off with excuses ranging from deaths in the family to an eye infection from a spider.Some, including Baree, complained to the police and gave statements to the Metropolitan police's Directorate of Professional Standards."When Mr Page became aware of the investigation, he tried to persuade unpaid creditors to say nothing to the investigating officers," Day said.Page's wife was also interviewed but refused to comment. Page, of Grays, Essex, denies making a threat to kill, intimidation, and threatening to take revenge, and two counts of fraudulent trading. Laura Page, 42, pleads not guilty to being concerned in an arrangement facilitating dealings with criminal property, intimidation and threatening to kill.
