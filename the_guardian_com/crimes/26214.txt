Singer KT Tunstall launched an online appeal after her tambourine was stolen at a gig, guilt-tripping the thief into sending it back to her in a taxi.She was packing up after a performance in Wick in the Scottish Highlands on Friday night, when she and her band realised the trusty instrument had been filched.Suspecting that an overenthusiastic fan had taken it as a souvenir, the singer launched a Twitter appeal to track it down using the hashtag #wherestambo.She posted: “Wick! Amazing show thank you but someone stole my tambourine off stage; if you know where it is please return to the Mackay Hotel tomorrow am.”KT Tunstall (@KTTunstall)WICK! AMAZING show thanku 💋👊🏼!!

By itself. In a taxi.She sent word to her relieved fans on Twitter updating them on the good health of her favourite percussion piece, saying: “We did it! I got my tambo back. Thanks for your help. Hey, sometimes excitement gets the better of us!”The singer was so thrilled by her tambo’s return she penned an instant classic hit: “I got my tambo back” a catchy tune she uploaded to Twitter on Saturday.KT Tunstall (@KTTunstall)NEW SINGLE DROPPED TODAY!!
