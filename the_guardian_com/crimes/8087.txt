Five children who were being sexually abused by paedophiles who streamed footage of their activities on the internet have been rescued in a series of police raids, Scottish law enforcement officials said yesterday.The boys and girls, aged between seven and 13, were rescued in three separate police operations which started in Scotland and spread to locations in England.The raids began in the central belt of Scotland after a man was arrested for other alleged sex offences.The operation involved three raids in Scotland and two in England. All of the children are now reported to be receiving counselling and support.The operation was led by Scotland's National Sex Crimes Unit which was set up in March to improve the way rape and other sex crimes were investigated and brought before the courts.It is made up of a group of special prosecutors, headed by senior prosecuting counsel Derek Ogg QC."This was one of our most harrowing and disturbing cases but it clearly demonstrated the value of, and real need for, the unit," Ogg told the Daily Record. "Until the police investigation revealed these results, we were unaware of the full extent of child exploitation going on in our backyard."Rescuing children like this whilst still preserving evidence for a fair prosecution can be a legal minefield for those detectives so it was important to develop new ways to get early guidance and help to them."When the Edinburgh-based unit launched in March, Ogg said he was determined to dramatically change the law enforcement agencies' ability to handle sex crimes."We are there to take seriously what is happening all the time in this country, sexual abuse of children and sexual abuse of adults," he said. "It is time we started to take this seriously."Details of the investigation remain scant, but a Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service spokesman said: "Using intelligence gathered following the arrest of a man for alleged sexual offences, police working with the assistance of the National Sexual Crimes Unit have been able to rescue five children who were being sexually abused. As proceedings are now active, it would be inappropriate to comment further."Scotland's National Sex Crimes Unit was set up earlier this year following a review by the Lord Advocate in 2006 which made 50 recommendations for improving how sexual offences were handled in Scottish Courts, including the introduction of specialist training on the investigation and prosecution of rape.
