A woman and her son organised the contract killing of her gamekeeper husband in a "planned, determined and cold-blooded killing", a court heard today. The motive for killing Nigel Bacon, 50, who was found dead at his remote bungalow in Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire, last November, was "a combination of greed and loathing", Nottingham crown court was told. Susan Bacon, 55, their son Michael Bacon, 21, Michael Bacon's father-in-law Sean Woodcock, 42, and Peter Jacques, 29, all deny charges of murder. The case was adjourned until Monday.
