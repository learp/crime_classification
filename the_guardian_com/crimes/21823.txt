As Angela Cannings starts to rebuild her life, the spotlight turns again to the man whose expert evidence helped to convict her. Professor Sir Roy Meadow told the jury at Winchester crown court that Mrs Cannings had probably smothered her baby sons.Working on his controversial rule of thumb that "Unless proven otherwise, one cot death is tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder", he proved a compelling witness for the prosecution. But yesterday's decision is the latest blow to the credibility of the former president of the Royal College of Paediatricians. His theories went largely unchallenged for more than 20 years until he gave evidence against solicitor Sally Clark, who was convicted in 1999 of murdering her two sons. During Mrs Clark's trial he said the likelihood of two children in the same family dying of cot death was 73m to one. Mrs Clark's conviction was overturned and law lords said Sir Roy's evidence was "grossly misleading". Despite the controversy, Sir Roy was hired as an expert in the Trupti Patel trial. He advised the jury that cot death did not run in families, even though Mrs Patel's grandmother lost five babies. Mrs Patel was found not guilty of killing her three babies. Jean Golding, professor of epidemiology at Bristol University, said: "He just seems convinced it is going to be murder whatever the case." The solicitor general, Harriet Harman, has now effectively barred Sir Roy from giving evidence, and the General Medical Council is investigating him.
