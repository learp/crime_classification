The jail system faces a "serious crisis" for which the government has completely failed to plan, the prisons watchdog said today.Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, warned that Home Office failings had made prisons "riskier places to run".Speaking as she published her fifth annual report on English and Welsh jails, Ms Owers said the document came at "a critical point for prisons and the correctional system as a whole"."I can't say other than we have a serious crisis and one which is impacting on the ability of prisons to do rehabilitation," she said."It is normally considered good practice to build an ark before the flood rather than during it or after it. This means long-term planning and planning which, in my view, should have happened a long time ago."Ms Owers said that, in April last year, she had warned that a rapid growth in prisoner numbers meant "we would hit the buffers in autumn, and we did".She called for extra spending on prisons, saying they would become "containers" for criminals with "ever-faster revolving doors" if it was not forthcoming."We need more money in the system generally - in mental health, in education and community support," she said.Ms Owers stressed that there was no easy route out of the crisis, saying even a swift programme of prison building might not be enough."I worry at the moment that, as fast as quick-build units will be put up, they will be filled," she said.In her 99-page report, Ms Owers noted that, at the time of writing, the total prison population was "hovering around 80,000" - almost 20% more than when she became chief inspector of prisons in August 2001.She said there had been improvements to some services such as healthcare and education, but warned of "some important and increasingly disturbing caveats", notably the number of inmates serving indeterminate sentences."For the first time ever, there were more prisoners serving indeterminate sentences than those who were serving short sentences of less than 12 months," she added."These are unparalleled increases. At the same time, there are resource constraints on public spending which are likely to affect the quality of life in prisons, both directly and indirectly. This is an alarming and potentially extremely damaging combination."The chief inspector said the prisons system was at a crossroads, adding: "It is by no means clear whether, in five years, we will look back on 2005-6 as a staging post in a slow and steady improvement, or as a turning point, when hard-won progress towards safe, decent and purposeful prisons faltered and began to slip back."This poses critical political and resource questions for ministers, both inside and outside the Home Office."Earlier today, Ms Owers saw the home secretary, John Reid, for what a prison service spokeswoman described as a "helpful meeting".The prisons minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, said the report highlighted "significant improvements" in aspects of the service.He defended the use of indeterminate sentences, which he said were "designed to offer the public greater protection from dangerous offenders".The Conservative leader, David Cameron, said the government had known there was an overcrowding problem, but had "stuck their head in the sand" and failed to build more jails."The failure under this government is a failure of planning, because they didn't plan for the prison crisis that everybody saw coming," he said.
