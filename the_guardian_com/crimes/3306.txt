Michael Adebolajo• A 28-year-old Londoner born into a church-going Nigerian family in Lambeth, he converted to Islam in 2003, changing his name to Mujaahid, which means "one who engages in jihad".• Adebolajo, who was known to MI5, took part in protests organised by the now-banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun, whose founder, Omar Bakri Mohammed, claims he converted him.• Reports on Sunday said he was arrested in Kenya in 2010 close to the border with Somalia, parts of which are controlled by Islamist militants, and was deported back to the UK.• A friend has linked Adebolajo's radicalisation to alleged ill-treatment in Kenya, where he claimed that he was tortured. MI5 was alleged to have harassed him and to have asked him to spy for them.• Attention is being focused on his time at Greenwich University, which, unlike several other London institutions, has not previously been associated with radicalism.Michael Adebowale• Like his friend Adebolajo, Adebowale was brought up as a Christian in a family of Nigerian origin and is believed to have grown up on the periphery of the south-east London gang scene.• He was stabbed during a knife attack five years ago and, according to a friend, afterwards converted to Islam.• Police investigating the 22-year-old have raided a flat in Greenwich, about four miles from the scene of Wednesday's attack, where he is said to have lived and attended a local college.• Richard Taylor, father of the murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor, revealed that he had acted as a mentor to Adebowale, who he said was bullied at school and was thought to be at risk of coming under the influence of gangs.• Like Adebolajo, Adebowale was on the radar of MI5.
