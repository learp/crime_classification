A 20-year-old nursery assistant is to appear in court charged with the rape of a child at his workplace, prosecutors said tonight.Paul Wilson was arrested at his home in Nechells, Birmingham, in the early hours of yesterday morning by detectives from West Midlands police's public protection department.Jayne Salt, head of the CPS West Midlands complex casework unit, said: "Having carefully examined all of the available information which was submitted to us by the police, we have decided that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to charge Paul Wilson with two counts of rape in relation to an investigation into the Little Stars Nursery in Nechells, Birmingham."Earlier, Superintendent Matt Ward said a 20-year-old male nursery worker, who had worked at the Little Stars nursery for 18 months, was arrested after a warrant was executed at his home on an unrelated matter. A computer and other items were seized.Ward said: "We recovered material which, when it was forensically examined, led us to believe a series of serious sexual offences against a child had taken place at the Little Stars nursery."He had since spoken to parents of children at the nursery and said: "At this stage all our evidence suggests there is one offender and one child."The nursery was closed as police and council officials carrying out the inquiry talked to parents.The nursery is run by the Nechells Regeneration Project. In a statement released by police, John James, its chief executive, said: "We were shocked to hear of the allegations made and we are, of course, co-operating fully with the police inquiry."The safety and welfare of the children and the community we serve is our first priority, and ... we fully support the decision by the police and Ofsted to temporarily close the nursery during the initial stages of this investigation."Parents of children at the nursery spoke of their horror after being informed of the police inquiry by reporters gathered outside. At least three mothers arrived with their children, unaware it had been closed.Nahla Yusif, whose three-year-old and eight-month-old baby attend the nursery, said: "This is the first I have heard about this ... no one has tried to contact me."She took her children home, saying: "IÂ am so frightened for them right now."Joan Ndeme arrived with her 11-month-old daughter, who first attended two days ago, also said had not received a call from the nursery.Assistant Chief Constable Anil Patani, who is leading the inquiry, said earlier: "We believe that we have identified one victim, who we believe attends the nursery."The family of this child have been told and police are supporting them. As the investigation continues, we will update families with children at the nursery at the earliest possible opportunity."The council said it was working closely with police and had set up a helpline with specialist staff.Little Stars opened almost five years ago as part of the regeneration of Nechells, near the centre of Birmingham. An Ofsted report last year rated the quality of the nursery as "overall, good" and said that "children are cared for in a safe and secure environment". It was given a good rating after a subsequent inspection in November.The nursery has 14 members of staff.
