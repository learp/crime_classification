Media coverage of the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman has scarred children's perceptions of safety and risk, research published today suggests.Children and young people consulted for a government study of "safeguarding" - a key concept in the children bill currently before parliament - repeatedly raised the Soham case in discussing their fears and behaviour.They knew the risk of abduction or kidnap was low, yet the possibility of it happening emerged as a "very common" anxiety, according to the report by Roger Morgan, the children's rights director for England. "They felt you could worry a lot about something serious, even if it was not very likely to happen," it says. The study used 14 consultation groups, comprising 110 youngsters aged 10 to 18, set up to discuss safety, plus 11 groups set up to discuss wider issues. All the participants lived in residential settings, including boarding schools, or were in foster care. The report, Safe from Harm, says: "The phrase 'like Holly and Jessica' was used over and over again in our discussions of dangers for children." Mr Morgan attributes this to saturation media coverage of the case. Similarly, he says, the groups talked about terrorism and illnesses such as bird flu that were in the news at the time of the research earlier this year. Other concerns included bullying, road safety, drugs, poor diet and lack of exercise. The report, which is being sent to ministers, is published by the Commission for Social Care Inspection, established in April.
