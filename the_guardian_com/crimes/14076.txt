Home office ministers are struggling to find a compromise to save legislation that would hold company executives accountable for the negligent deaths of their employees.The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill has been 10 years in the making and is considered a flagship piece of New Labour legislation but, following a government defeat in the House of Lords, it may not become law.The Lords rejected Home Office plans to exclude prisons, police cells and psychiatric hospitals, and sent the bill back to the House of Commons.The defeat has prompted fury at the Home Office, which believes the peers' plan would be unworkable, as it would place an impossible burden on the Prison Service to prevent deaths in custody.Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe is now attempting a last-ditch compromise to save the bill. He is proposing that police cells should be subject to the legislation, but not prisons or psychiatric hospitals.Such a proposal may not be enough to win support from Labour rebels, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who argue that all places of custody must be safeguarded in the bill.The bill is a remnant of a former parliamentary session - a 'hangover bill' - which means it cannot be transferred to the next parliamentary session and will die if it does not obtain approval by 17 July. Failure would dismay safety campaigners. High-profile disasters such as the Potters Bar and Paddington train crashes - which both occurred under the Labour government - have raised fears that company executives are not being held properly accountable for the deaths of customers and employees.'The potential implication of losing this bill is incalculable,' said Pamela Dix, executive director of the charity Disaster Action, which was set up to campaign for a corporate manslaughter bill following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster in 1987. 'We need a law that will act as a deterrent. It's now more than 20 years since Zeebrugge; we've waited a long time for this law. There has to be moral leadership shown on this issue.'Failure by the government to steer the bill through parliament would be a severe embarrassment for John Prescott. In 1999 he said: 'Companies responsible for tragedies such as the Marchioness must not be allowed to get off the hook just because no one individual can be blamed. The victims' relatives need to know that everything possible has been done to give them justice.'
