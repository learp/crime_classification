A jealous husband has been cleared of murdering his wife with a prohibited firearm after learning of her secret affair with another man.David Leeman, 60, admitted he shot his wife, Jennie, five times with a semi-automatic pistol at close range in a barn on the farm they had once shared in rural Devon, but claimed he was not in control of his thought processes at the time. He was convicted of manslaughter and will be sentenced on Friday.Mrs Leeman, who had two sons and two daughters with the defendant during a 20-year relationship, started seeing another man, Norman Laramy, 40, Exeter Crown Court heard.Leeman discovered the couple's affair six days before he killed Mrs Leeman at the farm, near Barnstaple in north Devon. He claimed he had heard voices in his head in the moments leading up to the death and anti-depressants he had been taking had an impact on his mental facilities.Experts were divided on whether the dosage Leeman had been taking was sufficient to cause his behaviour on the day he shot his wife in July last year.Outside court, a spokesman for Mrs Leeman's family said: "No one has the right to take another person's life."We, Jennie's family, feel disappointed and that justice has not been done for such a terrible thing that David Leeman has done to our wonderful daughter, sister and friend to so many people."There was a gasp from the public gallery as the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to murder, with Leeman appearing to fall from his standing position in the dock to his seat, where he was supported by two security guards.Justice Butterfield said Leeman would be sentenced for manslaughter and possession of a prohibited weapon.
