Police have confirmed that they are investigating new forensic evidence surrounding the murder of London teenager Stephen Lawrence, which could lead to the rearrest of the five main suspects in the case. All five men could be questioned again following the re-examination by independent forensic technicians of hundreds of pieces of evidence related to the 1993 murder.Gary Dobson, 32, Neil Acourt, 32, and Luke Knight, 31, were acquitted of murder in 1996, when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family collapsed. The case against the two other suspects, Acourt's brother Jamie and David Norris, both 31, was dropped before it reached court.A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said last night: "As the result of a forensic opportunity coming to light, new DNA samples are being taken from individuals who may have come into contact with Stephen at the time, or prior to his death, such as his family, police officers, ambulance and medical staff. The samples will be used to eliminate their DNA."According to the Daily Mail, the tests have revealed fibres from Stephen's clothes on those thought to have been worn by the suspects.Because the double jeopardy rule, which prevented a suspect being tried twice for the same crime, was abolished in 2005, all five suspects could once again face trial.Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in April 1993 by a white gang. The case was the subject of three separate investigations, an internal Scotland Yard review, a re-examination by Kent police, as well as the 1999 Macpherson inquiry, which found the Metropolitan police was beset by "institutional racism".Earlier this year, the force's commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, ordered a fresh review by officers attached to Scotland Yard's specialist crimes directorate.Using techniques employed in the successful reinvestigation of the murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor, forensic experts have examined hundreds of pieces of evidence, including clothes belonging to Stephen and his alleged attackers.Last night close friends of the Lawrence family told the Guardian that Stephen's mother, Doreen, felt that she had been told many times since the murder that the police had made a breakthrough. There was some excitement in the family about the developments, but no certainty that the police had made any real steps to get enough evidence to bring the five suspects to trial.A friend said: "After speaking to the police, Doreen was left with the impression that the police felt that this was important. But she has been told this so many times before by the police, and nothing has happened."Reports of a breakthrough in the case come as the Metropolitan police face severe criticism by the official inquiry into their shooting dead of an innocent man suspected of being a terrorist. Sir Ian will come under renewed pressure today with the release of a report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the death Jean Charles de Menezes. Last night, senior Scotland Yard sources seen as being loyal to Sir Ian could not rule out that this was an attempt to divert attention from what is expected to be a very painful day for the force and its commissioner.Sources confirmed that the re-examination of the Stephen Lawrence murder had been conducted in secrecy, with few people made aware how far it had progressed.It was also suggested that it was highly unusual for Scotland Yard to announce the imminent arrest of a suspect.Last night a Scotland Yard source said: "The case is not cracked. But we have made progress."
