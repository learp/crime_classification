A flamboyant book dealer jailed for handling a stolen edition of Shakespeare's first folio took his own life in prison, an inquest heard. Raymond Scott, from Wingate, County Durham, was serving an eight-year sentence when he was found dead in his cell by prison officers. The inquest at Berwick magistrates' court heard that he had severe wounds to his neck and was discovered with razorblades in his hand.Scott, who prior to his conviction passed himself off as a wealthy playboy, had mentioned having suicidal thoughts in the weeks leading up to his death.A letter from him was also found in his cell at HMP Northumberland saying he intended to kill himself. Giving evidence, detective constable Sarah Snaith of Northumbria police, said: "At 8.05am on 14 March 2012, staff were on duty and they began unlocking the 14 cells on the landing."After a minute or so Mr Scott had not appeared, so they entered the cell and saw Mr Scott lying on his back on the bed but could not rouse him."They then saw blood on the top of his chest. An alarm was raised and a nurse attended. She checked him for signs of life but no signs of life were evident."The jury were told that Scott had become withdrawn and stressed following his failed appeal against his sentence.The eccentric 55-year-old was caught with the highly valuable folio when he took the 1623 work to the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC, and asked for it to be authenticated.But the police were alerted by library staff as it had been reported stolen from Durham university in 1998.Scott, who would go on to arrive at court appearances in a horse drawn carriage and various expensive cars and was jailed in 2010, denied the charges and claimed he had found it in Cuba.The jury cleared him of stealing the collection but convicted him of handling stolen goods and removing them from Britain.His champagne lifestyle, which included expensive cigars and boasts of homes in Monte Carlo, led him to rack up tens of thousands of pounds in debt.It was also reported that he had become infatuated with a Cuban waitress and intended to sell the folio and share the proceeds with her.Coroner Tony Brown recorded a verdict that Scott had taken his own life.
