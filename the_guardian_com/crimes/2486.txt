The home secretary, Charles Clarke, faced fresh calls for his resignation in parliament today, after a man wanted for violent crimes committed after he was recommended for deportation was arrested in Hull.Caliph Ali Asmar was arrested around 10.30pm last night during a police raid on a house in the centre of the city.Humberside police arrested him in connection with a stabbing last month that left a 38-year-old man needing emergency surgery and an alleged sexual assault on a 15-year-old girl.Shadow commons leader Theresa May told parliament that the case showed the "dangers to which the public have been exposed by the incompetence of this government"."Does this count as sufficient reason for the prime minister to sack the home secretary? Surely enough is enough and the home secretary must go," she said.The Home Office would not confirm whether Asmar was on their list of 1,023 foreign prisoners who were not considered for deportation, nor whether he was on a list of 38 serious criminals the department was unable to track down.Mr Clarke has faced calls for his resignation since last week, following revelations that 1,023 foreign prisoners who should have been considered for deportation following their release had their cases ignored by the Home Office. 288 of the criminals in question were released from prison after Mr Clarke became aware of the situation last summer. Yesterday he unveiled new laws to tackle the situation, proposing that there should be a presumption in favour of deportation for foreign nationals convicted of any imprisonable offences.Ministers were "supportive" of the home secretary when he briefed them about the issue in today's weekly cabinet meeting, a spokesman for the prime minister said.He also said that the government was not worried about the possibility of Mr Clarke's proposed laws being overturned for contravening the Human Rights Act."If, whenever we get the legislation through, people want to challenge it in the courts, that's fine," he said. "What people shouldn't assume is that we necessarily have to go down that route."Mr Asmar's arrest follows the news earlier this week that a Somalian man wanted in connection with the killing of Bradford police officer Sharon Beshenivsky had his deportation turned down because of Home Office fears that it would be too difficult to send him to his war-torn native country.An Iraqi Kurd, 25-year-old Asmar was released last year after serving eight months of a prison sentence on a range of charges including unlawful wounding, possessing an offensive weapon and damage to property.The judge in that case recommended him for deportation, and it is understood that the Home Office did consider his case.Police described him as "dangerous and unpredictable". The victim of the stabbing for which he is wanted was stabbed between the shoulders with a large knife, while the victim of the sexual assault was allegedly dragged into a car by two men and driven to a house where she was attacked.Humberside police said four other men were arrested in raid, which came as a result of a tip-off from a member of the public.Increasing the pressure on Mr Clarke today, novelist Irvine Welsh has joined a campaign to in support of an arts promoter who is facing deportation to Jamaica after living in Britain for 30 years.Ernesto Leal was arrested on Monday and served with a deportation order over a 2002 pub brawl in which he was sentenced to jail for grievous bodily harm.A refugee from Augusto Pinochet's Chile with little previous connection to Jamaica, he was described by Welsh as being "as Scottish as a deep-fried Mars bar supper".
