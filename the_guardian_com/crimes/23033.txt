Staffordshire and Northumbria police have received the best performance ratings amongst forces in England and Wales, according to government assessments published today.The poorest results in the annual performance assessments were those of Humberside and Northamptonshire police.All 43 police forces in England and Wales were assessed in seven categories, including reducing and investigating crime, promoting safety and providing assistance. Other categories included citizen focus, resource use and local policing. Delivery of a category was graded as excellent, good, fair or poor. A second assessment compared the change in the category over the course of a year as stable, improved or deteriorated.Staffordshire received four excellent and three good ratings in delivery of services, and remained stable during the year. Humberside was graded poor or fair in all seven groups but had improved in four, including crime reduction and investigation.The Home Office does not publish an official league table as it says it is misleading to compare forces of different sizes. The City of London has 869 police officers while the Metropolitan police has more than 30,000.The Home Office minister Tony McNulty said he was "very encouraged" by the statistics."Crime and fear of crime are both down, investigations are up and the number of offences brought to justice has increased significantly," he said.Both the Association of Police Authorities and Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, Ronnie Flanagan, said some assessments showed "good progress" but improvements needed to be made in protecting vulnerable people. The report said that in 2005/06 around 1.32 million offences were brought to justice, an increase of 170,000 on the year before.It was also the first full financial year under which forces had had to operate against targets for frontline policing improvements, as set by police authorities."While the results show a slight improvement, from 62.3% in 2004/05 to 63.2% in 2005/06, this is equivalent to an additional 1,186 full-time officers carrying out frontline duties," the report said.A Home Office spokesman said the assessments helped identify underperformance and provide extra support to forces such as Humberside, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire.Chief Constable Tim Collis, of Humberside police, said a lack of resources had affected operations."I know that it does not reflect the sheer hard work and commitment that my staff have put into the policing of Humberside over the last 12 months and the unambiguous and marked improvements that have been achieved," he said."I'm realistic, however, and I know that we're not yet out of the trees. More needs to be done and we are doing it."
