A 45-year-old man appeared in court today charged with the murder of his former partner and her son.Sally Cox, 43, and her 22-year-old son, Martin Faulkner, were bludgeoned to death at their home in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Their bodies were discovered on Monday morning.Michael Kelly, of Swindon, spoke only to confirm his name and address during a brief hearing at Banbury magistrates court.Kelly was arrested at a residential address in Swindon shortly after the bodies were found.He is further charged with one count of grievous bodily harm, relating to a 19-year-old girl who was badly injured in the incident, thought to be Cox's daughter Amy.A 13-year-old girl, believed to be Cox's younger daughter, Katie, was present but unharmed, Thames Valley police said.Detective Inspector Steve Duffy said officers were confronted by a "horrific scene" when they were called to Cox's terraced home at around 6.45am.Police have not confirmed claims from neighbours that the victims were killed with an axe. A postmortem examination on Cox revealed she died of multiple head injuries caused by a "heavy bladed instrument", a police spokesman said.Results of her son's postmortem examination have yet to be revealed.Duffy said: "All I can confirm is their injuries are consistent with blunt trauma and I can't say if an axe was used, but a firearm was not used."Cox and her family are believed to have lived in their house for a year.Kelly was remanded in custody to appear at Oxford crown court tomorrow morning.
