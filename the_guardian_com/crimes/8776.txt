The death of four-year-old John-Paul Massey, who was mauled by his uncle's illegal pit bull terrier in Liverpool has led to calls for a repeal of the Dangerous Dogs Act.The act, introduced in 1991, is failing to prevent dog attacks, campaigners say. Former dog trainer Ryan O'Meara, publisher of K9 magazine, calls the act a shambles: "We need to have a new law that compels every single person who owns a dog to have compulsory education â€” that is the only way we are going to reverse these problems."O'Mears adds that labelling all pit bulls as dangerous is as ridiculous as saying Ford Mondeos are the most dangerous car on the road.Clarissa Baldwin, the Dogs Trust chief executive, said: "By banning certain breeds of dog rather than focusing on tackling anti-social behaviour it has not prevented a large number of dog attacks or reduced the number of pit bull terrier-type dogs in the UK. Since that act was introduced. the number of hospitalisations is reported as having doubled."Alison Green, the head of DDA Watch, says the act is not working "as has been proven in the most horrible way in Liverpool"."There have been deaths and an amnesty, but it has not been effective," she says. "It has not made one jot of difference to dangerous dogs."After cases like this people feel pressure to re-home their dogs by family members because of the media coverage."If people have bull breed-type dogs they find it difficult to walk them and they will often not be allowed at training classes when they are legally held, exercised and treated by vets."Chief Superintendent John Martin, of Merseyside police, says pit bull describes a variety of dogs and is a complex issue. "If there is a dangerous out-of-control dog, we can instigate section 3 of the act and seize the dog."We have to respond in a way that is lawful, reasonable and proportionate to the circumstances and we try to reduce the risk and harm to the public."John-Paul Massey's uncle, 21-year-old Christian Foulkes, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.The Dogs Trust wants the act to be repealed, to deal with aggressive or dangerous dogs based on actions rather than breed.Certain breeds such as Staffordshire bull terriers, bull mastiffs and rottweilers are being vilified and labelled "dangerous dogs" because of their popularity with certain members of society and gang members.When the dog fails to behave in the desired way it can be abused or abandoned. The trust's re-homing centres are seeing more unwanted bull breeds than any other dog.Another dog, a brown pit bull, walks past with its owner, but won't talk.The pit bull was made illegal under the Dangerous Dogs Act, along with Japanese tosas, fila brasilero and dogo argentino. The only way they can be allowed is if the owner obtains a certificate of exemption from a court after having the dog neutered, insured and a transponder implanted and an identification tattoo.
