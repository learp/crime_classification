The government is launching a campaign to warn young motorists against driving under the influence of drugs, and that the same penalties apply as for drunk drivers.The £2.3m Department for Transport campaign features a web page and a TV advertisement, to be shown on ITV for the first time tonight, that points out how police can tell drug-affected drivers by their dilated pupils.A fifth of drivers killed on the road are believed to have a drug in their system, the department said. The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, said it was important to make it as socially unacceptable as drink-driving."Our own research not only showed the high prevalence of drug-driving but it also showed that particularly young men, when driving under the influence of drugs, do not accept that it is dangerous," Adonis said."This is really worrying because whereas with drink-driving people accept that it is dangerous – it is a big social stigma, everyone knows that the law will come down hard on you and that you can kill. With drugs it isn't the same."What we are seeking to do with this advertising campaign is to bring about a cultural change, to get people, particularly young men, to take the same attitude to drug-driving that for 20 or 30 years we have had with drink-driving."Those convicted of driving while unfit through drugs face a minimum 12-month driving ban, a criminal record and a large fine.Adonis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was considering making the relevant law tougher to match some other European countries."The offence at the moment is driving or attempting to drive while unfit through drugs," he said. "We are looking at changing the law so that we could make it an offence simply to drive after taking illegal drugs which can impair the ability to drive."One of the problems faced by authorities was the lack of an equivalent to the roadside breathalyser, which did so much to cut back on drink-driving when introduced in the late 1960s, said Philip Gomm from the RAC Foundation."The technology behind such a device to detect drugs is complex – given the range of drugs available and the time they take to pass through the body – but that is no reason not to spend time developing it," he said.
