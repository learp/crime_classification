One of Britain's richest aristocrats was deeply upset by the theft of a rare and prized painting by Leonardo da Vinci and by the lack of progress in finding it, a jury heard today.The ninth Duke of Buccleuch, John Montagu Douglas Scott, and his father before him, had treasured the painting, Madonna of the Yarnwinder, so dearly they would carry it with them when they travelled between their various houses, the high court in Edinburgh was told.The painting became permanently housed at Drumlanrig castle near Dumfries in the 1970s. Richard Scott, who became the 10th Duke of Buccleuch in September 2007, said the theft of the Leonardo had devastated his father, who did not live to see its recovery in a police raid on a law firm in Glasgow in October 2007."It was hugely emotionally important for all us in the family but I'm sure my father in particular felt most keenly its loss," Scott told the court, of the theft from Drumlanrig in 2003. "He certainly made no secret of it … it was clear to anyone who knew him that he was deeply upset by the loss and by the lack of any progress in recovering the painting."Three lawyers and two "clients" of a firm of private investigators in Liverpool are accused of conspiring to extort £4.25m from the duke's family and threatening to damage or destroy the painting. They also face charges of reset, or handling stolen goods, and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. Cross-examined by Donald Findlay QC, the duke said he and his father had "a fear" the painting could be destroyed or seriously damaged by the thieves or other "volatile" people.This morning the jury of 15 was given a private viewing of the Leonardo, thought to date to 1501, at the National Gallery of Scotland, in Edinburgh.The trial heard the painting was conservatively valued by Christie's in 2008 at £15m-£20m, well under its widely reported worth of between £30-£50m. John Knight, a Christie's director, said very few Leonardos had been sold openly.Robert Graham, 57, and John Doyle, 61, both from Ormskirk, Lancashire, Marshall Ronald, 53, a solicitor from Skelmersdale, Calum Jones, 45, a corporate lawyer from Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire, and David Boyce, 63, a corporate lawyer from Airdrie, deny all the charges. They say they were trying to return the painting legally to the late duke in return for a reward. Jones and Boyce, former employees of HBJ Gateley Wareing, where the police raid took place, say they were giving legal advice to ensure it was properly returned.The trial continues.
