Detectives are hunting the killer of a 78-year-old man who died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a Christmas Eve attack at a Sikh temple.Sohan Singh, who came to Britain from India in 1989, was working at the Guru Nanak temple in Park Village, Wolverhampton, when he was assaulted between 3am and 4am on December 24. Property and a small amount of cash were taken. His widow, three daughters and son still live in India. "He had been staying with his nephew and spent most of his time at the temple, which is open 24 hours and where he worked as a volunteer," a police spokesman said. "At the time of the attack, he was staying at the temple overnight, which was not unusual. There is no indication that this was a racist attack." It is not known whether the intruder or intruders forced their way into the temple, or simply walked in. Chief Supt Tom Duffin said: "It is a very unusual event. It's one that's deeply disturbed us and clearly our thoughts are with his family and other members of the community. "We are going to do everything we can to make sure that the persons responsible are brought to justice."
