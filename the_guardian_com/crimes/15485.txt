A wealthy British playboy has been convicted of murdering a tenant who was holding up a £2m property deal.Thanos Papalexis, 37, who held a fundraiser at his Florida home for Hillary Clinton, faces a life sentence after being found guilty at the Old Bailey on Friday of murdering resident caretaker Charalambos Christodoulides, 55, at a warehouse in Kilburn, north-west London, in March 2000.The conviction could not be reported until today, when the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on Ylli Xhelo, 35, and Robert Baxhija, 29, two Albanian workmen employed by Papalexis, who were also charged with the murder.Papalexis was remanded in custody for sentencing on 30 September. Xhelo and Baxhija were remanded in custody to face a retrial.Papalexis was arrested in Palm Beach last November after police spent years building up a case against him.The prosecution said Papalexis believed that Christodoulides stood in the way of a quick deal to sell the derelict site to save him from financial ruin. He was worried the deal would collapse and he needed money for another development.Christodoulides – a gentle, solitary man known as Bambi to his family – had lived at the warehouse owned by his brother-in-law, Michael Lanitis, for most of his adult life.But Papalexis, who was negotiating to buy the plot, wanted to sell the property in a "back-to-back" deal to a third party to raise cash.The court was told he was in a "perilous" financial state after his inexperience led to heavy losses on another development in Holloway, north London.He was paying £60,000 a week on a bridging loan and was eager to rid himself of anything which stood in the way of the financial lifeline.The body of Christodoulides was found in a garage inspection pit in the warehouse. He had been tied to a chair, tortured and strangled.The property deal fell through and the Holloway development was put into receivership with £8m debts.Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, told the jury: "At the core of this case there is the sheer brutality and ruthlessness of the killing. This was a senseless killing motivated by greed."Papalexis, who was born in London to a Greek shipping businessman, was part of the social circuit in Palm Beach but property dealings in the US ran into problems when he was unable to raise funding.He launched a private members' club offering the rich exclusive access to yachts, a private aircraft and a luxury mansion. But the facilities failed to materialise as advertised and he was served with lawsuits.At one point, Papalexis held a fundraising gala at his rented home for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, which was attended by her and husband, the former US president Bill Clinton.
