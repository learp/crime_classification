In 2016, more than 20 children and teenagers were killed by knives or sharp objects in the UK. The media reporting of these deaths was inconsistent: some stories were told at length, others almost completely ignored. And when it comes to the issue of why and how knife crime is affecting Britain’s young people, the approach is equally frustrating: sensationalised one day and forgotten the next; driven by misconceptions that knife crime is predominantly a problem among inner-city black gangs. Long readIn our year-long series Beyond the Blade, we want to approach the complex issue of knife crime and young people thoroughly and consistently. Gary Younge and Damien Gayle will write about the lives of each child and teenager who dies from knife crime wherever possible. They also want to find out more about the themes that emerge from their deaths, and make it easier to understand the scale of the issue by bringing together data and experiences in one place.Share your views and experiencesWe need your help to gain a deeper understanding about this issue.
