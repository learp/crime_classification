The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday January 22 2007 A gang member receiving information from accomplices in a poker scam wore a hidden earpiece and not a microphone, as we wrongly described it in the article below.A poker cheat who used a hidden miniature camera to film cards as they were being dealt in a casino was jailed for nine months yesterday.Yau Yiv Lam, 45, and two accomplices are believed to have made £250,000 after targeting six London casinos with an array of spy equipment.Using a camera concealed up his sleeve, Lam filmed the croupier dealing cards, then relayed the footage to a nearby van where Fan Leung Tsang, 41, played the images back in slow motion. The card details were then radioed to a third gang member, Bit Chai Wong, 39, who wore a hidden microphone as she sat at the poker table.Staff became suspicious about Wong's extraordinary luck, after she lost just 10 out of 44 plays, during a night at the Mint Casino in Kensington. The game was three card poker, in which players bet against the dealer's hand. Wong made a profit of £3,520, after betting £2,500 in that session.Casino staff contacted police, who arrested the player and the cameraman. They then knocked on the door of the van, which was parked outside. Before they opened the door Tsang tried to destroy the footage but some of it was later pieced back together by police experts.All three pleaded guilty to "cheating at play" under the 1846 Gaming Act at Southwark crown court. Tsang and Wong were given nine month sentences suspended for two years.
