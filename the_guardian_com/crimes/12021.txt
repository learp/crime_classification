Sweeping new powers that prevent evidence disclosed to inquests from being made public are alarming legal rights experts who fear the measures will be used to suppress sensitive information about the security services. Under the new counter-terrorism bill, the Home Secretary can appoint a specialist coroner without a jury at an inquest if national security is 'under threat'.Inquest, which represents the victims of police shootings, expressed grave concerns about the new powers. 'These proposals amount to a fundamental attack on the independence ... of the inquest system and could result in the inquests into highly contentious deaths, such as that of Jean Charles de Menezes, taking place without juries,' said Helen Shaw, of Inquest.
