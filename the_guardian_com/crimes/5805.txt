A group of Mexican tourists burgled houses from Lancaster to Glasgow after they ran out of money during a holiday to Britain, a court heard on Tuesday.Three were jailed for two years for conspiracy to burgle and three others were sentenced to 14 months at Preston crown court. All six will be deported upon completion of their sentences.The court was told that the four men and a couple, also from Mexico, had never met before a chance meeting in a nightclub in London last October.All had travelled to Britain to visit sporting arenas such as the Old Trafford, the base of Manchester United's Mexican striker, Javier Hern√°ndez, but some of the group spent too much money on alcohol so they devised a plan to embark on a burglary spree in northern England and Scotland, the court heard.The burglars targeted addresses in Carlisle, Lancaster, Morecambe, Bolton-le-Sands and Strathclyde while the owners were out between November 16 and 21 last year.They smashed open the front doors of properties and then searched for jewellery, cash and electrical equipment. During one burglary, they were spotted by a witness who called the police. The gang were arrested as they travelled south through Staffordshire.The police recovered stolen goods, lists of addresses and a satellite navigation system which mapped out their travel route. A "significant number" of properties in the Strathclyde area were programmed into the equipment, the court was told.Juan Castillo Fernandez, 28, Cuauthemoc Fernandez Gomez, 30, and Manuel Garcia, 44, were jailed for two years after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary.Jose Vargas Gomez, 51, Juan Molina, 24, and Cristina Obregon, 22, were imprisoned for 14 months after they pleaded guilty to possessing stolen goods. The six gave their address as Springbank Road, Lewisham, south London.Judge Anthony Russell QC said: "You were all here on holiday from Mexico and chose to commit these serious crimes. They are serious because they involved entering people's homes, searching them and stealing valuable items. There was a significant degree of planning."The court heard the defendants had no previous criminal record.
