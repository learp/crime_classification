A judge asked the Home Office yesterday to explain why it apparently ignored a judge's deportation recommendation, and allowed a cash-machine fraudster to remain in Britain and pull off a new scam.Within weeks of his release from a four-year sentence last August, failed Romanian asylum seeker Gheorge Banu, 54, was touring London with fake ATM facades and "systematically pillaging" accounts.By the time Banu, a gang ringleader, was caught, he and others - some of them still on the run - had pocketed Â£630,000, Southwark crown court in London was told.Jailing him for six years, Judge Christopher Hardy said the case gave rise to a number of concerns.But a "particular disturbing feature" was the fact that a recommendation for deportation made by the Portsmouth crown court judge, who was jailing him in January 2003 for four years for a copycat fraud, was not acted upon.That enabled the defendant to rapidly return to his old ways and become involved with an "even more sophisticated" swindle.The judge continued: "Members of the public are increasingly concerned that serious crimes of dishonesty of this type are often committed by people who should not be in this country. They are often called alarmist or worse."I'm sure there is good reason for the Home Office's apparent inaction in your case for the recommendation made for your deportation, but I consider the public has a right to an explanation in the circumstances."I therefore call on the prosecution to contact the Home Office and request a written explanation within 28 days. On receipt of it, I will decide whether it should be made public," he said.The judge told Banu of Stoke Newington, north London, that before he started to serve the current sentence he would first have to complete the outstanding 18 months from the earlier one. Four other Romanians were also sentenced. Anton Stoica, of Mill Hill East, north-westLondon, was jailed for five years.The 28-year-old, who used five aliases and is regarded by police as another principal player, was arrested for a parallel fraud in July last year. He skipped bail to continue with the other scam.Also jailed was "foot soldier" Diego Urgnani, 23, who got three years for one count of conspiracy to defraud that he and the others admitted. He was also given a consecutive six-month term for possessing a fake Italian identity card, to which he also pleaded guilty.Ana Sandu, 33, of Edmonton, north London, received three and a half years, while Adi Matei, 30, of Colindale, north-west London, got three years.All five defendants were recommended for deportation on their release from jail.
