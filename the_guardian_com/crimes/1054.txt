Police are continuing their hunt for the killer of a 93-year-old widow found murdered on Christmas Eve.Margaret Weir was the victim of what officers said was a particularly violent attack at her flat in the Maryhill area of Glasgow. Her body was discovered by a neighbour shortly after 8am. Detective Superintendent Kenny Watters of Strathclyde police said he was appalled by the murder. "We are still trying to establish a motive for this cowardly crime and are pursuing all lines of inquiry," he said. "An incident caravan has been set up, and I would encourage anyone who thinks they could assist in any way to speak to the police." Officers have not yet found out whether anything was taken from the flat. Mrs Weir, who was known as Peggy, lived alone. Neighbours have described her as a popular and independent person, who often left her door unlocked. Police believe the killer may have broken into Mrs Weir's flat three hours before her body was discovered. Neighbours said they had heard a disturbance at around 5am on the morning of the killing. Extra officers were on duty in Maryhill over the weekend and police will hold a press conference this morning.
