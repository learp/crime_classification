A woman was punched and knocked out by car thieves who stole her £50,000 Mercedes and left her unconscious in the road, raising fears that "carjacking" is becoming increasingly common.The attack, which happened in New Charlton, south-east London, on Friday, came just days after estate agent Timothy Robinson was killed in a possible carjacking in Battersea, south-west London. Mr Robinson, 25, was stabbed on his doorstep as he returned home and died from a knife wound to the heart. A £10,000 reward for information leading to the capture and conviction of his killers was put up yesterday by the News of the World. The attack on the 41-year-old mother happened as she was returning home from work when her car was hit from behind on a roundabout. She went to talk to the driver of the car that had struck her. As she approached, according to a Metropolitan police spokesman, a man in his 30s jumped out and punched her in the face. He and an accomplice then drove off in her car, while a third person drove the attackers' car. Police said the suspect's car would have suffered damage to the front nearside wing and bumper, although they have not issued a description of the vehicle. They warned any motorists involved in a collision and leaving their car to take their car keys with them. A spokesman said: "We need to trace witnesses to the robbery, or anyone who may have seen the missing Mercedes - or the suspect vehicle - since the incident."
