London Underground staff ignored orders to evacuate a tube station after a suicide blast on a train and instead tried to reach injured passengers, the inquest into the 7 July 2005 attacks heard today.Darren Glazer, a duty station manager who assumed "silver" operational control of Liverpool Street station, told the inquests into the 52 people who died in the attacks that British Transport police stopped some of his staff going into the tunnel between Liverpool Street and Aldgate because of fears of additional devices.Glazer said: "It was just confusion, nobody seemed to have any answers as to exactly what was going on, what the problem was, or where the problem was exactly. There were lots of conflicting stories and information."No one tried to investigate the cause of the blast via the Liverpool Street end of the tunnel in the first 25 minutes after the explosion, he told the inquests, and when he began to make plans to do so he was overruled by a British Transport police officer who had assumed overall control of the situation and ordered the station be evacuated."So the system was saved by staff at Aldgate going down into the tunnel without pause or hesitation," said Hugo Keith QC, counsel to the inquests.Glazer replied: "Well, not the system. The unfortunate people in the situation itself were saved and looked after. The process itself was obviously there for a good reason."The station supervisor at Aldgate, Celia Harrison, had passed on reports from a colleague on the stricken train that the explosion appeared to have been caused by a bomb. But Tom O'Riordan, the group station manager who later appointed himself silver command at Aldgate, said he had not had a "credible" report of a bomb until he watched a BBC news report more than two hours later.Daniel Kemp, a control room assistant at Liverpool Street, said the first he had heard of possible blasts on other trains and a bus was when his mother called him. He agreed with Keith that he had received more information in that call than he had in the control room of one of the bombed stations.Lady Justice Hallett, the coroner, described as "totally brilliant" a number of LU drivers and station staff at Aldgate who ventured into the tunnel after the blast.Addressing Olanayi Falayi, a station supervisor who climbed into the bombed carriage to reassure the wounded, she said: "You were very brave and I'm sure that the efforts that you made, despite the risk to yourself to save and help people there in that dreadful scene will have provided some comfort to those who have either lost people or who themselves were dreadfully injured."The police had also requested an evacuation at Aldgate, Falayi said, but "when it first was called not everybody left straight away because we felt we could do more for those who were still lying on the track".The inquests continue.
