Police forces are to face regular public questioning over what they are doing to tackle antisocial behaviour, under new measures expected to be unveiled by the prime minister tomorrow.The plans, part of Tony Blair's "respect" crusade, involve giving local people the right to demand tougher action against neighbourhood troublemakers.Regular "face the people" sessions, which will be open to the media, will see police officers, council staff and other officials forced to detail what they are doing to tackle antisocial behaviour.And if they think problems are being ignored, local people across England and Wales will be able to make an official "community call to action". That will be backed up by a local committee, which would issue findings the police, and other agencies, would be obliged to address.Both measures are included in a respect action plan, which the prime minister will detail in Downing Street before a national tour by 16 ministers to promote it.A spokesman for Number 10 said: "Our approach of encouraging local agencies to implement measures developed nationally is one which is working."Where there has been a concentrated campaign to tackle the problem, there has been both a big increase in the use of powers and a significant decline in concern about antisocial behaviour."This action plan focuses on the minority who won't adhere to common rules causing individuals and families misery while devastating local communities." The "call to action" powers will give local communities the right to "require a response" where action does not seem to be happening.Difficult cases would be referred to the local council's scrutiny committee which would have a duty to consider the issue and respond within a deadline. Agencies would have a duty to respond to its findings.A national parenting academy will also be set up as part of the plan.
