Lawyers for a man who alleges that British intelligence officials colluded in his torture are considering an appeal to the European court of human rights after the court of appeal rejected his challenge against conviction yesterday.Salahuddin Amin was questioned repeatedly by two MI5 officers while being held in Pakistan and allegedly tortured by agents from that country's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI), before being flown to Britain where he was tried and convicted for his role in a plot to bomb targets around the south-east of England.Three judges rejected an attempt by Amin and four other men to overturn their convictions yesterday and refused them permission to appeal to the House of Lords. Much of the appeal was held in camera, with the press and the public excluded. Amin, from Luton, Bedfordshire, Omar Khyam, Waheed Mahmood and Jawad Akbar, from Crawley, West Sussex, and Anthony Garcia, of Barkingside, east London, were all found guilty of conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life after a trial at the Old Bailey last year. The jury heard that the five plotted to bomb public places using a bomb made from half a tonne of fertiliser. Amin's life sentence would also stand, the court ruled, although the minimum term that he had to serve was reduced from 17Â½ years to 16 years and nine months.A statement issued by the Home Office said: "The security and intelligence agencies do not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment."
