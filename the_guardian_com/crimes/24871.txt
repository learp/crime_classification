Nick Clegg has insisted there will be no change to the coalition government's austerity programme, including cuts to police, despite the riots and looting in English cities and towns since Saturday.The deputy prime minister said Britain had to wipe the deficit slate clean for future generations and the police would have to make savings just like everyone else. The government was confident these were "manageable".Clegg, speaking before an emergency Commons debate on the crisis, said the government's first obligation was to "show that we can keep our streets safe".He said: "It's a basic need that we've all got to know that our homes, our shops, our communities can be kept safe at times like this. I think the immediate priority is to see through what the police have been doing successfully in the last few days, which is getting on top of the situation, making sure that the streets are safe again, getting people into court and getting them behind bars where appropriate."Although he criticised the "smash and grab" and "get what you can, while you can" culture of those involved in the unrest, Clegg's rhetoric was different from David Cameron, who on Wednesday condemned the "sick" pockets of society responsible for the unrest.Interviewed on Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, Clegg said there were "real problems with parts of our society" but there had been "healthy expressions" of a strong society in areas most affected by violence.He said the riots were an indication that "something is going seriously wrong" in parts of society. "Undoubtedly, when people have so little sense of obligation towards their own neighbourhoods that they actually go out and trash them, something is going seriously wrong."Of course it is a deep question which we need to look at in the weeks and months ahead. But it's also a rather specific question now of asserting â€¦ that if you indulge in criminality you will face consequences."Yes, let's have the sociological debates in the weeks and months ahead but right now it is very important that people are reassured, that our streets are made safe, their homes are made safe and that we are able as a society to move on from what has been a very, very shocking set of experiences."He conceded there was an "issue of values" behind the disturbances. "If the predominant values are one of, sort of, smash and grab, get what you can, when you can, then of course that plays a role," he said."None of that can be an excuse under any circumstances for people trashing and ruining their own communities."Police budgets would be cut. He said: "It is a policy which is not going to change because of course the police have to make savings, just as everybody else does, because of the wider reasons we are all aware of"I wish it was as easy as simply saying we just stop that policy, change that, don't ask the police to make savings and all will be all right."But you've got to remember that even after the savings that have been made police will be able to do what they have done over the last few days, namely move police officers in significant numbers from one area to the other to make sure in exceptional circumstances that disquiet is quelled and the streets are kept safe."
