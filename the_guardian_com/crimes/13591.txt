The home secretary has announced that many more police will be authorised to carry Taser stun guns.John Reid told a Police Federation conference he wants non-firearms officers to have the devices, which stun suspects with a 50,000-volt shock.Police will also be able to use them in a wider range of situations.Mr Reid insisted the weapons are a safe alternative to guns and are increasingly needed to deal with violent offenders. However, Amnesty International has opposed the use of the US-manufactured weapons, claiming they can be lethal."The police service is facing unprecedented challenges and this government is committed to providing them with the tools they need to meet the demands of modern policing," Mr Reid told delegates in Blackpool.A Home Office spokesman said: "The intention, subsequent to medical advice, is to start a trial to extend to the use of Taser to specially trained teams. They provide additional options and are less lethal than conventional firearms."A 12-month trial will extend it to specially trained units, who will not necessarily be authorised firearms officers."It would also extend the use of Taser by authorised firearms officers where the criteria to use firearms do not apply."Tasers are used in incidents where officers are faced with violence or the threat of violence, and used only when they need to use force to protect themselves or members of the public."The spokesman said the trial would only be given the go-ahead after the UK's defence scientific advisory council sub-committee reports next month on the devices' long-term medical effects.The council concluded in 2004 that the risk of life-threatening or serious injury from the weapon used by police in England and Wales was "very low".Kate Allen, Amnesty UK director, said: "We are worried that this may be the start of a slippery slope towards a situation like that in the US, where officers are routinely armed with Tasers and use them in a wide range of situations."Amnesty has studied the use of Tasers in the US and Canada, where more than 220 people have died since 2001 after being Tasered. A Police Federation spokesman supported the plan, saying: "We think it is a vital piece of equipment for frontline officers to have."The trial, expected to begin in September, is expected to involve 11 forces. More than 3,000 Tasers have already been distributed to special firearms officers.Ms Allen of Amnesty said: "Our message is simple - Tasers are potentially lethal and should be treated as such. We want comprehensive and independent testing to establish that they are safe before the government considers handing them out to every police officer. "Amnesty would also like a meeting with the minister to discuss the implications of this decision for human rights in the UK."distributed to special firearms officers.
