Two men were charged today with helping the fugitive gunman Raoul Moat during his seven days on the run from a huge police operation in Northumberland.The pair were accused of conspiracy to murder and possessing a firearm, after allegedly accompanying Moat when he wounded his former partner Samantha Stobbart and shot dead her new boyfriend Chris Brown in early July.Karl Ness, 26, and Qhuram Awan, 23, are the first of 20 suspected helpers of Moat to appear in court. They sat in silence during the brief hearing at Newcastle crown court where they were separated in the dock by three security guards. Neither entered a plea and both were remanded in custody for a trial expected to start in the new year.Police initially feared that the two men were being held hostage by Moat, after he turned up at Stobbart's house in Birtley, near Chester-le-Street shortly after his release from Durham jail. But detectives then arrested them on suspicion of obtaining a sawn-off shotgun for Moat on his release, and getting supplies while he hid from the huge search, which at one stage involved RAF jets with heat-seeking equipment normally used in Afghanistan.Moat died after emerging near one of his suspected hiding places in a storm drain below Rothbury, on the edge of Northumberland national park. He shot himself on the bank of the river Coquet after a six-hour standoff with police ended with the firing of two Taser stun guns.Ness, of Dudley in North Tyneside, appeared in court bearded and with shaved ginger hair, sitting with hisarms folded throughout. Awan, of Blyth in Northumberland, wore a black T-shirt. Both spoke only to confirm their personal details. They were remanded in custody to stand trial on 24 January.
