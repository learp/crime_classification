Britain's most powerful criminals could have their assets seized even if they have not been convicted of an offence under legislation to be introduced by the government.Police have identified around 400 cases where criminals have amassed personal fortunes worth a total of £440m. Some £200m of that is controlled by just 39 "crime lords", who will be the focus of the effort to seize the cash that drives organised crime. Some of the country's most notorious criminals are believed to be among those targeted. Curtis "Cocky" Warren, a drug dealer serving a 12-year term in a Dutch prison for importing cocaine is believed to be the richest criminal in British history, even making it on to a list of the 500 wealthiest people in Britain. Some estimates put his wealth at more than £150m, assets which are dispersed in property across Europe, offshore accounts, and diverse business interests. Kenneth Noye, believed to have laundered the £25m proceeds of the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery, is also thought to be a target. Noye was given a life sentence last month for the "road rage" murder of Stephen Cameron. The legislation, which was being announced for the third time in 18 months, will extend civil forfeiture powers, allowing courts to recover proceeds of crime from people without convictions. A new body, the national confiscation agency, will be established to co-ordinate the process, and a strategy will be drawn up to co-ordinate police, customs, national criminal intelligence service, and inland revenue investigations. The burden of proof in civil cases will fall on those accused of amassing fortunes from criminal activities. Jack Straw, the home secretary, said such actions would be brought on the basis of intelligence, and that individual privacy would be protected. However, John Wadham, director of the civil rights group, Liberty, rejected the home secretary's reassurances, saying that the proposals undermined the presumption of innocence.
