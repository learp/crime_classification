The information commissioner signalled a crackdown last night on companies that steal and sell sensitive details of people's private lives after a prosecution exposed the growth in data theft.Richard Thomas, the official privacy watchdog, said he was investigating a number of organisations that have bought personal data such as details of bank accounts, tax returns and mortgage payments. He warned of raids and prosecutions after the conviction yesterday of a husband and wife who made £140,000 a year selling private financial information obtained by deception.The Guardian has learned that two of the country's leading law firms - Mishcon de Reya and Arnold & Porter - were linked to the couple's scam. The firms deny any knowledge of illegal activity, but confirm they hired private detective agencies to find out information for their clients.The privacy watchdog suspects some big companies are exploiting the trade in personal data, which has been driven by the growth in computer databases and call centres operated by banks, utility companies and government departments.Mr Thomas wants to widen his investigations to pursue those who buy personal data, as well as those who make a living selling it.He will also campaign to persuade Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs minister, to increase penalties. He wants jail terms for data thieves but is opposed by some newspapers, who say it would be a threat to free speech."These are serious offences, which are highly damaging to the individuals concerned. People's personal details ought not to fall into the wrong hands," Mr Thomas's office said yesterday.A court heard how Sharon and Stephen Anderson had made a career out of bogus phone calls to penetrate the details of people's bank accounts and tax returns all over the country.In what Mr Thomas has described as a thriving black market in personal information, the pair were hired as sub-contractors by three detective agencies, Carratu International, Fleet Investigations and Keypoint Services, all of which denied knowledge of the couple's crimes committed on their behalf.Guardian inquiries reveal that the ultimate clients in yesterday's case included a Japanese air-conditioning firm, Daikin, and a US insurance company, CNA. Those firms too, say they were unaware illegal methods were being used.The victims of "blagging", as such bogus calls are known, included David Hughes, former chairman of the collapsed football shirts empire Allsports, and Jon Sanders, a Manchester insurance broker. They were both said to be indignant that their privacy had been invaded.At Huntingdon magistrates court yesterday, where the Andersons pleaded guilty to breaching the Data Protection Acts and were ordered to pay £14,800 in fines and costs, their lawyer said their firm, based in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, was purely devoted to commercial disputes. They denied ever acting for warring spouses or newspapers on what they said were "ethical" grounds.But Phil Taylor, prosecuting for the information commissioner, said: "People have the right to feel their information is safe and secure". He told the magistrates: "There is a real risk information can be used for sinister purposes." Bogus callers could be used to extract personal information from databases on behalf of criminals, or to intimidate witnesses.
