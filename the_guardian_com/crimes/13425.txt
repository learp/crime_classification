More than 360 people were arrested in a series of coordinated raids across London as the Metropolitan police launched an operation to halt the rising number of burglaries.Details of the crackdown were revealed yesterday after three days in which 1,100 officers targeted a hard core of suspected offenders. The Met said the initiative had led to 163 people being charged with burglary. Property worth an estimated £442,240 was recovered, including computers, videos, televisions, jewellery and cash. The number of burglaries in the capital rose last year after a decade of steady decline, raising fears that the Met's efforts to curb street crime - a Downing Street priority - had had a knock-on effect. After weeks of planning the burglary initiative, called Safer Homes, began on Friday and continued until midday on Sunday, with officers, some of them wearing body armour, rounding up known and suspected offenders in all the capital's hotspots. One suspect tried to stab officers with a syringe and had to be restrained with CS spray. Acting assistant commissioner Tim Godwin said yesterday the initiative had been timed to coincide with the clocks going back. With darkness falling earlier in the afternoon, criminals always had greater opportunity at this time of year, he said. · A man who is thought to be one of Britain's most prolific burglars is expected to be sentenced next month. He has already been convicted of two offences and is suspected in up to 600 others.
