Milan Mandaric has said that he is "astounded and dismayed" that he is to face charges of cheating the public revenue relating to a payment made during his time as chairman of Portsmouth.The Leicester City chairman strenuously denies the allegations by HM Revenue and Customs, which go back to his time at Fratton Park from 1998 to 2006 and money paid to Harry Redknapp, who was the club's manager at the time.A statement issued by Cartwright King solicitors, who represent Mandaric, read: "Milan Mandaric is astounded and dismayed that proceedings are to be brought by HMRC in the new year alleging a connection with unpaid tax on a personal payment he made to Harry Redknapp in 2002. These will be vigorously defended."During a two-year investigation he has fully co-operated and has strenuously denied any wrongdoing."Expert tax advice has confirmed that Mr Mandaric has no tax liability. The decision of HMRC to bring proceedings is very surprising."Throughout a successful and respected 45-year international business career he has gained an impeccable reputation and has never been accused of the slightest wrongdoing, nor had his integrity called into question."Over the last 10 years in English football, the clubs that Mr Mandaric has invested in have employed hundreds of people and paid millions of pounds in taxes to HMRC."Redknapp, now the Tottenham Hotspur manager, has also been told that he will face charges. He was originally arrested on suspicion of false accounting and conspiracy to defraud in November 2007. Sources at HMRC have indicated any court case may not begin until well into the new year, and possibly 2011. PA
