A musician who trawled the internet for snuff movies and necrophilia websites was today found guilty of murdering a special needs teacher to fulfil a perverted fantasy.Graham Coutts, 39, was convicted at the Old Bailey of strangling Jane Longhurst with a pair of tights after forcing her into sex.The court was told how he had hidden her body in a storage depot before taking it to secluded woodland and setting it alight.The jury found Coutts guilty by an 11-to-one majority after hearing that the part-time musician had killed Miss Longhurst to satisfy a "longstanding and perverted sexual interest" in strangling women to death.Coutts, of Waterloo Street, Hove, East Sussex, repeatedly visited her body, which he kept in a storage unit and regarded as his "trophy", for a "sexual thrill", the court heard.Philip Katz QC, prosecuting, told the court that Coutts had been looking at "horrific" images on pornographic websites the day before he committed the murder in March 2003.The jury heard that he carried out web searches on terms such as "strangled women", "dead women", "asphyxia", "rape", "murder", "necro" and "snuff".A former partner told the court that Coutts had confessed: "I get the most awful feeling that I'm going to strangle and kill a woman."Coutts later told a psychiatrist that he had fantasised about murdering women since he was 15 and feared it might lead him to commit crime."His sexual turn-on was in serious violence to women, killing women by strangulation and sex with dead women," Mr Katz said.The victim's mother, Liz Longhurst, led a campaign to outlaw violent pornographic websites in the wake of the murder.Measures prohibiting extreme and violent pornography were published in the criminal justice and immigration bill last month, and are expected to become law later this year or in early 2008. Possession of such images, which are not covered by current obscenity laws, will be punishable by up to three years in jail.Jurors were not shown photographs of Coutts' ex-girlfriend Nicola Stainforth and other women over which he had drawn nooses around their necks.They were also not told that in 1997 Customs officers intercepted a package addressed to Coutts containing videos called Psycho Sisters and Murder Times Two.The tapes featured simulated violence against women who were "restrained and hanging from things". At the time Coutts was given a warning about future conduct.Coutts, a part-time salesman and a guitarist with a Who tribute band, was first found guilty of Miss Longhurst's murder in 2004. But a retrial was ordered after law lords ruled that his conviction was unsafe because jurors were not offered the alternative count of manslaughter.The judge, Richard Hone, adjourned sentencing until tomorrow so that emotion could be set aside. He told the jury: "This case has been one of the most testing ones that, in my experience, a jury has had to try."Coutts faces a life sentence.
