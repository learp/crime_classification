Britain's most senior police officer yesterday pressed the government for tougher powers to compel some clubs and bars to search for guns and knives on their premises.Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, revealed that he would be contacting the Home Office to seek to strengthen the Violent Crime Reduction bill, and so force certain venues to carry out proper checks.He told the London assembly that the measure was part of Labour's manifesto and that it was known that knife and gun culture flourished in some clubs. "These are very difficult areas to police inside. Going into a large club to find somebody with a gun is a very dangerous enterprise whereas if we had metal searches there I think that would be a very good plan." Referring to the weapons risk, the Labour manifesto said: "At-risk pubs and clubs will be required to search for them." The pledge does not appear in the bill in that form but a Home Office spokeswoman said the legislation would allow authorities to review licences and impose conditions, such as the requirement to search for guns and knives. Sir Ian, who was speaking at City Hall, London, also warned that there was some way to go before ID cards could be introduced. He still backed them but said they would only be effective in tackling terrorism and serious crime if the technology - recognition of biometric indicators, such as irises and fingerprints - was "as close to foolproof as possible". He added: "There are a whole pile of logistics that have to be got right." He did not support a regime that entailed police "demanding to see people's papers" at random. But he warned there were still several hundred potential terrorists in the UK. "The primary responsibility of the [Met] is to keep London safe from terrorism. Our message remains 'alert not alarm'. We must be very concerned about complacency ... because if we drop our guard trouble is out there."
