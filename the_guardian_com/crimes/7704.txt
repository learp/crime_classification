Police failed to act on concerns about a banned dog which went on to fatally attack a six-month-old baby, a report has found.Molly-Mae Wotherspoon died from severe blood loss after being savaged by the American pit bull called Bruiser at the family home in Daventry in October 2014.Her mother, Claire Riley, and grandmother Susan Aucott were both given two-year prison terms last month over her death.A report from the Northamptonshire Safeguarding Children Board said a vet to whom Riley, 23, had taken the dog nine months before the fatal attack believed Bruiser was a “banned type”.“The dog was so fierce that a vet had earlier refused to examine it for an illness unless it was first fully sedated,” said the report.This information was passed on to the RSPCA, which then forwarded the information to police, but the report said: “The police failed to carry out any further inquiries into that dog, or into who lived in the same household as the dog.”Molly-Mae, referred to as Child Q throughout the report, suffered a catalogue of injuries including a fractured skull, bites to every limb and four puncture wounds to her brain. She died of severe blood loss.The report said: “Although Child Q had not been born at that time, if the dog taken to the vet was, as seems likely, the same dog which later killed her, it goes without saying that had the police taken action over the intelligence from the RSPCA they may have been in a position to obtain a magistrates’ warrant to remove the dog from the house for an assessment.“This must be considered as potentially a missed opportunity to change the outcome for Child Q.”The report concluded that no single professional “could or should have prevented Child Q’s death” but made eight recommendations.On the night of the attack, the baby was being cared for by her grandmother while Riley went for a night out with friends.During last month’s hearing at at Northampton crown court, it was said Bruiser, who weighed 33kg, was kept in a cage alongside a Staffordshire bull terrier called Pups, and he escaped “without apparent difficulty”.At around 10.30pm, the dog made its way out of the “flimsy” cage in the kitchen and managed to open the door into the living room, where Molly-Mae was on a changing mat.Prosecutor James House said: “The attack was sustained. Susan Aucott simply was unable to bring Bruiser under control or remove Molly-Mae from the situation.”Police were forced to use pepper spray to subdue Bruiser for emergency services to gain access to the property and House said it later took “several people” and a “significant amount of time” to euthanise the dog.Northamptonshire police said it had carried out a “complete overhaul” of its policy within weeks of the tragedy.Detective Superintendent Steve Lingley, the force’s head of safeguarding, said: “The key driver for this has been to ensure that any report of a dangerous dog is responded to in line with our core aim of protecting people from harm.”Keith Makin, chairman of the safeguarding board, said: “This was a deeply distressing case which ended with the tragic death of a young baby.”He added that a number of the recommendations made had already been enacted – and recommended “greater professional curiosity” about family pets from midwives and other health workers.
