A specialist pathologist whose evidence helped quash the conviction of Sally Clark for the murder of her two babies will be the main witness in the appeal of a couple jailed for killing their adoptive son by poisoning him with salt.Lawyers for Ian and Angela Gay, who have spent 14 months in prison for the manslaughter of Christian Blewitt, believe their case is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in recent years. They compare it to the wrongful conviction of Mrs Clark, a solicitor eventually cleared of murdering her sons, and Angela Cannings, cleared on appeal of murdering her two babies.At the court of appeal tomorrow Glyn Walters, a retired chemical pathologist, will give evidence at the Gays' appeal that the boy died as a result of an undiscovered illness that meant the levels of salt in his body were wrongly regulated. Mr Walters was crucial to the acquittal of Mrs Clark, after giving evidence that her second baby died of natural causes.The appeal court will be told that Christian had a condition that affected the cells in the brain that regulate salt levels. It is linked to salt diabetes, a condition which was excluded from the Gays' trial.Carl Swain, Angela Gay's brother, said: "We are still at a loss to know what it is that Angela and Ian were supposed to have done in the first place. Because the Crown Prosecution Service never put forward how they physically force fed that much salt down a three-year-old child."Angela Gay, 40, and her husband Ian, 39, always knew they would not be able to have their own children because Mrs Gay had a hysterectomy in her teens.After vetting by social services they took on Christian, three, his 10-month-old sister and two-year-old brother, for a 13-week placement before formal adoption took place. They moved to Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to raise the children. Mr Gay, an electrical engineer, was to become a house-husband while his wife, an actuary, became the main breadwinner.But the prosecution painted Mr and Mrs Gay as an uncaring couple who wanted children to complete their perfect lifestyle but were unable to cope with the broken nights, nappy changing and disruption.Five weeks into the 13-week placement, in a fit of temper after Christian misbehaved at table, smearing gravy over his face, the prosecution said the Gays poisoned him with four teaspoons of salt, also shaking him to cause head injuries.The trial in January last year involved disputed medical evidence from more than a dozen experts who could not agree on how he came by his head injuries. The murder charge was reduced to manslaughter when it became apparent that the injuries may have been caused in hospital. Although there was discussion at the trial of an underlying illness it was never established because the boy's medical records had gone missing.The trial involved the work of Sir Roy Meadow, who wrote what his peers said was a seminal work on salt poisoning in the 1990s. However, the work has since been questioned by at least one leading endocrinologist, Ashley Grossman, who has told the Gays' defence team that 12 of the children in the Meadow's paper were likely to be suffering from salt diabetes.Peter Acland, a Home Office pathologist, who carried out a postmortem on the body, told the Guardian yesterday: "I wasn't persuaded by any means that a crime had been committed, let alone that the two conspired together deliberately to do this."
