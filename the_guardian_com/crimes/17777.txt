A solicitor was jailed for life today for arranging the contract killing of his business partner to get a life assurance payout. Vina Patel, 51, was found dead in her office in Cort and Co solicitors in Leicester on 15 January last year. John Cort, 54, of Leicester, and Brian Farrell, 37, of Bayswater, west London, were found guilty of murdering Mrs Patel and were sentenced to life imprisonment. Setting a minimum term of 29 years for Cort and 28 years for Farrell, Mrs Justice Linda Dobbs at Nottingham crown court told them the murder was "premeditated, calculated and ruthless". PA
