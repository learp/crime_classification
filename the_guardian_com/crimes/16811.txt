Three detectives face disciplinary action over "clear failings" to apprehend a wanted armed robber who went on to shoot a sub-postmaster's son dead during a raid.The Independent Police Complaints Commission said the West Mercia force knew about DNA evidence which linked Anselm Ribera to a string of robberies dating back to March 2008 five months before he went on to kill Craig Hodson-Walker in Fairfield, Worcestershire.Ribera's details had been circulated on the police national computer as a suspect in September 2008 after the DNA link was made but he was never apprehended. It was only after the killing of Hodson-Walker during an armed robbery in January 2009 that he was arrested."Detectives from West Mercia police should have made efforts to arrest Anselm Ribera on suspicion of robbery offences prior to his carrying out an attempted armed robbery at Fairfield post office," the IPCC said in a statement.The earliest of the robberies to which he was linked had taken place on 25 March 2008; the second was on 9 May 2008; and the third was an armed robbery at a pub on 25 August that year.IPCC commissioner Len Jackson said mistakes made by individuals had undoubtedly been compounded by organisational weaknesses within the force."Regrettably, there were clear failings by individual detectives in this case, but it merits saying they were officers under pressure of heavy workload working at times without necessary supervision," he said."We have made a series of recommendations to West Mercia police on improving supervision for detectives, on keeping intelligence up to date, and better recording of decision-making."West Mercia police said three detectives faced disciplinary action as a result of the findings.It said: "West Mercia police recognised that the previous robbery offences in north Worcestershire could have been dealt with better and we immediately initiated thorough reinvestigations and referred the apparent issues to the Independent Police Complaints Commission."Wider lessons for the force have been acted upon in an effort to continuously improve the quality of service provided to victims of crime."Ribera, from Birmingham, and two other men were each ordered to serve at least 34 years in jail after being found guilty of murder last year.
