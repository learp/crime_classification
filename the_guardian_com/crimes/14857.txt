A 16-year-old boy who terrorised a small town has been barred from a large area of Scotland by a sheriff.Edmond Eccles and his "private army" of teenagers conducted a four-month campaign of violence, vandalism, housebreaking and intimidation in Alva. The problem was so severe that the first minister, Jack McConnell, visited the Clackmannanshire community to address concerns. Yesterday, at Alloa sheriff court, Sheriff William Reid banned Eccles from the entire sheriffdom of Tayside, Central and Fife. The exclusion means that Eccles will have to stay out of a large swathe of Scotland, except for court appearances.
