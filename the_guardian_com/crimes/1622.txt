Police in Scotland have launched a murder investigation after the decomposed body of young man was found in a suitcase.Police divers pulled the case out of the Water of Leith, Edinburgh, after a tip-off on Monday. The body, believed to be that of a man in his 20s, was fully clothed. Police said it might have been in the water for several days. Officers who first attended the scene, in the Shore area of Leith, spotted a suitcase floating in the water, and forensic experts, divers and the fire service were called in. Two screens were erected, but onlookers reported seeing a dark-coloured suitcase removed from the water. Police say they know the identity of the dead man but have not been able to contact his relatives. A postmortem examination was carried out yesterday but police have declined to reveal how or when the man died. It is understood police visited the Dunedin Housing Association hostel close to the site of the discovery, and that inquiries are centred there.
