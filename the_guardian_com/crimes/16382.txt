Police are hunting a gunman after two men were shot and injured on farmland.Police are searching for Francis O'Donoghue, 27, who is believed to have been at his home on the farm in Essex when the shooting happened at 3.30pm on Tuesday.The victims were left with gunshot wounds to the legs and chest following the incident on land in Navestock, Brentwood.They are being treated in hospital under armed police guard and are both in a stable condition, Essex police said.Armed officers remained at the farm overnight while the search for O'Donoghue continued.Superintendent Trevor Roe said inquiries suggested the two victims and the gunman knew each other, but there was no explanation for the attack.He said: "We would urge people who know Francis to avoid him purely because he is in possession of a firearm and those who come into contact with him should call us immediately. There is nothing though to suggest that anyone else is at risk of being injured."O'Donoghue is described as white, about 5ft 11in and in his late 20s. He is of average build, with short-brown hair, protruding ears and speaks with an Irish accent.Anyone with information about the shooting should call Essex police on 101, or 999 if they know of O'Donoghue's whereabouts.
