A Northern Ireland lawyer begins a 10-year jail sentence today after pleading guilty to inciting loyalist terrorists to murder.Solicitor Manmohan "Johnny" Sandhu, 44, based in County Derry, also pleaded guilty to four charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice.The charges were brought after police secretly recorded his interviews with clients at Antrim police station.The judge at Belfast crown court told him: "It was a wicked thing to incite men of violence."Mr Justice Deeny continued: "This was all the more so when you were a solicitor. Such conduct must be deserving of a severe sentence."The charges against Sandhu arose from the attempted murder of taxi driver Jonathan Hillier in Newtownards in August 2005 and the murders of Jameson Lockhart and Andrew Cully.An earlier court hearing was told that Sandhu, who practised out of offices in Limavady, incited members of the Ulster Volunteer Force to murder Hillier in hospital in August 2005 as he recovered from an attempt on his life.The prosecution said Sandhu phoned an unknown person from Antrim police station and indicated that Hillier "should be taken out".The lawyer also attempted to pervert the course of justice in the investigation into the shooting.In another secret recording, Sandhu was heard coaching his client, Christopher Dinsmore, who was accused of murdering Jameson Lockhart.Lockhart was shot as he sat in a lorry on the Lower Newtownards Road in Belfast in July 2005 during a power struggle between the UVF and the Loyalist Volunteer Force.Sandhu told his client how to explain how gloves with cartridge discharge residue came to be seized from his house.According to transcripts read at an earlier court hearing, Sandhu initially suggested Dinsmore joined a rifle club to explain the residue, and then he suggested that he say the gloves belonged to murdered UDA boss Jim Gray.Mr Justice Deeny said Sandhu went far beyond his role as a legal adviser."Reading the interviews, the picture is not that of an officer of the court discharging his duty to his client but of an enthusiastic gang member."Sandhu has been suspended by the Law Society.After he was sentenced, Pamela Atchison, a senior lawyer in the Public Prosecution Service, said: "The conviction of a solicitor for offences including incitement to murder has raised important issues with regard to legal professional privilege."Legal professional privilege does not include communications which are made for the purpose of obtaining advice on the commission of a future crime, or communications which are part of a crime."
