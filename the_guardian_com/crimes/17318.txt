Detectives hunting the killer of a student nurse whose bloodstained body was found in her flat after reports of an angry row have named a man they urgently want to interview.Steven Balme, aged 34 and her partner, has not been seen since Sunday, a day before officers broke into the flat in Copley, on the outskirts of Halifax, and found the body of 30-year-old Helen Stokes, who had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer.A spokesman from West Yorkshire police said: "We are taking the unusual step of naming him because we are concerned for his welfare."
