"All change in history," wrote AJP Taylor, "all advance, comes from the non-conformists. If there had been no troublemakers, no dissenters, we should still be living in caves." Commander Brian Paddick is just such a man - a dissenter, a nonconformist and a troublemaker. His views on cannabis and policing will one day seem commonplace. But his courageous advocacy of those views - coupled with his sexual orientation - made it almost inevitable that he would be personally targeted and vilified.Yesterday the hunters claimed their scalp. Paddick, a refreshingly bold Metropolitan police commander for the Brixton area, was transferred from his high profile job following a tacky investigation into his private life. A Sunday newspaper reportedly paid Â£100,000 to a former gay partner to spill the beans on their life together. He suggested they had shared at least 100 cannabis joints. This was denied by Mr Paddick but, he admitted that his partner had openly used cannabis while they shared a home. A Police Foundation report is due out tomorrow on the six-month pilot programme which the commander organised in Brixton. It will show his strategy saved 2,500 hours of police time, allowing his officers to concentrate on more serious offences, including a 19% increase in arrests of dealers in hard drugs. No wonder Brixton's community leaders yesterday were upset by Mr Paddick's removal. He has a real commitment to the area. Unlike his contemporaries, he actually sought the post, possibly the hardest in English policing. Mr Paddick's police experiment will stand the test of time. It is in line with last week's report from the advisory council on the misuse of drugs, which endorsed the home secretary's plan to downgrade cannabis to category C, turning it into a non-arrestable offence. His own career is less certain. Yesterday he behaved with a dignity notably lacking in some of his homophobic accusers.
