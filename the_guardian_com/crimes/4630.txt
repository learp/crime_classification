Nineteen Malaysian women identified as suspected victims of sex trafficking were freed in dawn raids on five addresses across England yesterday. It was the largest coordinated police operation against trafficking since the start of a government crackdown this year.More than 50 officers raided premises in London, Hertfordshire, and the West Midlands, the culmination of a five-month Metropolitan police investigation of a gang suspected of bringing Malaysian women to Britain for forced prostitution. Eleven men and one woman were arrested on suspicion of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and conspiracy to control prostitution for gain. One man, a Vietnamese alleged by police to be the organiser, was arrested along with his partner in a hotel room in north London.Police discovered 13 of the suspected victims of trafficking in a six-bedroom house near Hyde Park, London, and a further six at an address in Birmingham.The raids were the latest action under the umbrella taskforce Operation Pentameter, a government-funded initiative which has led to more than 150 trafficking-related arrests.Police said that all the 19 women who had been freed had first been taken by officers to a reception centre run in partnership with the Salvation Army.They were then taken to different accommodation at undisclosed addresses run by agencies and charities which wished to remain anonymous, where they were being offered appropriate care and assistance.Police are arranging the return of some of the women to Malaysia in liaison with an unnamed Malaysian charity.
