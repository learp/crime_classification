A senior police officer yesterday denied at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry that he was corrupt and had tried to hinder the investigation into the teenager's racist murder.Commander Raymond Adams said the timing of his permanent sick leave, shortly after he became involved in the investigation, was coincidental. He wanted to remain in the Metropolitan police but was told to go sick by one of his superiors, deputy assistant commissioner David Osland.Mr Adams admitted he had since taken up a full-time job outside the force.He insisted he had never met Clifford Norris, the criminal father of David, one of the five men suspected of stabbing Stephen at a bus stop in Eltham, south London, in April 1993.Jeremy Gompertz QC, counsel for the Metropolitan police, said: "The suggestion is that you are a corrupt, dishonest former police officer who did his best to slow down and stop the arrest of David Norris and others because of your association with David Norris's father, Clifford. Is that true?"Mr Adams: "I am one of the most decorated police officers in this country. To suggest that I knew Clifford Norris is nonsense. I see it as an insult to myself and to the Lawrences."There is a great deal of hurt in these allegations. There has been Merlin's broth of magic mirrors, innuendos and nudges. I defy anybody to produce an ounce of evidence against me."At this point there was laughter from the public gallery.Questioned by Michael Mansfield QC, for the Lawrence family, Mr Adams admitted having met a Scotland Yard chief superintendent at a pub last month to discuss the "parameters" of his answers to the inquiry.The meeting, on June 8, took place four days after Mr Adams first gave evidence to the inquiry, when his testimony was adjourned.Initially, he insisted that he could not remember the name of the pub, its location or the name of the officer he had met.But after prompting from Mr Gompertz, Mr Adams recalled that the officer was a Chief Superintendent Wood, whom he met in the car park of The Star pub in Leatherhead, Surrey, before the pair entered the pub to continue their discussion.Imran Khan, solicitor to the Lawrence family, is due to give evidence today, the 55th and final day of the first stage of the inquiry.
