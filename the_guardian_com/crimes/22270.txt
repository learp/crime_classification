David Cameron has had his bicycle stolen for the second time in less than a year, the Tories said today.The Tory leader had chained it to railings outside the front of his house, but when he went to look for it an hour later it was gone.Cameron, who always cycles into parliament on Wednesdays because he believes that the exercise helps him prepare him for prime minister's questions, instead had to borrow a cycle from a parliamentary colleague.The theft has been reported to the police, an official said.In July last year Cameron had his bicycle stolen from outside a Tesco store near his west London home. He was ridiculed when a newspaper published a photograph showing that he had chained it to a concrete bollard, making it easy for the thief to carry away.After the episode received wide publicity, the bike – a silver and black Scott bicycle – was returned. At the time Cameron described it as "an old friend".
