A woman accused of murdering her parents and pretending for 15 years that they were alive faked a decade-long writing relationship with the French film star Gerard Depardieu, her co-accused husband has told a jury in Nottinghamshire.Christopher Edwards said he found out only during the couple's murder trial at Nottingham crown court that dozens, if not hundreds, of letters supposedly from the actor to his wife, Susan Edwards, 56, were fabricated by her.Edwards, 57, made the statement shortly after beginning his evidence in his defence on Thursday.Prosecutors say that he and his wife shot dead the couple, Patricia Wycherley, 63, and William Wycherley, 85, and buried them in their garden in Nottinghamshire. They raked in Â£245,000 by pretending the Wycherleys were still alive.They told the jury the couple were murdered over a bank holiday weekend in May 1998 at their home in Blenheim Close, Forest Town, Mansfield.After entering the witness box, Christopher Edwards was asked by his barrister, Dafydd Enoch QC, about his wife's extensive interest in celebrities. The defendant explained that she collected signed photographs and other mementoes, especially relating to the Hollywood star Gary Cooper.Edwards also told the jury that his wife had told him a story about meeting the football manager Bill Shankly in a London hotel in the 1970s after writing to him.He added that his wife had seemed to strike up a correspondence over many years with Depardieu. He said the letters and notes, of which there could have been hundreds, amounted to a relationship that ran from about 1992/93 to about 2005/06.Edwards said the letters appeared to be genuine because of the way they were written, the use of French constructions and the reference to the actor's upbringing and other biographical details. But he told the jury he had recently come to realise that they were not from Depardieu.Asked who he thought wrote all the letters, he said: "I believe it was my wife." And asked when he had come to this conclusion, he said: "A few days ago, during the course of these proceedings."Prosecutors have told the jury that the bodies of the Wycherleys lay undiscovered from 1998 to 2013. Their neighbours and relatives were told that they had gone travelling, or that they had moved to the coast for health reasons.The prosecution case is that Christopher and Susan Edwards, who married in 1983, had been in "severe financial difficulties" for much of their relationship and that they killed her parents for the cash, claiming pension money and selling the Wycherleys' house. The bodies were found buried in their garden in October last year.Police tried to trace the Edwardses in France and the couple agreed to return to the UK.The jury has been told that Susan Edwards, 56, admits the manslaughter of her mother, on the basis of provocation. She and her husband each deny two counts of murder.
