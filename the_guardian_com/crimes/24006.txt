A foreign prisoner convicted of a terrorism offence is threatening to go to court to force the government to deport him from Britain.Sabeel Ahmed pleaded guilty 13 days ago to failing to tell the police about information he had received about an attempted terrorist attack by his brother last June. Ahmed, whose brother died in the attempted suicide car bombing on Glasgow airport last summer, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey and agreed to be deported to India, where he was born.Lawyers for the doctor, who worked at the Halton hospital in Runcorn, say he has so far failed to receive a date for his removal. They wrote to the Home Office yesterday saying they will seek a court ruling ordering Ahmed's deportation, or his release from prison so he can make his own way home.Ahmed's solicitor, Imran Khan, said: "It is bizarre that we have to go to court to enforce a judge's order having pleaded guilty. The Home Office is ... keeping him as a category A prisoner in Belmarsh. He wants to leave the country because of his parents' illness, especially his mother, who recently underwent an operation." Ahmed, 26, from Bangalore, was jailed for 18 months for withholding information about last year's failed attack. He pleaded guilty to possessing information which could have prevented an act of terrorism. He was spared a longer sentence because he had read the emails only after the attack.
