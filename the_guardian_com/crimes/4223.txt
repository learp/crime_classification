Britain's most senior judges last night moved into open revolt against the government after eight weeks of talks broke down over safeguards for the independence of the judiciary following the creation of the Ministry of Justice.Amid a growing constitutional crisis, the lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, told MPs the department was only created to "clear the decks" so that the home secretary, John Reid, could mount a "concerted attack on terrorism".He also claimed that the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, was so far removed from the original decision that he only learned about it from an article by Mr Reid in a Sunday newspaper.Lord Phillips said the two sides were "poles apart" with the government refusing judges' demands for a "fundamental review" of their constitutional position. The judges fear that the ministry will be swamped by the demands for resources from prisons and probation, and want the courts to be given special protection as an arms-length executive agency with a ring-fenced budget to protect their independence.After evidence from Lord Phillips, Alan Beith, chairman of the Commons constitutional affairs committee, told Lord Falconer last night: "I have been in parliament for 34 years and I do not think I have seen such anger and concern on the part of the senior judiciary."Other MPs said it was "unprecedented for judges to criticise ministers in this way".Lord Phillips denied they were now facing a constitutional crisis, describing it as a "constitutional problem". The judges are close to invoking a rarely used emergency power allowing them to bypass ministers by making an unprecedented statement directly to parliament."We need to have a fundamental review of the position in the light of the creation of the ministry of justice," said Lord Phillips. The duty of the lord chancellor was to provide the resources the courts needed and his "primary loyalty ought to be to us", he added. The expansion of his portfolio meant his primary concern was bound to become the prisons and probation services.The Ministry of Justice was split from the Home Office by Mr Reid last month. One of Lord Falconer's first challenges in his new role is the crisis in the number of prisoners - currently standing at 80,600 and expected to increase.A report from the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, showing that 7,000 prisoners a month had been held in police cells since October, at a cost of Â£23m, landed on his desk on his first day in his new post.Lord Falconer's officials who conducted the talks with the judges made clear that any question of executive agency status for the courts that would involve legislation or ring-fencing their budget was off-limits.The demand for a review has become "a fundamental difference for us", said Lord Phillips.The judiciary's chief negotiator on the working group Lord Justice Thomas added: "We wouldn't have thought it was an awful lot to ask."Lord Falconer confirmed the claim that he had only learned of Mr Reid's proposal from a Sunday Telegraph article, adding that he might have been warned about it the day before. But he insisted that at that time - January 19 - it was not yet government policy. But Lord Phillips said he had rung Lord Falconer that day to find out what had been going on: "An old fashioned lord chancellor would have been at the outset at the heart of what was being proposed," he said."The impetus of this proposal was anxiety on the part of the home secretary to clear the decks so that he could make a concerted attack on terrorism. It was not a decision taken because it was thought it was a very good idea to have a ministry of justice," said the lord chief justice.Lord Falconer said he was very concerned about the breakdown of talks when the parties had been very close to "an interim agreement". He said he was prepared to get involved himself and hoped that they could resume. He added: "In the course of the working party we have been broadly able to reach agreement on the interim agreement. What we need to do is sit down and reach an agreement. That is what we are in the process of doing."
