Further to the article by Julie Bindel (Let this be the Macpherson moment for domestic abuse, 22 May), fMRI brain scans from the US show, perhaps surprisingly, that to an even greater extent than actually being abused themselves, exposure to and directly witnessing domestic violence has the most profound effect of all on the developing brains of children in terms of patterns associated with features of post-traumatic stress disorder. Referral rates of such children presenting with behavioural problems and/or symptoms of PTSD, to child and adolescent mental health service clinics in this country by GPs and social workers, provide further evidence that the harm done to them by seeing their responsible adults – almost always their mums – being subjected to violence is therefore both psychological and physical. Subsequent, potentially lifelong, elevated cortisol levels when faced with stressful situations mean that they risk "hidden costs" for the rest of their lives in terms of things like drug and alcohol problems and relationship difficulties, to name but three. While EMDR (eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) and other treatments recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for trauma can have a beneficial effect in terms of reducing and even repairing the damage done, most children witnessing domestic violence will not be able to access such help. How right Julie Bindel is to draw attention to the need for an inquiry which might come up with recommendations to help prevent domestic violence on women and children happening in the first place.
