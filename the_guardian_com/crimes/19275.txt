A body, believed to be that of a man in his 30s, has been found in a canal in north London.The body was discovered at around 10.30am by a person in one of several houseboats moored on a stretch of Regent’s canal near King’s Cross. The Metropolitan police initially said the death was being treated as suspicious, but later declared it as “non-suspicious but unexplained”.About a dozen police officers and an ambulance crew were at the normally busy scene, overlooked by flats and offices. Police cordoned off the canal section between York Way and Caledonian Road. A plastic tent was set up beside a houseboat and two emergency service personnel in an inflatable dinghy were also on the scene.
