Home Office plans to introduce compulsory lie detector tests to ensure that convicted paedophiles do not offend again are worrying cabinet members.The home secretary, David Blunkett, has admitted to his cabinet colleagues that the plans "are not without controversy" and is seeking legal clearance from Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general.A leaked ministerial letter dated July 20 shows that Patricia Hewitt, the trade and industry secretary, a former head of the National Council for Civil Liberties, wants "further evidence" before a decision is reached this summer to push ahead with the necessary legislation.Mr Blunkett has asked the cabinet to approve the plan, describing the polygraph tests as "an additional weapon in the armoury against sex offenders".When the Guardian dis-closed the scheme in May, the human rights organisation Liberty, the NCCL's successor, said it would raise no fundamental objections as long as the results were not used in court as evidence and would help prevent reoffending.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, has also said their use could be beneficial.The American polygraph technology is being considered alongside the introduction of satellite tracking of convicted sex offenders to monitor their behaviour after their release on licence from prison.A voluntary two-year trial in 12 of the 42 probation areas, including Northumbria, the West Midlands and Sussex, is understood to have been judged a success. It has involved 120 convicted sex offenders, who have been tested every six months.
