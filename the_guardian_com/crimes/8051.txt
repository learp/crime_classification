A leading forensic expert cast doubt on evidence used to convict a man of murdering an elderly widow, in a case before the court of appeal.Tiernan Coyle told the court that fibres found at the scene of the murder were consistently different to those in Hall's room and car. Coyle was the first witness to take the stand during a day of technical evidence on fibre analysis.Hall's case is the first in the UK in which a person has been convicted solely on forensic evidence.Hall, 33, was jailed for life for stabbing 79-year-old Joan Albert during a break-in at her home in Suffolk. He has always maintained that he was elsewhere when the pensioner was killed.Coyle said polyester fibres linking Hall to the murder scene, which were thought to be green at the original trial and which are rare, turned out to be black. This, he said, was very common and of "low value evidentially".Coyle rejected suggestions from the prosecution that his forensic technique exaggerated the differences in the fibres at the crime scene and at Hall's home.He told the court that his analysis showed differences in colour and intensity in the two sets of fibres – assertions that contradicted evidence from the prosecution forensic expert during Hall's trial at Norwich crown court in 2003. The prosecution said at the time that fibres from a pair of trousers, found in Hall's car and in a cupboard at his parents' home, linked him to the murder.The forensic evidence was enough to send Hall to jail, even though jurors at the trial were told that fingerprints, footprints and DNA evidence found at the scene of the murder did not match those belonging to the defendant.At the opening of the appeal hearing, Hall's barrister, Michael Mansfield, QC, said the challenge against the conviction centred on fresh scientific evidence relating to the fibres.Mansfield told the court: "There would have been perhaps no trial let alone a conviction if there had not been the presence of fibres that could be linked. So this is a case that entirely depends on the reliability of the expertise of those who examined the fibres."Present in court were Hall's small army of supporters, including his wife, Stephanie, and his parents, Lynne and Phil, as well as family friends. Lynne was a close friend of Joan Albert.The appeal judges are being urged to rule that the conviction can now be regarded as unsafe in the light of "fresh" scientific evidence in relation to the issue of fibres.Albert's blood-stained body was found in the hallway of her home in Capel St Mary, near Ipswich, in December 2001. She had been stabbed five times.Prosecutors said Hall broke into Albert's home with the intention of stealing from her, and attacked the pensioner when she disturbed him. Hall, a power company office worker from Ipswich, said he had been out drinking at the time of the crime.Hall, whose previous conviction appeal was dismissed in 2004, had his case referred to the court of appeal by the criminal cases review commission (CCRC), the independent body that investigates possible miscarriages of justice.When the CCRC referred the case in October 2009, it said it had carried out a wide-ranging investigation, including "examining issues raised by Hall and his legal team and his supporters".It added: "The referral is based, however, exclusively on a forensic development identified and pursued by the commission and centres on fresh forensic analysis of fibre samples taken from the crime scene and other locations during the original police investigation."The referral followed a series of submissions by the University of Bristol Innocence Project (UoBIP) as students spent hundreds of hours working for free through the evidence used to convict Hall to try to establish his innocence. Gabe Tan, now research assistant in the school of law and assistant director of the UoBIP, headed the investigation into Hall's claim of innocence.In the last ever BBC Rough Justice documentary, aired in April 2007, which followed Gabe and four other students from the UoBIP investigating Hall's case, Keir Starmer, now director for public prosecutions, said: "Simon's case is really peculiar, because there is no particular reason to suspect he is guilty of this offence, there are lots and lots of question marks."There is one crucial link and that's the fibre evidence, and that's what holds the whole case together. It's a very odd case, it's circumstantial – break that central piece of evidence and the case falls apart.'
