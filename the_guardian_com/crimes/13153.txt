Homecare assistants in west Yorkshire have a new role. They are being trained to help older people in the battle against doorstep crime.Four hundred staff employed by Kirklees council will help to get the "stop, chain and check" message over to the 3,400 elderly people they care for. They have been given information packs and door stickers to pass on to clients, their relatives and carers to try to prevent the 150 local cases of doorstep crime every year.The council believes it is the first local authority to develop a crime prevention role for all its homecare assistants. A spokesman says: "We decided to train our homecare assistants in this new role because they are our link to the most vulnerable and elderly people in the district. They work with them and are trusted by them."Kirklees is also creating its first pilot "no cold caller zone", which aims to ban unsolicited callers from knocking on front doors without a prior appointment.The Institute of Trading Standards said it was unaware of any other local authority that had developed a crime prevention role for homecare assistants on such a scale.
