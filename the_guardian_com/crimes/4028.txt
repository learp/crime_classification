One fifth of young male prisoners would be homeless if they were not in jail, a report warned today.The study by the Howard League for Penal Reform also found that the majority of 18 to 21-year-old men who have been in prison have housing problems.The young men interviewed admitted that they were more likely to become involved in offending if their housing needs were unmet. One quarter believed that housing was crucial to their successful resettlement and would help them to live crime-free lives. Three quarters had already left home - at an average age of 15 - by the time they began their jail sentence. Many said they had no idea where they would be spending their first night following release. The charity is urging the government to review housing benefit so that individuals aged 18-plus are entitled to the same benefits as those over 25. It also wants the government to impose a statutory duty on local authorities to house homeless young people when they are released from prison. Report author Finola Farrant commented: "When young people themselves say that having safe and secure housing will help stop them committing further offences the government should sit up and take notice. "Many young people will have been released from prison over the Christmas period and will spend the coming weeks homeless. Yet having appropriate accommodation, including support to maintain it, could make all the difference between someone re-offending or not."For instance, Richard, 20, told the researchers that he did not know where he would be staying on his first night out of prison. He said: "I came in without a home and now five months later I'm leaving without one too. "The only advice I've been given is to go to the HPU (Homeless Person's Unit) but I knew to do that anyway, I've been through the whole system in the past, I know what to do, it don't help though. "I need to know where I'm going to be staying, I can't sleep thinking about it."
