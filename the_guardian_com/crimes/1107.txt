The government became embroiled in another damaging row over crime figures today, after the head of the UK Statistics Authority accused the Home Office of releasing "selective" knife crime figures yesterday.Sir Michael Scholar said the figures, which showed a sharp decline in stabbings, had not been checked and were "premature, irregular and selective". He also revealed that the statisticians behind the data and Karen Dunnell, the national statistician, all tried to stop the government from publishing. He said the decision to publish the data in its current form was "corrosive of public trust" in official figures, and breached several parts of the Office of National Statistics code of practice which is intended to prevent the political manipulation of data or the impression of political manipulation.The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats last night demanded the immediate and full publication of the figures in order to discover if the government had indulged in "selective and manipulative spinning" over knife crime.The figures were originally compiled by the NHS information centre. In the version published today, they showed a 27% fall in hospital admissions from assaults with sharp objects, including knives, between July and September in nine out of 10 areas where police had mounted special stop and search operations. They were trumpeted by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, as evidence that the "tough, targeted action we are taking in 10 areas is making a real difference on the ground".According to Scholar, Downing Street "caused" the Home Office to issue the provisional figures in a fact sheet that coincided with yesterday's launch, backed by Gordon Brown, of a national No to Knives campaign. The fact sheet was "selective", according to the UK Statistics Authority, and did not carry all the statistics that were gathered.In a letter to Jeremy Heywood, permanent secretary at Number 10, Scholar said: "These statistics were not due for publication for some time, and had not therefore been through the regular process of checking and quality assurance. The statisticians who produced them, together with the national statistician, tried unsuccessfully to prevent their premature, irregular and selective release."I hope you will agree that the publication of prematurely released and unchecked statistics is corrosive of public trust in official statistics, and incompatible with the high standards which we are all seeking to establish."Scholar said he did not know if the data released had falsified the true picture about the effect of stop and search operations on stabbings, but said he was afraid that it might at least create that impression. "As is always the case, if a chief statistician in a government department alerts the national statistician to a potential breach of the code of practice it is her duty to get in touch with the responsible department to draw their attention to the provisions of the code," said a spokesman for the chief statistician."The knife crime epidemic is a tragedy that has claimed too many young lives," said the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve."If government ministers have sanctioned the selective and manipulative spinning of these statistics, it is reckless and irresponsible. Labour should immediately publish the full figures so that we can see the truth."Chris Huhne, Home Office spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said the incident was evidence that "the culture of spin is alive and well," in spite of Brown's pledges to end it when he became prime minister."Yet again this government has been caught peddling dodgy statistics," Huhne said. "If ministers want the British people to trust anything they say, statistics must be made completely independent of government. "Unfortunately it still seems that ministers are prepared to put courting the headlines ahead of checking the facts. This seems like a failed attempt to cover up criticism of Gordon Brown by rushing out a flimsy good news story."Keith Vaz, Labour MP and chairman of the home affairs committee, said the early release of figures "greatly undermined" public trust in government and he would be writing to the home secretary about the incident."It is important that we have accurate statistics that we can rely upon in order to craft policy to resolve problems as well to gauge when legislation is working. Public trust is greatly undermined by actions such as this."But Downing Street and the Home Office defended the decision to publish the figures.In a joint statement a spokesman said: "The figures on hospital admissions were published yesterday in order to give the public the most up to date information available about the current knife crime situation in priority areas."They were part of a wider package of statistics published yesterday, which detail the impact that our knife crime strategy is having in these areas."Obviously ministers and officials in all departments take very seriously the importance of maintaining the integrity of official statistics."Home Office and Cabinet Office officials will be in touch with Sir Michael Scholar at the earliest opportunity to discuss his concerns."
