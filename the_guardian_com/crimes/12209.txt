Losses from online banking fraud have risen sharply following a surge of nearly 1,500% in the number of bogus bank websites used by criminals to plunder people's accounts, new figures show.Cash machine fraud has also risen by 37% to £39.6m, driven by criminals using miniature cameras to spy on people keying in pin numbers, says the Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs).But overall, credit and debit card fraud losses have fallen. For the six months to June 30, they totalled £209.3m - down 5% on the £219.5m of losses recorded during the same period last year.This has been attributed to the successful introduction of chip and pin technology. Fraud involving criminals trying to use counterfeit, lost and stolen cards to buy goods in person has fallen sharply as a result since in most cases they do not know the pin number.Online banking fraud losses amounted to £22.5m in the first six months of this year - up 55% on the £14.5m of losses racked up during the same period last year. These losses involved "phishing" scams, where fraudsters send out thousands of emails purporting to come from the individual's bank and attempt to dupe them into disclosing security information. These emails include a link to a fake version of a bank website.The number of bogus websites that Apacs is aware of has leapt 1,471% in a year - from 312 in the first six months of last year to 5,059 this time.There are steps that consumers can take to protect themselves against online banking fraud, such as installing up-to-date anti-virus software and a personal firewall, said an Apacs spokeswoman.The chip and pin regime has made so-called card-not-present fraud - in which criminals get hold of people's credit and debit card details and use them to buy goods online - more attractive for fraudsters. It accounts for almost half of all losses but, even though there has been an explosion in the numbers of people shopping online, this type of fraud grew by only 5% year-on-year, said Apacs.Despite all the headlines about identity theft, credit and debit card ID fraud fell 7% over the period.Apacs has found that one quarter of all Britons have disclosed their pin to someone else, while a similar number use the same pin for all their cards.
