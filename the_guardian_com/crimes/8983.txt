Police investigating the M40 murder of a Hell's Angels biker have identified at least two witnesses from CCTV footage who might help lead them to his killers.The potential breakthrough was revealed last night by the man leading the investigation, Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence of Warwickshire police. He told The Observer that his team was still going through video footage in the hope of identifying more people who might have seen the Rover 620 in which 35-year-old Gerry Tobin's killers followed him and two other bikers before opening fire and shooting him in the back of the head.Lawrence said the camera images, which do not show the murder itself but caught the Rover as it was setting off in pursuit of Tobin, had already identified two potential witnesses whom police would now urgently like to trace.Lawrence also appealed to bikers' groups to help his force find and arrest the people behind the murder.'I know that the history is that bikers' groups are not comfortable dealing with the police,' he said. 'But it appears Gerry Tobin was widely respected, and was genuinely a good guy. We owe it to him to find who was responsible.'
