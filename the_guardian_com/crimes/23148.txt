Universities are using the popularity of TV police dramas and crime shows to set up dozens of new degree courses in forensic science and criminology.Cracker, Inspector Morse and cut-price crime reconstructions on TV have fuelled a boom in 'detective work' degrees which have seen a 55 per cent increase in applications this year. As more than 200,000 A-level students got their results last week, more than 1,000 were preparing for a course analysing crime scenes, DNA and statistics. There are currently 310 forensic degrees on offer, mostly in the former polytechnics - a big rise from 244 last year. The University of Teesside in Middlesbrough offers a degree in Crime Scene Science. The staff, who include former police officers, have even set up a 16-room 'crime house' - formerly student accommodation - so that the would-be SOCOs (Scene of Crime Officers) can practise gathering evidence.Forensic science students at Liverpool John Moores, meanwhile, take a more general course based on micro-biology, chemistry and statistical analysis. John McCarthy, the head of student recruitment at John Moores, says that not all the would-be detectives are properly informed. 'They don't necessarily understand the academic challenge. It's generated by Cracker , and Amanda Burton (star of Silent Witness ). It all looks very glamorous. Kids expect it to be a course where you mimic these people.' Susan McGrath, head of education liaison at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: 'Loads of people have rather vague or wrong ideas. Some think they will end up as psychiatrists.'
