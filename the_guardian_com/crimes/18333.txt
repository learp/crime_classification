  How today's Sun covered the collapse of the Tulisa Contostavlos trialThe collapse of the Tulisa Contostavlos trial gets big coverage in national newspapers today, including the Sun, which gives it a page lead and very properly reports that its journalist, Mazher Mahmood, has been suspended ahead of an internal inquiry.Two papers - Metro and the Daily Star - splash on the story, and it also gets front page coverage in the Independent, i and the Guardian, which devote considerable inside space to it as well.There are full pages in the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror, and page leads in the the Times, Daily Telegraph and Daily Express.I was slightly surprised that the Mirror failed to give credit to its sister title, the Sunday People, for having been the first publication to question the methodology employed in Tulisa's entrapment by Mahmood.A week after the Sun on Sunday ran Mahmood's tale, the People responded with an article - written by Katie Hind - about Contostavlos being the victim of "an elaborate hoax."So, 13 months on, I salute Hind and the People's senior editorial executives, notably James Saville, for running with the story. Sure, it was partly informed by tabloid rivalry. But it did expose the vast resources devoted by the Sun to the entrap the singer and was rightly sympathetic to her.What has not received attention in today's coverage is the contentious decision by the police to arrest Contostavlos on the evidence supplied solely by Mahmood, and the subsequent decision of the Crown Prosecution Service to charge her. There are important questions that the press should be asking.Given Mahmood's track record - with several past collapsed trials and judicial criticisms of his methods - it was very strange that the police and CPS thought it appropriate to put Contostavlos on trial.As the judge, Alistair McCreath, tellingly noted in a key paragraph in his statement to the court:"It should not be forgotten that Mr Mahmood is the sole progenitor of this case; the sole investigator; the sole prosecution witness; a man who has exercised his journalistic privilege to create a situation in which the identities of others involved in the investigation are unknown to the defence (or the prosecution or even to me); someone who appears to have gone to considerable lengths to get Ms Contostavlos to agree to involve herself in criminal conduct, certainly to far greater lengths than would have been regarded as appropriate had he been a police investigator."In other words, if the judge is correct the, CPS went ahead without obtaining any corroboration for Mahmood's story. They relied entirely on a man who went - I repeat the judge's words - "to far greater lengths than would have been regarded as appropriate had he been a police investigator."The implication of that statement should not be overlooked, especially by the Sun's publisher, News UK, as it conducts its "immediate internal investigation."News UK has been cleaning up the organisation since the News of the World phone hacking scandal. The Sun, including its Sunday issue, has been very different in tone from its past vulgarity (Page 3 aside, of course).There is a new friendlier News UK management in place. The editor, David Dinsmore, has been a breath of fresh air, engaging with people in public, giving interviews and overseeing a paper that is less cynical and more inclusive than its previous incarnations.By contrast, Mahmood is old school, one of the very few News of the World boat people to be saved by News UK. He is an embarrassment, as the Contostavlos episode illustrates, and the paper should now bid him farewell.
