Julie Bindel doesn't mention the name of the man who died because he was harassed in the street by Sarah Campbell, or tell us whether he had a family, and how they are dealing with his tragic death. We are told that he was elderly - perhaps we are meant to conclude that his death was less important than Sarah's?The course of Sarah's life may have taken an "even worse turn" that day, but the course of her victim's life was fatally affected. Perhaps she should have been sent to a secure hospital for treatment rather than a prison staffed by overworked prison officers. But Sarah was convicted of manslaughter. This is a violent crime, despite Bindel's sarcastic use of quotation marks around those words. Sarah's death was tragic, and that of her mother even more so. But I would have been able to find more sympathy for both women if Bindel had acknowledged at any point the suffering of the victim and his family. Or even told us his name.Dr Kate AbellBrighton
