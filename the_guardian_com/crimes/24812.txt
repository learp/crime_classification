A rural fire brigade that has to tackle fierce healthland fires every summer is launching a model spy plane to help catch the arsonists who begin the blazes. Firefighters will fly the remote-controlled aircraft fitted with cameras over vulnerable sites during the summer holidays, when most blazes occur.The images, still and moving, are beamed back to a fire engine and could be used as evidence in court cases. Dorset fire and rescue service is believed to be the first brigade in Britain to use such tactics. Last year Merseyside police launched a drone to be used in firearms operations, crowd control and traffic congestion. The brigade bought its Â£5,000 spy plane in response to a series of heath blazes in recent years. In 2006 over 202 hectares of scrubland at Canford heath, Poole, was destroyed by a fire that forced 100 residents to flee their homes.The plane is made of balsa wood and is 1.5m long with a wingspan of just over 2m. It can fly for 20 minutes before having to return to base for refuelling.
