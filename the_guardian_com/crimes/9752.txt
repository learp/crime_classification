Two men who have always denied murdering a drug dealer in Gloucester 14 years ago were released from prison yesterday pending an appeal against their convictions.Gary Mills and Tony Poole, who were jailed for life for the murder of Hensley "Willy" Wiltshire, should find out next week if their campaign has been successful. The two men were convicted at Bristol crown court of murdering Wiltshire, who died 15 hours after a fight in which the prosecution said all three were involved. Mills said that he struck Wiltshire with a crowbar and stabbed him in the buttocks in self-defence, but insisted that Poole did not take part and that the wounds were superficial. This was supported by staff at the hospital where Wiltshire was treated. The case against them was based on eyewitness accounts which Mills and Poole have claimed were unreliable. The Channel 4 programme Trial and Error highlighted how a prosecution witness, a drug addict called Kimberley Stadden, changed her evidence a number of times. It also claimed that a witness who supported Mills's version was deterred from giving evidence by the police. The Police Federation sued Channel 4 over the allegation but lost. The two men's barrister, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said: "There is evidence that there was something rotten at the core of this investigation." An initial challenge to their convictions was rejected by the court of appeal in 1996. That was followed by a defeat in the House of Lords. But a high court hearing related to their case in December 2001 found doubts about the safety of the convictions.
