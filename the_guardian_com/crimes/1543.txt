A fantasist who shot himself with a nailgun on two occasions before claiming that he had been attacked by thugs in an attempt to win compensation was jailed for two and a half years yesterday.David Russell was awarded £4,400 compensation after claiming that he had been shot seven times with a nailgun as he rode his motorcycle to work in Bristol.Russell, 38, a telephone engineer, needed an operation, but once he had recovered repeated the trick, this time claiming youths had attacked him in a street in Gloucester. One of the nails came within 2cm of his heart and two others hit a bone in his arm. Police arrested two youths but became suspicious and Russell admitted he had made up both attacks.Sentencing him, Judge Martin Picton said: "This was serious offending and it seriously undermines the process of law and order when you behave in this way."Gloucester crown court was told that Russell first claimed he had been shot in Bristol in 2004 while riding his motorcycle.Julian Kesner, prosecuting, said Russell reported a "sudden pain" in his stomach and his right thigh. Seven nails were removed at Bristol royal infirmary.Police could find no one responsible and Russell was awarded £4,400 by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.Russell claimed the second "attack" took place in August this year in Gloucester. He was left in agony, with his bloody T-shirt pinned to his body.He told reporters from his hospital bed: "This was like some kind of sick joke for these kids. I tried to run after them but it felt like someone had split my chest open and I could barely breathe."Russell pleaded guilty to two charges of perverting the course of justice. He admitted an unrelated charge of fraud by claiming on a job form that he had served in the Royal Marines for 18 years.
