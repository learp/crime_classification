Is human hair part of the human body? To some, this may seem a hair-splitting issue. But the most appropriately named judge in the English courts, Sir Igor Judge, lived up to his billing this week when he ruled - surely rightly - that it is. At issue in the high court case was whether a man who cuts off a woman's pigtail can be charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.Sir Igor and his colleague Mr Justice Cresswell spent nearly an hour debating such issues as whether hair is dead or alive, what hair means to a woman and whether, in legal terms, hair is intrinsic to the identity of an individual. In the end, having consulted not just the usual precedents but also Gray's Anatomy and the Encyclopaedia Britannica, they decided that Michelle Tether's pigtail was indeed part of her body.Local magistrates must now decide whether Michael Smith is guilty of the charge. But, in the wider context, history suggests that hair and the individual are as one. This very question is at the heart of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock, and in societies from Germany to Northern Ireland, cutting off someone's hair has often been a deliberate act of degradation of women charged with fraternisation. The most infamous assault on human locks, of course, was perpetrated by Delilah against Samson. It is often forgotten that Samson was himself a Hebrew judge and that the tale is told in the Book of Judges. Seen in that light, perhaps Judge Judge's judgment was simply an act of judicial solidarity.
