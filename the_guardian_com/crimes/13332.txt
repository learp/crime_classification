A man was jailed for life yesterday for murdering his teenage daughter by deliberately crashing the family car.Sean Brown, 35, gave Carry-Ann Brown, 14, sleeping tablets before speeding off the M6 motorway in Cumbria, smashing through a fence and cartwheeling down a steep embankment. He survived the crash but his daughter suffered head injuries and died in hospital five days later, on August 19 last year. Brown, of Darwen, Lancashire, who had five children, had previously told his family that he and Carry-Ann, who had a mental age of seven, wanted to die in a suicide pact. He had begun a sexual relationship with the girl, and got her pregnant. The foetus was aborted in July 2003 on the orders of a high court judge and Carry-Ann was taken into foster care. Brown was arrested on suspicion of unlawful sex but was released on police bail pending paternity tests on the aborted foetus. The test results were still awaited when he crashed the car on August 14, after picking Carry-Ann up in secret from the foster home. He admitted murder and unlawful sex at Preston crown court yesterday. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, with a minimum tariff of 19 years, Judge Peter Openshaw said Brown had killed Carry-Ann, and tried to kill himself, because he could not live with the consequences of impregnating his daughter. Tattooed and crop-haired Brown was also given 21 months on the unlawful sex charge. He covered his face with his hands while the sentence was passed. The defence barrister, Peter Wright QC, said: "He is racked with remorse and he is contrite at the destruction he has wreaked on the family."
