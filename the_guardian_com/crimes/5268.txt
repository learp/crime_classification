The campaign to reform murder laws has received a significant boost with the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, saying he supports the introduction of different degrees of murder charges in England and Wales.Starmer said he would back a system akin to that in the US where people can be charged with first or second degree murder. A spokesperson has confirmed Starmer supports the proposed changes.This brings the head of the Crown Prosecution Service into line with high-profile legal figures who have backed reform of murder laws in recent years.In 2007 Lord Phillips, now president of the supreme court, backed proposals by reform body the Law Commission for new categories of murder."The Law Commission said that the object of their proposed reforms was to rationalise the general law of homicide; to produce a comprehensible and fair legal structure that non-lawyers can understand and accept. I think that their proposals go a long way to achieving that end," Phillips said.The current law means those who intended to cause grievous bodily harm can be convicted of murder, which carries a mandatory life sentence, in the same way as those who intended to kill.In the US a first degree conviction is reserved for those who intended to kill. Second degree murder, which in the UK would carry a discretionary life sentence, would require proof of intent to prove grievous bodily harm.The previous Labour government rejected the proposed changes, instead reforming other areas relating to offences of provocation and "diminished responsibility" – partial defences for killings in situations of domestic violence or mental illness.Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor under Labour when the Law Commission proposals were rejected, said the current law was sufficient."The message that the law is sending out is that we are very willing to see people convicted if they are a part of gang violence – and that violence ends in somebody's death."Is it unfair? Well, what you've got to decide is not 'does the system lead to people being wrongly convicted?' I think the real question is do you want a law is as draconian as our law is, which says juries can convict even if you are quite a peripheral member of the gang which killed?"And I think broadly the view of reasonable people is that you probably do need a quite draconian law in that respect."But Ian Blair, a former Metropolitan police commissioner, said: "While murder must remain a very specific crime, with a very serious penalty attached to it, there are, and I think everybody can see it, different kinds of murder and different levels of culpability in those murders."I think the Americans have a very sensible idea that there are degrees of murder."Starmer's remarks come amid continuing scrutiny on euthanasia laws, with further high-profile cases expected later this year.Under current laws, a relative involved in someone ending their lives can be convicted of murder, which carries the mandatory life sentence.Paul Mendelle QC said: "The problem with introducing first and second degree murder is that you still wouldn't be able to deal with mercy killing – where the person has an intent to kill and which still attracts a mandatory life sentence."
