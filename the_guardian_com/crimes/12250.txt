Anti-terrorist detectives and prosecutors will have been hugely relieved by the conviction of three of the defendants in one of the most complicated and long-running criminal trials in recent years.The home secretary, Alan Johnson, was among the first to react yesterday, insisting that the case underlined that "we face a real and serious threat from terrorism. This was a particularly complex and daring plot which would have led to a terrible attack resulting in major loss of life."He added: "The police, security services and CPS [crown prosecution service] have done an excellent job in bringing these people to justice. This was the largest ever counter-terrorism operation in the UK and I cannot thank enough those involved for their professionalism and dedication in thwarting this attack and saving thousands of lives."Sue Hemming, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service's counter-terrorism division, described the plot as "calculated and sophisticated" and one that could have killed hundreds of people."These men wanted to bring down several aircraft in a short space of time, indiscriminately killing hundreds of innocent people â€“ perhaps more if they'd succeeded in activating their devices while over cities," she said. "This was a calculated and sophisticated plot to create a terrorist event of global proportions, and the jury concluded that Ali, Sarwar and Hussain knew what the target was."Deputy Assistant Commissioner John McDowall, head of the Metropolitan police's counter-terrorism command, said: "Apart from massive loss of life, these attacks would have had enormous worldwide economic and political consequences."He added that the public "should be in no doubt the terrorist threat is still with us and that there are individuals in the UK who are determined to attack us."John Reid, the home secretary at the time of the plot, said: "It is only on occasions like this that the true extent of the threat is brought home."Lord Carlile, the Liberal Democrat peer and government reviewer of terror laws, praised what he called the prosecution's "great determination and judgment" in pursuing a retrial. He said: "I believe terrorists are at least as likely to be caught in the early stages of their preparations in the UK as in any country of the world. My only criticism of the security services is that they should be more ready to tell the public about what they have discovered."Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, the Tory security spokesperson, said if the plot had succeeded, " ... it would have had great repercussions across political life. We have just seen some of the repercussions of Lockerbie between friendly countries."
