The government has decided to abandon the ancient principle that protects British citizens from "double jeopardy" by changing the law to allow senior judges to overturn acquittals and order a retrial in murder cases where compelling new evidence has emerged.David Blunkett, the new home secretary who is fighting off civil libertarians' predictions that he will be "even more illiberal than Jack Straw", has decided to press ahead with the law commission proposal which followed such controversies as the acquittal of five youths of the murder of Stephen Lawrence.The bill changing the law, probably by next year, will be in today's Queen's speech. But it is certain to be fiercely resisted by civil liberty groups, Labour MPs and peers on all sides who gave Mr Straw such a hard time over his plan to curtail the right to trial by jury on some theft cases that the bill failed to become law. What was not immediately clear last night was whether Mr Blunkett had accepted a third law commission recommendation that would allow the court of appeal to overturn acquittals and order retrials in a retrospective fashion. That could affect the five young men suspected of murdering the black teenager in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993. The Daily Mail reported that retrospection would apply. There was no confirmation last night and Whitehall refused any comment. Under current law, Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson, three of the five suspects, cannot be retried because they were formally acquitted after a private prosecution launched by the Lawrence family following the crown prosecution service's decision that there was insufficient reliable evidence to prosecute. The collapse of the family's prosecution in 1996 sparked outrage. Such a radical change in the law could theoretically open the way for a new trial, but the adverse publicity they received would probably bar any fresh attempt to prosecute them.
