"Even for his own safety, she should hand him in.

We are making steady progress with this investigation and are following some strong lines of enquiry."The offender and any others involved in this need to know we are determined to prosecute those responsible. We are doing everything possible to build up a strong evidential case, which will put those responsible behind bars."
