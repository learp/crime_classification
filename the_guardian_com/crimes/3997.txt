Scotland Yard has spent nearly £5m this year on three separate investigations into allegations of historical child sexual abuse by celebrities and politicians, the Guardian can disclose.The Metropolitan police spent nearly £2m this year on its Operation Midland inquiry into claims that a so-called Westminster paedophile ring murdered three boys in the 70s and 80s.The investigation, based on the claims of one key witness known only as Nick, was brought under the control of a new umbrella inquiry in October after failing to uncover evidence that key establishment figures were involved.The cost of Operation Midland was revealed in a freedom of information request by the Guardian which also found that Operation Yewtree, the inquiry into sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile and others, is costing £2.2m a year.A third operation, Fairbank, an umbrella inquiry that is considering whether to launch full-scale investigations into specific allegations, costs £550,000 a year. In total, 83 members of police staff were working on the three inquiries as of 29 September, Scotland Yard said in its response to the FoI request.The disclosure of the £5m-a-year price of the inquiries prompted Nigel Evans, the Tory MP who was cleared of rape and sexual offences in April 2013, to call for full disclosure of the cost of the investigations, whose “track record is incredibly poor”.He said: “There is huge competing demands on police time – we were told before the budget how strapped for cash they were – so someone has to be brave enough to look at the way these investigations are being conducted, whether they are being done in the most economically viable way and if not then scale them back.”While £5m was spent this year on the three inquiries, £10.1m has been spent over four years on Operation Grange, the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, which was drastically scaled back from 29 to four officers in October. The Home Office funds that investigation from a special grant budget.

The force admitted it was wrong to have described allegations made by Nick as “credible and true” at the start of Operation Midland last year.The detective who made the remark, DS Kenny McDonald, was relieved of his control of the investigation in October when Operations Midland and Fairbank were brought under a newly formed investigation led by Det Supt Ang Scott.The force’s handling of an investigation into the former Tory home secretary Leon Brittan also sparked recriminations. The detective leading the inquiry, Det Ch Insp Paul Settle, was removed from the case after telling his bosses there were no legal grounds to interview Brittan on suspicion of rape.He was overruled and Brittan was interviewed, only for detectives to conclude there was no evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction. Brittan died in January 2015 without being told he had been cleared.Evans called on Scotland Yard to disclose how much it spent on the Brittan investigation before it was shelved. “I think we need to be told on these things because it has a huge impact on the diversion of funds that could be going into fighting Daesh [Islamic State],” he said.“This is money that can’t be spent twice so if you are spending it there in large fashion – as the Guardian’s freedom of information request has demonstrated – then it can’t be spent on fighting Daesh or domestic terrorism in the UK.”Operation Yewtree, launched amid public outrage over Savile’s crimes after he died in 2012, has produced some convictions. Publicist Max Clifford, entertainer Rolf Harris and DJ Dave Lee Travis are among high-profile figures to be convicted of sex crimes.However, others including the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, presenter Jim Davidson and comedian Freddie Starr have been told they face no further action after being arrested. In December, the DJ Neil Fox was cleared of all charges after six women came forward to make allegations against him. Magistrates said the six alleged victims were believable but that they had taken factors including “context” into their decision.Speaking after Fox’s acquittal, Gambaccini called for Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police chief, to resign “in disgrace”. Gambaccini said Hogan-Howe’s “witch-hunt has shamed London and discredited the very profession of policing”.He added: “The Metropolitan police embarked on a mendacious and malevolent witch-hunt that will be remembered by history with the same disdain and derision with which we now recall the witch-hunts in Salem, Massachusetts, and McCarthyism in America.“These unprecedented scenes of police opening a dedicated website, opening a dedicated phone line, going on TV and saying ‘Accuse celebrities, you will be believed’ … It’s time to stop believing Bernard Hogan-Howe and the Crown Prosecution Service.”Gambaccini declined to comment further when contacted by the Guardian.
