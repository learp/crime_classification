Britain's most senior police officer today accused the media of "institutional racism" over its reporting of murders.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said murders in minority communities appeared "not to interest the mainstream media", while middle-class, white victims attracted much more coverage.He highlighted the recent murders of 31-year-old lawyer Tom ap Rhys Pryce, and banker John Monkton, both of which were followed closely by the media."I actually believe that the media is guilty of institutional racism in the way they report deaths," Sir Ian said."That death of the young lawyer was terrible, but an Asian man was dragged to his death, a woman was chopped up in Lewisham, a chap shot in the head in a Trident murder - they got a paragraph on page 97."Sir Ian conceded that there were "one or two exceptions", such as the media interest in the killing of Peckham schoolboy Damilola Taylor.But he said the murder of father-of-two Balbir Matharu, an Asian man, who was dragged to his death by two car stereo thieves, had received little press coverage.Mr Matharu was killed on the same day as Mr ap Rhys Pryce, who was stabbed to death when he was mugged close to his north London home.Sir Ian made his comments at the Metropolitan Police Authority's monthly meeting, where he was asked to give an assurance that his force delivered a "proportional response" to all murders.Sir Ian said his force had to respond to press interest."It is not about our resources or our intent. Every single life is equally important," he said.Sir Ian said it was sometimes difficult to understand why certain stories captured the national press.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
