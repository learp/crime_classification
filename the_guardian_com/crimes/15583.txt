Tony Blair said today that Britain's new FBI-style crime squad would make "life hell" for the "Mr Bigs" of organised crime.The prime minister said the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which officially starts work today, would "hit hard" against people-trafficking, drugs gangs and major fraud and counterfeiting.Soca is chaired by the former MI5 chief Sir Stephen Lander, and includes other members of the intelligence and security services and around 2,000 agents among its 4,200-plus staff. It will be Britain's first non-police law-enforcement agency.Mr Blair told a Downing Street news conference that the new agency provided a way of fighting 21st-century crime with modern methods. He said the rapidly changing nature of organised crime, which caused "tyranny" in people's lives, demanded ever more sophisticated methods.The prime minister said the new crime squad, which has an annual budget of Â£400m, would seek prosecutions and chase after criminals' assets.Bringing together experts from the police, customs and immigration staff, Soca has already drawn up a "most wanted" list of more than 1,000 targets.The agency, which will have armed units and electronics surveillance experts, will incorporate the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and key functions of the immigration and customs servicesBut the prime minister insisted that Soca, which has been working as a kind of shadow organisation for around a year, was much "more than an amalgamation" of existing bodies.From today the Crown Prosecution Service has greater powers to compel witnesses and suspects to hand over information. Suspects will no longer be able to stay silent with immunity and could face up to five years in prison for failing to disclose information.However, disclosures obtained using these powers will not be admissible as evidence against suspects themselves.Mr Blair said there would also be an increase in efforts to persuade minor players to become informants by offering them lesser sentences or "queen's evidence" immunity from prosecution, an approach that is currently more popular in the US. The prime minister said this would help foster uncertainty in the crime world.Courts will also be able to force crime bosses to hand over their bank statements for up to 20 years after their release from jail to prove they have not returned to crime. Further powers could be created if they were needed, Mr Blair said.Earlier the prime minister told Sky News: "This is an agency that has got the powers and the organisation that is going to make life hell for you whilst you make life hell for other people."It does not matter how far removed you are from the actual street where ... people-trafficking and prostitution and drugs [trafficking] are taking place."We will have the powers to come after you ... to put you in jail, and then to make sure that, even after you leave jail, you are subject to restrictions on your financial activities for a long, long time to come."Mr Blair said that organised crime was not victimless and that it tended "to make victims of the poor at least as much [as] the wealthy". The Tories welcomed the creation of Soca, but said it was vital an engagement with local policing was not lost.
