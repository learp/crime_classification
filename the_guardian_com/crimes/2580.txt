Police and car crime experts yesterday called for a review of the current vehicle registration system which they fear is fuelling an alarming rise in car cloning and personal identity theft.Across the country, police forces have reported a rise in the number of licence plates being stolen and then used to disguise identical vehicles which are sold to unsuspecting buyers or used in other crimes. Often innocent drivers whose plates have been copied don't find out about the scam until they are hit with fines for speeding and parking offences committed by drivers of the cloned cars.The rise in licence-plate thefts has been attributed to the tightening of procedures that make it difficult for criminals to obtain duplicate plates legally. However, Superintendent John Wake, of the newly formed Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service, said more needed to be done and yesterday called for an improved licensing system, a central issuing body for registration numbers and for all cars to have tamper-proof plates fitted.According to police estimates, there were more than 40,000 sets of number plates stolen last year, a rise of almost 25 per cent on previous years. The used car market is worth almost Â£30m a year, making it an attractive money-spinning scam for gangs who often invest proceeds from cloned car sales into other criminal enterprises.
