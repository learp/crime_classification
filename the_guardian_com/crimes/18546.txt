A tennis instructor accused of conducting an affair with a girl she was coaching was today found guilty of molesting the student.Claire Lyte, 29, was found guilty of four out of five counts of sexual activity with a 13-year-old pupil between 2005 and 2006. The girl cannot be named for legal reasons.Lyte, who will be sentenced on November 2, broke down in tears outside the court and was comforted by her parents.She had denied any sexual encounter throughout the trial, telling police: "I like men."The jury rejected her claims that the child's mother had invented the allegations out of jealousy and a reluctance to accept that her daughter would not make it as a professional tennis player.The court heard that Lyte, of Shirley, Solihull, in the West Midlands, was found with the girl naked and engaged in oral sex when the mother returned home early from a party in October 2006.The girl's mother did not report the18-month relationship to police until August the following year.She said she was disturbed by her daughter's reaction to her discovery, and was terrified of what would happen if she told the police.During the two-week trial, the court heard that the rising tennis star first met her coach at the Lawn Tennis Association's academy in Leicestershire, where Lyte had been named "coach of the year".Within months Lyte and the girl had become noticeably close, spending lunchtimes together in isolated parts of the University of Loughborough campus where the tennis academy was based. They wore similar clothes and tied their hair back in the same distinctive ponytail.Lyte's bosses became suspicious as she spent more time in the youngster's study room, and the pair were suspected of sharing a toilet cubicle.But they did not realise the pair were spending nights together at the child's home and sharing hotel rooms during tournaments.The eight women and five men of the jury heard that the girl fell in love with her coach, sending her gushing text messages and, on one occasion, a stick drawing of the two in bed and the words "You" and "Me" written over them.On another occasion, the girl told Lyte to "stop stressing" as bosses at the academy would never believe they were in a relationship.Lyte admitted twice wearing a pair of the child's pink knickers left in her home but said she thought they were her own, despite the girl's nametag inside them.Lyte's employers at the LTA repeatedly warned her about spending too much time with the girl, the court heard.As the relationship continued, the girl's tennis suffered and ten months after her original discovery, her mother was confronted with further proof that the relationship was continuing.She saw Lyte wearing her daughter's shorts and jumper in the summer of 2006 and said her "stomach turned over".She went to the police, but upon hearing the news her daughter climbed on to the roof of their Merseyside home and threatened suicide.After a period of recovery, she has returned to live at home full-time and told the court herself she was "doing fine" and was once again playing tennis.The youngster could resume her professional career and told jurors she plans to meet LTA officials after her 16th birthday.Lyte began playing tennis herself at the age of ten when she was spotted at her local tennis club by county selectors in Warwickshire. By 16 she had turned professional and three years later was ranked among the sport's top 500 players.But she lost her position through injury and gave up playing to work as a waitress and coach part-time at Edgbaston's exclusive Priory tennis club.Within two years her fellow coaches voted her the LTA young coach of the year and she was headhunted by the LTA academy to coach young stars of the future.
