An 18-year-old was today jailed for life for the murder of a Polish woman who was caught in the crossfire of a "wild west" shoot-out in a south London car park.Magda Pniewska, 26, a nursing assistant, was shot in the forehead as she returned home from work on October 2 last year. She was talking on the phone to her sister in Poland when she was killed.Armel Gnango was told at St Albans court that he will serve a minimum sentence of 20 years.A jury found Gnango guilty of Pniewska's murder last month, even though he did not fire the fatal shot. Gnango, who was 17 at the time, exchanged at least six shots with another 17-year-old in John Williams Close, New Cross, over a debt thought to be less than £100.Pniewska died just a few yards from the flat she shared with her fiance, Radoslaw Lipka, 25.Mr Justice Cook told Gnango: "The fact of the matter is that you went armed to find your man who then shot at you and a gunfight ensued."Either of you might have been killed. You plainly intended to kill the other and instead of either of you dying an innocent nursing assistant was killed instead."The shot that struck Pniewska was fired by the second youth, who was also arrested but not charged and remains on bail. Detectives from Operation Trident, which targets gun crime within the black community, are continuing to gather evidence against him.Gnango came to Britain as a child from war-torn Sierra Leone. At the time of the shoot-out he was on a painting, decorating and bricklaying course at Lewisham College. He claimed the shooting was the first time he had ever fired a gun and that he was trying to sell the weapon on behalf of a friend for £2,500 when he was ambushed.Gnango was also found guilty of the attempted murder of the second gunman and having a gun with intent to endanger life. He pleaded guilty to having a prohibited weapon.Pniewska had left Poland six years before she died and was hoping to start a new life as a carer in Britain. After eight months she became homesick and went back to Poland but she returned to Britain four years before her death.
