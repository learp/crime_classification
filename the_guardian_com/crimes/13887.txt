A social services department is facing mounting criticism tonight for failing to stop a mother starving her seven-year-old daughter to death despite numerous warnings.Khyra Ishaq, who weighed just 2st 9lb (16.8kg), was said by a paramedic to be like a concentration camp victim when she was finally rescued from her home.She later died in hospital from infection caused by extreme malnutrition.The tragedy of Khyra's death was summed up by a high court judge who said: "It is beyond belief that, in 2008, in a bustling, energetic and modern city like Birmingham, a child of seven was withdrawn from school and thereafter kept in squalid conditions for a period of five months before finally dying of starvation."Khyra had been taken out of school by her mother, Angela Gordon, for what she claimed was home learning but Birmingham council had been repeatedly warned by her deputy headteacher about her welfare.Social workers followed up three calls from the teacher but found nothing wrong. Two education officials from the local authority also questioned Gordon about home teaching but were not allowed to see Khyra.Gordon claimed the child had had a late night and was asleep upstairs.The last social worker saw Khyra on the doorstep of her home in February 2008 and said there was no cause for concern. Within 12 weeks, Khyra was dead.Ed Balls, the children's secretary, said: "It is very hard for any of us to understand how adults could do this to children in their care. There are clearly serious questions to be answered about what local services and professionals were doing in the months before this tragedy took place."Mrs Justice King said schools attended by Gordon's six children were voicing their concerns, "in particular their concerns relating to their belief that the children were not being fed properly."The schools did all they could to bring their concerns to the attention of the ­relevant authorities. These concerns were not taken sufficiently seriously and were not adequately investigated."The judge made her comments in care proceedings last year involving Khyra's siblings which can only be reported now. She said Khyra's death "was caused by and is the responsibility of her mother" and her partner, but added: "On the evidence before the court I can only conclude that in all probability, had there been an adequate initial assessment and proper adherence by the educational welfare services to its guidance, Khyra would not have died."She said Khyra had been subjected to "sustained and punitive brutality … of a type which thankfully is virtually unheard of in this country". None of the experts who gave evidence to the court had ever seen a child in the UK in Khyra's state of "extreme emaciation" and had to rely on medical research on concentration camp victims because "people simply do not die of starvation in Europe".Khyra's mother and stepfather, Junaid Abuhamza, will be sentenced next week after admitting manslaughter.Gordon, 35, was cleared of murder today after prosecutors at Birmingham crown court accepted her defence of diminished responsibility.The decision to accept her plea to the lesser charge came after she admitted five counts of child cruelty and psychiatrists agreed that she was suffering from severe depression when Khyra died in May 2008.Abuhamza, 30, pleaded guilty on 12 February to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.Horrific detail of Khyra's miserable life emerged during the trial. At mealtimes, the children in Gordon's care were given a bowl containing carrots, beans, eggs and rice, or unsweetened porridge, to share between them.The meagre dinner would be placed before them on the floor of the room. They ate with their hands. Timothy Raggatt QC, prosecuting, said that if a child ate too much he or she would be struck with a bamboo cane.The children were subjected to "a regime of punishment that most would find wholly inappropriate and unacceptable in any kind of household, never mind a civilised one."What they did was a continuous course of conduct that was cruelty of an extreme kind and had at its heart the deliberate starvation of this child, who was to all intents and purposes a prisoner in the home in which she was supposed to live and be protected."The local authority defended its actions today. It claimed councils were ­limited in their efforts to protect children by ­current legislation.But Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, dismissed the comments as "rubbish" and claimed the local authority was refusing to take responsibility for its failings.Hilary Thompson, chair of the Birmingham safeguarding children board, which set up a serious case review after Khyra's death, said: "It is our view that the key authorities involved in the education and protection of children are hampered in their efforts by current legislation." It was "of serious concern" that the police investigation identified at least 30 people out of 90 witnesses who could have intervened and made a difference in Khyra's case."It is alarming because it was clear to us that many people in the community had concerns but did not feel able to share them with the many agencies that are there to help."But Mahmood said: "The local authority is mandated to protect the most vulnerable young people. They singularly failed to do so in this case. For them to be blaming someone else is completely out of order. It is absolutely incredible that they are blaming other people in the community and not take responsibility for allowing what happened."Tony Howell, the council's director for children, young people and families, rejected calls for his resignation. He said he was sorry they had been unable to save Khyra."It is difficult to comprehend that in this day and age a child can starve to death in Britain without anyone appearing to notice. But the fact of the matter is that it did happen and it has caused a great deal of hard reflection among all the agencies in the city who have a responsibility to protect vulnerable children," he said.
