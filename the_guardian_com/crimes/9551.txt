The number of prisoners held in police cells to alleviate pressure on Britain's overcrowded jails increased 13-fold last year, it has emerged.Prisoners were held overnight in police cells on 60,953 occasions in 2007, compared with just 4,617 occasions the previous year.The figures were revealed yesterday in a written parliamentary answer by the criminal justice minister, David Hanson, who said it cost an estimated £385 to hold a prisoner overnight.The shadow police reform minister, David Ruffley, who tabled the question, said: "A record number of prisoners who should be in prison are now being housed in police cells ... Police stations are being clogged up and police time wasted."Government incompetence means police are spending more time as prison jailers and less time as crime fighters."Police and court cells were formerly made available to ease overcrowding as part of a wider set of measures, Operation Safeguard, launched in 2006.The Metropolitan police made the most use of the measure, falling back on police cells more than 9,799 times last year - compared with 333 times in 2006.The use of police cells in Kent and West Yorkshire also soared last year, with many other overstretched authorities forced to use them on more than 3,000 occasions.Ruffley added: "In 2006, 18 police forces didn't have to keep any prisoners in their police cells but in 2007 every single police force has had to look after prisoners."Police budgets are being hit hard by this incredible ministerial incompetence. The police are forced to look after prisoners who should be in a prison but they are not getting fully reimbursed for this work."A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said Operation Safeguard was put in place between October and December 2006 to "protect the public" and reinstated in January last year.He said: "The National Offender Management Service [Noms] did everything reasonably possible to avoid the resumption of Operation Safeguard but, with the continuing rise in the prison population, we had to implement the formal use of police cells."The spokesman said the fact the measure was only available for three months during 2006 would explain the significant increase.He said: "Noms is closely monitoring the prison population and continues to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity. In response to Lord Carter's review of prisons, the government has now announced a further 10,500 places on top of the 9,500 previously announced."In November, Hanson admitted that police forces in England and Wales had billed the government for £28.7m to meet the cost of accommodating prisoners in police cells since the start of the programme.
