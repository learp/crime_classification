"Everything points to the fact that a doctor with the sinister and macabre motivation of Harold Shipman is a once in a lifetime occurrence."Professor Liam Donaldson, chief medical officerKey findings Shipman issued a total of 521 death certificates, 499 while he worked in Hyde. The highest number issued by any other Hyde practitioner in the audit was 210.  A comparison between Shipman and others shows that he issued 297 excess death certifcates. Of these, 236 patients died at home - the vast majority women over 65-years-old.  The excess death certificates were evident from the beginning of his practice in Hyde.Analysing the cremation formsThe following trends were revealed among Shipman's deceased patients:  Death was more likely to occur in the afternoon  The cause of death was certified as heart conditions, stroke or old age  Mode of death described as syncope or collapse  Shipman was likely to be present at the death of his patients while relatives and carers often absent.The medical records "Typically, Shipman records attending the patient within one day of death and finding vague symptoms or signs. In such circumstances, he frequently indicates a 'watch and wait' management plan by using the lettes 'tluk' - to let us know if the condition deteriorates. Case 502 is a typical example:(Day before death) 'h/o vertigo. Falls to 150/100 r leg ? weak ? plantar left all ok stemetil sachets tluk if alters.'(Day of death) 'o/e - dead. Neighbour saw at 1400 ok found 1500 in bed dead cva bp'"Shipman's records of deaths certified as due to heart conditions were often similar, the patient being seen shortly before death with relatively mild symptoms, then being found dead within a few hours or the next day."Cases referred to the coronerThe deaths of seven patients were referred to the coroner. Most were caused by accidents or overdoses, but one was referred by Shipman and detailed toxological tests were undertaken because he claimed to suspect that the patient had committed suicide. The notes of this patient were available for review and did not contain a history of depression although the patient had recently suffered a bereavement.When the patients diedThe annual numbers of deaths were low leading up to and after 1990-92 when Shipman moved to a single-handed practice. However, they increased steeply from 1993 to 1998. The numbers were also high from 1978 to 1982, and from 1984 to 1989, although the levels in these years were lower than 1993 onwards.Conclusion"The audit has uncovered a substantial body of evidence from various sources that raises grave concerns about Shipman's activities throughout the 25 years he spent as a general practitioner."Special reportThe Harold Shipman caseAudioJanuary 5: Helen Carter in HydePolice quiz Harold Shipman over Winifred Mellor's deathPhoto galleryThe story in picturesRelated articles1 January: Judge to head wider inquiry into Shipman murders29 December 2000: Male 'Shipman victim' namedFebruary 1 2000: Profile of Harold ShipmanUseful linksGeneral medical council: Shipman struck offDepartment of HealthUniversity of LeicesterElaine Quigley: analysis of Shipman's wife's handwritingCrown prosecution serviceTimelineHow the Shipman trial unfolded
