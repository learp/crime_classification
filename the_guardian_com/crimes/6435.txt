British soldiers subjected Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian, to interrogation techniques described as illegal and morally unjustifiable more than 30 years ago, a public inquiry into his death heard today. Gerard Elias QC, the inquiry's counsel, referred to five techniques – wall standing, hooding, subjection to noise, sleep deprivation, and deprivation of food and drink – used against IRA detainees in Northern Ireland. Edward Heath, the prime minister, told the Commons in 1972 that the methods would be banned in future operations. Mousa died after being beaten in Basra in 2003.
