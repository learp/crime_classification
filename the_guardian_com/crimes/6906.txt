Two people have been charged with the murder of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, the 25-year-old student who was stabbed to death last weekend as he made his final pizza delivery before starting a career as an IT consultant.Shamraze Khan, 25, of Sheffield, and a 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are both due to appear at Sheffield magistrates court on Saturday morning.The body of Peiris, who was originally from Sri Lanka, was found in his car in Southey Crescent, Sheffield, at about 10.30pm last Sunday. A postmortem examination revealed that he died from stab wounds. He was found by fellow Domino's Pizza workers who had gone looking for him after he failed to deliver what was to be his last order.Peiris, who came to the UK to finish an IT degree and graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 2011, had just secured a job as an IT consultant in the city.His family, who are understood to be making plans to travel to South Yorkshire, described him as the "most caring and loving son a parent could have".Speaking from their family home in Sri Lanka, his father Sarath Mahinda Peiris and mother Sudarma Narangoda said: "We sent our son to the UK to study so he can have a better life. Now we are left with only a broken heart."We were devastated and shocked to hear of our son's tragic end and we are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone."
