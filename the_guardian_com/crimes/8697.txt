Peter Tobin, the convicted child rapist and killer already serving life sentences for the murders of two young women, was found guilty today of killing a third, amid fears that more victims could emerge.A jury at Chelmsford crown court took just 13 minutes – believed to be one of the shortest deliberations ever in a trial of this nature – to find Tobin, 63, guilty of kidnapping, drugging and murdering 18-year-old Dinah McNicol, who disappeared in August 1991 as she hitchhiked home from a music festival.Yesterday police released images of women's jewellery found in Tobin's possession which they believe he might have kept as trophies from unknown victims. Forces across Britain will now begin pursuing 1,400 separate outstanding lines of inquiry to try to piece together his movements since the 1960s.Among the 37 items recovered are watches, necklaces with religious pendants, diamond rings and a black leather purse carrying the word Lourdes.More than a dozen unsolved murders are thought to have been examined again for possible links to Tobin, though officers have stressed there is no immediate evidence linking him at this stage.Robin Merrett, assistant chief constable of Sussex police, who, under the codename Operation Anagram, is leading the national trawl for any further victims, appealed to the public to help identify the jewellery, which was in Tobin's possession in 1991 and 2006.David Swindle, Detective Superintendent at Strathclyde police, said: "Peter Tobin has now been found guilty of the brutal murders of three young women. Who knows if he has killed others?"We will continue to actively scrutinise his movements throughout his lifetime. No stone will be left unturned. If this takes years then so be it. If Peter Tobin dies, it will not mean that the investigation ends."McNicol's body was discovered in November 2007, tightly bound and gagged, wrapped in 16 heavy-duty refuse bags and buried under concrete in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent. A few metres away, cut in two and also wrapped in bin bags, was the corpse of Vicky Hamilton, 15, whom Tobin had abducted, raped and murdered in Bathgate, West Lothian, in February 1991.Tobin has already been convicted of killing Hamilton, and has also been convicted of the murder of Angelika Kluk, 23, a Polish student whom he raped, bludgeoned and stabbed to death in September 2006, dumping her body under the floor of a Glasgow church.He was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 1994, of which he served 10, for raping and buggering a 14-year-old girl and indecently assaulting another.Already serving life with a minimum of 30 years, he was sentenced by Justice Calvert-Smith to a full life term.McNicol's father Ian, 70, sat in court throughout the two-and-a-half-day trial with Dinah's brother and two sisters, who held hands as the verdict was announced, before kissing each other in silence. Michael Hamilton, Vicky's father, arrived from his home in Scotland for the verdict, and touched McNicol on the shoulder and shook his hand as it was delivered.Tobin, dressed in dark trousers and the same lilac jumper and shirt he wore for his previous murder trials, sat impassively as he was sentenced. Two jury members wept as details of his other crimes were disclosed in court after the verdict."After all these years, we at last know the truth and justice has prevailed," Sara Tizard, Dinah's half-sister, said outside court. "We'd like to put the trial behind us and remember Dinah as the unique and inspiring daughter and sister she was."Detective Superintendent Tim Wills, of Essex police, described the killer as "pure evil" and paid tribute to McNicol's family, saying: "I can't imagine what 18 years of not knowing what happened to Dinah must have been like for them. The strength they have shown throughout that has been remarkable."The jury of three women and nine men had heard that Tobin murdered McNicol, from Tillingham, Essex, after picking her up in his car, drugging her with the sedative amitriptyline, which he was prescribed at the time, and almost certainly raping her. The body of the teenager was found buried in the garden of 50 Irvine Drive, Margate, where Tobin had lived.After murdering McNicol, Tobin used her cash card to take more than £2,000 from her account via cash machines along the south coast, money she had received as compensation for the death of her mother in a car accident when she was six.It was Kluk's murder in 2006, shortly after which Tobin was arrested, and the discovery that he had moved around the country using alibis, that prompted all police forces to re-examine cold cases.The discovery that he had lived in Bathgate at the time that Hamilton disappeared there led to a search of his house, where a knife holding traces of her skin was found. Essex police then began excavating the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate looking for McNicol, where they found the bodies of two young women.
