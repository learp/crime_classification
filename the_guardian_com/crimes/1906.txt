Proposals for a radical shake-up of the police that would shift political control and funding decisions to local communities will be announced by David Cameron this week. The 43 police authorities in England and Wales would be replaced by elected police commissioners who could appoint and dismiss chief constables under the plan. The commissioners would have a wide range of powers to set targets, draw up policing plans and control their own budgets.Separate 'community security budgets' would also allow town or parish councils to make detailed decisions about local policing priorities, such as whether to 'clean graffiti or purchase specific equipment'.'The key is accountability to local communities,' according to Nick Herbert, the Arundel MP and opposition police reform spokesman, who wrote the latest policy report. He said the make-up of the current police authorities was 'largely unelected, and undemocratic' and said major changes were necessary. Though Cameron has stressed that final decisions on Tory policy will be taken much closer to a general election, party sources suggested the proposals were likely to help shape law-and-order plans in an eventual manifesto.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: 'There is a growing gulf between the police and the public which must be bridged. People want officers on the streets. They want them to reflect local priorities.' He added: 'We need to give communities formal control over policing so that they can secure the level of protection to which they are entitled and which they have paid for.'In an apparent bid to head off charges that the overhaul of the police might endanger security, the latest report says that the aim is to 'substantially reduce the role of the Home Secretary' in issues of local policing but also allow central government to 'refocus on to areas of national policing and security'.The police proposals come just three weeks after a similar mid-term policy consultation - suggesting new environmental taxes on air travel - triggered criticism from airlines, travel companies and the government, which said it would 'criminalise' air travel without significantly denting carbon emissions.
