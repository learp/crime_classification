One woman described how Kirk Reid attacked her as she arrived home in the early hours from a Halloween party in October 2005. It was a year and eight months after he had been identified as a suspect in a long-running string of sexual attacks in south London.The woman, in a fancy dress costume including a bright blue wig, was about to enter the garden of her south London home when Reid struck."I didn't see or hear anything behind me," she said. "Suddenly I felt a hand come up between my legs with some force. It was touching my inner thigh."At the same time another hand came around from behind and over my mouth. I was actually lifted off the ground."Instinctively I brought my elbow back behind me - I don't know if it made contact but it made him drop me back to my feet."I spun round and we were just sort of staring at each other. He looked quite startled. I noticed he didn't have a weapon and I thought all my lotteries had come at once."We both looked at each other for what seemed like a long time but it was only a few seconds. He didn't say anything, he just ran off round the corner."It was then my adrenaline started pumping and I started yelling blue murder and shouting all kinds of obscenities after him. I was pretty angry."Many of Reid's victims described his "crazy eyes" and blank expression. Another woman, a student, was grabbed as she was on the phone after a night out in October 2007. "I was walking back home on my own," she said. "I just heard footsteps behind me and a hand went over my mouth and someone pulled me to the floor. His other hand came out and started grabbing my crotch. I thought he was trying to get my knickers down but I was wearing tights. "My boyfriend was on the phone that was still around my wrist. He thought I was being murdered."
