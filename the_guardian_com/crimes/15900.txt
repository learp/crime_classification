Dr Andrew Murday, an expert on knife wounds, warned yesterday of the ease with which knife attacks can cause death.Dr Murday, a surgeon at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, operates on three victims a week. His hospital receives hundreds of victims a month. Glasgow is Britain's capital for knife crime, with 55% of murders attributable to knife wounds. Dr Murday said anyone carrying a knife was a potential murderer. "If someone sets out carrying a knife and attacks someone with it, unless they are an anatomist, it is a completely random chance whether or not they will kill their victim," he said."If they pierce the skin with a knife, the result could be either a minor cut or a fatal wound, depending on whether the blade hits a vital organ or artery. If you have a knife in your hand, it's as easy to kill someone as it is to give them a scratch."He added: "There's a lot of ignorance about what a knife can do. People carry them for bravado, or because they wrongly believe it offers them protection. "In reality, if you use a knife in a fight you have a substantial chance of killing somebody. Just carrying the knife makes you a potential murderer.""If you stab somebody in the chest, for example, it might just hit the bone. But if it gets the ribs, the blade can kill. Stabs in the abdomen and even the groin can be fatal too, although the person committing the attack may not know that. They can often be accidental murders.""What we really need to do is to stop people from carrying knives in the first place."One obstacle to attempts to reduce the number of people carrying knives is that they are so accessible, he said. "The majority of penetrating wounds are caused by knives that aren't specific combat weapons, but knives you can pick up on the high street."Anybody can go into their kitchen cupboard and pick up a knife, unaware of how easy it is to inflict a fatal injury."
