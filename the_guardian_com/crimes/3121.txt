Police are to question a 32-year-old woman about allegations of sexual assault on a child at a nursery run by a charity in central Leeds.Detectives made initial inquiries after arresting the woman following the claim, which is believed to have come from within the nursery where she has worked for just under a year.She was released on bail pending further interviews over the allegation, involving one of some 30 children aged under four. Anxious parents yesterday said they were worried, but did not want to jump to conclusions about what could be a misunderstanding or false claim.West Yorkshire police said the woman was from Leeds, where she would be interviewed by the force's child and public protection unit. The inquiry is at an early stage and officers are understood to be treating it as an isolated incident, which is not linked to other nurseries or the internet.A statement from the nursery said: "A member of staff has been suspended as a result of an allegation."
