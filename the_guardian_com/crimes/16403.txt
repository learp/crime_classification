A coroner heard yesterday how a husband stabbed his police officer wife to death just before Christmas last year and then killed himself.A postmortem examination revealed that Richard Mace, 26, had stabbed his wife Clare, 23, many times in the head, neck, torso and arms. One wound pierced her heart. "The fact that two of the stab wounds to the chest went through bone implies considerable force," said Caroline Singleton, deputy coroner in Blackburn, Lancashire. Mr Mace died from blood loss due to self-inflicted stab wounds to his neck and arms, she added. She recorded verdicts of unlawful killing and suicide. The bodies of the couple were found early on Christmas Eve by police who broke into their house in Clayton-le-Moors after neighbours raised the alarm. PC Mace, a Lancashire constabulary patrol officer based in Nelson, was found dead in a downstairs room. The body of her husband, an immigration worker, was found upstairs. Susan Metcalfe, the couple's neighbour, told the court that on December 23 she had heard hammering coming from their house and heard Mrs Mace screaming. When there was no reply at the front door the following day, she called police.
