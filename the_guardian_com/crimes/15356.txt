Sandi Toksvig has said she was groped "on air, by a famous individual" 30 years ago. The radio and television presenter, who declined to name the celebrity, said when she told other staff what had happened they thought it funny.The disclosure came as Toksvig reviewed the newspapers for the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.Questions have been raised about the culture at the corporation in the 1980s after the allegations emerged about the behaviour of Sir Jimmy Savile.Liz Kershaw, a former RadioÂ 1 DJ, described last week how she was regularly groped by a colleague.Toksvig, who starred in children's shows including ITV's Number 73 during the 1980s, and is now a regular on Radio 4, said the other claims about abusive behaviour came as no surprise.She said: "In the 80s, which is when I started in radio and television, things were very different. Not to name any names, but I was once very unpleasantly groped while I was broadcasting by a famous individual who shall remain nameless. When I told the staff afterwards what had happened, everybody thought it was amusing. There was a sort of 'shrugged shoulder' approach to the whole thing."She said the allegations of inappropriate behaviour "did not surprise me at all and I had heard those stories when I was working at the BBC".The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust has said it is considering changing its name after being contacted by members of the public who felt the name was no longer suitable. In a statement the charity said the trustees were "actively looking at supporting, amongst others, charities that work with survivors of sexual abuse They feel this is the right thing to do in the circumstances."It adds: "The trustees are aware that a large proportion of the funds the charity received came from donors other than the late Jimmy Savile, through fundraising and legacies."
