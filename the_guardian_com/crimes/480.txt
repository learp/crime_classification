Police hunting the murderer of Joanna Yeates attempted once again to dampen down any expectation that the crime was going to be solved quickly.Chief Superintendent Jon Stratford, of Avon and Somerset police, said "steady progress" was being made but warned: "It could take some time before we find out who killed Jo but we certainly will."Stratford, who has responsibility for community policing in the Clifton area of Bristol, where Yeates went missing three weeks ago tomorrow, said a large police presence remained in the area to reassure people. Extra patrols of officers on foot, in vehicles, on bicycles and on horseback were taking place.Women have been advised not to walk home alone after dark but Stratford repeated that there was no "specific intelligence" to suggest there was an increased risk.Meanwhile, a friend of Yeates' landlord, Chris Jefferies, who was arrested on suspicion of her murder before being freed on police bail, claimed he planned to take legal action over his arrest.Irving Steggles, 65, who works at a Baptist church in South Africa, said: "Chris emailed me and said he was going to be eliminated from police inquiries in the next day or so. He said: 'The ordeal is almost over'. He is preparing a case against the media and the police, I believe. This has completely shattered his life."Searches continued around the building where Yeates, a 25-year-old landscape architect, lived. Drains, a small outdoor rifle range and neighbouring gardens were being searched.The University of Bristol issued safety advice ahead of the return of students next week. Staff and students were advised to carry a personal attack alarm and were told they could get one for free from the university's security services.They were also told they could ask to be escorted to their vehicles by security staff if they were working after dark.Police are continuing to hunt for a long grey ski sock that was missing from Yeates' body when it was found on a roadside verge eight days after she vanished.Detectives are keeping an open mind over whether the sock was kept by the killer as a trophy and whether she may have been strangled with it.
