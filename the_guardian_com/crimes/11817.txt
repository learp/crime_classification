A copycat criminal who tried to blackmail the Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone for £200,000 in a "hopeless and hapless" plot involving the potential kidnap of his socialite daughter Tamara has been jailed for five years.Martin Peckham, 41, posed as a security specialist who claimed to know of a Middle Eastern plot to kidnap Tamara Ecclestone that he said he could foil if he was paid the money by Ecclestone. Peckham, who pleaded guilty to blackmail, dreamed up the plot after seeing a tabloid newspaper article about a similar attempt to blackmail the F1 supremo, Southwark crown court heard.The father of two, from Colchester, had lost around £8,500 on a deposit for a wedding venue and, unknown to his fiancee, could not afford to pay for the new location she had booked, the court heard.In an attempt to cover the costs of the wedding and buy the house he lived in with his fiancee, the dental technician repeatedly telephoned Bernie Ecclestone and Tamara Ecclestone's boyfriend at the time, Omar Khyami, to give them updates on the fictitious kidnap plot and ask for money to scupper it, according to the prosecutor Peter Zinner. Peckham's lawyer, Satyanand Beharrylal, told the court: "The actions of Mr Peckham were hopeless and hapless compared to seasoned criminals."
