The mastermind of a gang of fraudsters who used leaked bank account information to steal £2.4m from wealthy customers was yesterday jailed for five years by a judge who described him as "the managing director" of the sophisticated conspiracy.When he was arrested, the 27-year-old known as Olawasegun Adekunle - his real identity remains a mystery - had, among other luxury goods, an £18,500 18-carat gold Rolex, an £87,000 Bentley Continental and a "palatial" Thames apartment.London's Southwark crown court heard how part of the scam relied on confidential customer information supplied by Shana Campbell, of Brockley, south-east London, a 24-year-old Halifax customer adviser persuaded to act as an "insider" for the group. She received a four-year jail sentence."This was a well-planned, well-oiled money laundering circuit obviously set up well in advance," said Judge Anthony Pitts, passing sentence.The five-week trial was told by Francis Sheridan, prosecuting, that the defendants and "persons unknown" - including other bank insiders - had been involved in the "highly organised and systematic operation" to steal from clients of Halifax, HSBC and Barclays.Posing as account holders, the fraudsters used fake documents to target dozens of high-value deposits. The thieves failed in their attempt to defraud former BBC world affairs correspondent Rageh Omar, after a Barclays branch manager became suspicious of a caller pretending to be the journalist.Around £1.3m went missing after the crime ring gained control of customer accounts and transferred money to "friendly third party accounts" - deliberately set up in the name of genuine account holders - before laundering the proceeds. A further £1m was siphoned using a virus to hack into accounts and change internet banking passwords.Council janitor Steven Fabian, 44, from Kennington, south-east London - Adekunle's uncle - was sentenced to two and half years for money laundering.Berkshire car traders Neil Kynock, 38, from Windsor, Brett Hilton, 33, from Sunningdale and Wesley Rossiter, 29, from Fifefield, all admitted to money laundering and, respectively, received 27-month, 14-month and 12-month sentences.The court heard that illegal immigrant Adekunle profited most. "You were undoubtedly the mastermind, the managing director, the driving force, the organiser, enthusiastic in your role of ... defrauding banks and their customers," the judge told him.
