A British man was charged with the murder of his girlfriend when he appeared in a court in Crete today, his lawyer said.Chelsea Hyndman, 21, died on Monday after suffering ruptured internal organs, which doctors said were caused by physical violence.Luke Walker, 22, of Brierley Hill, West Midlands, was remanded in custody but his lawyer said he would file an appeal for bail next week.George Koundourakis said: "It is too early to say when the trial will be."It was originally thought Walker would face a lesser charge of causing fatal bodily injury.Ms Hyndman's mother, Heather, said: "We are devastated - we cannot believe what has happened. The last time we saw her was when she set off for Greece with her friends embarking on a new adventure."Her mother said she left a younger sister, Mia, six, whom she treated like her own daughter.Ms Hyndman, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, died a day after she was admitted to hospital in Heraklion suffering from severe abdominal pain.It is understood she and Walker were intending to spend the summer working on the island.
