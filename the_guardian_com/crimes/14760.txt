The surveillance society found its voice yesterday with the announcement that CCTV cameras equipped with loudspeakers are to give a public telling-off to people behaving badly in crime hotspots across 20 English towns and cities. The introduction of "talking cameras", pioneered in Middlesbrough, allows CCTV operators to speak directly to people on the street to ask them to stop doing something, make amends or simply warn them that their behaviour is being recorded.Children's voices are to be used initially to make the encounter less confrontational. In Middlesbrough they have been used to deal with littering, drunken and disorderly behaviour and vandalism, and even to disperse intimidating groups loitering in shopping areas and on housing estates. CCTV footage released yesterday showed a reveller on a street in Middlesbrough being watched after picking up a traffic cone and hitting a public phone box with it. A voice boomed out from the speaker attached to the camera: "Warning you in the dark T-shirt, you are being monitored by CCTV. Please put the traffic cone back where you found it, thank you." The man put down the cone and went on his way.The Conservatives gave the scheme a cautious welcome but David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said it could yet go the way of aborted schemes such as night courts and marching yobs to cashpoints. The talking cameras will be launched later this year in Southwark, Barking and Dagenham, Reading, Harlow, Norwich, Ipswich, Plymouth, Gloucester, Derby, Northampton, Mansfield, Nottingham, Coventry, Sandwell, Wirral, Blackpool, Salford, South Tyneside and Darlington.
