The father of Madeleine McCann returned to work today, almost six months after his daughter went missing.Gerry McCann, a consultant cardiologist, said he felt he and his wife, Kate, had done everything they could to try to find Madeleine after she vanished on a family holiday in Portugal on May 3."We have always said that at six months we didn't want to look back and say I wish we had done that and wish we had done this," Mr McCann said before arriving for work at Glenfield hospital in Leicester."But now we feel we have done everything we can do to establish the search for Madeleine on an ongoing basis and we feel we have the proper infrastructure now in place to find her."The decision was [that] it was the right time for me and the family."When we came back from Portugal we wanted to get back to a degree of normality. I'll be starting off with the work I normally do, academic work, MRI scans, administration, and steadily increase my workload depending on how I get on."He added: "I'd like to thank all of the staff at Glenfield and across the wider trust who have been incredibly supportive over the last six months."Doug Skehan, the clinical director of the hospital's cardio-respiratory directorate, said: "My colleagues at Leicester's hospitals look forward to welcoming him back as he returns to work after a lengthy and difficult period of absence."In short, we're glad to have a good doctor back."
