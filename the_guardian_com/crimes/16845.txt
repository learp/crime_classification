Four teenagers were last night charged with murdering 16-year-old Shakilus Townsend, who was beaten and stabbed to death in London last week. Tyrell Ellis, 18, of Thornton Heath, south London, two male youths aged 17 and 16, and a 15-year-old female are accused of the killing, Scotland Yard said.All four were were remanded in custody and are due to appear at Sutton magistrates court this morning. A fifth person arrested - a 22-year-old man - has been bailed to return to a south London police station on a date in August.Shakilus became the 18th person in the capital to die from knife violence when he was stabbed and beaten with a baseball bat in an attack near his home in Thornton Heath last Thursday. The victim, known as Shaki or Bugz, died pleading for his mother in the arms of a witness.After the killing his stepmother called for violent teenage criminals to be sent to Iraq, saying they behaved badly because there was "no punishment".Townsend died less than a week after the stabbing of Ben Kinsella, 16, the brother of the former EastEnders actor Brooke Kinsella, which sparked a 400-strong protest march and calls for urgent action from police and politicians. Three youths have been charged with Kinsella's murder and remanded in custody until October.The latest spate of stabbings led the policing minister, Tony McNulty, to call on judges and magistrates to impose tougher sentences on people carrying knives. The Metropolitan police also announced it was setting up a dedicated 75-strong taskforce to target gangs and knife crime and the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, is considering forcing doctors to notify the police of stabbing injuries.
