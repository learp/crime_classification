Yeshi Girma, the wife of the failed suicide bomber Hussain Osman, was jailed for 15 years today after failing to tell police about her husband's plan to cause "carnage and mass murder" on London's underground.Girma, 32, of Stockwell, south London, knew of Osman's intention to bomb Shepherd's Bush tube station on July 21 2005, two weeks after the July 7 bombings in which 52 people died, and could have stopped it from going ahead, the Old Bailey heard.She was yesterday found guilty of having information about terrorism and failing to disclose it "without reasonable excuse". She was also convicted of assisting an offender and failing to disclose information about Osman's involvement in the July 21 attacks.Girma's sister and brother, Mulu Girma, 24, from Brighton, and Esayas Girma, 22, from Stockwell, were found guilty of failing to disclose information and assisting an offender. They were today sentenced to 10 years in prison.Judge Paul Worsley today told Girma: "You already shared Osman's extreme views on Islam and coordinated the escape plan for the father of your three children after he failed to achieve his sought-after place in paradise.''Osman and his fellow bombers Yassin Omar, Ramzi Mohamed and Muktar Ibrahim were convicted at Woolwich crown court last year of conspiracy to murder. Plotters Manfo Asiedu and Adel Yahya pleaded guilty to related charges. Thirty minutes after the botched bombing attempt, Osman rang his wife to hatch an escape plan and she helped him flee to Brighton. He later took a Eurostar train to Paris and went on to Rome, where he was arrested.Girma said of Osman: "I don't know what he was doing. He only came when he wanted to, once a week or once every two weeks."But the court heard Girma became aware of her husband's radicalisation as early as May 2004 when he took their young son to a training camp in Cumbria, also attended by the three other bombers and Yahya. Her fingerprints were discovered on tapes of "extremist Islamic preaching".Max Hill QC, prosecuting, said: "Yeshi Girma had prior knowledge of the events of 21/7. She had some information about what the bombers intended to do but failed to bring this to the attention of the police."Had the bombers successfully detonated the bombs on busy tube trains that day, there would have been carnage and mass murder."Armed with that prior knowledge of what was going to happen, Yeshi Girma could have attempted to prevent the attacks, which, but for shortcomings in the production of the explosive devices, would have killed and injured many people."
