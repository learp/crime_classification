Human remains have been found by police searching for the body of retired teacher Kate Prout, who was murdered by her husband, Adrian Prout, in 2007.Adrian Prout admitted for the first time last week that he had killed his wife and was taken from his prison cell to their former home to point out the spot where he had buried her body.The search at Redhill Farm in Redmarley in Gloucestershire began on Monday.Officers used ground-penetrating radar and dogs to comb an area of about 250 sq metres where Prout said he had buried his wife. A forensic archaeologist was also on hand to help supervise the work, described by police as "delicate and painstaking".Police said on Thursday afternoon that human remains had been found.Adrian Prout, 49, a wealthy farmer, was convicted last year of murdering his wife, who was last seen in November 2007, though her body had not been found.He had protested his innocence until he failed a lie detector test organised by supporters who had campaigned for his release.He finally broke the news he was guilty to his fiancee, Debbie Garlick, and was visited by police in prison. He confessed he had murdered his wife and agreed to show officers where he had buried the body.He was taken to the farm on Friday and spent 25 minutes pointing out the area where the remains had been left.Kate Prout's family have repeatedly called on Adrian Prout to reveal the whereabouts of her body. The pair were in the middle of an acrimonious divorce when Mrs Prout, 55, went missing.Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson, of Gloucestershire police, said: "At one o'clock this afternoon we have found human remains close to the location Adrian Prout identified as the place he buried his wife."No formal identification has taken place. However, we have informed Kate's family of recent developments."I do hope that this will be the final chapter of these harrowing events for Kate's family."
