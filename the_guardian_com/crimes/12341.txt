A schoolboy who admitted murdering 11-year-old Joe Geeling after luring him to his house with a faked letter from a teacher has been sentenced to life in jail.Joe, a cystic fibrosis sufferer who was described as a "little angel" by his parents, was stabbed to death on March 1 this year.Michael Hamer, 15, pleaded guilty to the murder before his trial was due to start at Manchester crown court and was later told he would serve a minimum of 12 years for the killing.The court heard that, driven by a sexual obsession, Hamer lured Joe to his house, where he attacked him with a frying pan and then stabbed him 16 times with kitchen knives.Hamer put the boy's body into a wheelie bin and dumped it in a nearby park.Alistair Webster QC, prosecuting, said Hamer had not given the court a true account of Joe's death and had tried to conceal it afterwards."The murderer targeted his victim, led him away by deception, carried out the killing with significant brutality and set about covering up his crime in what appears to be a surly, calculating way."Joe's parents, Tom and Gwen Geeling, raised the alarm after he failed to return home from his school in Bury, Greater Manchester.Police, firefighters, mountain rescue teams and members of Joe's family searched in freezing temperatures until late in the night.At 11am the following day his body was found in a wooded gully in Whitehead Park, covered with twigs, leaves and dirt.An hour after the discovery of the body, police arrested Hamer, then aged 14, in his classroom on suspicion of murder.Hamer attended the same school as Joe, St Gabriel's Roman Catholic high school.He was formally charged with Joe's murder on March 7. Since then he has been remanded in secure local authority accommodation.At an earlier hearing he admitted killing the boy, but denied it was murder.Passing sentence, Mr Justice Richard McCombe said Harmer had harboured "significant feelings of distress from the absence of a relationship with your father" and suffered a "significant degree" of bullying at school."I am now told that, within the last few days, that you have admitted to Mr Steer [Hamer's defence counsel] and to your solicitor that you made a sexual advance to Joe who responded by referring to you as 'gay' and threatening to tell others of what you had done."Joe, as you accept, had done absolutely nothing to encourage any such advance. The rejection of the advance was the immediate triggering event of what you did to Joe."You took away Joe's life and damaged the lives of all who loved him," he added.Mr Webster later described Hamer as an "isolated" boy who had been bullied at school.But there had been "no significant contact" between Joe and his killer before March 1, he said.The court heard that Hamer used the school's system of older pupils mentoring younger ones to gain access to Joe.He wrote a fictitious letter purporting to be from the deputy head teacher to Joe to lure his victim to his house.The loss of their "very brave and kind-hearted little lad" had "devastated" the Geeling family, Mr Webster said.Speaking briefly outside the court, Mr Geeling said: "It's taken us an enormous amount of time to get to this point, it's been a long, frustrating, agonising wait."He thanked the police and the school and asked that the family be given some privacy in the next few days to help them "get through this stage in the ordeal".Hundreds of mourners attended his funeral in Bury on March 31.The Catholic Dean of Bury, the Rev Paul Cannon, who led the service, said: "When a child dies, we are inclined to say what a pity he died before he was able to blossom fully."When we speak like that we speak of promise rather than achievement and that is unfair to Joe. The most important thing about Joe is not what he might have achieved, but the fact that he achieved much in his short life."
