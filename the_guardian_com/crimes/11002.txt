Two men described as prominent republicans were charged today with offences connected with the IRA robbery of the Northern Bank.Tom Hanlon and George Hegarty were arrested in Cork last night by detectives investigating the 2004 robbery in Belfast.Both men were taken to the republic's anti-terrorist special criminal court in Dublin under armed guard this morning, where they were charged.Hanlon, 42, of Passage West, Cork, and Hegarty, 62, of Douglas, Cork, were arrested as part of Operation Phoenix, a huge cross-border investigation, involving anti-terrorist units, fraud squads and the Criminal Assets Bureau.The court heard Hanlon, a father of four, made no reply when arrested on suspicion of being a member of an ­unlawful organisation, the IRA, on 16 February 2005.Hegarty was also charged with being a member of the IRA on the same date. A lawyer for Hegarty, a father of five who is on disability benefits, said he was a primary carer for his partner and his grown-up child, who has a learning disability.Mr Justice Paul Butler, presiding over the three-judge court, insisted a bail ­hearing should go ahead today despite prosecution calls for the men to be remanded in custody for 48 hours.The judge said he was taking into consideration the age of the alleged offences and evidence both men have lived in Cork and been available to investigators since February 2005.The men are due before the court again later this afternoon for a bail hearing.
