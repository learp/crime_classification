One of them was seen at Charlton's final game of last season, away to Birmingham City. For the new season Charlton fans will have to give their name before they can buy a ticket.A club spokesman said: 'We don't want them here and we won't sell them a ticket. We take a great pride in our anti-racist policy and in being leaders in that field.'Suresh Grover, spokesman for the Stephen Lawrence Family Campaign, said: 'This is the first time these five have received any sort of punishment. [It] is a magnificent gesture to exclude these racist thugs and it represents a measure of practical support for Doreen and Neville Lawrence.'
