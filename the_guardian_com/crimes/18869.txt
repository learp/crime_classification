Max Clifford pleaded his innocence as he appeared in court accused of 11 counts of indecent assault relating to seven alleged victims.The celebrity publicist arrived at Southwark crown court, in central London, to a media scrum on Friday morning for a hearing ahead of his planned trial in March next year.Speaking on the steps of the court before the hearing, Clifford told the media: "I'm totally innocent of these charges from the seven anonymous women."It's been a very hard time for myself, my wife, my family and my loved ones, but I have been helped tremendously by the public support I get everywhere I go and that has made a huge difference."Wearing a grey suit jacket and a white shirt, Clifford stood in the dock to formally enter not guilty pleas to each of the 11 charges of indecent assault. His trial is scheduled to begin on 4 March at Southwark crown court and last up to five weeks.After the hearing, Clifford took aim at the legal process for allowing the anonymity of seven alleged victims.He said: "I don't think it's fair that they remain anonymous because their accusations are so damaging. Just the accusations."Effectively, I've been punished since I was arrested last December in a very public fashion while they remain totally anonymous."It's a horrible thing to go through for anyone and I'm lucky to have the support of the public everywhere I go."Asked whether he ever expected to be in the public eye facing a high-profile criminal trial, the PR guru said: "Of course I didn't – but for Jimmy Savile, I wouldn't have been. If the truth comes out in March I'll be happy."The 11 counts of indecent assault relate to seven alleged victims, all women aged between 15 and 19 at the time between 1966 and 1984.The judge, Anthony Leonard QC, released Clifford on bail on condition that he lives and sleeps at his home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and has no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18. He is also prohibited from contacting any prosecution witnesses.Clifford has maintained his innocence since his arrest under Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation into alleged sexual offences by Jimmy Savile and others, last December. The charges facing Clifford are unrelated to Savile.The publicist, who made his fortune shaping the reputations of some of Britain's biggest stars, first pleaded not guilty to the charges on 28 May.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
