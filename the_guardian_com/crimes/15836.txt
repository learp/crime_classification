Two men died and two others escaped early today after two quad bikes thought to have been involved in a £40,000 ram-raid minutes earlier were hit by an empty passenger train in Cardiff.The dead pair were identified by British Transport police as Trevor Davies, 20, and David Cooper, 24. The gang is thought to have stolen sports and ski jackets from a store next to the main London to South Wales rail line after used bolt cutters to get through fencing and ram-raided the doors. It is thought the thieves drove back on to the rail line but were hit by a train travelling at 70mph.It is thought the sound of the train was drowned by the engines of the bikes and the train driver could not stop in time. One bike was crushed and the other pushed off the track. It is understood the jackets were retrieved by police near the line.The GO Outdoors store backs on to the railway line which is used by quad bikers as an unofficial — and very dangerous — nighttime race track. Initially it was thought the men died while racing.But police are working on the theory that a gang dreamed up the idea of using the line as a quick getaway route away from main roads and street lighting.A spokesman for South Wales police said: "Police believe that the men who made off from the store may be the same men involved in the fatal incident at a nearby railway line. That is our line of investigation although it is too early to be certain at this stage."
