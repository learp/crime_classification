Launched 56 years ago as a fifth arm of the welfare state, legal aid has been through a troubled decade. In 1996 the Woolf review of civil justice concluded that "a system which pays more in lawyers' fees than in compensation to accident victims is indefensible". And, while initially 70% of people qualified for legal aid, this had shrunk to 50% by the 1990s and has halved since then. A decade ago, 11,000 law firms offered legally aided help but, since contracts were introduced, this has shrunk to 4,000, creating swathes of the country where no help is available - legal aid "deserts" in the words of the lord chancellor himself. The obscene disparity in earnings between top QCs and junior barristers on £50 a day further undermined the system, now made worse by news that one QC has become the first to be paid over £1m in a year from criminal legal aid.And yet. Legal aid is still more accessible in the UK than in most other states. Ministers have correctly identified the cause of civil legal aid's decline: the degree to which criminal aid (up 37% in seven years) has squeezed out civil (down 24%). But the ambitions remain as valid as in 1949. In a complex society people need help on a vast range of issues: family disputes, clinical negligence, debt, housing, immigration, employment and others. On all these fronts people can get advice, even if representation is more restricted. Social justice remains a true test of a civilised society and legal aid is one of the essential tools to deliver it.
