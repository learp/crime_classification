Your leader (July 10) alleges that the government's intention to create a single criminal justice inspectorate will threaten the independence of the current Prisons Inspectorate and result in less rigorous scrutiny of our prisons. The new inspectorate will strengthen the current system while continuing the work of the chief inspector of prisons in ensuring that prisoners are kept in decent conditions and their human rights are respected. A single inspectorate will create one organisation capable of monitoring the management of offenders before, during and after imprisonment as a complete process, more easily spotting gaps or weaknesses in the system and making recommendations to address them to the agency concerned and ensuring they are immediately addressed.The importance placed on prison inspections by the government is evident in the decision to extend the appointment of Anne Owers as chief inspector of prisons to March 2008, allowing a solid transition period before the new inspectorate comes into effect. The police and justice bill preserves a specific duty on the single organisation to inspect the treatment and conditions (health, safety and decency) of prisoners held in institutions. Inspection reform is not about diluting inspection. Patricia Scotland Home Office minister for the criminal justice system and offender management
