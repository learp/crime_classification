An estate agent who kidnapped and tortured her former boss in an attempt to secure a ransom was jailed for 10 years yesterday. Ambreen Gul, 23, was so furious when she was sacked by Waqas Malik that she recruited another sacked colleague and two other accomplices to take revenge. She lured Malik to her flat in Hackney, east London, where the businessman was kicked, punched and pistol-whipped repeatedly. During a seven-hour ordeal one of his captors stood on his head, and another warned him that unless he raised a Â£200,000 ransom he and his 13-year-old son would be killed. After being forced to make several phone calls to his wife to raise the cash, Malik was given a powerful sedative. But the plot went wrong when the 48-year-old estate agent fell ill. Gul panicked, Southwark crown court was told. She ordered her bound, blindfolded and bleeding victim to be put in an office chair, wheeled from her flat and driven "almost unconscious" to his family home. Gul told Malik's wife that he was drunk and had sexually assaulted her, before driving off. In the dock with Gul were Mukshud Ali, 18, of Barking, Essex, who was sentenced to seven years and nine months in a young offenders' institution; Quasim Ahmed, 21, of Barking, who was jailed for eight years; and Shakib Chowdhury, 20, a former footballer with West Ham under-17s from Surbiton, Surrey, who was sent to a young offenders' institution for eight and a half years. All four were variously convicted of false imprisonment, wounding with intent, blackmail, having an imitation firearm with intent, theft and administering a "poison or noxious substance" with intent.
