Mark Hobson's choices are diminishing as each day passes. After six days of evading capture he is likely to be hungry, tired and increasingly desperate.To the north of Selby he has vast stretches of the North Yorkshire moors in which to hide out, but even if he knows the land he is unlikely to remain invisible for very long in an area criss-crossed by ramblers and farmers. Survival experts yesterday dismissed suggestions that Mr Hobson would have gained anything by reading an SAS handbook, as has been suggested. "You may as well read the back of a cornflake box," said Jonny Crockett, a former Royal Marine. "The bottom line is he is a 30-year-old man, he is fairly fit and would be able to last on the moors without training for maybe four or five days. "After that the hunger will kick in - it will start to get the better of him and he will be very tired. That will drive him to farms or homesteads scavenging for scraps." For those with military training there was food available in the wilds of the open moorland, Mr Crockett said. Grasshoppers, crickets and worms were plentiful and just a few a day would provide protein. Other nutrition could be found from thistle roots, burdock and nettles. "You would have to have a fire source, and that would lead to smoke which would identify where he was, but there are ways around that if you know what you are doing." But if Mr Hobson took to the open moors he would be easily detectable with infrared image enhancers. Even with training the chances of evading capture in the countryside for long were low, according to Mr Crockett. "Britain is too compact and too dense a place to be able to hide out for any length of time." Should Mr Hobson make his way to a large city the fear is that he could successfully disappear, using anonymity as his disguise.
