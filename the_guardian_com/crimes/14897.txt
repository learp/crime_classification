The two Thai fisherman who raped and murdered a British backpacker should be spared the death penalty but locked up for life, the victim's mother has said.Wichai Somkhaoyai, 24, and Bualoi Posit, 23, will learn of their fate on Wednesday after pleading guilty to the attack on 21-year-old Katherine Horton on the island of Koh Samui, Thailand.Thailand's prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has called for the pair to be executed. But Elizabeth Horton disagrees and has told British journalists it was not what her daughter would have wanted."I've never believed in the death penalty, but I believe life means life," Mrs Horton, of Thornhill, Cardiff, told the News of the World."A life sentence would be appropriate. I don't agree with taking anyone's life and Katherine wouldn't believe in that either."I don't think that serves any purpose. If they are behind bars until they die it will stop it happening to anyone else."Her plea for leniency came as concerns were raised about the unprecedented speed of the investigation and trial, and the impartiality of the Thai police and judicial authorities. Murder cases usually take months to conclude in Thailand, but in this case sentencing will take place only 17 days after the attack on January 1.The police pulled out all the stops after Mr Shinawatra warned the publicity was harming the country's tourism industry.Bualoi and Wichai were arrested last Monday following the deployment of more than 100 of Thailand 's best detectives to Koh Samui, where the 21-year-old Reading University student was attacked while talking by phone to her mother in Cardiff during a late-evening walk along Lamai beach. Mrs Horton heard a scream before the line went dead. Her daughter's battered body was found floating in Lamai Bay the following day by a jet-skier.Miss Horton's funeral is to take place in Cardiff tomorrow.Speaking to BBC Wales, Mrs Horton said: "I'm grateful for the way the Thai authorities found the perpetrators so quickly. We feel some justice for Katherine. These men can't hurt anyone else."
