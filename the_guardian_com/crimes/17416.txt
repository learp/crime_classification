A postmortem carried out on the body of Natasha Collins, the fiancee of a children's BBC presenter, was "inconclusive", Scotland Yard said today.Ms Collins, 31, who died suddenly last Thursday, was found in the bath at the home she shared with presenter Mark Speight in St John's Wood, north-west London.Speight was arrested on suspicion of murder and supplying class A drugs following the death of his fiancee, but was released on bail on Friday until early February.A postmortem examination on the body of Ms Collins, also an actor and presenter, was "inconclusive" and further toxicology tests would now be carried out, said a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police.In a statement, Scotland Yard said: "The postmortem examination was held at St Thomas' Hospital today and the cause of death remains unknown."We await further test results, including toxicology. An inquest will be opened and adjourned at Westminster coroner's court tomorrow."After Ms Collin's body was discovered, the police said a suspected drug overdose was one line of inquiry that was being considered. But Speight's mother, Jacqueline, said Ms Collins may have died after taking drugs prescribed for a medical condition.Ms Collins was hit by a car about seven years ago and reports said she had suffered regular fits ever since.Speight fronts the children's art show SMart, which has been running for 14 years. The BBC has cancelled repeats of the programme until further notice. Repeats of the spin-off programme SMarteenies were also cancelled.The presenter said he is "distraught" and insisted he had nothing to do with his girlfriend's death.A statement from Speight's solicitors, Sabir Selby, issued last week, said: "At the moment no one knows what happened. Mark found her body in the bathroom and immediately called an ambulance and the police."Mark was the only other person present in the flat and has therefore been questioned by police as a matter of course. He is assisting police with their inquiries."Speight found fame on ITV's Saturday morning show Scratchy & Co. He has a degree in commercial and graphic art, and had appeared in a string of other hit children's shows on the BBC and ITV, including Beat the Cyborgs, On Your Marks and Name That Toon.The presenter met Ms Collins on the children's programme See It Saw It. He recently branched out with regular appearances on BBC1's Heaven and Earth, Rolf on Art and ITV1's This Morning.
