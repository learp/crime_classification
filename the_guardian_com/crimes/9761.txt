A man who killed his son when he threw him from a hotel balcony in Greece could return to the UK within months, it emerged yesterday. John Hogan, 33, from Bristol, has been receiving treatment at a psychiatric hospital in Athens after dropping six-year-old Liam from the fourth floor of a hotel in Crete then jumping from the balcony with two-year-old daughter Mia in his arms.Yesterday doctors said he was "showing signs of recovery" and could be ready to return to the UK in three to six months.Last night Hogan's ex-wife, Natasha, told family members she did not object to the plan but insisted Hogan should remain in custody.Her stepfather, Brian Chandler, added: "The family would not have any problems with John being returned, at the appropriate time, to a secure psychiatric hospital in the UK, for ongoing treatment. That is entirely different to him being released as a free man in the near future, which we do not believe is a likely scenario."Hogan was cleared of murder in a Crete court this year when the judge ruled he was suffering an "earthquake" of psychosis when he took Liam's life during a family holiday in 2006. At the time his ex-wife gave a harrowing statement saying their son had "lost his life for nothing". Yesterday Athanasios Kosmopoulos, managing director of the hospital where Hogan has been treated, said he could return to Britain in the "near future" after a request from his mother, Josephine, and other family members."A request has been made by Mr Hogan's family to the appropriate authorities, so that all concerned may examine the possibility of his return to England in the near future for further treatment," he said. "Depending on the advice provided by the medical and legal authorities, it is our belief that this process could be finalised within a time framework of between three and six months."Kosmopoulos said Hogan was in good health. "[He] is communicative with the staff and with other patients, and often goes for walks in the gardens and woods of the estate within which our hospital is located."Psychiatrist Ioannis Nestoros, who convinced judges that Hogan was mentally incapable of murder, said any notion that Hogan could soon be free was "ludicrously optimistic".Liam died of head injuries but Hogan and Mia survived with broken limbs.The family were told this month that Hogan was highly unlikely to face any further charges in Britain despite protests from his ex-wife.
