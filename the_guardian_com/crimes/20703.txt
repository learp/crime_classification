Tributes were paid today to a pregnant woman who was fatally stabbed in a town centre in what police said appeared to be a random attack. Claire Wilson, 22, whose unborn baby also died, was attacked as she walked to work in Grimsby, north-east Lincolnshire, on Sunday afternoon.Police said she was followed by a man who stabbed her in the back with a knife a few hundred yards from the town's main shopping centre.Friends of the mother-to-be, who was seven months pregnant, described her as "one of the greatest people anyone would want to meet" and said she was excited about the impending birth of her first child. She planned to name the girl April.Wilson's boyfriend, Adam Kennard, 23, visited the scene of the attack yesterday with a group of family and friends. He left a number of items, including a "Baby Girl" balloon. One card from the group, accompanied by a pair of red baby's shoes, read: "Baby April. You would have been the most loved baby in the world. Take care of your mum for us." Wilson's family were said to be distraught.A pub landlord said a member of the public came into his bar shouting that a woman had been stabbed, and then chased after the suspect together with a DJ from the pub, Rick, and caught up with him. He also described how members of the public tried to comfort Wilson.Medics were unable to save the woman or the unborn baby. Friends from the town's Pizza Hut restaurant, where she worked, laid flowers at the scene.A 53-year-old man, Alan McMullan, has been charged with murder in connection with the incident and will appear before Grimsby magistrates tomorrow.
