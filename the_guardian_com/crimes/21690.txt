Detectives are investigating the death of a 24-year-old woman who had taken the legal drug mephedrone.Officers are trying to work out what role, if any, mephedrone played in the death of the woman, whose body was found yesterday at a house in the village of Norton, North Yorkshire.Detective Chief Inspector Nigel Costello, who is leading the inquiry, said family and friends had told him the victim had been taking the drug in the 48 hours leading up to her death, possibly with other substances.The detective is waiting for the results of toxicology tests.The woman's death follows those of Louis Wainwright, 18, and Nicholas Smith, 19, who died in the Scunthorpe area last week following a night out.The deaths prompted criticism of the government for not doing more to tackle the threat from mephedrone – also known as M-cat or meow meow – which is manufactured as plant fertiliser.Today Costello said the woman's family were devastated by her death.He said: "Her friends and family are all very cut up – devastated, as you would imagine. People think this kind of thing happens to other people in the big cities but this is not always the case."Asked about the victim, he said: "As far as I'm aware she was a normal girl."Costello said police were called to a house in Norton just after 9am on Monday. He said it was a friend's house.Officers have been told she had been at the house since Sunday morning.The detective said the victim spent Sunday saying she did not feel well, complaining of feeling drowsy, and was asleep for most of the day.He said his officers had been told she had been taking mephedrone over the weekend but he was still trying to work out whether she was at friends' homes or in local pubs.Costello said other substances had been recovered but he was not yet in a position to say what they are.The officer repeated his warning for people to avoid mephedrone and not to believe it is safe just because it is not illegal.After the Scunthorpe deaths, opposition parties attacked the "inordinate delays" in research into the drug which could have led to it being banned.It is claimed these delays were related to the fallout from last year's sacking of the chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Professor David Nutt.Ministers vowed that immediate action would be taken on a report into a group of so-called legal highs, including mephedrone, due to be issued at the end of the month.It is expected that government drug advisers will recommend a ban on the drug within weeks.
