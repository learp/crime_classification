An urgent inquiry is under way today after a disturbed teenager who was placed with carers sexually abused the couple's children.Vale of Glamorgan council in south Wales has admitted a "serious error of judgment" over the case involving the youth, who was placed with the family despite having a history of sexual behaviour involving children.The teenager, who was housed with the family under the council's adult placement service, has been given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection after admitting raping one child and assaulting another.The council said last night it deeply regrets the distress and harm caused to the family. The director of social services, Phil Evans, said: "Although the inquiry is still at an early stage, it has become clear that there was a serious error of judgment in placing the young man in this family."Allegations about the teenager's sexual behaviour were first made in 2004, when it was claimed he acted in a sexually inappropriate way to another boy. In 2005, he is said to have sexually touched a boy while they were both at a hostel in England.Last year, he allegedly sexually assaulted a 16-year-old while they were staying in the same hostel. Despite this he was sent to live with the couple and their children.The teenager, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the family's children, was sentenced at Cardiff crown court on Friday after admitting rape and sexual assault. Judge Nicholas Cooke QC said the case was a tragedy for the couple, whose only wish was to serve the community by helping the teenager.The teenager is to serve a minimum term of six years before he can be considered for release. Evans said senior managers from the council's social services department had met the couple to apologise and offer support.The council's adult placement service provides accommodation with single people, couples or families for vulnerable adults who cannot live on their own.
