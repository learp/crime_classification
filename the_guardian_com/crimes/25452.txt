A man suffering from paranoid schizophrenia was convicted yesterday of stabbing a police officer to death as the officer tried to arrest him.Glaister Earl Butler attacked DC Michael Swindells, 44, on a canal towpath in Birmingham on May 21 last year.The 49-year-old was convicted at Birmingham crown court of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, which he admitted.He was formally cleared of murder after the prosecution accepted that medical evidence showed he had been suffering an abnormality of mind at the time of the killing.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith ordered Butler to be detained indefinitely at Ashworth high security hospital in Liverpool. He said he could not foresee a time when Butler would not pose a "serious danger" either to himself or the general public, especially the police.An independent inquiry is to examine how the martial arts enthusiast with a history of violence and paranoid delusions about the police was considered suitable to be cared for in the community.The court heard that carers saw Butler, of Nechells, Birmingham, with a knife just four days before the killing.DCI Glenn Moss said Mr Swindells' family were satisfied with the outcome. "They accept that Glaister Earl Butler clearly has an illness," he said.During the trial, the jury was read Butler's medical notes which revealed he believed he was the victim of a conspiracy by M15, the police and the authorities, including health workers and white people.On the day he was killed, Mr Swindells was attempting with other officers to arrest Butler for allegedly threatening a local carpenter with a knife. Butler had not been taking his anti-psychotic medication, and the court heard that being confronted by a number of police officers probably "tipped him over the edge".The mental health problems of the Jamaican-born mechanical engineering graduate appear to have begun when he was made redundant from his job with Rolls-Royce in 1982, after joining the company as its first black trainee. It emerged during the trial that he had believed the police were responsible for him losing the job.He first came to the attention of Stafford social services in 1992 when they were told that he had been living without electricity for two years. In 1994 he kicked a neighbour in the head in an unprovoked attack and during the investigation it emerged that he had been abusive and aggressive and was often heard shouting: "They're coming to get me, they're persecuting me."Between 1994 and 2001 he was sectioned three times, on one occasion after throwing a brick through the window of a neighbour he believed worked for the Special Branch. Shortly before going into hospital in 2001, he burned down his flat.The court was told that during his stays in hospital he was often verbally and physically violent towards staff and other patients, refused to accept that he had a mental illness and did not take his medication regularly. After the attack on Mr Swindells, 18 months' worth of anti-psychotic drugs were found at Butler's council flat.During the trial, the jury passed the judge a note questioning the wisdom of treating Butler in the community.Sue Turner, chief executive of the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust, whose outreach team was caring for him at the time of the killing, said: "The trust is extremely concerned that such a tragedy occurred and involved a person who was receiving mental health care services from the trust." She said staff who visited him before the incident thought he was taking his medication and did not believe he showed signs of a relapse.An internal inquiry would be carried out to examine what lessons could be learned, she said. An independent inquiry will also be conducted by the Birmingham and Black Country Strategic Health Authority.
