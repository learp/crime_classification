A former judge pleaded guilty today to drink-driving after being caught driving more than three times the legal limit with a bottle of vodka by his side in the car.Bruce Macmillan, 63, of Sefton Park, Liverpool, committed the offence while a sitting judge at Liverpool crown court.The former judge had been arrested on 27 August after a police officer spotted him driving erratically in his Vauxhall Signum on the motorway near Chorley in Lancashire.Adrian Hollanby, prosecuting, said that, when police stopped Macmillan, a half-full litre bottle of vodka and an empty can of the energy drink Red Bull were found in the passenger footwell of his car.Hollanby said the officer tried to stop Macmillan by sounding his vehicle's siren but he did not stop until he pulled alongside him.He went on: "When he went to the door, the officer said he noticed there was a strong smell of alcohol emanating from inside, and he also saw a half-full one-litre bottle of vodka and an empty can of Red Bull in the footwell of the passenger seat."He spoke to the driver and asked him how much alcohol he had consumed and his response was, 'I've not had a drink today, officer'."The policeman asked him if he had drunk alcohol in the last 20 minutes and he denied this, Hollanby said.A roadside breath test proved positive, and when the ex-judge was tested again at Leyland police station the lower reading was 111 micrograms in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.Stuart Driver QC, defending, said that soon after his client's arrest he went into hospital for treatment by specialists, including seeing a psychiatrist. He said: "Currently, Mr Macmillan is receiving treatment for his difficulties."Macmillan will be sentenced for driving with excess alcohol at Chorley magistrates court on 12 November. Magistrates imposed an interim driving ban and he was released on unconditional bail.The justice ministry announced last week that Macmillan had resigned as a circuit judge with immediate effect following a second arrest for alleged drink-driving on 17 September.Colleagues at Liverpool crown court are understood to have expressed concern over Macmillan's emotional state after his arrests.Macmillan, who was called to the bar in 1969 and made a full-time judge in 1993, is believed to be married with children.He lives in Liverpool, but spends much of his spare time at his holiday home in Spain. By stepping down, he lost his Â£128,000-a-year salary, but avoided being disrobed by the lord chief justice and lord chancellor.Macmillan also hit the headlines in January when he sentenced a Liverpool man who was found naked and stuck in a supermarket chimney following a bungled burglary.Passing sentence, he told the man: "Were this matter not so serious, the facts would be decidedly comic."
