Tory leader David Cameron has promised to "re-energise" frontline policing by hiving off "form filling" to the private sector.In his second policy speech of the day, Mr Cameron said the private sector was already delivering services in the public sector and argued that both had a role to play in policing.Earlier today, Mr Cameron addressed the flipside of law and order issues as he called on the private and voluntary sectors to do more to help support young people in danger of falling into crime.Mr Cameron argued that fighting crime requires agencies to stop being "blind" to the underlying causes that drove young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to offend.In a speech widely dubbed by Labour as 'hug hoodies', Mr Cameron broke new Tory ground by defending the hoodie youth culture as a response to feeling unsafe in a dangerous environment.Putting things right was not just about law enforcement, he said earlier today. But in his speech to the Police Foundation tonight, he said that compassion did not mean excusing criminal activities as he vowed to put measures in place to release officers from "form filling".Efforts to improve conviction rates will require supplementing police officers with civilian staff. Only one-quarter of recorded crimes were brought to justice, he said.Citing estimates from the Association of Chief Police Officers that wasteful and restrictive practices make police 20% less capable than they should be, Mr Cameron said forces should bring in the private sector to carry out routine administrative tasks."I'm not talking about replacing police officers, but supplementing them - freeing sworn officers to fight crime, to do the job they want to do. The private sector has been operating prisoner transport and managing custody suites for some time."There's no longer a hard and fast divide between the public, private and voluntary sectors ... and innovative chief constables will combine them in new ways to achieve the best results," Mr Cameron said.Bringing down the wage bill of frontline police staff would be another plank of the Conservatives' law and order agenda - a move likely to be opposed by the police federation.The Tory leader called for greater local flexibility to reduce the cost of services through reforms on police pay and conditions and modern employment contracts to make it easier to sack poor officers.And he reiterated his party's opposition to "the trend of growing national political control" of the police.Under a Conservative government, the new national policing board announced last week with the home secretary as chair would be scrapped, he said.Mr Cameron also condemned police force mergers, which John Reid has suspended, claiming they would deplete neighbourhood policing.Labour seized on Mr Cameron's comments today, claiming his policies had "no credibility whatsoever".Hazel Blears, the Labour party chair, said Mr Cameron was out of touch with reality. "He continues to oppose Labour's measures both to tackle crime and to tackle its causes," she said."He should spend more time with people facing anti-social behaviour before making speeches about it. The Tories voted against tougher sentences for murderers and sexual offenders, against tough new gun laws, key terrorism measures and powers to tackle anti-social behaviour, drunken violence and dangerous driving."And Labour's Respect action plan, which gives police and communities new powers to tackle the anti-social behaviour that can make life a misery for the law abiding majority, was dismissed by David Cameron as 'a headline-grabbing gimmick'.""Yet again, David Cameron is saying whatever he thinks his audience wants to hear."
