It's rare these days for the Attorney General to argue a case herself. So when Baroness Scotland appeared in court this morning in a domestic violence appeal, the subtext is clear. The government regards domestic violence as a major issue for women's rights."As well as being a human rights issue, which domestic violence clearly is, we have got to acknowledge that it is a disabler of talent disadvantaging a significant proportion of our population to achieve their potential," Scotland has said.In today's case the defendant, Harpal Singh Moore, had pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm after he repeatedly ironed his wife's face, but was sentenced to only two and a half years in prison.That was unduly lenient, Scotland successfully argued today. The court of appeal described the incident as part of "a background of abuse" against his wife. The fact that he had no previous convictions for violence did not justify a lenient sentence, they added, saying "those who perpetrate domestic violence often only demonstrate their violent nature at home."Scotland is proud of her crusade against domestic violence. She has spoken out against it frequently, and even promoted measures to make sure any members of her own staff who suffer abuse can speak out and receive support.In 2008, 80% of the cases her office referred to the Court of Appeal, mostly for violent crime, were deemed unduly lenient, with 52 individual sentences being increased.But not everyone feels the courts are sufficiently enlightened when it comes to dealing with domestic violence.Earlier this month a Bangladeshi woman was convicted of murdering her husband after years of abuse. Her appeal – under the defence of provocation which reduces murder to manslaughter where the defendant can show they were provoked into losing their self-control – was rejected by the court of appeal. Her lawyers' attempts to call a cultural expert to shed light on her background and the circumstances of her husband's killing were refused.Last year the government reformed murder law to make it harder for perpetrators of so-called "honour killings" to enjoy the defence of provocation, but said they would continue to protect women in domestic violence situations."The law will continue to recognise the realities of domestic abuse sustained over a long period of time," the Ministry of Justice said.But there is still a big difference between women who are simply victims of domestic violence, and those who hit back. Many of the latter are serving long jail sentences whilst the former, if they are lucky, have the Attorney General appearing in the court of appeal on their behalf.
