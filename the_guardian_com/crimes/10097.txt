Tony Martin has touched a chord. Messages of support for the farmer who opened fire on a gang of burglars who had broken into his home have flooded in. This is hardly surprising. There is understandable public sympathy for a 54-year-old farmer, living in a remote Norfolk house, defending himself against a gang of three much younger men.This has been reinforced by news reports of the under-resourced local police service, so short-staffed that the village station was only manned part-time and its hot line linked to a town miles away. The crime had few extenuating circumstances. It was not spontaneous but deliberately planned. The trio went fully equipped, with a holdall for the swag, binbags, chisel, torch and gloves. All but one of the windows of the farmhouse was barred. It was that one window which the burglars broke to gain entry. But Mr Martin is not the hero which the tabloids are likely to make him this morning. He broke a fundamental rule of civilised society: rejection of the use of unnecessary and undue force. Of the two burglars who broke in, one was so badly injured he could only crawl for help; the other died in the garden. He was just 16. He had only joined the two older men at the last moment. The police were right to carry out their murder investigation; the jury was right to find the farmer guilty of murder yesterday. Some of the support for Mr Martin has clearly been orchestrated by the egregious Max Clifford. Yet, ironically, it is these supporters, who want in the words of one of them quoted by Mr Clifford, to be "counted on the side of real law and order", who point to Mr Martin's most serious crime. The reason we set up a criminal justice system was to end the injustices which blood feuds, private revenge and lynch law created. Mr Martin's mother told reporters her son "never really liked shooting ... and didn't like the idea of killing animals". He must be even more appalled by the murder of a boy.
