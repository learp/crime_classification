The family of a teenager believed to have been at the wheel of a car that drove the wrong way down a motorway after a police chase and caused a horrific crash yesterday apologised to the innocent victims.Five people were killed in the accident, three young men who were in a Ford Mondeo that turned the wrong way on to the M4 in south Wales and a couple in a Volvo on their way home from their summer holiday.Teresa Fielding, the mother of 18-year-old Chris Beresford, thought to have been the Ford driver, said: "I am so sorry - I feel devastated for all the families. I had to go and identify my own child, which was the hardest thing I've ever done."Also in the Ford were Sam Case, 19, and Lee Maggs, 26. Another 18-year-old youth who was in the car is critically ill in hospital.The couple in the Volvo were named as Bridget Stafford, 70, of Thornton Heath, Surrey, and her husband, James, 69. They had spent the summer on their native Achill Island, off the west coast of Ireland, and were returning home when the Ford crashed head-on into them in the early hours on Monday.The couple spent their holidays on Achill every summer. They had travelled from Achill to board the Rosslare-Fishguard ferry on Sunday evening.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the accident because it began with a police pursuit, though officers did not follow the Ford on to the motorway.
