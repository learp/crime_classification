The ringleader of a gang which kidnapped an 11-year-old boy and threatened to kill him unless his family paid£40,000 was jailed for 12 years yesterday.Ravideep Babu, of Southall, west London, snatched the child as he walked home from school last year and phoned the boy's family nine times to demand the ransom.In one call he told them that if the money was not paid within 10 hours or if they dared raise the alarm "you can see your boy's dead body".The jury at Middlesex Guildhall crown court, in London, heard that Babu, an illegal immigrant, had admitted kidnapping the child, but claimed he had done nothing wrong.He told police he was owed money by one of the boy's relatives and claimed it was "normal practice" in his native India to take a member of someone's family to ensure a debt was met.The 24-year-old also denied forcing the child to do anything against his will and said he had needed the £40,000 ransom because his mother had cancer.But Matthew Kennedy, prosecuting, told the five-week trial that the gang's motive had been greed. He said Babu, who was smuggled into Britain four years ago, believed the boy's father "could afford to pay a substantial sum of money for his son's safety".It also emerged that the boy had overheard his captors discussing whether to spend the money on shopping trips, a visit to Paris, a flat, or perhaps a Ferrari.Yesterday Babu was sentenced to 12 years in jail for kidnapping, false imprisonment and blackmail. The judge told him he could expect to be deported on his release.Passing sentence, Judge Richard Matheson QC told Babu: "You are, in my opinion, quite dangerous, always ready to resort to threats. And there have been many."Babu seized his victim as he walked home last March, bundling him into the back of a car and taking him to a squalid room where he was held for 26 hours. The court was told that the boy had to relieve himself on the floor of the "dingy, filthy" room as there was no toilet.At one stage Babu gave the crying child a phone so that he could plead: "Dad, can you hurry up with the money, please." He was eventually freed after one of the other kidnappers was arrested by armed police and revealed where the boy was being held.Although physically unharmed, the boy suffers from panic attacks and nightmares. His schooling has also been affected and, along with several other members of his family, he is having counselling.The other gang members, all from Southall, also received prison sentences yesterday after the jury found them guilty on all three counts. Gurnham Singh Dhanoa, 22, another illegal immigrant, got six years, and Amarjit Singh Dhariwar, 30, was jailed for seven years.The fourth defendant, Ayisha Choudhry, 20, wept as the judge told her that she would have to go to jail despite giving evidence for the crown and admitting the charges. She was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.After the case, Detective Chief Superintendent Sharon Kerr, the head of Scotland Yard's serious and organised crime group, said: "The Met treats kidnap offences with the utmost seriousness and anyone who commits this type of crime can always expect an extremely robust police response."
