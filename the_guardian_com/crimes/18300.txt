A gang dug a 40 ft tunnel through soil and rocks in an attempt to raid a cash machine, police said today.Workmen accidentally uncovered the tunnel which had been intricately constructed with scaffolding and wooden poles.It is thought the tunnel must have taken several weeks to build.The would-be raiders were only 15ft short of their target at a branch of Blockbuster Video at the Fallowfield shopping precinct in Manchester.The tunnel ran from a nearby railway embankment under part of a car park towards the ATM.Builders replacing electric cabling accidentally broke through part of the roof of the tunnel and contacted police.Officers found shovels and a wheelbarrow stashed inside the 5ft high tunnel, which had even been fitted with electric lights.The tunnel has now been filled in with concrete and police have launched an inquiry into the attempted burglary.A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: "Police in Fallowfield are investigating after an underground tunnel leading to a cash machine was discovered."At around 10.15am on Thursday August 23 2007, contractors discovered a tunnel at Fallowfield shopping precinct."Further investigation showed the tunnel was about 40ft long and 5ft high, running from a railway embankment towards a cash point at Blockbusters DVD rental store on Birchfields Road."Officers sealed off the area and are now investigating the attempted burglary."
