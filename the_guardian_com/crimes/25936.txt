Police are scouring a patchwork of copses and game bird estates for a former miner suspected of murdering a neighbour after g a "blazing row" about the 1984 miners' strike.Armed officers and a helicopter equipped with heat-seeking equipment have joined the hunt for Robert Boyer, 42, who vanished with an air rifle and warm clothing after a "vicious" attack on Keith Frogson, a 62-year-old veteran of the National Union of Mineworkers with a name for denouncing strike-breaking "scabs".Detectives are working on a theory that Mr Boyer, who is believed to have joined the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and worked through the dispute, saw old resentments revive after a TV programme marking the strike's 20th anniversary.Mr Frogson was found 18 days ago with lacerations to his head and upper body on the doorstep of his terrace house in Annesley Woodhouse, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire. A crossbow lay 30 metres away.Unconfirmed sightings of Mr Boyer have been reported in local woods that he is known to have roamed for years, shooting rabbits and pigeons.Nottinghamshire police yesterday warned people not to approach Mr Boyer, whose likely hiding place covers the same area being searched for Terry Rodgers, father of the murdered newlywed Chanel Taylor of Huthwaite, near Mansfield.The force's chief constable, Steve Green, asked people to stay calm, but he appealed to everyone in the area to look out for the two men.Detectives also want to question Mr Boyer about a late-night arson attack on Mr Frogson's house last week, after the murdered man's son and daughters made an appeal for help in finding his killer.Mr Frogson's daughter, Rachel, 33, and her partner were in the house when the blaze was started after midnight. She, her sister Mandy, 36, and brother Wayne, 34, are now being protected by armed officers.A squad of police, some with guns, broke down the door of Mr Boyer's house late on Wednesday after a tip-off that he could be hiding in a roof space running most of the length of the terrace of colliery-built cottages. Nothing was found in the house or one next door, which was also searched. Both properties back on to Mr Frogson's garden.Detective Chief Inspector Russ Foster, who is leading the murder and arson inquiries, said Mr Boyer's appearance had changed from the seven-year-old picture issued by police last week.He is now described as looking more gaunt and showing the effects of living rough. "When seen on Sunday, he looked dirty and unkempt, he had lost weight and had a thinner face," Det Ch Insp Foster said."He also had facial hair and was wearing a green woollen hat, dark biker jacket, pale blue jeans and dark shoes or boots."Mr Frogson, who was well known in the village, was killed within 15 minutes of leaving his local pub. Neighbours said he had been involved in a furious argument earlier in the evening.It has not been confirmed that the argument was with Mr Boyer, but police said yesterday that the two men were known to have had a serious falling-out several years ago. Officers are checking UDM membership records after suggestions that the miners' strike caused the bad blood.Neighbours of both men were appalled at the violence used in the attack, which saw one and probably more sharp instruments used to slash and cut the victim. The crossbow may also have been used, but results of a postmortem examination have not yet confirmed this.Criminal profilers who took part in last month's successful hunt for Mark Hobson, after two double killings in north Yorkshire, have joined the search.
