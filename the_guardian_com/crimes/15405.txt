Last month I wrote on Cif about a worrying incident in Loughton, Essex, in which Noor Ramjanally – a local Muslim figure involved in organising the Friday jumu'ah prayer sessions in the town's Murray Hall community centre – was the victim of an arson attack on his home. The attack had come very soon after Ramjanally had been sent a threatening letter from suspected far-right activists telling him to stop the prayer sessions and warning that "We know which school your kid goes to and which car you drive."Today the Guardian reports that earlier this week Ramjanally was abducted at knife-point by two men and driven to nearby Epping Forest where he was once again threatened and told to stop holding the Islamic prayer meetings.The local police have issued a statement saying: "The police are treating the incidents as 'hate crime' and a possible motivation would appear to be a link to the use of the Murray Hall, Loughton by the Muslim community for Friday prayers."Superintendent Simon Williams of Essex police said: "We are treating these offences with the utmost seriousness and are putting considerable resources into the investigation."While that investigation continues we will be working with the whole population of Loughton to ensure that all members of the community are free to practise their religion and beliefs safely and freely."The British National party – which has four councillors in the area – has been busy in recent weeks in stirring up anti-Muslim sentiment in Loughton. One of its flyers titled "No Mosques in Loughton!" warns that "In parts of neighbouring Redbridge and east London, the Islamification process is almost complete," and proclaims that "the BNP love Loughton and we'll do all in our power to prevent Islam creeping into our town."The leader of the BNP group on the local council, Pat Richardson, denies that the BNP were involved on the attacks on Ramjanally and has said that: "Firebombing is not a British method. A brick through the window is a British method."The events in Loughton are by no means isolated ones. Recent months have seen several arson attacks on mosques around the country including in Luton, Bishop's Stortford and Woolwich. There have been a number of explicitly anti-Muslim rallies held by groups calling themselves the English Defence League and Casuals United with more set to follow.In 2005 a parliamentary committee against antisemitism was established to "confront and defeat antisemitism in this country and beyond". At a time when anti-Muslim bigotry has become pervasive and is now translating into actual hate crimes, it is surely crucial that a similar committee against Islamophobia is also set up to monitor and help combat anti-Muslim prejudice and discrimination.One of the PCAA's recommendations was that the Home Office should require police forces nationwide to properly record antisemitic incidents so that an accurate picture could be formed of the true extent of the problem. It must now be time that this requirement was broadened to ensure that religious hate crimes against people of all faiths are properly recorded and categorised across the country.
