Police in Glasgow have launched two separate murder inquiries after the violent deaths of two women within 24 hours. Almost 200 officers are involved in the search for the killers, a senior detective told a news conference yesterday.The body of businesswoman Moira Jones, 40, was discovered in the city's upmarket Queen's Park on Thursday morning near her Â£250,000 apartment. The next morning, trainee pizza restaurant manager Eleni Pachou, 25, was found stabbed to death in the kitchen of her West End restaurant.Detective superintendent Ruaraidh Nicolson, of Strathclyde police, said 198 officers were working on the cases. "These are two unacceptable crimes and we need to find the persons responsible as soon as we can," he said. There is no connection between the inquiries. He said police wanted to speak to friends, relatives, colleagues and neighbours. House-to-house inquiries are being carried out in the two areas of the city where the women were found dead. Extra officers are patrolling to provide reassurance to the communities, police said. The partly-clothed body of Jones was found by a ranger at Queen's Park. She was originally from England, but moved to Glasgow five years ago. She was involved in a successful campaign to close down a nearby hostel for people with addiction problems, which had been linked to 100 crimes in the area.Pachou, who was originally from Greece, met a "horrific" death, police said. Her body was found at her workplace, Di Maggio's restaurant, by a cleaner.
