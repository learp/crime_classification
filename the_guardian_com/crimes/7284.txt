The home secretary, David Blunkett, yesterday set himself on a collision course with Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, over new sentencing guidelines that could allow murderers up to a third off their prison terms in return for pleading guilty.Responding to draft guidelines issued last September by the independent sentencing guidelines council, chaired by Lord Woolf, Mr Blunkett said he was determined that convicted murderers should "receive a punishment that reflects the unique nature and seriousness of the crime". He said he respected the independence of the council, which had suggested that murder should be treated in the same way as other crimes, with a formal system of discounts depending on how early the guilty plea was tendered. But while he "broadly welcomed" the proposals for other crimes, he agreed with the home affairs select committee, which last week said in its report on the guidelines that murder should be treated differently. Murderers are all given life sentences, but the guidelines tell courts how to decide on the tariff: the minimum term the prisoner must serve before applying for parole. In the past, few defendants have pleaded guilty to murder, but the proposals could change that. Mr Blunkett said guilty pleas should reduce time in prison for murderers only if the plea had "particular merit." An example was where a murderer admitted a killing which was previously unknown, or where there was no evidence to implicate the killer. Even then, there should be a cap on the size of the discount, he said. Although the council must consult the home affairs select committee and the home secretary, it need not take their advice. It said it would meet next Friday, and hoped to finalise the guidelines then.
