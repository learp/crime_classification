Duwayne Ashley Philpott, 13Died in Birmingham children's hospital two days after the fire. Duwayne was described during the order of service at the children's funeral as a "charming and caring ladies' man", on the verge of turning into a young man. As the eldest sibling, Duwayne took it upon himself to be protector of his younger siblings, becoming more independent and understanding of them. He loved to spend time with the family pet, Crackle, an African grey parrot.In his spare time he enjoyed music and had a talent for the violin. He enjoyed sport, especially football, and held a season ticket for his local club Derby County, where he loved to cheer on the mighty Rams. Dr Christopher Reynolds, headteacher at St Benedict's Catholic school, where Duwayne was a pupil, described the young boy as "modest, hard-working and always looking to improve his skills".Jade Louise Philpott, 10She was also well-regarded at school, described during the order of service as a "very intelligent" individual who was not only a "beautiful princess" but also a "mother hen" to her younger brothers.

John was said to have wanted to pursue a career as a soldier in the army when he was older.Jack Elvis Aaron Philpott, eightDescribed in a tribute as a typical "blue-eyed boy", "bashful and shy", much like his older brother Duwayne.
