A police officer received a summons yesterday in connection with the deaths of two boys who drowned in a swimming pool at a north London police college.PC Danny Phillips, 42, an employee of Scotland Yard's human resources directorate, was served a summons by City of London magistrates, on two counts of manslaughter and another charge of contravening the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act. Gameli Akuklu, 14, and William Kadama, 15, drowned in the pool at the Metropolitan police training centre in Hendon, in July 2002. The teenagers were with 35 other youngsters and six youth workers enjoying a summer activity scheme supervised by the police and Barnet council. The police lifeguard had been allegedly treating another boy who had gashed his knee when Gameli and William were seen lying at the bottom of the pool. Yesterday, the Crown Prosecution Service recommended no further action be taken against eight others - a Met police sergeant, two police staff, and five people not connected with the police. The Met's directorate of professional standards held an inquiry into the events at the time, which was overseen by the Police Complaints Authority. Responsibility then transferred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission when it took over the PCA's role last April.  Rosie Cowan
