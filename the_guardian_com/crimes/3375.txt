The attorney general last night launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding a judge's decision to free a senior police officer accused of murdering his wife.Garry Weddell, 47, is thought to have shot himself in a field near a gun club on Saturday morning after killing his mother-in-law, Traute Maxfield, who had been due to give evidence at his trial later this year.Judge John Bevan, who granted Weddell bail at a court in Ipswich in September, said yesterday that he had done nothing wrong but admitted he could not recall why he had granted bail."I hope there will be transcripts of the two bail applications," he told reporters outside his north London home. "These would explain things. I can't remember the precise details so it would be wholly inappropriate to comment at this time."Last night calls for a full-scale inquiry into the judge's decision intensified.The Tory justice spokesman, Nick Herbert, said: "This case raises very serious questions and the public will find it extraordinary that anybody on a murder charge should be given bail. It is very unusual and there should be a full inquiry into why it happened."Mike Penning, Conservative MP for Hemel Hempstead, said he had written to the attorney general, Lady Scotland, urging her to take action."What the public are asking quite rightly is what on earth happened here? It appears that this whole tragedy could have been avoided if this man had not been given bail."The attorney general's office said Scotland had requested the case notes relating to the bail decision, adding that a thorough investigation was under way. The Ministry of Justice said it would review its guidance to judges after the inquests into the two deaths had been completed.The decision to grant Weddell bail was taken after his brother Geoffrey, a London-based barrister who specialises in police law, offered surety of Â£200,000 and said Weddell would live with him at his home in Surrey. According to reports the defence team argued that this, combined with Weddell's cooperation with the police and fears for his safety in prison, meant bail should be considered - even though there was evidence he had planned to harm himself while in custody.Yesterday the judicial communications office said Bevan would also have had psychiatric reports on Weddell which, according to one leading QC, must have concluded he did not pose a risk.However, a few months after he was granted bail Weddell appears to have driven to his mother-in-law's house in the small village of Gustard Wood, Hertfordshire, and shot her with an illegally held shotgun. He then went to the Broomhills Shooting Club in Markyate where he turned the gun on himself.Yesterday one of Traute Maxfield's neighbours said the 70-year-old had been concerned about her son-in-law.Suzanne Locks, 72, said yesterday: "She was very worried about the whole situation. She feared that her son-in-law would be let off when the case came up in May."Locks said her friend was "bitterly disappointed" when he was released on bail. "She was absolutely convinced he was quite capable of murdering her daughter," she said.Weddell, a former soldier who had risen to the rank of inspector with the Metropolitan police, was accused of murdering his wife, Sandra, at their home in Dunstable last January. According to evidence given at a pre-trial hearing, he found out that she had met someone else the previous Christmas and that she wanted a divorce.Prosecutor Sarah Browne said Weddell was devastated and had planned her murder to look like a suicide, apparently typing her "suicide note" on the computer in rubber gloves to ensure he left no evidence.Mrs Weddell, who worked as a nurse, was last seen alive on January 30. Her body was found the following day in the couple's garage, with a cable tie round her neck and a suicide note nearby.At first police believed the 44-year-old had committed suicide but detectives were unhappy with the circumstances surrounding her death "given the unusual and bizarre means" used. There was also concern about the suicide note, which detectives thought was a forgery.Checks with police forces around the UK revealed only three previous deaths involving cable ties - each one had been a murder.On June 26 detectives arrested Weddell and charged him with murder.Browne said: "It was quite apparent the relationship was going through a difficult phase - in fact Mr Weddell had discovered at Christmas his wife had been having an affair and he stated she had been behaving irrationally."Browne told the court there were signs Mrs Weddell had been involved in a scuffle and that the suicide note had been written on the computer when her husband was the only one in the house.CareerJudge John Bevan QC was appointed a circuit judge in 2004 after a successful career as a prosecuting counsel, including a spell on the panel of senior prosecutors at the Old Bailey. Although he has been on the bench a comparatively short time, he has long experience of the criminal courts and has prosecuted in many murder cases, including the trial of Learco Chindamo for killing the headteacher Philip Lawrence.Bevan, who lives in Hampstead, north London, was educated at Radley College and Magdalene College, Cambridge, and was called to the bar in 1970. Now the senior judge at Luton crown court, he presides over trials for crimes such as murder, rape and the supply of drugs.In 2005 at St Albans crown court, he gave 10 life sentences to a serial rapist, Petros Anthia.A QC who appeared against him at the bar said he was a "highly successful silk" who was "a bit imperious and full of himself" as a prosecutor. Another silk who has defended clients prosecuted by Bevan said he was regarded while at the bar as "quite a hard prosecutor" who as a judge "would be unlikely to let people off willy nilly". He added: "I wouldn't have thought he was particularly way out in any direction."
