A man has been jailed for life and another for nine years for beating a gay man to death in a "callous and brutal" attack in a city centre park.James Kerr, a catering worker, died in hospital after being repeatedly punched and kicked in the face and head by three people in April. They had hunted him down and attacked him for allegedly "trying it on" with one of the gang.After leaving Kerr, 51, dying in a pool of blood in South Inch park in central Perth, the group went to a party nearby, where they boasted about the attack.One of the gang, a 15-year-old who had claimed Kerr had assaulted him, told one partygoer: "There's a poof tried it on with me and I hit him."As he left the scene of the attack, the teenager was heard remarking: "I hate gays and poofters."After leaving the party two hours later, the three walked past Kerr, who was lying barely alive where they had left him, but did nothing to help.Yesterday, the judge, Lord Macphail, said all three had taken part in an unwarranted and cold-blooded homophobic attack on Kerr."He had major head injuries, and the photographs of his body are horrifying," the judge said. "This was a killing of a callous and brutal character, which appears to have been marked by a homophobic element."The trial had heard that the 15-year-old claimed to have met Kerr and another man in the park at around 2.30am, as he was taking a short cut home. After they asked him for a cigarette, Kerr's companion allegedly hit him.Witnesses heard the youth shout at them: "If I ever see you again, I'm going to kick your fucking head in."The teenager then admitted calling one of the accused, Martin Soutar, on his mobile phone, who then arrived at the park with another friend, David Meehan. The three then began searching for Kerr.As all three youths looked straight ahead at the high court in Edinburgh, the judge said the most violent assailant, Meehan, 19, had launched a "savage and sustained attack upon a defenceless man who had done you no harm".His assault was so vicious and sustained that Kerr died without recovering consciousness. Meehan later told a social worker he believed Kerr was a paedophile.The judge sentenced Meehan, of Perth, to life imprisonment for murder, with an order that he spend at least 16 years in jail. Two years had been deducted because Meehan had pleaded guilty but the judge said this did not guarantee he would be automatically released on licence - Scotland's version of parole - within 16 years.Soutar, 21, also of Perth, was jailed for nine years on a reduced charge of culpable homicide, an offence similar to manslaughter, after he confessed to punching Kerr to the ground, and repeatedly kicking him. He then went through the council worker's pockets, stealing his keys and cigarette lighter, which he threw into a nearby pond.The judge said that while Soutar did not have the mental age needed to face a murder charge, he had five previous convictions, including one for assault. As a result, he would be also put on licence for a further three years after his release, putting him at risk of immediate reimprisonment if he committed a further offence.The 15-year-old, who is too young to be named, is to be sentenced today after also pleading guilty to assaulting Kerr.The Scottish parliament is to introduce new "hate crime" legislation bringing Scottish courts into line with those of England and Wales by allowing them to increase a sentence to take overt prejudice into account, particularly over disability and sexuality.Patrick Harvie, the Green MSP proposing the legislation, said: "This kind of savage murder is quite rightly always going to attract a huge sentence."If this had been committed in England or Wales, then the court would have the option of increasing the sentence to reflect that."
