The only police officer to face a disciplinary hearing over the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation was yesterday found guilty of mishandling two minor elements of the much-criticised inquiry.Detective Inspector Ben Bullock - who is retiring at the end of the month due to ill health - is unlikely to receive more than a reprimand when he learns of his punishment on July 22. Mr Bullock was said to be relieved but Stephen's mother, Doreen Lawrence, was infuriated, describing the disciplinary process as a "whitewash". She said: "We should have known nothing was going to come of this. The police were investigating the police. The questions asked of the witnesses were never intensive enough to get to the truth." Yesterday's ruling effectively ended official scrutiny of the botched investigation six years ago. Despite the furore, Mr Bullock was the only serving detective who faced charges - four other senior officers who were potentially culpable retired before any action could be taken against them.
