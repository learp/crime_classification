Judges in rape trials can explain that the trauma of an attack can cause "shame and guilt" which deters victims from going to the police immediately, the court of appeal ruled yesterday. A delay in making a rape allegation is one of the factors most frequently relied on by defendants to try to undermine victims' credibility.The ruling was welcomed by campaigners and Vera Baird, the solicitor general, who said it "busted a rape myth" and was likely to make trials fairer. The judgment, which suggested a basic direction judges should give jurors when the issue of delay is raised, arose from an unsuccessful appeal by a man convicted of six rapes.John Doody's lawyers had argued that the trial judge in his case, having explained in his summing up why a woman may delay making a rape complaint, should have told the jury at Wolverhampton crown court that some women fabricated rape allegations for their own purposes.The appeal court said: "The judge is entitled to make comments as to the way evidence is to be approached, particularly in areas where there is a danger of a jury coming to an unjustified conclusion without an appropriate warning ... "We think that cases where a defendant raises the issue of delay as undermining the credibility of a complainant fall into [this] category ... the fact that the trauma of rape can cause feelings of shame and guilt which might inhibit a woman from making a complaint about rape is sufficiently well known to justify a comment to that effect.""This is an important advance," said Baird, who argued the crown's case at the appeal. "It is a rape myth that a victim of sexual assault will always scream for help as soon as she is able, and if she does not she must have made the whole thing up."Jurors who are new to these issues can be - and frequently are - brought to what the court of appeal calls 'an unjustified conclusion' by this. The court has taken the opportunity to tackle this myth, on the basis that judges are better aware from their court experience that many reasons, including trauma, fear and shame, may make a victim unable to complain for some time."Only 6.1% of rapes reported to the police, and 34% of all cases prosecuted, result in a conviction.The court said the judge's comment to jurors should be tailored to individual cases, and suggested as a template: "You may think that some people may complain immediately to the first person they see, whilst others may feel shame and shock and not complain for some time. A late complaint does not necessarily mean it is a false complaint."Sharon Smee, justice policy officer for the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for greater justice for rape victims, said: "This is a very important step forward in helping to combat the prevalent myths that operate throughout society and are then transported into the courtroom."
