Two Thai fishermen sentenced to death for the rape and murder of the British backpacker Katherine Horton are appealing for the sentences to be reduced.Bualoi Posit, 23, and 24-year-old Wichai Somkhaoyai face lethal injection for killing Ms Horton, who disappeared while holidaying in Koh Samui with her friend Ruth Adams on New Year's Day. Her body was later found floating in the sea.Bualoi and Wichai told a Thai court they should be given credit for their co-operation with police and their guilty pleas despite a lack of witnesses.Their lawyer, Phrompachara Namuang, said the appeal - automatic under Thai law - had been submitted on the grounds that the death penalty was "too harsh".DNA tests had linked the two to the attack but there were no witnesses to the crime, he said."The defendants were fully co-operative [with authorities], which greatly helped to expedite the judicial process," he added. "They should be given leniency for this."A Royal Thai police spokesman said the judge had also been asked to consider Ms Horton's family's views on the death penalty.Family members have insisted they have never publicly expressed an opinion on the sentences, and said they did not want to be involved in the criminal and political processes of another country.Bualoi and Wichai were found guilty on January 18 of murdering Ms Horton, a 21-year-old student. She disappeared as she walked along a beach while speaking to her mother in Cardiff on her mobile phone.Bualoi told police he had grabbed Ms Horton's arms, while Wichai admitted repeatedly hitting her on the head with a stick before the pair raped her and threw her body into the sea. The case was fast-tracked through the court system, and eight prosecution witnesses - but no defence witnesses - were heard.Thai courts usually reduce such sentences to life imprisonment or less in cases in which defendants plead guilty.However, the Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, made an unusual public appeal for the killers to receive the "hardest punishment" possible, saying the killing had hurt the country's image and could damage its tourism industry.The appeal, which usually takes around a year, could take less than a month to complete, Thai police said.No death sentence has been carried out in Thailand since 2003, although more than 1,000 people are on death row, according to Amnesty International.
