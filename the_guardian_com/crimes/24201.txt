Women and children are being sent to prison more readily and for longer than any period in recent history. Prisons recommended years ago for decommissioning still "function" at the heart of the prison estate. Many prisoners spend long hours locked in isolation, enduring regimes lacking in constructive, confidence-building activity. Yet the one independent, regular check on what goes on behind locked doors - the Prisons Inspectorate - is under threat (Leaders, July 10).Two years ago I co-authored a report commissioned by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission on the imprisonment of women and girls. Our extensive research was an indictment of the appalling circumstances in which women and girls were incarcerated. Those who self-harmed were routinely locked, 23 hours a day, in solitary confinement in the punishment block, with no mattress, no toilet or underwear. Mental health care was dire, counselling non- existent, often resulting in transfer to the hospital in the male prison; there to suffer consistent verbal abuse. Mothers struggled to maintain meaningful contact with their children. There was no strategy or policies for women's imprisonment and no leadership or direction. Our report made over 40 recommendations.A highly critical Prisons Inspectorate report had been key to the Human Rights Commission's decision to commission our research. We found that the prison management had not only failed to address the inspectorate's recommendations, but had allowed serious deterioration in the regime. At best this revealed institutional complacency in the face of independent investigation. Subsequent inspections of Northern Ireland's two adult male jails have revealed systemic deficiencies. As chief inspectors, David Ramsbotham and Ann Owers have led inspection teams that have built and sustained immense integrity and respect, especially among prisoners. This is a time for strengthening, not weakening, their powers. Professor Phil ScratonQueen's University, Belfast
