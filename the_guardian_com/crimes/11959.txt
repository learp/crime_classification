A 15-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of murder after an 18-year-old mother was stabbed following a late night fracas on a street in Wallsend, near Newcastle, on Thursday. Samantha Madgin is believed to have become embroiled in a row between two groups of people around midnight and died later from knife wounds.A man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s were already being questioned, also on suspicion of murder, and more suspects are wanted by Northumbria police.Chief Superintendent Steve Storey, commander of the North Tyneside area, said that knife crime was rare in the area. "I'd like to remind people we do not have the same level of problems with gang culture as other parts of the country and the majority of incidents involving knives are when the victim and offender are known to each other in some way - a random attack by a stranger is rare," he said.A neighbour living 100 metres from the scenes said he was a friend of the family. He said: "She seemed to be a loving mother. To have something like this on our doorstep is unreal. It is not that kind of area, it is a very close-knit community."Another resident, Mark Armstrong, 32, told the Evening Chronicle: "I heard shouting and swearing in the back lane. I heard someone shout the words 'knife' and 'stabbing' and minutes later someone said 'put it down'."Beth Cronin, an 18-year-old student at Newcastle University, told the paper: "There was a young blonde girl hanging out of an upstairs window arguing with two lads. We went back to bed and the shouting and arguing continued for another half an hour. I heard three male voices shouting. The shouting stopped and we heard a car screech away."
