A 44-year-old policeman was stabbed to death in Birmingham yesterday as he tried to carry out an arrest.Detective Constable Michael Swindells, who was married with an 18-year-old daughter, was knifed in the stomach as he attempted to arrest a man on the towpath of the Birmingham and Fazeley canal in the Nechells area of the city. Colleagues and paramedics administered first aid at the scene but he was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Police could not confirm whether he had been wearing protective body armour when he was attacked. DC Swindells had been a officer with the West Midlands force for 14 years, latterly based at Queens Road station in Aston. Police are questioning a 48-year-old man. Paul Scott-Lee, a West Midlands chief constable, paid tribute to the dead man as he explained what happened. "As officers went to apprehend a person suspected of having a knife, one officer was stabbed in the abdomen. "He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. "This is a tragic day, which-ever way you look at it. I have been to see the widow of a very brave officer. She and her daughter are coming to terms with the death of a loved one and we will come to terms with the death of a colleague. "This officer did the right thing but the end was tragic. We will work tirelessly to put the offender before the courts. We will also work to support his family and the colleagues who have lost a friend." DC Swindells is the 57th police officer to be killed on duty in mainland Britain since 1980.
