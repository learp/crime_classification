It is billed as Britain's first purpose-built mixed gender prison of modern times, with equal provision for both sexes. But when details of HMP Peterborough were released yesterday it became clear that equality has yet to reach the prison kitchen.Prison chiefs say that all parts of the 840-prisoner institution will be duplicated to provide male and female areas. Except one area. There will be only one kitchen, and in it only women will do the cooking. Mike Conway, the director, of Peterborough prison, which is run by a private security company, United Kingdom Detention Services, insists that the decision has nothing to do with old-fashioned chauvinism but stems from an official risk assessment of the different dangers of having men and women doing the cooking."Whenever we have prisoners operating in kitchens and there is a risk of adulterating food, we carry out a risk assessment," said Mr Conway. "It was far more likely that males would adulterate food going to the female side than vice versa. There wasn't any paternalistic reason why females were going into the kitchen." The prison, which will take its first inmates this month, is designed to hold 480 male and 360 female prisoners and is the first purpose-built prison to house men and women. A UKDS spokesman said that nearly all the services and facilities in the prison are duplicated to ensure total separation of the sexes at all times. The only exception is the kitchen, which is used to feed the 400-strong staff, as well as the prisoners. Peterborough is the 11th private prison to be opened in England and Wales and will serve courts in the East Midlands and East Anglia. The Home Office hopes that its pioneering dual purpose role will prove a blueprint for the future with new prisons able to accommodate a mixture of adult and young offenders, as well as men and women.
