Jeremy Bamber, jailed for life in 1986 for the murders of five members of his family, today had his latest appeal rejected.The court of appeal judges, who reviewed his case recently during a 12-day hearing, ruled that his convictions were "safe". Lord Justice Kay, reading a summary of the ruling in the packed courtroom, said: "We have concluded that there was no conduct on the part of the police or the prosecution which would have adversely affected the jury's verdict."Bamber, 41, who was not present in the courtroom as Mr Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques gave their decision, had been told of the ruling in advance and broke the news on his website, jeremybamber.com, yesterday. A message on the site, signed "Jeremy", stated: "Latest News: It is with regret that I have to inform you that my recent appeal has been denied." Lord Justice Kay said that for a number of reasons the court had concluded "that the jury's verdicts were safe". He pointed out that it was not the function of the court to decide whether or not the appellant committed the murders. The judge said: "We do not doubt the safety of the verdicts and we have recorded in our judgment the fact that the more we examined the detail of the case, the more likely we thought it to be that the jury were right, although as explained we can never go further than that."Bamber, now 41, was convicted for the murder of his mother, father, sister and her twin six-year-old sons. He has continued to protest his innocence after being convicted at Chelmsford crown court in 1986. His website states: "I was wrongly convicted of murdering five members of my family and I've been in jail for nearly 16 years."I have protested my innocence through all the usual channels and tried hard to find a successful path to the appeal courts."The court of appeal has turned my appeal down, I therefore feel it important that the evidence is made available to the public so that they can make up their own minds on this matter."Contained in the following pages is proof of my innocence, backed up by documentation that was not available for me to use at my original trial."I am innocent and the following facts speak for themselves."The website contains pages of evidence from the appeal. The initial message ends: "Stay in touch, Jeremy".His case was referred back to the court of appeal by the criminal cases review commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice.Bamber's mother June, 61, and his nephews Nicholas and Daniel were shot dead in their beds at White House Farm in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, in the early hours of August 7, 1985.His father Nevill, 61, was found slumped downstairs, while his sister Sheila Caffell, 27, a model nicknamed "Bambi", was found by her parents' bed.Bamber had alerted police in the early hours of August 7 saying that his father had telephoned him to say his sister had gone crazy with a gun.Detectives initially suspected that Sheila, who had not been taking her medication for schizophrenia, had murdered her parents and sons before turning the gun on herself.But three days after the shootings, a cousin of Bamber's discovered a silencer in a cupboard at the farm, apparently with Sheila's blood on it, casting doubt on the theory.Four weeks later Bamber's then girlfriend Julie Mugford went to police and claimed he had often bragged to her that he was going to kill his parents.Bamber, who stood to inherit almost Â£500,000 from his parents' estate, was arrested when he returned from a holiday in France.But he claims the prosecution case against him was built on a "series of deceits" by police.Defence counsel, Michael Turner QC, told the judges during the hearing that there had been "many compelling points" in his favour at trial supporting his case that he did not "assassinate" his entire adoptive family, but that they were killed by his sister before she committed suicide.It was also argued that evidence was "deliberately withheld so as to unfairly bolster the prosecution's case and secure a conviction".But Victor Temple QC, opposing the appeal, told the judges that the Crown's principal submission was "that there has been no evidence placed before your lordships to enable this court to doubt the safety of these convictions".Mr Temple told the judges: "At the end of the day nought plus nought equals nought and if that is right ... these convictions for murder remain safe and we would invite you to uphold these convictions." Bamber's first appeal attempt was rejected in 1989.
