The government's anti-yob tsar today denied that an initiative to provide 40 so-called "Respect" areas with extra help to deal with antisocial behaviour was a gimmick.The areas of England and Wales were selected on the basis of indexes such as deprivation, high levels of antisocial behaviour, truancy and school exclusion levels.Shadow minister for police reform Nick Herbert said communities suffering from antisocial behaviour did not want gimmicks such as "Respect Handbooks" but rather needed police officers on the streets to help tackle the problem.He said the government had failed to evaluate the success of its antisocial behaviour measures and had cut 4,000 promised police community support officers from the forces in the 40 chosen areas.But the government's "respect tsar", Louise Casey, said: "This is no gimmick. This is a very serious business."It's about getting parents to be more in control in their own homes and keeping up the unrelenting drive to tackle antisocial behaviour and that is happening across the country."Ms Casey told BBC Breakfast that the 40 areas would point the rest of the country "in the right direction" when it came to tackling antisocial behaviour."We want the 40 areas to show how we can take the programme forward and point people in the right direction as well as keeping up the unrelenting drive to tackle antisocial behaviour," she said."These are the areas that are doing parenting classes and family projects that tackle the really, really difficult people in our communities."The Home Office said the local authorities will be expected to use the full range of schemes and powers available to them including:  路 Family intervention projects to tackle "neighbours from hell";  路 More parenting classes for parents struggling with troublesome children;  路 Face the people sessions where the police, local authorities and others can be accountable to their local public;  路 Asbos and other measures designed to tackle antisocial behaviour.The prime minister, Tony Blair, is marking the announcement by attending a "face the people" session in Brighton, one of the cities to benefit.The meetings are designed to allow residents to find out from representatives of the local crime and disorder partnership what actions are planned. He said: "The key to tackling antisocial behaviour successfully lies in local communities."Central government can provide the powers and the resources, as we are, but it is the police, local authorities and local people who have to use them effectively to deliver results."Communities know where the problems are - and they now know too how best to use new powers to tackle them."We have seen real progress with communities across the country making full use of the powers we have put in place with councils, police, courts and local people working in partnership to make neighbourhoods safer and better places to live."We want to extend this good practice across the country and encourage those championing the fight against antisocial behaviour to build on their good work."The home secretary, John Reid, who is visiting Middlesbrough today, said: "A great deal of action is being taken across the country to tackle the scourge of antisocial behaviour and I am delighted that these 40 local authorities have committed to driving forward the Respect programme."He added: "Respect is a national programme and we expect all areas to play their part."We have had many successes but we recognise we have a long way to go to drive this problem from our towns and cities."There are no more excuses for local services not to take action to create stronger, safer communities."Government figures published today show significant increases in the powers being used by local councils and police to crack down on anti-social behaviour.There has been a 90% increase in acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs), with more than 18,000 used over the last three years, and 4,000 parenting contracts in the same period - an increase of nearly 250%.The government is also publishing a comprehensive "Respect Handbook" which reinforces the warning that there are no more excuses for local services not to take action.The Home Office said the 40 respect areas were not the worst areas for antisocial behaviour but were chosen from a longer list of areas with significant challenges, where more action is needed.Mr Herbert said: "The government has cut 4,000 promised police community support officers from the forces covering these so-called 'respect areas'."Communities don't want gimmicks like 'Respect Handbooks' - they want police officers on their streets to take real action against antisocial behaviour."Today's announcement conspicuously omits any reference to Asbos - hardly surprising when over half are breached and teenagers now treat them as a badge of honour."And there's no evidence of the success of increasing the number of acceptable behaviour and parenting contracts, since the Home Office has failed to evaluate the measures."The 40 respect areas are:  Birmingham City Council Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council Blackpool Council Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council Bournemouth Borough Council Brighton and Hove City Council Bristol City Council Burnley Borough Council City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council City of Wakefield Metropolitan District Council Coventry City Council Derby City Council Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council  Exeter City Council  Gloucester City Council  Harlow District Council  Hastings Borough Council  Ipswich Borough Council  Kingston upon Hull City Council  Kirklees Metropolitan Council  Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council  Leeds City Council  Leicester City Council  Liverpool City Council  Manchester City Council  Middlesbrough Council  Newcastle City Council  Norwich City Council  Nottingham City Council  Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council  Plymouth City Council  Portsmouth City Council  Salford City Council  Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council  Sheffield City Council  South Tyneside Council  Southampton City Council  Southend on Sea Borough Council  Sunderland City Council  Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council
