People over 60 who are burgled are more likely to die or be moved into residential care, according to unpublished Home Office research.The leaked study, conducted in sheltered accommodation in Flintshire, north Wales, found that two years after a burglary older victims were more than twice as likely to have died or moved into residential accommodation as neighbours who had not been burgled. The victims had an average age of 81 and of the original group of 56, 11 had died within 2 years of the break-in and nine moved to residential care. Among 53 neighbours who had not been burgled, only six had died and two had gone into residential care. Families and wardens also reported that the health of those burgled had deteriorated faster than expected and some were "very twitchy". Gordon Lishman, director-general of Age Concern, said the study was deeply worrying: "It highlights the devastating impact that crime has on older people. Crime can destroy their life and sentences many to life inside four walls."
