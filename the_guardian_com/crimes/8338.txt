Four counter-terrorism detectives have been arrested for allegedly abusing corporate credit cards to claim up to £120,000 in fraudulent expenses while gathering intelligence after the 7/7 bombings.Another four have been questioned about claiming rent on a property in Leeds, north Yorkshire. The moves come after a two-year investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Police Complaints Commission into alleged abuse of American Express cards by officers.A source said: "The allegations are that officers were not just taking a few pounds, but that it was organised."Detectives were living in Leeds for two years… Cash for rent was disappearing at quite a rate," he said.The arrested detectives, who are mostly from London, were part of a team of more than 150 officers examining the background of the bombers.The Metropolitan Police Authority first raised suspicions of possible fraud after it was discovered a house rented for police officers was being sub-let.The IPCC said the officers were arrested in connection with offences including conspiracy to defraud, theft and false accounting.
