An MP's wife was caught on CCTV as she sneaked into the home of her husband's mistress to steal a kitten, a jury has been told.Birmingham crown court heard that Christine Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming and his lover, Emily Cox, were involved in a "love triangle" at the time of the alleged offence last September.Jason Pegg, prosecuting, told jurors that the defendant spent three minutes inside Cox's home before emerging with the kitten under her arm.Explaining that the Liberal Democrat MP divided his time between his marital home in Moseley, Birmingham, and the nearby residence of Cox, Pegg said: "This is, for want of a better word, a love triangle â€“ a love triangle that both women are fully aware of."Christine Hemming, who denies burglary, listened from the dock as Pegg said: "This case is all about the defendant going to Emily Cox's home one evening in September of last year before entering that home and stealing a kitten known as Beauty."At that house there are CCTV cameras, which have been installed around the house, giving coverage of the gardens."The court heard that Cox was out at a meeting in the early evening of 29 September and returned home to find one of her two cats was missing.Cox searched the local area for the kitten during the next few days, and then watched the CCTV footage in the first week of October.Urging jurors to be dispassionate in their consideration of the "perhaps out of the ordinary" case, Pegg told them: "Beauty, the kitten, was never seen again by Emily. CCTV footage, members of the jury, showed exactly what had happened to the cat."The defendant had sneaked around the back garden, she had opened the back door, she had entered Emily's house and she remained in that house for three minutes or so."She then left the house through the same door which she had entered but, when she left the house, under her left arm was Beauty the kitten."The case continues.
