The tragic deaths of two teenage girls outside a New Year's party in Birmingham have focused attention once again on the menace of gun crime in Britain. The timing of the killings at the heart of the holiday season, the age of the innocent girls and the horrifying manner in which they were gunned down highlight poignantly the now-daily reality of armed violence in Britain.We have already been told that the Government looks favourably on police proposals to introduce a minimum sentence of five years for possession of a firearm. It is likely that restrictions will also be imposed on the import and sale of replica guns which can all too easily be adapted. Both measures should be supported by anyone concerned about the safety of Britain's streets, not least because they are backed by leading representatives of the communities most affected by the growth in gun violence. British levels of gun crime may be lower than in countries such as America, but the Birmingham tragedy will be repeated if weapons continue to be routinely carried as a fashion statement by a minority of macho young men in inner cities. However, tough new legislation will be useless if convictions do not follow. The Birmingham tragedy has been compounded by a police failure to find witnesses. An ever more vicious cycle of violence will not be broken unless the police can regain trust in those inner city communities where people are too terrified to talk. And once again it is a question of 'too little too late' from the Home Office. It is now two years since the Home Affairs Select Committee warned of a rise in gun-related crime and confirmed what the black community has been saying for years. It is depressing that it is has taken the death of two teenage girls for the Government finally to act.
