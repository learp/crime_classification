One in eight prisoners in England and Wales is a foreign national - an all-time record - according to a report published today.The Prison Reform Trust says the figure represents a threefold increase over the last 10 years. In some jails, foreign nationals now make up over 50% of the population, it adds. The figures are revealed in a report which concludes that such prisoners are not given the the attention and support they need, and in some cases are treated with disrespect, often experiencing racist behaviour from prison staff. The report, Going the Distance, suggests official figures may underestimate the number of foreign prisoners because there are 1,200 people in custody whose nationality is not known. The Verne prison, Dorset, and Morton Hall, a women's jail in Lincolnshire, are identified as those where foreign nationals make up over half of the population. In 16 prisons they account for a quarter or more, including all of the large prisons in London.
