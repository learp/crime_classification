Regardless of the judge's decision to refer newspapers to attorney general for their coverage of serial killer Levi Bellfield (see here), it is clear that the Daily Mirror pulled off a significant coup today.Its splash told how reporter David Collins played a key part in trapping Bellfield into admitting a key fact about his presence at the place where Milly Dowler vanished, I nailed Milly's killer Collins, in a tape-recorded phone call to Bellfield in Wakefield jail, got him to admit he was at the scene of Milly's disappearance. He previously had refused in interviews with police to have been driving a red Daewood car near the spot where Milly disappeared. Collins's information was therefore crucial to the case.He managed to make the call by spending months winning the trust of Bellfield's own family. It enabled him to phone the prison while at the home of Bellfield's brother.He wrote today: "After months of my own investigative work and the police case against him having stalled, this was my chance to help provide Milly's tormented family."In an editorial, the Mirror said:"Politicians criticise a free press when it publishes inconvenient truths, but nailing Bellfield is a pertinent reminder that an inquiring media, often needing to take risks, is a force for good in our society."It also pointed out that the police were "grateful... for the Mirror's crucial breakthrough" and "our reporter's painstaking research and determination."
