The jury will retire next week to consider its verdicts, the trial judge said yesterday.Mr Justice Moses said the court would be hearing closing speeches from the prosecution and defence at the start of next week. Once these were completed he would sum up the case. "You will be going out to consider your verdicts some time next week," said the judge. "We have made good progress and the case will be over before Christmas." He told the jurors they could have as long as they needed to consider their verdicts. The trial, which began on November 3, had been expected to last into the new year. Mr Justice Moses said the jury would not be required at court today as counsel were discussing legal issues.
