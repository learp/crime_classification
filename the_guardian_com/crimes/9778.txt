The crisis in jail overcrowding yesterday reached its worst point since 2002 as the number of inmates exceeded the Prison Service's official number of usable places .A total of 75,544 people were in jails across England and Wales yesterday morning, itself a record and 107 above the Prison Service's "usable operational capacity" of 75,437, the supposed maximum level.Penal reform groups accused the government of playing "musical cells" in moving inmates around the country in search of a bed. The Liberal Democrats said Labour had presided over a system that would have shamed the Victorians.In the last official weekly figures released last Friday there were just 26 spare places. On Monday the Prison Service was privately confident that the pressure would ease and the number of spare cells increase.But already this week the number has risen by 133, with the courts increasing inmate numbers by 200 a week on average.The Prison Service said it would not need to turn convicted offenders away or use police cells.The last time the government had to take that politically embarrassing step was in 2002. Then there were still 150 spare cells left when police cells housed people the Prison Service could not accommodate.Last month ministers cut the safety "buffer" of cells that are not filled from 2,000 to 1,700 as the crisis loomed.Yesterday the Prison Service conceded that the goalposts could be moved again and that the buffer may be cut on a daily basis.Places are being found by bussing inmates around the country to find suitable cells.It is believed some refurbishments are being postponed and the jail numbers are expected to rise as the week progresses, though it should dip for the Easter holidays.One Prison Service source admitted that education and other services aimed at rehabilitating offenders are suffering: "If resources are designed for 500 inmates, and now there are 700 in a prison, then obviously resources are stretched more thinly."Enver Solomon, of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "Governors are being put under intolerable pressure to squeeze prisoners into every available space by doubling up yet more inmates in cells designed for one and putting a hold on refurbishments."Prisoners are being shipped around the country in a game of musical cells to avoid the political embarrassment of having to use police cells. This is the worst form of crisis management."The prison population has grown by a quarter since Labour came to power. It stood at 60,131 in May 1997. theguardian.com/prisons
