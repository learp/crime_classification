A woman has been arrested after her three children were found home alone in West Yorkshire while she was in Afghanistan.Simten Sezgun, of Leeds, was arrested at Heathrow airport on Tuesday evening and taken back to West Yorkshire for questioning.A police spokesman said the 33-year-old was held "on suspicion of wilful neglect in relation to an incident in Burley on Saturday, August 30, in which three children were found at an address with no adult present".She was released on police bail pending further inquiries.The three children, aged 11, six and five, were found in their house last month after police were alerted by a neighbour.Police said the children were all "fit and well".Last month, a message on Sezgun's Facebook page said she was in Kabul "having a nice time".While she was in Afghanistan, Sezgun denied she left her children alone and told reporters an aunt and a friend were looking after them.She said she was not a bad mother and was visiting Kabul partly because she wanted to work there once she qualified as a teacher.
