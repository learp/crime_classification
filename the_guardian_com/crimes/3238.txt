Two high court judges ruled yesterday that a district judge was wrong not to grant police an anti-social behaviour order against a prostitute operating in a city's red light district.They ordered the district judge to think again. If he changes his mind and grants the order, the move could pave the way for police forces to make increasing use of the orders, more commonly imposed on teenage tearaways. Today Tony Blair and David Blunkett, the home secretary, will launch an anti-social behaviour plan as part of a wider government drive against low-level crime. In 2002 Lancashire's chief constable, Paul Stephenson, applied for an order against Lisa Marie Potter, 22, who was regularly seen soliciting in the Deepdale area of Preston. The application claimed she had acted in an anti-social manner "likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress". Deputy district judge Alan Lloyd Jones was told the problem of prostitutes at Deepdale dated from 1997. Used condoms and hypodermic syringes were often dumped in the area. But the judge refused to grant the order, saying there was no evidence that Ms Potter was a drug addict, or had personally been involved in any of the incidents reported to the police. Nor was there any evidence that her sex activities had been witnessed by the public, or that her behaviour had caused harassment, alarm or distress to others. Yesterday Lord Justice Auld, sitting with Mr Justice Goldring, ruled that the judge had been wrong to dismiss the application and ordered him to reconsider, saying that one of his conclusions was "perverse and unreasonable and therefore erroneous in law". Ms Potter is now in jail. She was caught supplying heroin in an undercover operation.
