A controversial multimillionaire oil trader and banker suspected by Britain of helping criminals to make billions of pounds in carousel fraud scams will appear in court today.John Deuss is due to appear in the Netherlands, where he is accused by Dutch prosecutors of money laundering and running a criminal organisation. Police were denying requests for further information over the weekend.Back in the limelight after years out of the public eye, Mr Deuss, 64, returned last Friday to his home country after 30 years spent living in Bermuda.He was arrested by Dutch police in connection with illegal activities at his First Curaçao International Bank, a spokeswoman for the Dutch financial prosecutor's office said, and he spent the weekend behind bars in the Netherlands.Mr Deuss will appear before an examining magistrate today as prosecutors seek more time to question him.The First Curaçao bank was closed down by the Dutch last month and is suspected by Dutch and British authorities of having run banking services which allowed criminals to siphon billions of pounds out of European treasuries via carousel fraud. The fraud involves acquisition of VAT-free goods, which are then sold on at VAT-inclusive prices, the tax never being paid to the authorities.Mr Deuss agreed to return voluntarily to the Netherlands for questioning, relinquishing his right to an extradition hearing. He arrived at Gatwick early on Friday before transferring to a flight to Amsterdam's Schipol airport, accompanied by two officials from the prosecutor's office.The Guardian revealed last month that every single one of 2,500 suspected carousel fraudsters in this country had accounts at the First Curaçao International Bank. The secretive offshore bank allegedly offered complete anonymity and lightning-fast transfers, allowing fraudsters to create instantaneous false paper trails of trades in goods such as mobile phones, allowing them to reclaim VAT from Revenue & Customs on transactions which did not exist.The UK revenue's VAT losses this year could run to between £5bn and £10bn, although there has been a sharp fall in fraud activity since First Curaçao was closed down.Recently, Mr Deuss told the Guardian that none of his companies, including his well-known Transworld Oil, had been involved in illegal activity. But an arrest warrant issued a fortnight ago by Dutch prosecutors said he was suspected of money laundering, handling stolen property and being in charge of a criminal organisation.Mr Deuss sprang to notoriety more than two decades ago when the Observer reported that Transworld Oil had been running oil to South Africa in violation of international sanctions against the apartheid regime.He has been involved in many controversial business deals over the past three decades. He refused to pay $100m he owed the Soviet government for oil he was exporting out of Russia, and reportedly he still carries an injury on his head, allegedly caused by an attempt in 1984 by Dutch anti-apartheid protesters to blow up his mansion in Berg en Dal, near Nijmegen in the east of the country.Mr Deuss's sister, Martina, was arrested by Dutch police in the Netherlands several weeks ago as part of the original swoop on the bank, which has a small nameplate operation running from the Berg en Dal villa.He is likely to put up a robust defence. His defence team includes the British lawyer Clare Montgomery, who represented the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in his pursuit of immunity from foreign courts in the late 1990s.
