The failed prosecutions of celebrities over allegations of historic sex offences were not prompted by a knee-jerk decision to overcompensate for mistakes made in relation to Jimmy Savile, the UK's chief prosecutor has said.Alison Saunders, the new director of public prosecutions (DPP), criticised those who had suggested that high-profile acquittals – such as of the Coronation Street actor Bill Roache and the DJ Dave Lee Travis – meant the cases should never have been brought to court."This argument fails to understand the fundamental basis of our criminal justice system, that the roles of the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and the jury are completely different – and so it is entirely legitimate for them to come to different conclusions," said Saunders in a speech to the annual conference of the St Mary's sexual assault referral centre in Manchester on Thursday.Saunders made the remarks after instructing prosecutors not to dismiss complaints about crimes allegedly committed decades ago just because of the lapse of time in reporting. The move was described by the CPS as a "shift of focus towards ensuring potential victims have their day in court".The new approach introduced by Saunders requires prosecutors to consider that "the impact over time might have become greater and led to adverse effects on the victim's physical or mental health and their circumstances in general. A prosecution, especially for a more serious non-recent offence may help the victim through the offender being brought to justice even if the courts are likely to only impose a nominal penalty. An admission or finding of guilt may help the victim to come to terms with the offence committed against them".Saunders conceded that the police and CPS had in the past "betrayed" victims of Savile and "many others who had not been listened to, believed, or given the chance to have a jury hear their case"."In the past, police and prosecutors have often usurped the role of the jury by not bringing cases to court unless a conviction was certain," she said. "This approach failed many victims and it is not something I want the CPS or police to return to," she said.The CPS had learned from those mistakes, she said. "There was no knee-jerk change to a position where we were more likely to prosecute – and we didn't – because someone was well-known or influential."We must be careful not to establish new myths that victims come forward only for financial or other motives. I believe that most victims and complainants have heart that they will finally be treated with the respect they deserve."
