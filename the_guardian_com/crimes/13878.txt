A mentally-ill man shot dead by police when he refused to drop a samurai sword was lawfully killed, an inquest jury ruled yesterday.Andrew Kernan, 37, was shot in the chest on a Liverpool street in July 2001. He had ignored repeated requests by armed Merseyside police officers to drop the sword and was making his way towards a busy pub when the shot was fired. A jury at Liverpool coroner's court returned a verdict of lawful killing after a nine-day hearing. The court heard that Mr Kernan, a former gardener, had suffered paranoid schizophrenia for more than 15 years. He lived with his mother, Marie Kernan, and had spent several periods in psychiatric units. During one of them he threatened staff with a kitchen knife and had to be CS-sprayed by police. Despite that incident his mother allowed him to keep a stash of weapons in his bedroom, including a Gurkha's kukri knife, a sword sheathed in a walking stick and a 3ft samurai sword. Mrs Kernan told the inquest she was not worried about her son keeping the weapons as he was a "loving, gentle man" who posed no risk to anyone but himself. Liverpool coroner Andre Rebello directed the jury to reach a conclusion of either lawful killing, if they believed reasonable force had been used, or an open verdict. It took them two hours to reach a unanimous decision on the former. Mr Rebello expressed his condolences to Mr Kernan's family, including his sister - a Metropolitan police officer - who attended the hearing. He also commended the bravery of the armed police officers and criticised the fact that it had taken so long for them to be exonerated.
