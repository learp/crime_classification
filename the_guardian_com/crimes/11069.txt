She also pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining one payment of her dead mother's state pension of £176.92 and a single payment of pension credit of £34.44.Jasmine, an artist, pleaded guilty to leaving the corpse of her grandmother unburied.In August 2010, police found Olive Maddock's remains in the house the three women shared in Wallasey after a neighbour raised concerns about her welfare. Her body was found slumped behind her bedroom door.Forensic examination did not provide an exact cause or date of death but it is thought she died of natural causes between two and six months before police found her.Both women, who no longer live together or at the Wallasey residence they shared with the deceased, were granted bail on condition of residence to addresses shown to the court.Judge Gerald Clifton said his decision to grant bail bail should not be interpreted as a signal their sentences would be non-custodial. Speaking to Jasmine Maddock, he warned: "You must expect the possibility of a custodial sentence." The pair will be sentenced on 1 July.
