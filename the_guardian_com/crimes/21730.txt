A Portuguese factory worker who slit his pregnant girlfriend's throat was today found guilty of her murder and jailed for life.Hugo Quintas slashed Hayley Richards from ear to ear with a craft knife at her flat in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, in June 2005 before escaping to Portugal.The 24-year-old denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of provocation. He claimed Ms Richards, a 23-year-old waitress, taunted him after confessing she had been unfaithful.But the jury of seven women and five men at Bristol crown court rejected that version of events and convicted Quintas of murder.The judge, Mr Justice Owen, imposed a life sentence and ordered Quintas to spend a minimum of 18 years in prison, including the 272 days he had already spent in custody."There are a number of aggravating features to this case. Firstly, your victim was particularly vulnerable and alone in that flat on that night," the judge said."Secondly, it is clear from the evidence that she must have suffered dreadfully before she died."During the trial, the court heard how Quintas killed his girlfriend, who was two months pregnant with his child, in a "prolonged, deliberate and fatal attack" on June 11.After slitting her throat, he left her to die in a pool of blood and returned to his home nearby. He caught a plane to Portugal later the same day.He later fled to Spain but was arrested and flown back to England for questioning.Quintas, who had moved to Britain in 2003, admitted killing Ms Richards. He originally claimed that she had lunged at him with a knife during an argument and that he stabbed her during the struggle.But days before the start of his trial, he changed his defence and said he had "lost it" after Ms Richards, his girlfriend of 10 months, smiled at him as she confessed she had slept with another man.Six days before Quintas killed Ms Richards, he had tried throttling her after she threw him out of her flat.She told officers she was "petrified" of her jealous and volatile boyfriend. But Wiltshire police did not arrest Quintas despite her warnings.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the force's handling of Ms Richards' complaint.
