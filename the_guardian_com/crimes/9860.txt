A 72-year-old woman has been injured in a targeted drive-by shooting by a gunman riding a motorbike in Liverpool.The woman was shot in the leg by the gunman in the doorway of her home.Merseyside police said the woman – who was in a stable condition – was shot by one of two men on a motorbike at about 6.10pm on Tuesday, before the pair rode away from the scene in Peckmill Green in the Netherley area of the city.Detectives from the Matrix serious organised crime unit were investigating the shooting. The motive was said to be unclear but the attack was believed to be targeted.DCI Mark Tivendale said: “We are keeping an open mind as to why this has happened and the investigation is in its early stages. Our priority is to establish who is responsible and to bring them to justice.“Criminals who choose to settle their disputes with a weapon do not care about the widespread fear they bring to their own communities. We cannot and will not stand by and let people like that rule the roost.“But to achieve safer streets we need the public to tell what they know about the criminals and I promise we will take robust action and put these people before the courts and into the prisons. If you know something, please come forward. Silence could result in someone being seriously injured, or killed in the future.”A cordon had been set up as forensic teams examined the scene and patrols had been stepped up, the force added.
