Penal reformers protested yesterday about a Prison Service decision to end the separate management of the 17 women's prisons in England and Wales from next April.The decision means the closure of the operational group that manages the record 4,461 women in prison. The director-general of the service, Phil Wheatley, has said the change is to improve women's access to regional resettlement services. But penal reformers fear it will downgrade women's priority. A Fawcett Society report yesterday said it was clear that integrating the management was "likely to further impoverish provision, which we already regard as weak".
