A mother killed herself at almost exactly the same time as her four-year-old daughter was found dead at the family home, police said yesterday.Counsellors were talking to Catherine Madden, 40, shortly before her death at Seven Sisters cliff at Birling Gap in East Sussex on Saturday afternoon.At almost the same time, police traced Madden's car, which had been abandoned at Birling Gap, to her home in Felpham, Bognor Regis, West Sussex, where they found the body of her daughter, Keira, in the bedroom."It was almost simultaneous that they were entering the property as she fell off the cliff," a Sussex police spokeswoman said.Detective Chief Inspector Nick Sloan, of Sussex police, said Mrs Madden had been going through a divorce from her husband, Steven, a self-employed computer expert who lives and works in Germany.He said Mr Madden would come back to the UK every three weeks for access visits to Keira and was "devastated" by what had happened. Police are not looking for anyone else in relation to Keira's death.A postmortem examination of her body had been inconclusive and officials were awaiting toxicology results to establish a cause of death, police said yesterday.Counsellors from Beachy Head chaplaincy team, which specialises in suicide intervention in the Beachy Head area, were talking to Mrs Madden and trying to establish her identity when she fell at around 2pm.A neighbour, Steve Hill, said he had seen the mother and daughter days before they died, adding: "They seemed like a normal family." Keira's godparents, Sarah and Ewan, who were too upset to speak, left a sunflower toy outside the house yesterday morning with a note speaking of their loss. The note said: "A little sweetie who will always be remembered."
