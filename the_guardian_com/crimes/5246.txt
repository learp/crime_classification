Lynette White, a 20-year-old prostitute, was hacked to death in the early hours of St Valentine's day 1988 in her room above a betting shop in Butetown, Cardiff. She was stabbed more than 50 times, her throat slit and her left breast almost severed.Within days South Wales police issued a photofit of their suspect, a white man seen outside the flat at the time of the murder. He was in a distressed state and his clothing was bloodstained. According to one of the investigating officers, the man "almost certainly had the blood of the deceased on him". Ten months later, however, five black men - Tony Paris, Yusef Abdullahi, Stephen Miller, John Actie and his cousin, Ronnie Actie - were charged with the murder, even though there was no forensic evidence against any of them. The case went to trial in Swansea in October 1989, but was halted in February 1990 when the judge, Mr Justice McNeill, died as he was about to begin his summing-up. The second trial, before Mr Justice Leonard, ended on November 22 1990, by which time it had become the longest murder trial in British legal history. (The previous longest, the Maynard-Dudley "torso murder" case, was also a miscarriage of justice.) Mr Paris, Mr Abdullahi and Mr Miller were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment; the Actie cousins were acquitted. Two months later David Rose in the Observer raised doubts about the convictions. A year after that there was a BBC Panorama programme on the case. At appeal in December 1992 the lord chief justice, Lord Taylor, quashed the convictions on the grounds that Mr Miller's confession was obtained by oppressive means."The officers were not questioning him so much as shouting at him what they wanted him to say," he said. "Short of physical violence, it is hard to conceive of a more hostile and intimidating approach by officers to a suspect." The three men had spent four years in prison.
