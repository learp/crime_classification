Four out of five children are worried that government plans to tackle antisocial behaviour will cause tension between them and the police, a coalition of crime reduction and children's charities said today.Nearly 80% of the children surveyed by the 13 charities warned that plans in the antisocial behaviour bill to give the police powers to move young people off the streets for no reason and impose curfews on them were unfair and would create tension.The survey of 702 youngsters aged 10-16, published to coincide with the House of Lords vote on the bill, also found that 70% opposed giving the police powers to move them on if they had done nothing wrong.Three-fifths of those questioned expressed concern that curfews would prevent them from doing things they enjoyed. More than four-fifths (82%) said they hung around on the streets because there was nowhere else for them to go.The chief executive of the Children's Society, Bob Reitemeier, said the bill was discriminatory and would damage relationships between children and adults. "Police powers to disperse groups and fast-track child curfews may penalise law-abiding children with nowhere to meet. No wonder the children we spoke to felt this was divisive," he said."Parents and children also tell us that they prefer to meet up with a group of friends because this makes them feel safer. Yet the government is now planning to legislate against this."The 13 charities, including Barnardo's, the Children's Society and the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro), have warned that the proposed legislation would alienate young people from their community and make them the scapegoats for local disputes and unrest.A legal report on the bill, commissioned by the charities and published in July, said that giving the police the power to take children up to 16 unaccompanied by a parent after 9pm back home even if they had done nothing wrong amounted to "a nationwide curfew of young people".
