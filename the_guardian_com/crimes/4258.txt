A US pilot today admitted turning up to fly from Heathrow while over the alcohol limit.Erwin Washington, 51, of Lakewood, Colorado, had been due to captain a Boeing 767 carrying 124 passengers and 11 crew bound for Chicago when a colleague smelled alcohol on his breath.He pleaded guilty at Uxbridge magistrates court to being above the alcohol limit for flying a plane, and will be sentenced at Isleworth crown court on 5 February.The United Airlines pilot was arrested at Heathrow on 9 November last year. The departure to Chicago was "imminent" when police arrived.A breath test showed Washington was more than three times the limit allowed to fly a plane. He recorded a reading of 31 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath; the legal limit is nine micrograms.A blood test later showed he had 50 milligrams of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The limit for pilots is 20 milligrams. The legal limit for driving a car is 80 milligrams.Chris Humphreys, defending, said his client was "remorseful for events".
