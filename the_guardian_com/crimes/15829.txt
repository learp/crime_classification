The claim by community secretary Eric Pickles that a “phenomenal amount” of money is saved by switching off street lights (Report, 22 December) is fallacious. There is a demonstrable positive correlation between night accidents and street lighting. Research by the Road Research Laboratory showed that improvements in street lighting at 64 sites resulted in an average reduction of 30% in night accidents and a reduction of 45% in accidents involving personal injury. Cost-benefit accident savings from improved street lighting demonstrate annual savings greater than the cost of energy consumed. Savings are not direct credits to the lighting authorities, but are of benefit to the community as a whole, and to the NHS in having to treat fewer victims of road accidents. Vivian JonesWorcester• Here in the Aggborough and Spennells ward of Kidderminster, we are a pilot area for a Conservative county council initiative that has seen a reduction in street lighting, with two out of three streetlights turned off after midnight. In October, this area experienced five cases of criminal damage (same month last year, none), eight instances of violent crime (last year, two) and six thefts from motor cars (last year, none). Residents drew their own conclusions at a subsequent noisy and frustrated Pact (Partners and Communities Together) meeting – a West Mercia police initiative. It’s most disturbing to read that the police are likely to face a yet further reduction in numbers.David CollinsKidderminster, Worcestershire• The Campaign to Protect Rural England says we should reduce street lighting to better appreciate the lovely starry skies. That might be all very well in the countryside, but here in urban areas, while it is true there is a lot of light pollution, there is also a high crime rate.I’ll stick to astronomy picture of the day on my phone.Roger GreatorexLondon
