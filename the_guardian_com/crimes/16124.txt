The body of a British backpacker murdered in New Zealand was today being flown home for a family funeral in Orkney.Karen Aim, 26, was killed on her way home from a night out in the North Island resort town of Taupo.She was found with head injuries 50 metres from her home in the early hours of January 17, and died in hospital.After the 11,000-mile journey back to the UK, her body will be flown to Scotland then taken by ferry to Orkney. The final leg of the journey may be hampered by stormy weather forecast for the weekend.Her funeral was due to take place on Tuesday at Holm parish church, said her father, Brian.Aim arrived in New Zealand in October, intending to stay for a year, and was working as a supervisor in a glass-blowing workshop in Taupo. Her coffin was escorted back to the UK by her friend Alan Robertson, 29, also from Orkney, who ran a hostel in Taupo.Auckland police leading the murder investigation, named Operation Waikato, have charged a 14-year-old boy in relation to an earlier incident, but said his arrest was not linked to the attack on Aim.Officers said they were examining other crimes committed in Taupo at around the time of Aim's death "as part of standard investigation procedure". They were trying to track down vandals who smashed the windows of a college on the night Aim died, near the spot where she was found.The 14-year-old has been charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and aggravated robbery, after an attack on a woman in Taupo on January 5.Brian Aim told the Daily Record he felt no anger over his daughter's death. "I do not look on it as a murder. Karen was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I am certain the person who did this is sorry," he said.
