They strike in the dead of night and at dawn the population rises to a sinister peril.London has joined the select band of world cities cursed by the mysterious phenomenon of manhole cover theft. The target has been Newham, east London, where in recent weeks nearly 200 grates and covers have been stolen. The thieves made off with 93 covers in one week. Bemused council officials have been trying to locate and cover the holes before someone disappears. A spate of manhole cover thefts was reported earlier this year in Aberdeen and Gloucester. But the international hotspots for the crime are India and China, where missing manholes have caused eight deaths. Newham has asked the local populace to keep a close eye on their manhole covers, to watch out for suspicious vehicles and to submit information to a hotline number. Officials also warn that culprits risk jail. Councillor Ian Corbett said: "We are on their trail and we will use every method at our disposal to track them, including closed circuit television cameras and increased patrols by our community constabulary. The thieves are causing a real danger to the public." The motive for the thefts is financial. The world price of steel has more than doubled this year and even scrap metal is eagerly sought after. The 130 covers stolen from Aberdeen in March were valued at Â£13,000. But for many the losses are more cultural than monetary because London's manholes are feted as symbols of the industrial revolution and distinctive art. According to the art website Ruavista, which displays pictures of many of them, manhole covers "offer living testimony to the industrial artistry of the second half of the 19th century".
