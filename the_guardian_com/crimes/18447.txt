Nearly 40% of incidents of self-harm in women's jails this year were carried out by prisoners on remand, prison reformers said today.In one small local women's prison in July there were more than 200 incidents of self-harm involving nearly one third of the inmates, according to the Prison Reform Trust (PRT).A prison officer at Brockhill women's jail in Worcestershire, which holds just over 160 prisoners, recorded 209 incidents of self-harm by inmates on remand in July. Eleven of those who harmed themselves were young offenders while 41 were adults. The PRT report, Lacking Conviction, showed that prisoners at Brockhill required resuscitation on five occasions while in another eight cases, inmates needed to be admitted to hospital. The trust's policy officer, Enver Solomon, said there was little sign of a significant reduction in the level of self-harm in women's jails despite government pledges to tackle the problem.He said: "In 2003, 40% of self-harm incidents in women's prisons were carried out by remand prisoners, which is very high given the fact that they make up only around 20% of the female population. And in the first six months of this year they accounted for 37% of self-harm incidents."Mr Solomon added that the "very high" level of self-harm in Brockhill reflected the situation in all local women's jails that held remand prisoners.According to the PRT, the number of women in England and Wales remanded into custody has more than trebled over the past decade. In 2002, more than 1,200 women were received in prisons and two-thirds were on remand.Â· There has been a massive rise in the number of young people who harm themselves, according to the National Inquiry into Self-Harm. The first interim report of the inquiry, published today, showed that the number of calls to ChildLine's relating to self-harm had increased by 65% in two years. The number of children speaking to ChildLine about self-harm has grown on average by 23% since 1994.
