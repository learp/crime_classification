Police searching for the missing schoolgirl Shannon Matthews today released the 999 call made by her mother.In the call, made on the evening of February 19, Karen Matthews reports her nine-year-old daughter's failure to return to their home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, after school and gives information about her.Police have released a 71-second extract in which the 32-year-old tells the operator there had been no arguments with the child, adding that she had been in contact with Shannon's friends, family and "everywhere I can think of" in an attempt to trace her. She also says Shannon did not have a mobile phone with her, meaning there was no way she could be contacted.When asked whether her daughter had ever been missing before, she says: "No, this is the first time."Today, Matthews also revealed how her two-year-old daughter, Courtney, cries for Shannon every day and cuddles up to her favourite teddy in the bedroom they share. "It is heartbreaking," she told the Yorkshire Evening Post. "She doesn't understand as much as the other kids, but she is starting to realise Shannon has been gone a long time." She said Shannon's stepfather, Craig Meehan, was helping her to keep going, saying he had been a "rock".Meehan has denied any involvement in the disappearance of his stepdaughter. "I know people start pointing fingers at family and friends when things like this happen," he told the Sun newspaper. "But I had nothing to do with Shannon's disappearance."West Yorkshire police officers have already used specialist sniffer dogs to search more than 500 homes lining Shannon's route to school.Although the dogs have so far failed to detect any trace of the schoolgirl, police said they would be taken into hundreds more houses.Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan, leading the search, said officers had also pieced together a full set of Shannon's fingerprints and her DNA profile to help them establish exactly where she had or had not been.Some 250 police officers, including 60 detectives - around 10% of the force's operational strength - have been assigned to help in the search.Speaking at a press conference, Brennan said he was continuing to treat the case as a missing person inquiry, but admitted it was potentially that "something more sinister".Brennan made a special appeal for any information about a swimming kit Shannon had with her at the time of her disappearance. It has yet to be found.He said the kit was believed to consist of a blue striped towel and a pink and blue two-piece costume with fish on it.Brennan was speaking two weeks after the last confirmed sighting of the "timid" little girl. She was seen leaving her school in Dewsbury Moor following a class swimming trip on February 19.
