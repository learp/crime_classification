Members of the public who inform on companies or individuals defrauding the government could get huge rewards under possible new laws outlined today.The Home Office consultation paper on recovering more illegally-acquired assets also proposes other new measures making it easier to seize criminals' "bling", such as expensive jewellery and electrical goods like plasma screen televisions and laptop computers.The paper describes a government aim to double the current amount of illicit assets seized every year to at least £250m by 2009-10, a figure it calls a "staging post" towards an eventual annual target of £1bn a year.The most eye-catching new scheme is based on a US measure known as Qui Tam - the first words of a Latin phrase meaning "he who sues for the king as well as himself" - which allows anyone who becomes aware of a fraud to launch a legal claim on the government's behalf.In successful cases, informants receive between 15% and 30% of seized assets.The principle dates back to 1790 but has been far more widely used since a change to US law in 1986. Since then there have been more than 5,000 actions in which whistleblowers have received almost £900m in awards, while recovering £5.5bn for the state."It seems to have been successful in the US," said home office minister Vernon Coaker, introducing the consultation paper."We are asking is it applicable in this country, is it something that people would find acceptable and is there a workable model?"The Home Office paper calls the US system "strikingly successful" but stresses that it comes from a "very different US historical, legal and cultural context", one currently alien to England and Wales, where it could be introduced.The document, which is open to responses until November 23, also suggests a series of other changes to make it easier for criminals' assets to be taken from them.One proposal would involve changing the law to allow police to seize high-value goods as soon as a suspect is charged and hold the items pending a trial, selling them in the event of a guilty verdict.The paper also outlines the "radical option" of allowing the seizure of not only cash and cash substitutes but also so-called "lifestyle property" such as jewellery, plasma TVs and laptops to an equivalent sumIt notes: "While this would be a highly powerful tool against bad criminal role models, it would clearly increase the risk of human rights challenge."The paper also proposes removing a current 12-year time limit applying to the Assets Recovery Agency's ability to confiscate property under civil recovery laws.Earlier this year the ARA's former director, Jane Earl, admitted that the agency had been hampered by the time limit which meant it could not pursue some of its key targets.The ARA was set up in 2003 and given powers to confiscate assets from crooks, even if they had not been convicted of a crime. If a criminal confiscation or civil recovery proved impossible, officials could land the law-breakers with a tax bill.The agency was described as a "mess" earlier this year after the National Audit Office said it had cost £65m to run but had seized only £23m from crooks.However, the agency's new annual report, published today, revealed that for the first time it had seized more money than it cost to run it in the past 12 months, £15.9m against £15.5m.
