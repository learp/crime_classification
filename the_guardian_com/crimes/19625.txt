Nottingham was today labelled the crime capital of England and Wales, prompting a furious response from the city's leaders.Using police statistics for seven types of crime - murder, rape, burglary, robbery, car crime and gun offences - the Reform think tank said the East Midlands city ranked worst in terms of crimes per resident, ahead of Leeds, Stockport and Bradford.It averaged 115.5 serious crimes per 1,000 people during 2005, Reform said - four times the rate for Southend, Essex, which came 55th and last in the survey of towns and cities in England and Wales with populations of 100,000 or more.The organisation said there were also marked differences between similar-sized urban areas, with the crime rate in Nottingham more than twice that of Wolverhampton or Reading.However, Jon Collins, the leader of Nottingham city council, said the study was seriously flawed and called for it to be withdrawn."There are lies, damn lies and statistics," he said. "Once again, people are bandying around statistics without fully understanding them and the implications of getting them wrong."I demand that this report is withdrawn until they can get their facts right, before it does any further damage to Nottingham, its businesses, its universities and its reputation." He said the city's depiction as the UK's crime capital "does not describe the Nottingham that I, or the vast majority of people who live and work here, recognise", adding that residents were "proud of our city, and feel safe in it".Chief Superintendent Marcus Beale, the police commander for Nottingham city centre, said there were errors in the survey."Nottingham's population is significantly higher than this survey suggests, and we are being compared against some areas with large swathes of countryside," he added."Every weekend, we play host to around 100,000 people who choose to visit Nottingham for a night out. They have a great time and then go home safely." However, Reform insisted its survey - based on models used in the US - had a vital role to play in helping the public to better understand crime statistics."The government's key message that crime has been falling masks a huge variation between the safest and most dangerous urban areas," report co-author Blair Gibbs said."Better information and improved policing, based on direct accountability to local communities, is urgently needed to drive down crime and increase public safety."The death of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan, who was killed by shots fired from a car as she walked home from a funfair in October 2004, turned the spotlight on gun crime in Nottingham. However, individual figures for gun crime per head of population showed the city in fourth place, below Bradford, Leeds and Northampton.The study, which did not take into account factors such as economic deprivation, used crime statistics obtained from police under the Freedom of Information Act and population data from the 2001 census.London was ranked 29th in the survey, but the authors said this masked a "wide variation" between the capital's safest boroughs, such as Richmond and Kingston, and its most dangerous, which included Hackney and Islington.
