Police confirmed that a body found in the river Ouse yesterday in York was not that of the university chef Claudia Lawrence who disappeared a month ago. A North Yorkshire police spokesman said inquiries were continuing into the identity of the body. Police also said they had a lead in the Lawrence case, and appealed for information about a man and woman who were seen arguing outside the University of York at about 6.10am on Thursday 19 March - around the time Lawrence, 35, was due to start her shift at Goodricke College.Detective Superintendent Ray Galloway, the senior investigating officer, also revealed a second line of inquiry which had happened on the afternoon of either 10 March or 13 March.A woman had passed by Lawrence's home in slow moving traffic and had seen two men at her front door. One of the men is described as Asian. "They are stood at the door and one of the men, the Asian male, appears to try to open the door. Whether it was with a key or he was just trying the door handle, we are not absolutely certain. We obviously need to know who the men are," Galloway said.
