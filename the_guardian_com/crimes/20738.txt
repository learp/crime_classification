Two men, aged 21 and 20, have been charged over the murder of a teenage boy on the Isle of Lewis. The Northern constabulary said a report would be made to the procurator fiscal over the murder of Liam Aitchison, 16. Liam was the first person to be killed on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides for more than 40 years. His body was discovered by search teams in a derelict RAF building in the Steinish area of Stornoway on 29 November, a week after he went missing from home. Liam, who came from Uist, had been living in Stornoway for two months.
