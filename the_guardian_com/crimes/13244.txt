The Metropolitan police won an appeal yesterday against a ruling that Duwayne Brooks, surviving victim of the racist attack on Stephen Lawrence, could sue them for negligence over the way he was treated afterwards.His solicitor, Jane Deighton, had described the court of appeal decision which gave him the go-ahead in March 2002 as "ground-breaking". It was the first time a police duty of care toward victims and witnesses of crime had been recognised in law. But five law lords unanimously agreed that the police owed no such duty, and the claim in negligence should be struck out. However, Ms Deighton said Mr Brooks was going ahead with a "substantial" claim against 13 individual police officers under the Race Relations Act, which the appeal court had agreed he could bring, and which was unchallenged in the lords. Mr Brooks was present when his 18-year-old friend was stabbed in the "most notorious racist killing which our country has ever known," said Lord Bingham. He telephoned for an ambulance after the April 1993 attack by white youths in Eltham, south-east London. He claimed he was later treated as a suspect rather than a victim by police, and went on to suffer from severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Lord Bingham said that however well the crime had been investigated and however sensitively Mr Brooks had been treated, he would inevitably have been deeply traumatised by his experience. But unfortunately, as established by the public inquiry conducted by Sir William Macpherson, the investigation was "very badly conducted". However, the duties claimed could not even arguably be imposed on police officers charged in the public interest with investigation of a very serious crime and apprehension of those responsible, without potentially undermining the officers' performance of their functions.
