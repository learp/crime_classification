Tony Martin, the farmer jailed for shooting dead a burglar who broke into his home, has been refused permission to appeal against his manslaughter conviction in the Lords.Martin, from Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, had his conviction for murdering Fred Barras, 16, reduced to manslaughter by the appeal court last October. His jail sentence was cut from life to five years. Now three law lords have refused him permission to challenge the court's decision in the Lords. Richard Portham, a friend and former neighbour of Martin's, said the farmer was "phlegmatic but disappointed" at the news. The appeal court ruling rejected arguments that fresh psychiatric evidence, plus new evidence from ballistics experts, supported Martin's case that he acted in self-defence, using no more than "reasonable force" to protect himself and his property. Martin should be eligible for parole in October.  Press Association
