A convicted paedophile who escaped jail after his 13-year-old victim was branded as "predatory" is to have his sentence reviewed by the court of appeal.Neil Wilson, 41, was handed a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years after he admitted engaging in sexual activity with the child, as well as offences of making indecent images of a child and possession of an extreme pornographic image.A row broke out shortly after the case was heard when it emerged that the prosecuting barrister Robert Colover had labelled the young girl "predatory" and "sexually experienced".The attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has decided to refer Wilson's sentence to the court of appeal, where three judges will decide whether or not it is unduly lenient and whether they should increase it.A statement from the attorney general's office said: "Having carefully reviewed this case, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve QC MP, has decided to refer the sentence of Neil Wilson to the court of appeal for review."The case will in due course be heard by three court of appeal judges who will decide whether or not the sentence is unduly lenient and whether they should increase it."In addition to Colover's comments, the judge, Nigel Peters, said he accounted for the way Wilson's victim looked and behaved when he sentenced her attacker.Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review by the Crown Prosecution Service, while Peters's comments are to be investigated by the Office for Judicial Complaints.As well as receiving a number of complaints, the CPS was confronted by a petition, which now has more than 50,000 signatures, demanding that the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, investigate the language used by Colover.
