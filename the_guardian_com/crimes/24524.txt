British border and immigration officials took bribes from human traffickers in exchange for assistance in a criminal enterprise that the UN has labelled "modern-day slavery", according to a government report published today .Convicted traffickers and people smugglers who supplied prostitutes to brothels and workers for the drug trade and the unofficial economy told a Home Office inquiry into immigration crime that Passport Agency officials took cash to help organised people-trafficking gangs. Other officials traded favours with traffickers in "longstanding relationships of mutual benefit" to help earn criminal networks profits of up to £500,000 a year.The claims, which the Home Office said it had not been able to verify, were met with calls for an urgent investigation from anti-trafficking campaigners and opposition parties who described them as "deeply shocking".They will also increase pressure on the home secretary, Alan Johnson, to reform the UK's anti-trafficking strategy. Johnson is due to be questioned by the Commons home affairs select committee tomorrowover the government's handling of people trafficking."Corruption and bribery were mentioned by a range of interviewees involved in smuggling and trafficking as a means of smoothing the passage into the UK," said the Home Office report, Organised Immigration Crime: A Post-conviction Study. "In some cases, the corruption was not as obvious as the payment of money for services rendered but was more subtle – to do with longstanding relationships of mutual benefit … Equally, interviewees provided examples of bribery." A convicted Albanian trafficker told the Home Office : "At the Home Office you had people who worked very, very hard, but … there were a few people who would help and break the law – for money, of course." The report made clear these individuals were in the Passport Agency. It said traffickers included bribes to officials in their "business costs" as a matter of course."Any accusation of corruption inside the Home Office needs to be investigated very urgently," said Damian Green, the shadow immigration minister. "There have been previous examples of immigration officers taking bribes to help people into the country, and ministers need to stamp this out." Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the "deeply shocking" allegations required thorough investigation."We have heard anecdotal evidence of this from victims and it is contributing to the transformation of people into slaves in the 21st century," said Klara Skrivankova, trafficking co-ordinator at Anti-Slavery International.The report, which refers to data collected in 2006, was released after a freedom of information request by the Guardian last September was turned down despite a draft being available in 2007.Since then, the Home Office said, it had been correcting factual errors and misleading information.It pledged to release the report in "spring 2009" and when challenged in June about the lack of publication, a spokeswoman said it was still "meteorologically spring".It was released today following a complaint to the information commissioner about the delay.According to the report, traffickers and smugglers boasted of having "contacts in useful official networks" in Britain and many of those running brothels using trafficked prostitutes said they felt the police "turned a blind eye" as long as there was no associated trouble."Interviewees generally perceived the likelihood of apprehension as low and were critical of UK law enforcement," the report states. "It was said that the scale of activity was far beyond the level appreciated by the authorities and that the dispensible foot soldiers were caught while the major players often escaped conviction."The report also concludes that traffickers and people smugglers have "very low regard" for the effectiveness of the Immigration Service. Interviews with 45 criminals convicted of trafficking offences found they regarded illicit entry into this country as "relatively easy" and that the UK was a place where "healthy profits" could be made with a "low risk of detection".The Home Office said the claims of bribery could not be verified and it included them "to provide a full record of interviewees' perceptions"."Since 2006, a lot has changed," the Home Office said in a statement. "We have radically overhauled our border security, stepping up the fight against organised crime and barring record numbers before they set foot in Britain."Following the setting up of the Serious Organised Crime Agency in 2006, there are now closer links between police, immigration officers and social workers, making the UK a more hostile place for people smugglers and traffickers."
