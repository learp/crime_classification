Anne Darwin, the wife of the back-from-the-dead canoeist, returned to court today as legal proceedings began to reclaim the hundreds of thousands of pounds the couple swindled.Darwin, 56, appeared before Mr Justice Wilkie, who jailed her in July for six and a half years for fraud and money laundering, to hear a proceeds of crime application.The hearing was held at Newcastle crown court in chambers, meaning the press and public were barred. It is understood that a timetable was set out to recover the couple's gains, and Darwin will be in court again at a later date.Darwin and her husband, John, convinced the police, a coroner, financial institutions and even their two sons, Mark and Anthony, that he had drowned in the North Sea outside their large home overlooking Seaton Carew promenade, near Hartlepool, in 2002.He turned up in London a year ago, claiming to have suffered from amnesia. But in the intervening five years, he hid in the next-door bedsit they owned, took on a false identity and then tried to start a new life in Panama after his wife cashed in a life assurance policy and paid off their mortgage.After his reappearance, Mrs Darwin was traced to Central America and acted surprised at the discovery of her husband. Her tale collapsed when a photograph of the couple smiling in a Panamanian estate agents surfaced on the internet.She returned to the UK and was convicted of six fraud charges and nine counts of money laundering. Her husband admitted the charges, as well as falsely obtaining a passport, and was jailed for six years.
