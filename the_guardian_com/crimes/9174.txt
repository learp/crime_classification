Detectives hunting a man thought to be responsible for attacking women in Birmingham city centre with a needle may have struck at least 11 times, it has emerged.West Midlands police revealed last week that they were investigating attacks on five women but said that since then six more potential victims have come forward.Police have described the attacks as strange, and do not know the motive. They have stepped up patrols around Birmingham city centre to try to stop the man striking again.Last week, an image of a man the police want to trace in connection with the attacks was released. The picture, showing a man lighting a cigarette, was captured on CCTV just after an attack at around 3am on Sunday 3 November, when a 30-year-old woman felt a sharp pain in her thigh, which was later confirmed as a puncture wound.They have now released an expanded version of the image showing a second man who they say may have vital information about the suspect.Detective Inspector Julie Woods said: "We believe that this man could have witnessed the attack or may know the person responsible and could help us significantly with our enquiries."We have received several calls with information following the appeal on Friday and are currently following these up. We have also received reports of six further attacks going back over the last six months, which could possibly be linked to the same suspect."However, we are still keen to hear from anyone who has any information about these incidents and who recognises either of the men in the CCTV images."These are strange offences and the motive at this stage is unclear but we do not underestimate the anxiety and stress that the attacks can cause." None of the victims has suffered any long-term health effects following the attacks.Superintendent Danny Long said patrols had been stepped up in an attempt to reassure people visiting the city centre.He said: "This is an unusual offence, which will understandably cause some concern and we are working extremely hard to find the person responsible."We have increased the number of officers on patrol in Broad Street and around the city centre, particularly since the attack earlier this month, and are working closely with street wardens, street pastors, licensees, door staff and clubbers themselves to keep people safe."Anyone who recognises either of the men in the images should contact detectives from Force CID on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
