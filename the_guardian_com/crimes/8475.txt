Three men accused of planning a massive suicide attack discussed how the 7/7 London bombers did not do enough damage because they had forgotten to use "nails and stuff", a court has heard.Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali, both 27, are among 11 men accused of being behind the plot.Prosecutor Brian Altman told the jury that technical examination of a laptop used by the group revealed a Google search for the term "muhammed siddique khan as sahab", who was one of the London bombers.In a taped conversation read out during the trial, Naseer is heard discussing the bombings and agreeing with another man it had gone "a bit wrong" and that not enough damage had been done."You know what? They forgot to put the … they didn't put the nails and stuff in, man," Naseer said.Laptop examinations also revealed the accused searched YouTube for "The devil's deception of the fake jihadis", "Taliban fighting videos" and on FoxNews, "homemade bomb found in womens restroom in Detroit".Khalid was also recorded talking about wanting to see "AQ", and giving Naseer the instruction to spread the knowledge into Europe, the jury at Woolwich crown court in London was told.Naseer then said: "AQ's main aim is … the knowledge that they give us, we want more and more people have stance in Europe. So they can start whacking you there, yeah, do you understand?"The men also joked about their last meal before the planned attacks and finding a second wife in paradise, the court heard.The three men are accused of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, which they deny.Naseer is accused of five counts of the offence, Khalid four and Ali three, all between Christmas Day 2010 and 19 September last year.Naseer, from Sparkhill, Khalid, from Sparkbrook, and Ali, from Balsall Heath, all in Birmingham, are alleged to have been involved in planning a bombing campaign, collecting money for terrorism and recruiting others for terrorism.Naseer and Khalid are also accused of travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, and it is alleged Naseer also helped others to travel to the country for the same purpose.In another taped conversation, it was revealed the men had suspicions that they were under police surveillance."Naseer had a feeling, correctly as it turned out, that 'they were gonna do something here soon' – in other words, there might be a police raid," Altman said.They then discussed always having someone inside the flat so that bugs could not be planted; or if they had to leave, going out via a window to create the illusion that someone was still in, or by installing a spy camera to cover the front of the house, the court heard.The three men were arrested on the night of 18 September while getting out of a car.Ali, who was in the back of the car, was recorded saying: "I am not a terrorist. I am a civilian. Just because I have a beard does not make me a terrorist."Once arrested, a police search found in Naseer's bedroom a black flag bearing the words in Arabic: "There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is the Prophet of Allah."Altman said: "This is the first of the five pillars of Islam. The colour and style of the flag represent the jihad and the caliphate, the era of Islamic ascendancy following the death of the prophet."Police also found a tape labelled "Caravan of Martyrs" containing songs about martyrs and longing to see them again in paradise, the court heard.A search of Khalid's apartment uncovered a large amount of extremist literature in the form of taped lectures by radical clerics and books, the jury was told.The trial has been adjourned until Monday.
