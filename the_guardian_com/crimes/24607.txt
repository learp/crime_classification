A wanted sex offender who could be as young as 12 must be caught before he strikes again, police in Manchester have said.Officers believe the boy is responsible for a string of attacks near the University of Manchester over the last month. Detective chief inspector Colin Larkin said he feared they could escalate if he is not stopped.The first two assaults took place within 15 minutes of each other on 21 September. A 27-year-old woman was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 6.15pm before she screamed and the offender ran off.The next incident took place in Oxford Road when a boy approached a 21-year-old woman and made lewd comments as she left the John Rylands library.She carried on walking on Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant, who was described as an Asian boy aged 12 and wearing green jeans and glasses.The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 2.15pm on 5 October, when two boys approached a 32-year-old woman and one of them sexually assaulted her. The assailant was described as being Asian, 12 to 13 years old and of slim build. He was wearing baggy trousers and carried a rucksack on his back.The woman pushed the boy away, but he approached her again and sexually assaulted her for a second time before running off with his accomplice, also described as a Asian boy.Larkin said: "While we cannot be precise about the offender's age, we believe from the descriptions given to us by the women he assaulted that he was between 12 and 15 years old, and it is obviously very unusual and very worrying that someone someone so young is committing such appalling attacks on women."What we can be certain about is that the women are traumatised as a result of what happened and are being offered support by specially trained officers."Whatever the young boy's motivation, this is not a practical joke or a prank. His actions are disturbing and he has caused the three women he assaulted a lot of upset. That is why it is so important we find whomever is responsible."Given his young age, I would appeal to anyone who may know him - schoolteachers, community leaders or possibly even family members - to either alert the police or bring this young man to a police station as soon as possible. We cannot allow these sexual assaults to escalate and we need to find him."Larkin said he did not believe the boy who accompanied the offender in the last assault had also committed an offence and appealed to him to come forward and prevent his friend from assaulting other women."Undoubtedly people who work, live and study in this area will be concerned," he added."Incidents of this nature are thankfully extremely rare and this sort of offence involving such a young offender is even rarer, but it is right we should warn members of the public so they can be vigilant and take the right precautions such as sticking with friends and not walking alone where possible."Anyone who does have information about these appalling crimes or perhaps suspects who may be responsible should contact police immediately."Figures released by the Crime Survey for England and Wales on Thursday showed that the number of reported sex offences has increased by 9% in the twelve months to June. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase to the police investigation into the sex crimes committed by Jimmy Savile.The figures showed that 55,812 sexual offences were committed in England and Wales over the year.In March this year, the NSPCC released figures obtained under a freedom of information request which showed that children as young as five were among thousands of under-18s to be accused of sexual offences against other children.The charity's figures showed that, between 2009 and 2012, police dealt with more than 5,000 cases.
