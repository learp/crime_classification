A burglar has admitted causing grievous bodily harm to a police officer who was knocked down by a car as he responded to reports of a break-in.Carl Anderson had been charged with attempting to murder PC Peter McGinn but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge during a hearing at Birmingham crown court.Anderson, who will be sentenced next month, also admitted burglary, dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and using a vehicle without insurance.The 50-year-old, from Osbourne Close, Aston, Birmingham, was arrested on 7 June after McGinn suffered multiple fractures in the incident in the Erdington area of the city.The facts of the case were not opened at Wednesday's hearing, but McGinn is known to have undergone complex surgery after suffering serious shoulder, leg and pelvic injuries as he tried to stop a Honda estate car in Oval Road, Erdington.The prosecution barrister, Robert Price, told the court that Anderson's not guilty plea to attempted murder was acceptable to the crown in light of his guilty plea to the alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.Anderson, who spoke only to enter his pleas, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the same court on 27 September.
