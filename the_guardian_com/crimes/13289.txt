A primary school caretaker was given an indeterminate jail sentence yesterday for carrying out a nationwide letterbomb campaign which he claimed was a protest against Britain's "surveillance society".Miles Cooper, 27, from Cambridge, was told at Oxford crown court that he would have to serve at least five years.Judge Julian Hall told Cooper he was a danger to the public. He said: "First and foremost you are a terrorist, let there be no mistake. Anyone who tries through violence or threat of violence to change the political will is a terrorist and that is precisely what you did."Cooper was found guilty by a jury on Thursday after denying 11 counts relating to explosive devices he sent to offices in London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Kent, Birmingham and Swansea in January and February. The offices included three forensic science laboratories, a computer company, an accountancy firm and the DVLA. People who opened the envelopes were showered in glass fragments or nails, his four-day trial heard. Eight were injured and suffered lasting psychological damage, the court was told.After sentencing, Cooper's solicitor, Julian Richards, read a statement which said: "He would at this stage like to express that he is sincerely sorry that any individuals were harmed by his actions."
