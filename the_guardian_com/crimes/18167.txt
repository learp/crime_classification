A couple suspected of involvement in their daughter's possible 'honour killing' will be questioned in public this week over the teenager's death.Almost four years after the body of 17-year-old Shafilea Ahmed was found in a Lake District river, the inquest into her unsolved death is expected to shed fresh light into how she was killed months after refusing an arranged marriage.Her parents, Iftikhar Ahmed, 44, a taxi driver, and his 41-year-old wife, Farzana, were arrested and questioned on suspicion of kidnapping their Muslim daughter in Christmas 2003.Both were subsequently released without charge and this week will maintain their innocence of any involvement in her death. Shafilea's decomposed body was found partially submerged on the bank of the River Kent, Cumbria, in February 2004.Meanwhile, The Observer has learnt that prosecutors considered possible murder or manslaughter charges against her parents for almost two and a half years before eventually informing detectives there was insufficient evidence.Crown Prosecution Service sources have revealed they actively examined charges against one or both of Shafilea's parents between November 2003 and February 2006 before senior CPS lawyers finally told Cheshire police that the findings of the murder inquiry could not 'provide a realistic prospect of conviction'.The couple, from Warrington, were served with witness summons from the coroner five days before Christmas, a move that compels the pair to attend the hearings, which start this Tuesday. The long-awaited inquest threatens to be a charged affair with her parents having already accused Cheshire police of racial stereotyping. Statements from family members will portray a girl seemingly torn between traditional family ties and the Western culture she sought to embrace.The 17-year-old student, described as highly 'Westernised' by friends, disappeared from her Warrington home on 11 September 2003. Months beforehand she had swallowed bleach in an apparent cry for help after being introduced to a potential suitor while on holiday with her family in a Pakistani village.Police sources last week confirmed that the murder inquiry into her death is ongoing with senior detectives expected to give an update on developments and possible new leads when the inquest concludes. The CPS have confirmed they are prepared to reopen their file on Shafilea's parents if 'fresh evidence' is forthcoming.Detectives are not ruling out the possibility that the teenager was the victim of an 'honour killing', the punishment reserved to some Asian women judged to have brought shame on their family.No one, however, remains on bail in connection with the death.In total, 29 witnesses have been summoned to the inquest including four family members and a number of senior officers from Cheshire police involved in one of the largest inquiries in the force's history.Detective chief inspector Geraint Jones, who led the investigation, has previously spoken of his frustration at the reluctance of potential witnesses to come forward. Even so, police have interviewed more than 2,000 people as part of the investigation and have identified 200 members of Shafilea's extended family, most of whom live in Bradford or Pakistan. Officers, though, have yet to travel abroad in connection with Shafilea's death.The coroner for south and east Cumbria, Ian Smith, will hear the results of a second post-mortem examination ordered after the condition of her body initially prevented pathologists from identifying the cause of death. Her body was discovered by workmen close to the flooded River Kent at Sedgewick, near Kendal, in February 2004 and was so badly decomposed police required DNA tests to ascertain whether it was her.Officers have worked on the basis she was murdered within days of her disappearance and that her body was deliberately hidden in undergrowth by a third party. A possible murder weapon has never been traced.Detectives believe her killer, or killers, may have driven north from Warrington up the M6 and have chosen the first good hiding place that presented itself after leaving the motorway at junction 36. Her body was found close to a secluded lay-by and among the first woodland that visitors using the junction would have encountered.Iftikhar and Farzana were arrested on suspicion of kidnap and bailed pending further inquiries, but were later released from bail and made headlines after gate-crashing a police press conference three weeks after Shafilea's body was found to protest their innocence.Shortly after, the parents offered a Â£5,000 reward to catch her killer and appealed on the BBC's Newsnight programme for help to find her killer and to deny they had tried to organise an arranged marriage for their daughter.The decision of the parents not to report her missing immediately, however, ignited speculation that she may have been a victim of an honour killing. Instead, police were alerted eight days later by her worried teachers at Great Sankey High School.The last sighting of Shafilea was recorded on 11 September 2003 after her parents picked her up from her part-time call centre job in Warrington.During the lengthy police investigation, eight of Shafilea's relatives from the Bradford area of Yorkshire were also arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. They were later released without charge. It is understood at least two have also been served summons to attend the inquest.Described as intelligent and ambitious, Shafilea was studying for A-levels at Priestley College in Warrington to fulfil her ambition to become a lawyer. The coroner will hear accounts of a teenager apparently caught between her traditional Muslim home life and the pop music culture of her social life.At home she spoke Urdu and observed Muslim prayers with her three sisters and younger brother. But at the same time she idolised R&B singers, wore tight jeans and secretly stored the mobile telephone numbers of male friends at college.She and her 15-year-old sister, who was also her closest friend, shared a love of pop stars such as Justin Timberlake and Kelly Rowland. They frequently travelled to the Trafford Centre, in nearby Manchester, to go window shopping.
