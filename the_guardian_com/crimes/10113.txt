Relatives of murder victims yesterday criticised the way their cases had been handled by the justice system, condemning failings of police and the courts.Giving evidence to the home affairs select committee, the bereaved son of a 70-year-old woman killed by her son-in-law accused a judge of ignoring prosecutors' objections when he freed the man on bail, even though he was accused of murdering his wife. Traute Maxfield, who was killed by Gary Weddell, a Metropolitan police inspector, would still be alive had she not been failed by the justice system, her son told MPs.Paul Carne, the son of Traute Maxfield and brother of Weddell's estranged wife Sandra, told the committee on policing in the 21st century that had Weddell not been a police officer and his brother Geoffrey, who paid his bail, a barrister, things might have been different. Weddell murdered his wife at their home in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, strangling her and trying to cover up the crime as suicide. While on bail he joined a clay pigeon shooting club, using a shotgun stolen from there to kill his mother-in-law and, a day later, himself. Police believed he had been aiming to kill other members of his family.Carne was joined by Helen Newlove, whose husband Gary was kicked to death on his doorstep by a gang of drunken teenagers. She said that as victims, families needed more help and respect in court. "You go in the court with all the emotions and then you are fighting for a seat, the press have a box, the legal people have a box but there is no respect for the families. You do not know who you are sitting next to. I think it's utterly disgraceful because you think that the courts are for you, that they are your safety net."
