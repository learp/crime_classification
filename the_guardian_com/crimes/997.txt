A man is being questioned today over the suspected murder of a young woman who disappeared after an evening out at a nightclub in Bath 14 years ago.Avon and Somerset police said the 39-year-old man was held on suspicion of the murder of Melanie Hall, whose remains were found at the side of the M5 last October by a workman clearing vegetation.The man, from Wiltshire, was arrested at 4pm yesterday after he went voluntarily to a police station, a spokesman said.Hall, who was 25, went missing after a night out at Cadillacs nightclub on 9 June 1996. In July this year a 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of her murder and disappearance, and was later released on bail.Detective Chief Inspector Gareth Bevan, of the murder inquiry team, described the latest arrest as an important step but stressed that the investigation was continuing.He said: "Since Melanie's body was found last October, the investigation team has continued to work tirelessly, following up new information we have received and revisiting the previous investigations that followed Melanie's disappearance from Walcot Street in June 1996. An additional 250 statements have been taken and 1,200 new tasks and investigative actions have been completed."He said Hall's parents, Pat and Steve, were being kept informed and were aware that police had made an arrest. "The murder inquiry team remains active, positive and determined to find Melanie's killer or killers and bring them to justice," Bevan said.Hall, who worked as a clerical officer in the orthopaedic department at Bath's Royal United hospital, was last seen sitting on a stool near the dance floor at Cadillacs shortly after 1am.Thousands of clubbers and taxi drivers were interviewed in an investigation involving 60 officers and several searches of the river Avon, but no trace of Hall was found until last October, when her remains were discovered hidden under five plastic bags. A ring which had been in her family for generations was also discovered.In 2003, police arrested two men in connection with Hall's disappearance but they were released without charge after police searched buildings and a field near Bath.
