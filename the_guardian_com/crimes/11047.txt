The former home secretary Charles Clarke yesterday sharply criticised his successor, John Reid, for postponing the programme of police force mergers, describing it as a "weak and damaging" decision that will seriously hamper the fight against terrorism.The attack was triggered by the failure on Monday of merger talks between the Lancashire and Cumbria forces, the only two to volunteer for the proposed mergers.Mr Clarke, who as home secretary fought to push through the merger programme of which he was the architect, said yesterday that the decision to halt the Lancashire-Cumbria merger was likely to jeopardise the whole police reform programme. "This will mean the delay of the introduction of neighbourhood policing throughout the country, to which we committed in our 2005 manifesto," he said. "Moreover it will seriously hamper the ability of the police to contest terrorism and serious and organised crimes like trafficking in drugs and people, as the 2005 report of Her Majesty's Inspectorate made clear."Mr Clarke's attack on his successor was quickly followed by a warning by the Association of Chief Police Officers, the major police body in favour of mergers, that the necessary Treasury cash for the plan had not been forthcoming, jeopardising the entire scheme. Ken Jones, the Acpo president, said in a letter to all chief constables: "The necessary financial support has not materialised and mergers, including voluntary ones, will not take place."But the Home Office insisted last night that it was not about to shelve the entire plan for mergers affecting nearly all 43 police forces in England and Wales. "The home secretary remains convinced of the need to review and reform our structures so as to better equip the police forces to deal with the challenges we face in the 21st century," said a Home Office spokesman.Mr Reid told the Commons in June that he was postponing any forced mergers until the autumn to allow for further discussions. The former immigration minister Tony McNulty was moved to the police minister's job - which Mr Clarke once held - at the last reshuffle to sort out the police reform programme.Ministers are resting their case for merger on a report by the inspectorate of police which identified "significant weaknesses" in the ability of individual forces to deal with major terrorist incidents and organised crime. But the Lancashire-Cumbria merger plan - the only one of five proposed by the Home Office to be approved by all involved - has hit problems over the issue of Treasury funds for the merger. The alternative is to push up council tax bills.The Cumbria chief constable, Michael Baxter, last night predicted that the whole programme would have to be pulled: "If it can't work between Cumbria and Lancashire, it can't work anywhere."The Home Office insists the financial problems can be sorted out. But Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg said: "Surely this is the nail in the coffin for the government's ill-judged and rushed plan."
