An Australian revisionist historian wanted in Germany for alleged Holocaust denial was today greeted in court with a Nazi salute from the public gallery.Dr Fredrick Toben, 64, who is fighting extradition under the European Arrest Warrant, was remanded in custody for at least another week after today's hearing at Westminster magistrates court. As he left the dock, he smiled at a small group of supporters in the public gallery, one of whom raised his arm in a Nazi gesture. The German-born academic, who has now taken Australian nationality, was arrested as he passed through Heathrow airport on October 1.He is wanted by a district court in Mannheim, Germany, for posting information of an "anti-Semitic or revisionist nature" on the internet from 2002 onwards.Toben used his Australian-based website to refute that the Holocaust took place on the scale accepted by the vast majority of historians. While it is not a crime to express such opinions in the UK, it is a specific offence in Germany and Austria.The European Arrest Warrant expedites extradition from one EU country to another if a person is accused of an offence for which the penalty is at least a year in prison.Toben could face up to five years' imprisonment if convicted.
