The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith QC, has asked the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith QC, to "look into the handling" of the Damilola Taylor murder case, he said in a statement today.Lord Goldsmith said he had asked the DPP to consider whether there were implications for the conduct of future cases. The review will report by mid summer.Scotland Yard commissioner Sir John Stevens said he had invited the Bishop of Stepney, John Sentamu, to chair an oversight panel which will review the investigation and prosecution arising from the murder of Damilola Taylor.In his statement, Lord Goldsmith said: "I would like to express my deep sympathy for the Taylor family, who still have many questions left unanswered despite an intensive police investigation and a lengthy trial. "No one has been convicted for the tragic death of a child. I welcome the inquiry that the Metropolitan police commissioner has established. The CPS will be working closely with the Met. "As the prime minister said this morning, there should be no rush to judgment. This was always going to be a difficult case. It is the job of the CPS to bring cases before the courts where in their judgment there is a realistic prospect of a conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute. "It is then the job of the court, in this case the judge and jury, to examine the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence. "The approach of the CPS results in cases being brought before the courts that ought properly to be examined in a trial. Inevitably, there will sometimes be acquittals. If the CPS prosecuted only in cases where conviction was near certain, there would be far fewer cases and many guilty people would go free."
