The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into bribery at the British publisher Macmillan after it admitted paying officials to win an education deal in south Sudan.Macmillan referred itself to the SFO following an investigation by the World Bank, which has banned the publisher from any of its contracts for six years.Millions of dollars of international aid have been pumped into south Sudan through a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank, established in 2006 to fund post-conflict reconstruction in the wake of two decades of civil war in the region.The company admitted that a representative of Macmillan Education made "improper and unauthorised payments" to local officials in its unsuccessful bid to win a multimillion-pound contract to print English language teaching and school curriculum materials. The tender was part of a $45.9m project to develop the school curriculum, train thousands of teachers, build 100 schools and refurbish a further 50.The SFO and the City of London police are working together on the case. Police said: "We have been investigating the allegations for over six months and following Macmillan's decision to report themselves to the SFO we are now working with the SFO on a joint investigation."The SFO has powers to prosecute cases of overseas bribery, corruption, and serious and complex fraud against individuals and corporations. Both Macmillan and the individual responsible for the payments could therefore face criminal charges, although the SFO could decide to give civil penalties instead.Last year the international engineering firm Amec was fined nearly £5m plus costs under civil recovery proceedings after the company reported itself to the SFO over irregular payments.The World Bank was alerted to the payments after bribery charges were made in 2008-09. "Macmillan admitted it paid funds and provided benefits which could have influenced the award of the contract," an official said. As a result the publisher has been added to the bank's "debarred list", which names and shames organisations found by the bank to have acted corruptly.The bank said the company's swift action to admit the bribery resulted in the ban being reduced from eight to six years. "In this case Macmillan was very quick to acknowledge its wrongdoing," the official said.Annette Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan, said: "We will not tolerate any form of potentially unlawful behaviour. We are deeply shocked to have discovered these issues, and are sorry for the harm that such behaviour will have done."Macmillan is a business with strong values rooted in education and development, which we hold dear. We will work tenaciously to protect it from bad conduct. There is no suggestion that these concerns have affected any of Macmillan's other principal businesses, and it is the case that they are confined to a limited part of our education business. Despite this, we take the situation very seriously and have been co-operating fully with the authorities."Macmillan said it had commissioned an independent internal investigation from a leading law firm, conducted a thorough review of its compliance policies and procedures, and adopted a new anti-bribery and corruption policy.Leonard McCarthy, integrity vice-president at the World Bank Group, said: "This [the ban] is an acknowledgement of past wrongdoing by Macmillan and demonstrates the World Bank's unwavering commitment to ensuring all those who participate in World Bank-financed projects, including those who do not actually get contracts, are held to the highest levels of integrity, while also encouraging companies to come forward and join our fight against corruption."The bank said the ban could be halved to three years if the publisher continued to co-operate. "The debarment period of six years can be further reduced to three years depending upon the company stepping up its compliance and further co-operating with the World Bank's integrity team to address fraud and corruption risk," the official said.In September the British engineering firm Mabey & Johnson was fined £6.6m for overseas corruption and breaching UN sanctions in the first prosecution in the UK against a company for corruption. The prosecution came after the steel bridging supplier voluntarily gave evidence to the SFO indicating that it had sought to influence decision-makers in public contracts in Jamaica and Ghana between 1993 and 2001.Last month Robert John Dougall, a former DePuy executive, was jailed for 12 months after admitting his involvement in £4.5m corrupt payments to medical professionals within the Greek state healthcare system.
