Ahead of a major speech on criminal justice tomorrow Tony Blair was today warned by a leading academic expert to "think hard" before introducing any more "headline-grabbing" law and order legislation.The critical letter by Professor Ian Loader, one of six policy papers written by criminologists, senior policemen and politicians and published today on the No.10 website, urges the prime minister to be the "voice of reason and restraint" rather than the "uncritical cipher" of public anger on the issue.While not reflecting government policy, the papers, written after attending a Downing Street seminar, will inform Tony Blair's speech in Bristol on the criminal justice system, the first in a series of lectures under the umbrella theme "Our Nation's Future".Mr Blair's spokesman said its focus would be on rebalancing the system to put the needs of the victim and law-abiding citizens at the heart of the process.Professor Loader from the Oxford Centre for Criminology tells Mr Blair there is little evidence for his belief that the criminal justice system has become 'unbalanced', unduly favouring the rights of offenders."Listening to you speak about these matters," Professor Loader writes, "you seem to take the view that the role of government is to act as an uncritical cipher for public anger and demands viz.crime and disorder."It is as if you have lost confidence in the capacity of government to engage in a dialogue with people...to be a voice of reason and restraint rather than a conduit or cheerleader for longer sentences and more punishment."This advice came the day after Mr Blair taunted his opponent, David Cameron, for 'voting soft' on law and order legislation at prime minister's questions. Professor Loader also urges Mr Blair to engage the public with different narrative about the facts of falling crime levels and effective punishments. More legislation and another prime ministerial statement would, he advises, be "like putting a plaster on a broken leg".Another criminologist, Professor Anthony Bottoms, tells the prime minister that the public doesn't believe crime is falling because of the presence of "incivilities" in their neighbourhoods like graffiti or gangs of youths, which have a detrimental impact on the public's perception of safety.Peter Nayroud, chief constable of Thames Valley police, argued that there was no contradiction between better local policing and larger more capable forces.Following the annoucment this week from the home secretary, John Reid, that the proposed reduction of forces from 43 to 17 was being delayed for more consultation, Mr Nayroud warned Mr Blair not to drop the proposal."Difficult though this is, the government would be failing in its duty to protect the citizen if the current changes to forces do not happen," he said.Other ideas proposed by the panel of experts include; complete publication of all sentences on the web, webcams in local magistrates courts, special antisocial behaviour courts, greater provision of drug treatment in prison, and high-intensity focus on repeat offenders.Mr Blair's official spokesman said his speech tomorrow would reflect the premier's own experience of the system, dating back to his time as an opposition home affairs spokesman, the opinions of the experts and some frontline experience gathered in an inner city visit to be made this afternoon.The spokesman said: "He will argue that we need a proper, considered, intellectual and political debate about the nature of liberty in the modern world."He will present an historical analysis of how and why crime and immigration and the criminal justice system have changed over the past century and argue that the modern world has changed the nature of the debate between security and liberty."If we do not rebalance the system across a range of areas, the rights of law-abiding citizens will be put at risk."Commenting on the publication of the experts' letters the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "These comments are a telling indictment of the government's strategy over the last nine years. "They reinforce the concerns we have raised over the tidal wave of legislation, regulation and initiatives that have overwhelmed the Home Office and indeed the systems of criminal justice and immigration control."Far from announcing new reviews, more laws and even more initiatives, the prime minister and the home secretary would do well to buckle down to the serious business of government and to get a grip on the burgeoning bureaucracy that they have fostered, in order to deliver a long overdue improvement in public safety."The expert opinions can be viewed at www.number-10.gov.uk.
