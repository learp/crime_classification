A senior police officer today called for people charged with sex crimes to be placed on the sex offenders register before they appear in court.Deputy chief constable Robert Ovens, of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (Acpos), proposed the idea after it emerged that the prime suspect in the murder of schoolboy Rory Blackhall had skipped bail on sex offence charges.Simon Harris, 37, was awaiting trial on sex abuse charges when he is suspected of killing the 11-year-old boy.Harris appeared at Linlithgow sheriff court in February accused of abusing three girls between 1993 and 2000. He was released on bail, but failed to turn up in court on August 22 - the day after Rory's body was found in woods in the Deans area of Livingston, West Lothian.A warrant was issued for Harris's arrest after he missed the court date, but police said they were unaware that such a step had been taken. He was not on the sex offenders register as he had not been convicted of any crime.Mr Ovens, of Dumfries and Galloway police, told BBC Scotland it was worth exploring whether those facing sex crime charges should be placed on the sex offenders register on a temporary basis.He said: "There is certainly a need to ensure that anyone who is subject to an investigation for a sexual offence and has been charged, that all the agencies are working together to share information and to make sure that any risk posed by that individual is managed properly and minimised to the wider public."Questions as to whether they should be placed on the register are something which need to be explored, even if that is only on a temporary basis."The Scottish executive said an announcement was due "very soon" on bail, sex offenders in the community, and court reform.The Scottish first minister, Jack McConnell, yesterday pledged to update the way the legal system in Scotland deals with sex offenders in the light of Rory's murder."I have no doubt whatsoever that our laws and our procedures to manage sex offenders in the community, to update and improve the system of bail, the way in which our courts deal with bureaucracy and a whole range of other areas are in need of updating," he said.The Scottish National party's justice spokesman, Kenny MacAskill, said Harris should have been arrested immediately after failing to appear at his court hearing last week. He also questioned the court's decision to grant bail.Rory vanished after being dropped off near his school by his mother on the morning of Thursday August 18. His body was found in woodland three days later covered in a tattered tent. A postmortem examination found he had been asphyxiated.Yesterday Lothian and Borders police would not comment on reports that Rory had been sexually assaulted.
