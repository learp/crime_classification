One of five men, on trial in connection with the killing of PC Sharon Beshenivsky, has admitted to her murder, it has been revealed today.Mr Justice Andrew Smith, sitting at Newcastle crown court, lifted an order which had prevented a guilty plea, previously entered by Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah, 25, of no fixed address, being reported.The four other defendants, Yusuf Abdillh Jamma, 20, of Whitmore Road, Small Heath, Birmingham; Raza Ul-Haq Aslam, 25, of St Pancras Way, Kentish Town, north London; Faisal Razzaq, 25, and his 26-year-old brother Hassan, both of Sebert Road, Forest Gate, east London, all deny her murder.Shah alone was charged with the attempted murder of PC Beshenivsky's colleague, PC Teresa Milburn, who was also shot during the alleged armed robbery at a travel agents on November 18 last year. He denies the charge.The 38-year-old officer was shot dead on the day her daughter Lydia was celebrating her fourth birthday.On Monday, Mr Justice Smith told a group of potential jurors: "We are starting a long trial today. It is a trial about a shooting in Bradford last November in which a police officer called Sharon Beshenivsky died, and her colleague Teresa Milburn was injured."Five defendants are to be tried and the charges include the murder of the one police officer and the attempted murder of the other. The prosecution estimate that the trial will last six to eight weeks."Of course, that is only an estimate but everyone will be doing their best to avoid it going longer than that."The judge added the case would be opened tomorrow morning, as he had legal questions to consider in the meantime.
