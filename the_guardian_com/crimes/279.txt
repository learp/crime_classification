Penal reformers last night accused John Reid of surrendering home affairs policy to the tabloids, after the home secretary unveiled his criminal justice package.Mr Reid also faces a warning today from the former top official at the Home Office, Sir John Gieve, that increasing the pressure on prison capacity will significantly increase the risk of disorder and riots.Despite Mr Blair's original 1997 pledge to get "tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime", the policy document published yesterday outlining the 24-point "public protection" programme uses the words "tough" or "tougher" some 34 times - but mentions the "causes of crime" only once.Mr Reid told the Commons that longer sentences and 8,000 more prison places were needed to protect the "law-abiding majority", and insisted that the prison system was currently coping with its record numbers, even though the total rose by 400 in the past week alone.Britain already has the highest rate of imprisonment in western Europe, with more than 140 prisoners per 100,000 people. Since Labour came to power in 1997, average sentence lengths have risen from 20 months to 27 months, and 13 prisons have been built to house the ever rising inmate population.The law and order package, some of which was trailed in the Sun as "Blair axes soft sentences", angered penal reformers. Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust said: "Today is the day that John Reid surrendered home affairs policy to the Sun. The home secretary may have announced 8,000 more prison places, but this hotchpotch of eye-catching initiatives will fill them before they are even built."James Lowe of the Howard League for Penal Reform said that in the last six months the government had reversed its position "from a sensible recognition that prison doesn't work to one where it decides to waste more taxpayers' money by building more prisons".The criminal justice plan was announced on the 76th day after Mr Reid became home secretary; it follows Wednesday's radical rescue plan for the Home Office itself, and will be followed by a shake-up of the Immigration Service early next week.Penal reformers were particularly critical of Mr Reid's announcement that he had cancelled the planned introduction in November of David Blunkett's "custody plus" scheme, which would have seen 60,000 short-sentence prisoners, serving 12 months or less, put on tough community sentences, with only a short taste of prison instead.Earlier this year Charles Clarke, Mr Reid's immediate predecessor, praised the scheme, saying short-sentence prisoners did not remain in jail long enough to be usefully rehabilitated.Mr Reid said yesterday that he did not share that view. Instead, the home secretary announced plans to build more prison places, increase the length of sentences served by more serious offenders, tighten up parole arrangements, and get tougher with those who breach their release conditions.The wide ranging package also introduces measures to make offenders pay more compensation, including medical bills faced by their victims, and introduces parental compensation orders to make sure parents must pay for damage which their children cause.Mr Reid said he was confident that the money would be available to add an extra 8,000 prison places on top of the 900 already planned to be available by autumn next year. But with some speculating the extra prisons could be five years away, there is no current public timetable for their delivery.With only 1,100 spare places currently available before the prison governors start putting "jail full" notices on their gates, many observers find it difficult to see how the home secretary will square the circle in the meantime. He yesterday ruled out using expensive police cells, which would only add 400 extra places. But he strongly hinted that, in the medium term at least, he would like to see ways of ensuring that the mentally ill and vulnerable women offenders do not end up in prison.The warning of a significant risk of disorder in Britain's jails as a result of the increased pressure of numbers from Sir John Gieve, the former Home Office permanent secretary, comes in evidence published by the Commons public accounts committee.A Home Office paper submitted to MPs last November says that there are only two ways of managing the risk of ever rising prison numbers - to increase capacity or reduce the numbers in prison."The final option of last resort," it notes "would be 'executive release'. In practice, this would mean that prisoners nearing the end of their sentence would be released earlier than under the existing schemes."However, it is understood that Mr Reid has already rejected that option.Main pointsPrisons· 8,000 new prison places by 2012;· Violent offender orders to manage dangerous offenders after release, jail for breaches;· Rules on parole decisions changed - releases to be agreed unanimously;· Post-release conditions for persistent offenders;· New tactics to tackle problem drug users involved in crime;· More foreign national prisoners to serve their sentences in own countries;· Less jailing of women and non-dangerous people with mental health problems.Sentencing· Maximum penalty for carrying knife doubled to four years;· Discretional end to automatic one-third sentence discount for early guilty pleas;· Judges given discretion on parole of dangerous offenders;· Judges get more discretion over fixed-term sentences, ending automatic halving of sentence tariffs;· Tougher enforcement for breaches of release licence;· Those absconding or reoffending on bail returned to prison faster;· New enforcement service against people who do not pay fines.Extending summary justice· Expand use of conditional cautions so that prosecutors can impose penalties, such as fixed penalty fines or unpaid work, without need to go to court;· Bulk processing of offences such as failing to pay a TV licence so that magistrates' courts are used for more serious cases;· Abolish jury trials in serious fraud cases;· Live TV links from police stations to courts to speed up processing of low-level guilty pleas.Victims· Offenders to compensate victims.
