A teenager was stabbed to death in Sheffield after a group of up to 40 people, some armed with baseball bats and knives, fought outside a 16-year-old girl's birthday party.Emergency services were called to Rokeby Drive, Parson Cross, just after 11pm on Saturday. Witnesses said they saw the victim staggering in the street before he collapsed.The 18-year-old, named yesterday as Dale Robertson, was taken to hospital, where he died from his injuries, South Yorkshire police said. A 16-year-old and a 17-year-old were last night being held on suspicion of murder.Part of the street remained cordoned off as officers searched gardens and alleyways close to the murder scene. The police called for witnesses.A group of tearful youths arrived to place flowers at the scene yesterday afternoon. One said a fight had begun in the street and had been between rival gangs. "It all started after a bit of banter and name-calling between the two gangs. One of them walked off to go home and then they all started fighting. "About 40 people were involved in the fight - some were carrying baseball bats and knives. It lasted for about 10 minutes. At one point two cars came screeching up the street and you could hear them being trashed."He added that the victim had walked away before collapsing on the ground.It is understood members of one of the gangs were invited to the party, but that a rival group turned up without invitation.A pensioner who called the police said: "There was a tremendous noise and I saw a lot of men fighting. I didn't dare go out so I phoned the police. The next thing I hear, someone has been stabbed."
