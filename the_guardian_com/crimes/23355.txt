A 21-year-old woman was arrested earlier today after the Labour MP Stephen Timms was stabbed while holding his constituency surgery in Beckton, east London.The former junior Treasury minister and MP for East Ham was stabbed in the upper part of his body at 3.20pm but his injuries are not believed to be life threatening.He is recovering at Newham General hospital.A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "Police were called at 3.20pm following reports of a man in his 50s stabbed at Kingsford Way, east London. Police and ambulance attended. He has been taken to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries. A 21-year-old woman was arrested at the scene and is currently in custody at an east London police station."Timms, 54, has been MP for the constituency – and previously for Newham North East – since 1994.His personal popularity in his constituency is reflected by the fact that he secured a 7.7% swing from the Conservatives in last week's election, when Labour was generally losing ground across the country.He won a remarkable 70.4% of the vote and his 27,826 majority is the largest in the new House of Commons.Timms held jobs in the Labour administration throughout its 13 years in power, first as a parliamentary aide and then in ministerial posts as financial secretary to the Treasury and in the Departments for Social Security, Education, Trade and Industry and Work and Pensions.He joined the cabinet in 2006 as chief secretary to the Treasury – in effect, chancellor Gordon Brown's second-in-command, with responsibility for keeping departmental budgets under control.He was dropped from the cabinet and made competitiveness minister in the Business Department when Brown became prime minister in 2007, before moving back to the Department for Work and Pensions and then returning to his old job of financial secretary to the Treasury in 2008.He describes himself as a Christian Socialist and is Labour's vice-chairman for faith groups.In 2000 the then Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones was wounded and his aide, Andrew Pennington, killed in a frenzied sword attack during a constituency surgery at the party's office in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.Jones was conducting his weekly surgery when he received lacerations to his hands and arms after fending off blows from Robert Ashman, who was jailed for manslaughter and attempted murder.
