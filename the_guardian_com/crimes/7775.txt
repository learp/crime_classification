A man whose craving for attention led to his conviction for the murder of a man wrongly suspected of being a paedophile was released today after seven years on the orders of the court of appeal.Three senior judges ruled that fresh medical evidence cast doubt on whether 47-year-old Ian Lawless could have played the part he claimed in the 2001 killing of retired sea captain Alf Wilkins in Grimsby.Lawyers for the family of Lawless, a fantasist who tried to persuade fellow prisoners on remand that he was a Taliban fighter, triggered the fresh hearing by presenting medical findings to the criminal cases review commission. The former cellarman was given a life sentence in 2002 for setting fire to the flat of 67-year-old Wilkins, who had recently been cleared of abusing a nine-year-old girl.Lawless's unemployed godson Gary Lawson, then 19, was also convicted of murder and two neighbours on Grimsby's Yarborough estate were jailed for conspiracy and intimidation. Lawson, who is serving a life sentence, told police after his arrest: "When it became known that Alf was dead, everyone wanted to party."The trial at Hull crown court heard evidence of Lawless's drunken fantasies, but he was convicted on a majority verdict after more than three days' deliberation. The jury had earlier found Lawson guilty.Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Mrs Justice Gloster and Mrs Justice Dobbs, said today that the appeal court was satisfied that the new medical evidence "might have affected the jury's assessment of the reliability of the various confessions made by the appellant. Their verdict might have been different."The court also bore in mind the "very long period of deliberation" before the guilty verdict was returned.The new evidence, presented after an earlier appeal by Lawless failed, set out his personality disorder in detail, adding that his need for attention was made worse when he was drunk. Described at the trial by his own QC as "obnoxious", he made a string of confessions to fellow drinkers at a Grimsby pub, but later denied them to police.After the hearing, where the appeal was not opposed by the prosecution and no retrial was ordered, Lawless was released and came out of the royal courts of justice with members of his family and legal team. Standing beside his daughter Laura Jayne, he said: "I should never have been in there." He felt "ecstatic but strange" to be out of prison after so long.His solicitor, Mark Newby, said: "Ian is delighted to have his liberty today," but added that the case showed the continuing risk of "vulnerable people being pushed through the court process without the necessary safeguards in place".
