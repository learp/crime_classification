Two teenagers arrested in connection with firearms offences by detectives hunting the killer of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Liverpool were released by police tonight.The pair were taken into custody earlier today for the second time in two months. They were originally arrested on November 20 last year in connection with the youngster's murder but were released on bail. Rhys was shot dead in Croxteth, Liverpool, as he returned home from football practice in August last year. His mother, Melanie Jones, cradled her dying son in her arms in the Fir Tree pub car park near their family home. Nobody has yet been charged with the murder despite a high-profile police investigation and 18 arrests.A police spokesman said tonight: "Two males, aged 18 and 16 years, from Croxteth, who were rearrested in connection with firearms offences earlier today by detectives investigating the murder of Rhys Jones, have been released on police bail pending further inquiries."Both suspects had been taken into custody for questioning at police stations on Merseyside. Detectives said last year they were investigating a theory that the boy was hit by a bullet fired by a teenage gang member aiming at a rival. Rhys' mother and father Stephen, 44, have previously made appeals to the killer to come forward, but without success. There have been appeals for information from a woman driving a red car who nearly hit a youth, thought to be the gunman, as he cycled in front of her shortly after the shooting. Two BBC Crimewatch appeals, including a reconstruction of the shooting, leaflet drops, phone messaging and billboard adverts, have been made in Croxteth in an effort to identify the cyclist.
