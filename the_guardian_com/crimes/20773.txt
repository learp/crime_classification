Two teenage women who were murdered nearly 30 years ago were last seen by friends talking to two men in a busy pub, the trial of the man accused of the "World's End murders" has been told.Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, who had been school friends, disappeared after leaving the World's End bar, on Edinburgh's Royal Mile, on October 15 1977, during a night out with their friends Jacqueline Ingles and Toni Wale. Their bodies were later found in East Lothian, stripped and bound with their own clothing.The prosecution alleges the women were raped, assaulted and then strangled by Angus Sinclair, 62, with the help of his brother-in-law, Gordon Hamilton, who was then 22 and has since died. Mr Sinclair has put in a special defence incriminating Hamilton; he also claims that any sex with the girls was with their consent.During the first full day of evidence yesterday, Ms Ingles, 47, an auxiliary nurse, who now has the surname Thomson, told the high court in Edinburgh she had seen both girls talking to two men in the pub."What I can remember is going to the toilet, coming back, and Christine and Helen were sitting down with two men," she told the prosecutor, Alan Mackay. She said the friends had visited seven or eight pubs before getting to the World's End.At closing time Scott and Edie turned down an invitation to go on to a party with their friends and remained in the pub, the court heard.Another of the women's companions, Toni Hudson, 59, said Scott and Edie were sitting at a table with one man and another was standing alongside.This was the last time their friends saw them. Mr Sinclair is accused of persuading or forcing both women into a vehicle and taking them to East Lothian.The trial continues.
