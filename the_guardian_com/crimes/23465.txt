A man who carried out a series of rapes pleaded guilty yesterday to his campaign of assaults against lone women.Petros Anthia, 35, a builder from Cyprus, changed his plea to guilty three weeks into a crown court trial where he was accused of sexually assaulting nine women in north London and south Hertfordshire. Anthia, of Harringay, north London, drove his van around the streets before dragging his victims into undergrowth or parkland, St Albans crown court heard. He attacked the women as they walked home along well-lit streets in Arnos Grove and Enfield, north London, and St Albans and Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Anthia, a Greek Cypriot, admitted 10 charges of rape and three of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Three other charges alleging serious sexual assault were left on file. He raped the women be tween January 2003 and April 2004. He was arrested after forensic scientists found his DNA on the clothing of two victims. The women were always attacked from behind, Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting told the court. "Some women were raped, brutalised and beaten, some escaped, but all must have been terrified and some are still deeply affected by their ordeal," she said. In evidence some of the women recalled their attacker speaking with a foreign accent and also remembered him wearing gloves. Ms Moore said Anthia had a deformed hand which he may have tried to hide with gloves. It emerged yesterday that Anthia had been acquitted of a rape in 1999 after the alleged victim, a French woman, refused to give evidence. The Metropolitan police this time managed to persuade her to give evidence. Anthia is expected to be sentenced at St Albans crown court today.
