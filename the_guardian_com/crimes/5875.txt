The Yorkshire traffic policeman killed on Boxing Day after stopping a suspicious car was shot twice at close range, his inquest heard yesterday.PC Ian Broadhurst, who was 34 and married, was hit in the head and abdomen, Detective Superintendent Chris Gregg told the 10-minute hearing in Leeds. A postmortem examination by the Home Office pathologist Christopher Milroy confirmed that he died from gunshot wounds. He was shot in Dib Lane, east Leeds, after questioning the driver of a BMW which turned out to be stolen. The West Yorkshire coroner, David Hinchcliff, adjourned the inquest until further notice after passing official condolences to his family. The officer's colleague PC Neil Roper, a former miner aged 45 with two children, was also shot and is recovering from surgery in a convalescent home. A third officer called in as back-up, PC James Banks, 26, escaped injury when the bullet ricocheted off his radio and belt buckle. Mr Hinchcliff released Mr Broadhurst's body for burial. The funeral service will be held in Leeds parish church next Friday, with a private committal for family and friends. David Francis Bieber, 35, an American nightclub bouncer also known as Nathan Wayne Coleman, was remanded to Wakefield prison on Thursday, accused of murdering Mr Broadhurst and the attempted murder of the two other officers.
