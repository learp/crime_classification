Dartmoor, Brixton and Holloway prisons were yesterday named as the worst in England and Wales, as a new official rating system branded them "one-star" jails.The three prisons were all graded performance level one by the Home Office for "failing to provide secure, ordered, or decent regimes" or failing to hit most of their targets.The new rating system, under which all 138 prisons in England and Wales have been graded, also named five exceptional "high-performing prisons" which are outstripping similar jails with similar resources.The "five-star" prisons are: Frankland, in Durham; Lancaster Farms, Lancaster; Usk/Prescoed, Monmouthshire; Whatton, Nottingham; and the Group 4 privately run Altcourse prison in Liverpool.Their governors are to be given extra money to reward their staff or to invest in the prison regime, and they will also be given a special plaque.Seven other prisons were named in the top performance category but were not given the special "high-performing prison" status.At the other end of the scale two further prisons, Bullingdon in Oxfordshire and Eastwood Park, a women's jail in Gloucestershire, were warned yesterday that they face privatisation if they do not improve. They are to be given extra resources and four months to produce proposals to improve their regimes. Eastwood Park was criticised in the mid-1990s for having cells that were too small.The three worst prisons, Brixton, Dartmoor and Holloway, have all been the subject of scathing recent reports from the chief inspector of prisons.Brixton was named two years ago as one of the six worst "hell holes" in the prison service.Dartmoor was identified as a place where inmates were routinely abused and degraded by prison officers. Holloway, Britain's biggest women's prison, was criticised in February for imprisoning pregnant teenagers in wholly inadequate conditions.Martin Narey, the commissioner for correctional services, said that the table had been introduced to show how prisons were performing. "It clearly demonstrates where the public are getting value for money and where there is room for improvement," he said.But penal reformers criticised the decision to publish a prisons league table.Juliet Lyon, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the table raised more questions than it answered. "For hospitals and schools there is patient choice and parent power. Neither prisoners nor the courts have a say where people go or what happens to them when they get there."Will naming and shaming prisons in this way provide the public with any more information or will it simply put overstretched staff under even greater pressure?" she asked.The new system has rated every prison in England and Wales on a performance scale of one to four. The five highest-performing jails are in category four, but can be considered "five-star" prisons because they have been given the extra status.Twelve prisons were placed in the four-star category; 101 were given three stars; 22 two stars; and three were put in the lowest, one-star category.A prison service spokesman said the ratings were a professional judgment based on costs, performance against targets, and compliance with prison service standards combined with findings from independent inspectors and monitoring boards. They also took into account the views of area managers on more subjective factors, such as decency and willingness to change.Stars and barsTop · Albany, Isle of Wight · Altcourse, Liverpool · Bullwood Hall, Essex · Camp Hill, Isle of Wight · Frankland, Durham · Lancaster Farms, Lancaster · Low Newton, Durham  · Swinfen Hall, Staffordshire · Usk/Prescoed, Monmouthshire · Wayland, Norfolk · Whatton, Nottingham · Whitemoor, CambridgeshireBottom · Brixton, south London  · Dartmoor, Devon · Holloway, north London
