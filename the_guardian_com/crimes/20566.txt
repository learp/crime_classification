Max Clifford has taken aim at the legal process for allowing seven alleged victims to remain anonymous as he pleaded not guilty to indecent assault.The celebrity publicist was greeted by a media scrum as he arrived at Southwark crown court in central London on Friday morning for a pre-trial hearing.Clifford told the waiting media: "I'm totally innocent of these charges."It's been a very hard time for myself, my wife, my family and my loved ones but I have been helped tremendously by the public support I get everywhere I go and that has made a huge difference."Clifford pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of indecent assault. His trial is scheduled to begin on 4 March next year.After the hearing, he said: "I don't think it's fair that they remain anonymous because their accusations are so damaging. Effectively, I've been punished since I was arrested last December in a very public fashion while they remain anonymous."The charges relate to seven alleged female victims, aged between 15 and 19 at the time, between 1966 and 1984.The judge, Anthony Leonard QC, released Clifford on bail on condition that he lives and sleeps at his home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and has no unsupervised contact with anyone under 18.Clifford has maintained his innocence since his arrest under Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation into alleged sexual offences by Jimmy Savile and others, last December. The charges Clifford faces are unrelated to Savile.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
