Both before and after he killed Jane Longhurst, Graham Coutts was a frequent visitor to internet sites which deal graphically with necrophilia and death by asphyxiation. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which helps to police the net, examined some of the sites he had logged on to and concluded that they could be caught by the Obscene Publications Act 1959. However, as the sites are hosted by service providers overseas, the UK authorities have no power to act. The IWF said last night that such content was more difficult to combat than images of child abuse, because there was less of an international consensus about its unacceptability. There is disagreement over the link between pornography and violent sexual crime. However, the American serial sexual murderer Ted Bundy, who was executed in 1989, once said in a radio interview that he had become addicted to increasingly explicit images of violence. "You begin to wonder if, maybe, actually doing it will give you that which is beyond just reading about it or looking at it," he said.
