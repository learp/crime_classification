The police version of events surrounding the death of British teenager Scarlett Keeling in Goa contains a mass of contradictions, a court heard today.The near-naked body of the 15-year-old was found on the sea shore at Anjuna in north Goa in February 2008. The initial police inquiry concluded she had drowned accidentally but a fresh investigation mounted in the face of heavy criticism of the handling of the case found that she had been attacked and raped.Today at the opening session of the trial of the two men subsequently charged over her death – Samson D'Souza, 28, and Placido Carvalho, 36 – defence lawyers made clear they intend to target what they regard as contradictions and omissions in the official police account.Defence lawyer Ryan Menezes questioned why the report from the police officer who initially found the body contained no reference to injuries, although in subsequent reports he described seeing blood coming from her mouth.Menezes also highlighted two contradictory accounts from the same officer about when and how the teenager's body was moved on to the beach, along with a number of other apparent differences between the officer's initial and subsequent statements.Giving evidence in the children's court in the state capital of Panaji, the officer, Police Constable Gurunath Naik, described how he received a phone call at 7.15am on 18 February 2008 from an unknown person to say that there was a dead body floating in the sea at Anjuna beach.The 29-year-old officer, cross-examined by a special public prosecutor, SR Rivankar, and the judge, BP Deshpande, said he went to the beach with a colleague and walked for about 200 metres before spotting the body."The sea was splashing the body," Naik told the court. He said it appeared to be the body of a female foreigner which was naked except for a bra on the right shoulder."From observation I saw that the eyes were partly opened and the mouth was partly open," he said.He said he called a superior officer by phone. "When we were waiting the body was drifting in the sea water," he said, adding that they moved it two and a half metres on to the beach.In his first written statement Naik had described how a boy arrived on the scene and was sent to get a bed sheet to cover the body because it was naked.Under questioning from Menezes, Naik was unable to explain why he had made no mention of any injuries in the initial report but later reported that he had observed blood coming out of the victim's mouth.The defence also questioned when Naik first reported back to his superiors, referring to a later statement in which the officer noted that "the body would shift in the waves because the sea was rough" and that he moved the body and only then informed his superiors.Under further cross-examination, Naik was also unable to explain why in a subsequent statement he had said that the body had already been moved from the water by a worker from a nearby beach shack.The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday afternoon at the conclusion of Naik's evidence. Keeling's family has long argued that the police investigation was flawed and that Carvalho and D'Souza should not be the only men in the dock.The pair face charges including culpable homicide, sexual assault, outraging modesty and destroying evidence. D'Souza, appearing in a white and blue check shirt, sat in front of Carvalho, in a pink shirt, to the rear of the court as the evidence was heard.Keeling was on a six-month holiday in India with her mother, Fiona MacKeown, and other family members when she died. She had been left behind in Goa while the others travelled to Karnataka.MacKeown is due to give evidence in the coming weeks, though she faces a possible jail term in the UK after she was convicted of falsely claiming £19,000 in benefits between 2005 and 2008. She is listed at number 25 in the order of witnesses, although it is is possible her evidence may be taken earlier.The trial is expected to last for the rest of the year.
