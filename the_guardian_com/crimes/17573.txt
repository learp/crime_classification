Violent crime rose by 5% last year, according to new figures out today from the government.The authoritative British Crime Survey showed a rise in reported robberies recorded by the police.There were 101,370 robberies in recorded crime figures for England and Wales - the highest level for three years.And a separate analysis of the impact the controversial licensing reforms have had on crime showed an increase in offences during night-time hours in the year after 24-hour drinking was introduced.The BCS report came ahead of a crime reduction strategy to be outlined by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, today.She told GMTV there was still more the police could do to tackle crime but praised their efforts.She said: "I think and the police themselves think ... that there is more they can do and more their partners can do to help reduce crime and reduce fear of crime."Ms Smith added: "Technology can help but we do want our police, and our community support officers and others like those working for the council in our neighbourhood, to be visible, to be able to talk to them so that together it is possible to make a difference."The figures show there were 940,522 violent crimes and cases of disorder and criminal damage committed from 6pm to 6am in the year after pubs and clubs were given permission to open later, compared with 933,701 in the previous year.The Home Office said the number of more serious violent crimes fell after the licensing reforms overall but there were increases between 3am and 6am.The report said: "The rise from 3am and up to 6am is likely to reflect the change in the closing hours of licensed premises and the increased numbers of people in a public place at these times, including the police, with greater resources being placed on the streets to deal with disorder."Critics of the licensing reforms are likely to seize on the figures as evidence that later opening hours has simply pushed drink-related violence to a later time slot.Causing death by dangerous driving or while under the influence of drink or drugs reached its highest level for 30 years.There were 462 cases in the year, up 7%.Recorded crime figures showed drug offences increased by 9% last year to 194,300 cases.It included a 9% rise in possession of cannabis to 130,000 incidents, which Home Office statistics experts said was due to the police handing out more warnings to users following the drug's reclassification to class C.Possession of other controlled drugs also rose, showing a 12% rise to more than 36,600 cases.The total number of recorded crimes fell by 2% to 5.4m.But there were large rises in the categories of trafficking people for sexual exploitation (up 30%) and sexual grooming (up 36%), which reflects greater police activity in combating such crimes.In the BCS - which estimates total crime levels based on interviews with 40,000 members of the public - the Home Office claimed the 5% rise in violent crime was not statistically significant.The only BCS category to show a statistically significant change was a 10% increase in vandalism, the Home Office said.However, police chiefs have been criticised by the home affairs select committee, which said today that extra resources had not helped the police reduce crime.The committee found that the drop in levels of crime had taken place before the injection of funds began.But its acting chairman, David Winnick, said: "We know the police have had a major increase in funding over the past decade but it is much more difficult to tell what they have done with it."The BCS - seen by the government as the most reliable indicator of crime trends - has previously been criticised for excluding offences against under-16s.Now Home Office officials have disclosed that future rounds of the massive interview-based poll may include youngsters, as well as people living in group residences such as student halls of residence and old people's homes, which are also currently missed out of the poll.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the rise in violent crime showed the government's "serial failure to protect the public" and accused ministers of acting "recklessly" on licensing reform. "These figures show Labour continue to fail on crime," he said. "The increase in violent crime betrays a serial failure to protect the public. "The government need to realise that drugs fuel all other crime, ruin communities and destroy lives. "If we do not tackle drugs, all our other efforts to fight crime are rendered worthless. This means doing more than just consulting on cannabis reclassification." He added: "This increase in violent crime is also due to, and compounded by, the crisis in our prisons. "With offenders being released early or escaping jail completely, criminals are not deterred from committing violent crime, nor do they receive sustained and proper rehabilitation. "This is why half of all crime is committed by people who have been through the criminal justice system." He added: "The fact a separate analysis has shown that night crime increased after the introduction of 24-hour drinking is yet more evidence why the government should have listened to our call to pilot the scheme and assess its consequences instead of recklessly unleashing it on our towns and communities."
