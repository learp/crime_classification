The Tottenham Hotspur manager, Harry Redknapp, and the Sheffield Wednesday chairman, Milan Mandaric, sat side by side in the bullet-proof glass encased dock at Southwark crown court in the manner of two children playing buses, to hear the prosecution open the Crown's case that Redknapp received $295,000 (£189,500) from Mandaric as "a bung or offshore bonus that the parties had absolutely no intention of paying taxes for" while the two men were manager and chairman respectively of Portsmouth FC. Redknapp, the favourite to succeed Fabio Capello as England manager in the summer, had arrived at court with his son Jamie and the chief executive of the League Managers' Association, Richard Bevan, among his entourage.The morning's proceedings were devoted to swearing in the jury and hearing legal submissions from prosecution and defence. There was nothing here to mirror the rigmarole and grandeur of Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial By Jury apart from the lawyers' wigs.Court No6 is a functional wood-panelled box, the timber and red carpet giving it the air of a 1970s school language laboratory or municipal crematorium. The central heating was turned up soporifically high and the acoustics were poor for those stationed behind the legal teams, deployed in two banks of six, and the dock in which Redknapp, wearing Alan Whicker-esque horn-rimmed spectacles, flicked through the file of documents pertaining to the prosecution's case when they were referred to and exchanged the odd word with his co-defendant. He looked chipper and dapper in his navy-check suit and tie.Throughout Mandaric was the more demonstrative of the two, occasionally titivating his hair, yet the only conspicuous sign of dismay came from Redknapp's slow shake of the head when John Black QC, leading for the Crown, ended a long appraisal of the former Portsmouth manager's occupational talent with a statement outlining the Crown's assessment of him in regard to the charges he faces."He is currently enjoying what may be described as footballing success," Black said. "They [Tottenham] are currently riding high and are placed today as third in the league even after yesterday's disappointment. Talented and popular he might have been, the Crown says he was nevertheless a hard-headed businessman, with a financial acumen and keen sense of his pecuniary worth to his employers."The Crown went on to outline its case, that two sums were paid by Mandaric into a bank account Redknapp had opened in Monaco "intended to obscure and to render less transparent the nature of the money payments". The prosecution said that these two payments, totalling £189,500, derived from a profit bonus due to Redknapp for the sale of Peter Crouch from Portsmouth to Aston Villa, under the terms of his former contract as the club's director of football. When he became manager the scale of his bonus for net profit the club made on players he had bought and then sold had been reduced from 10% to 5% and Crouch had been transferred two days after Redknapp succeeded Graham Rix at Fratton Park.There was some mirth as Black described the prosecution case that Redknapp had flown to Monaco in 2002 and opened that particular account, called Rosie 47, a designation arrived at by combining the name of his dog with the year of his birth, a cute variation of the old porn handle game. It was, said the Crown, "quite deliberate" and "highly relevant" that the account was not in his own name.Court adjourned for the day midway through the prosecution's opening statement. Football, said His Honour Judge Leonard, in his opening remarks to potential jurors, was a game where allegiance to and prejudice against clubs and individuals were commonplace. Well-wishers and those ill-disposed to the defendants or the clubs with which they had been involved were asked to disbar themselves from service.A few of the former, though, were present in the public gallery and afterwards Redknapp cordially thanked them for their words of support. That geniality, famously seen when dispensing titbits to Sky Sports News from the rolled-down window of his car exiting Spurs Lodge on transfer deadline day, seemed to survive the first testing day in court.
