Ministers should set up a timetable within six months to close down existing women's prisons and replace them with a local network of small custodial units reserved only for those who are a danger to the public, according to a Home Office-commissioned report published yesterday.The radical approach is recommended as a result of a nine-month review of the position of vulnerable women in the criminal justice system carried out by the Labour baroness Jean Corston. It was ordered by the former home secretary Charles Clarke in the face of demands for a public inquiry following the deaths of six women at Styal prison in Cheshire.Although the current home secretary, John Reid, has talked of the need to remove vulnerable women from prisons, the report was given a low-key welcome by the Home Office, which said only that it would be carefully studied.Lady Corston said yesterday that a large proportion of the 4,300 women in prison in England and Wales could be better dealt with in community centres which could deal with their problems of mental illness, addiction and history of abuse."I am dismayed to see so many women frequently sentenced for short periods of time for very minor offences, causing chaos and disruption to their lives and families, without any realistic chance of addressing the causes of their criminality," she said.The effect on the 18,000 children whose mothers were sent to prison each year was nothing short of catastrophic.The average sentence of 42 days is just long enough for many to lose their home and contact with their children.Lady Corston said a radically different approach was needed, with ministers announcing a clear strategy within six months to replace existing women's prisons such as Holloway and Styal with small, geographically dispersed, multi-functional custodial centres within 10 years.
