An art collector and his wife who were tied up at knifepoint and robbed of almost £2m worth of Lowry paintings have spoken of the ordeal they endured, in front of their two-year-old daughter, at the hands of three masked robbers.The raiders burst into Ivan and Louise Aird's home in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire, early last Thursday morning, after Mrs Aird answered the front door to a man dressed as a postman. Three men threatened to kill their daughter Sabrina unless they handed over their collection of LS Lowry's works, including the artist's palette and paintbrushes.One of the stolen works, The Viaduct, worth £700,000, once belonged to the actor Alec Guinness.Mr Aird said yesterday: "These paintings were my own personal collection -they're something I've been collecting all my life. It was like a pension - something to pass on to my daughter. I think this was well planned. I am not interested in the money - I just want the pictures back."He said the robbers would not be able to sell the pictures, because they were so famous. Lowry was a friend of his family and his father, an art dealer, used to buy Lowry's works.Mr Aird said the family now felt very uncomfortable in their own home."The people who've done this need to be caught," he said. "They held a knife to a two-year-old girl. They shouldn't be out there on the streets."
