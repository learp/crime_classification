The home secretary, Theresa May, has appointed the chief of the National Crime Agency to conduct an investigation into how North Wales police handled allegations of child abuse in the 1970s and 1980s.Keith Bristow, the director general of the NCA, is to review how police originally handled the case, as well as look at the latest allegations by one of the victims.May made her statement to MPs following fresh allegations by the BBC Newsnight programme and others that both the police and a subsequent public inquiry led by Sir Ronald Waterhouse into abuse at almost 40 children's homes in the region were not carried out properly, and claims of a cover-up on behalf of a close ally of Lady Thatcher."The government is treating these allegations with the utmost seriousness," May told MPs. "Child abuse is a hateful, abhorrent and disgusting crime and we must not allow these allegations to go unanswered."She said Britain had "an appalling and shameful" record in relation to young people in care.She indicated that the government was still considering a wider public inquiry into all the issues raised by a series of claims about police and other institutions ignoring allegations of abuse, not just in north Wales but in other recent cases, such as revelations about the TV and radio presenter Jimmy Savile, and the treatment of victims of the sex ring preying on children in care in Rochdale.But she resisted calls from MPs from both sides of the House of Commons for an immediate decision to bring together what are now at least nine separate inquiries covering the north Wales and Savile claims."If, at the end of the process we have set in train, it appears it is necessary to move forward to a wider investigation, we'll look forward to that," May said. "At this stage we need to get the police investigations under way and make sure the Waterhouse inquiry did what it was intended to do and did it properly."Ending her statement, May addressed the fact that MPs could use parliamentary privilege, without fear of prosecution for defamation, to name one or more of the public figures alleged on the internet to be involved in the abuse at north Wales care homes. But she warned: "If they [MPs] plan to use parliamentary privilege to name any suspects, they risk jeopardising any future trial and, therefore, the possibility of justice for the victims that I believe the whole House wants to see."In the event, no individuals were named. But the Labour MP Susan Jones said if any member of the House of Lords was found to be involved in child abuse they should be "stripped of their peerage".The Labour backbencher Tom Watson, who has raised claims of a past paedophile ring linked to No 10 and of a former cabinet minister being allegedly involved in child abuse, dismissed the latest moves as simply "the next stage of a cover-up".Watson had urged the government to act after one of the alleged victims,Â Steve Messham, said the Waterhouse inquiry had only covered a fraction of the assaults.On Newsnight, Messham said he had been abused by a senior Tory and said the claims had been "swept under the carpet". According to reports at the weekend, as many as three victims have named the same individual as one of their abusers. Newsnight said at least one other victim of abuse in the homes said he was abused by the politician.Messham was due to meet the Welsh secretary, David Jones, on Tuesday.May's statement followed the announcement by David Cameron on Monday that there would be two investigations into the claims about the north Wales abuse and inquiries in the 1990s.The prime minister said during a trip to the Middle East that he would appoint a senior independent figure to lead an inquiry into the conduct of the Waterhouse inquiry, including the remit it was given and claims that it ignored evidence from victims about abusers who were not employed at the care homes.No 10 said on Tuesday that details of who would lead the inquiry, its exact remit and timing were being discussed with the Welsh assembly, which now has devolved responsibility for the issue."We want to get on with this and don't want to take too much time, but equally it's got to be done properly," the prime minister's official spokesman said.Announcing details of the police inquiry, May said Bristow would head a team which would include officers from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre. It would act as the single point of contact for fresh referrals relating to historic abuse. An initial report was expected by this April, she said.The NCA becomes operational next year.Responding to several complaints that the police investigation did not go far enough to tackle the actual claims of abuse, May said the Bristow inquiry would have powers to carry out criminal inquiries into any allegations of sexual or physical abuse that were not properly investigated by the original police operation."[It will] look at those historic allegations to make sure everything that was supposed to be done was done, and if there are any avenues to pursue in terms of criminal investigations the police should take them wherever they are going," she said.Later, May reiterated that the government had been "absolutely clear" that "if there are people who should be pursued for prosecution, that then takes place"."I believe the whole House will also be united in sending this message to victims of child abuse: 'If you have suffered and you go to the police about what you have been through, those of us in positions of authority and responsibility will not shirk our duty to support you. We must do everything in our power to do everything we can to help you, and everything we can to get to the bottom of these terrible allegations.'"
