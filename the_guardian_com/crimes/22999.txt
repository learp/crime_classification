A Muslim activist sought to raise money for insurgents fighting British troops in Iraq, a court heard today.Abu Izzadeen was one of eight men who gathered at the Regents Park mosque to appeal for donations for terrorist forces in November 2004, the court was told.Izzadeen, who is being tried at Kingston crown court under the name of Omar Brooks, and his co-defendants are charged with fund-raising for the purposes of terrorism.He is also charged with one count of encouragement of terrorism, following a speech he made in Birmingham in July 2006.Prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw told the court that the eight men gathered at the mosque in Regents Park when US troops were locked in a fierce battle for the city of Fallujah in Iraq.Izzadeen, along with Abdul Saleem, Shah Jalal Hussain, Omar Zaheer, Simon Keeler, Rajib Khan, Ibrahim Hassan and Abdul Muhid, denounced the US in speeches made both inside the mosque and later, after a clash with the mosque authorities, out on the street.The court heard that their preaching quickly went much further than mere protest.Mr Laidlaw said: "Freedom of expression has its limits and what is not permitted is speeches which are in fact appeals for money to assist with the insurgency or to seek to encourage others to join in the jihad there."He said that all eight men were members of an extreme religious group known as al-Muhajiroun. The group was led by Omar Bakri, who left the UK for Lebanon several years ago, and was disbanded around the time of the Regents Park mosque speech.Izzadeen has claimed that he has been "the subject of a campaign designed to bring about his arrest".All eight men are charged with fund-raising contrary to the Terrorism Act of 2000. Izzadeen, Saleem, Keeler, Khan and Hassan are also charged with inciting terrorism overseas.Izzadeen faces a further charge of encouragement of terrorism and Hassan is charged with possession for terrorist purposes of a document called "How can I train myself for jihad?"
