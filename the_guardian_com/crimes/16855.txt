A village postmaster bludgeoned his sleeping wife to death before concocting an unlikely story of an armed raid on their store, a murder trial has been told.Robin Garbutt, of Melsonby, North Yorkshire, denies beating Diana Garbutt, 40, with a metal rod and waiting at least four hours before dialling 999 to say: "My wife's been attacked, she's gone a funny colour, there's blood on the pillow."When officers arrived at the scene, Garbutt claimed a man with a gun had entered the shop at 8.30am in March last year, soon after he had opened for business, told him to lock up, switch off the lights and "not do anything stupid".He was then forced to fill a holdall with cash, he told police. The gunman left and Garbutt said he ran upstairs where he discovered the terrible scene in the bedroom. However, when the paramedics arrived they spotted signs of rigor mortis in the body, including hypostasis, the pooling of blood in tissue after the heart has stopped.David Hatton QC, prosecuting, told the jury at Teesside crown court, Middlesbrough, that medical experts estimate that Diana Garbutt was killed between 2.30 and 4.30am. The court heard the couple had eaten fish and chips at 8.30pm the previous evening, and Diana Garbutt's digestion had stopped between six and eight hours later."One of the questions you will have to consider, if you accept this evidence, is the likelihood of a robber or robbers not only being prepared to violently kill a female sleeping in her own bed, but then, having done so, to wait for four to six hours before going downstairs to rob the post office," said Hatton. "And further, the likelihood of their waiting for that length of time, with the defendant himself unharmed and unrestrained to raise the alarm."The jury heard Diana Garbutt was a former court official who had retrained as a postmistress but soon lost interest in the business. She often stayed in bed until at least 8.30am, while her husband got up at 4am to get the post office and shop ready.The state of Robin Garbutt's finances were revealed after the death, when police discovered he had debts of £30,000 and found evidence of large cash payments into his account.Hatton told the jury the shop made only a modest profit, and any theft from the Post Office would have come to light as a relief postmistress was due to take over while the couple went on holiday in the US.Police were called to the premises a year earlier, in March 2009, when Robin Garbutt reported a £10,000 robbery. No arrests were made and no one else in the village reported anything suspicious.Similarly Hatton said no one in Melsonby had seen anything out of the ordinary on the morning of the alleged raid by a masked intruder. Detectives also discovered the post office safe, which was electronically disabled before 8.30am, was opened just over a minute before Robin Garbutt made the call to the emergency services.A metal bar, believed to be the murder weapon, was found on a garage wall opposite the post office, and rust particles similar to others on the rod were found in the bedroom and on Robin Garbutt's clothes.The trial continues.
