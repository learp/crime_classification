Road safety campaigners have condemned the decision not to ban a Conservative peer who admitted driving at 113mph on a dual carriageway.Lord Howard, 63, already had two speeding convictions when he was caught breaking the limit on the A47 at Terrington St John, Norfolk, in February. But despite his guilty plea, magistrates in King's Lynn, Norfolk, decided not to ban the peer from driving, after he argued that such a ban would cause hardship for the charities he works for. Lord Howard, of Castle Rising, Norfolk, is a landowner, a councillor with King's Lynn and West Norfolk borough council and chairman of the National Playing Fields Association. Brigitte Chaudhry, president of the charity RoadPeace, said: "It is quite amazing that someone who has previous driving convictions has been allowed to continue to offend. It shows a complete disregard for the road and the law." A spokesman for the Institute of Advanced Motorists said: "It is not very good to hear that someone who has been exceeding the speed limit by so much is still being allowed to keep their licence. What kind of message does that send out?" Lord Howard was fined Â£470 and had six points added to his licence, bringing the total to 12, following the hearing on Tuesday. He told the court he divided his time between House of Lords duties and council work and said he travelled frequently in his work for charity.
