Police have launched a murder inquiry – but said they were not seeking any other suspects – after a husband and wife were found dead at their home in Somerset. Postmortem examinations found that Tracey Baker, 42, died from multiple head injuries and her husband, Kevin, 35, appeared to have killed himself.Officers were called to the house in Chard at around 10.15am on Sunday. On Monday, police were seen searching undergrowth near the modern redbrick property.Neighbours said the couple had two daughters and a son. One resident said the couple had recently had problems after the husband stopped working as a builder due to health issues.The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: “I’ve not long found out what happened, I’ve just finished talking to the police. I don’t know much about what happened. I know that they hadn’t been getting on very well recently. I think he was still living there but there were a few nights recently when he didn’t come home.”She added: “They’ve got three children, they’re quite young. They were lovely, such nice people. Tracey was absolutely gorgeous. If I went out the front she would always say hello. It’s so sad, I just don’t know what to think.”The senior investigating officer, Andy Mott, of Avon and Somerset police, said: “Our thoughts are very much with the families affected by this tragic incident and they’re continuing to be supported by specially trained family liaison officers.“Although we’re not looking for anyone else in connection with these deaths, our inquiries will continue to develop a full understanding of what happened, following which, a file will be supplied to the coroner’s office.”
