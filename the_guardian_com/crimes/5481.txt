Stephen Lawrence's mother has given her grimmest assessment yet of the chances of catching her son's murderers, saying they would need to confess for them to be convicted.The 10th anniversary of the stabbing of the 18-year-old student by a racist gang falls on Tuesday. Doreen Lawrence said her biggest "grief" was the fact that the five prime suspects were still at large, and probably only their own admission of guilt or a "miracle" would see them jailed.No one has been convicted of the murder at a south-east London bus stop on April 22 1993. Several police inquiries have tried to repair the damage caused by the blunders of the first investigation, which was found by a public inquiry to have been hampered by institutional racism. For more than 18 months the crown prosecution service has been considering files sent to it by an elite team of Scotland Yard detectives. Mrs Lawrence told the Guardian: "Part of me thinks it won't ever happen because they've lost so much time. Unless they confess, it will take a miracle to get the evidence to convict them." The Guardian has learned that the reinvestigation headed by former deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve produced new evidence tying two of the original five suspects, Jamie Acourt and David Norris, to the crime. But lawyers are still debating whether it could form the basis of a new prosecution. A source with knowledge of the case said: "There are other cases such as [Jill] Dando in which the smallest piece of evidence has been enough to... get a conviction. "There is enough evidence, probably more than in Dando, against some of the five suspects." Gary Dobson, Neil Acourt and Luke Knight, were acquitted at the Old Bailey in 1996 after a private prosecution failed. As the law stands they cannot be prosecuted for Stephen's murder.
