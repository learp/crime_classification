A couple who were arrested after a shooting incident during a burglary at their home will not face criminal charges, prosecutors have announced.Andy Ferrie, 35, and his wife, Tracey, 43, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after a legally-owned shotgun was fired during a break-in at their home in Welby, Leicestershire, in the early hours of Sunday.The Ferries were released on police bail as police announced that two men had been charged with burgling the property near Melton Mowbray.In a statement released by the Crown Prosecution Service, Judith Walker, the chief crown prosecutor for the East Midlands, said: "Looking at the evidence, it is clear to me that Mr and Mrs Ferrie did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves, and their home, from intruders."Ms Walker said: "Earlier this afternoon, the head of the East Midlands Complex Casework Unit, Lawrence English, visited the scene of the incident to see for himself whether the accounts given by Mr and Mrs Ferrie were consistent with other evidence of what happened."I am satisfied that this is a case where householders, faced with intruders in frightening circumstances, acted in reasonable self-defence."The law is clear that anyone who acts in good faith, using reasonable force, doing what they honestly feel is necessary to protect themselves, their families or their property, will not be prosecuted for such action."Daniel Mansell, 33, from Leicester, pleaded guilty to burglary at Loughborough magistrates' court on Wednesday and will be sentenced at Leicester crown court on 25 September.Joshua O'Gorman, 27, who is also charged with the burglary, did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody to appear before magistrates on 14 September.The court heard the Ferries had been woken in the night by the sound of banging and breaking glass.Sally Cook, prosecuting, said: "It is no secret that a shotgun was fired at the property."She said Mansell, who appeared to have his arm in a sling, had been injured inside the property and was arrested later at hospital in Leicester.The arrest of the Ferries after the incident at their isolated cottage has reopened the long-running debate about the rights of householders.Rutland and Melton MP, Alan Duncan, said the real crime would be if the couple were prosecuted for defending their home.On hearing the news that the couple would not face further action, he said: "I'm delighted the CPS has seen sense and has exonerated them. The law has worked and so has the system," he said."The focus must be on the burglars and not the victims. My constituents can hold their heads high."He added: "I hope they can sleep happily and safely at home this evening."
