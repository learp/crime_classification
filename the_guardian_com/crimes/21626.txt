You provide a fascinating snapshot of life behind bars for the country's 80,000 inmates (A day inside, G2, March 12). But the growing prisons crisis has consequences that reach far wider. More than 150,000 children suffer the trauma of having a parent imprisoned each year. These children are forced to cope with stigma, bullying and isolation, and many develop mental-health problems. Although this group are at risk of falling into a cycle of poverty and deprivation, there is no official body responsible for their needs. The government cannot seriously tackle crime and social exclusion without taking into account the needs of this most vulnerable group.Lucy GampellDirector, Action for Prisoners' FamiliesPrison official Marilyn Welsh is quoted as saying: "The prisoners here are men aged 15-18." To speak of 15-, 16- and 17-year-old prisoners as "men" betrays an attitude of mind that was outdated even by the standards of 19th-century prison reformers. The report later in the survey that a child of 15 died while under restraint by adult officers shows just how much further we have to go before we can claim to run a civilised penal system.Terry MunyardLondonMost of the arguments advanced and remedies suggested - such as holding offenders in small secure centres where they could be closer to their homes and families - surely apply just as much to male offenders (Study calls for women's jails to be shut, March 13). Why in 2007 should women be treated more leniently just because of their gender?John KanefskyMorchard Bishop, Devon
