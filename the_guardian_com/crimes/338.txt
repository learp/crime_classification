He was in my class. He was a smashing guy, really nice chap. The picture of us in the football team was after we did a 24-hour sponsored football match to raise money for the sports hall.“We would have been about 14 years old. Everyone got on with Adrian, he was a lovely bloke. He was a bright student, he loved sport. He was in the rugby team.”Knight said Ajao’s family – his mother, Janet, and stepfather, Phillip – were a great family.Ajao, who took his stepfather’s surname after his mother’s marriage, left Huntleys school at 16 and Knight lost touch with him.
