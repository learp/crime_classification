An ambitious project aimed at putting a radio station in every jail in the country was launched last week at Winson Green prison in Birmingham.Although intended primarily as an educational tool, the scheme may also produce a bonus for its main sponsor, the BBC, in the form of a steady stream of material for its local and national radio stations.The scheme, Prison Radio Project, has evolved via a partnership with the BBC, the newly established Prison Radio Association, the Prison Service, Community Service Volunteers and local education establishments.Described as an exportable radio scheme that can easily be adopted into prisons' existing educational systems, the programme aims to roll out across the 39 BBC local radio stations.Prison Radio Project is benefiting from the donation of redundant BBC analogue radio equipment and has made an interactive CD-rom designed to teach radio skills to prisoners.Inmates will take part in master classes given by producers from local BBC stations.Programmes will broadcast initially to the population of each prison and then be relayed to local community radio. Selected material may then be aired on BBC stations in the region.Prior to last week's launch, prisoners at Hewell Grange prison in Redditch, who had successfully operated a pilot station, produced several programmes for BBC Radio West Midlands.Prison radio is not a new concept. The first station was set up at Feltham young offenders' institution in 1994. The man behind the idea, Mark Robinson, is a founder and trustee of the Prison Radio Association.Another organisation, Radio for Development, opened a station in Wandsworth jail in 2004. That venture gained recognition when Cherie Booth QC went to the south London prison to present diplomas to inmates who had graduated from a BTEC radio course run in association with a local college.Mark Williams, a graduate of the Wandsworth experiment, was at last week's launch in Birmingham. A free man now, he is doing a degree in media studies and has worked in mainstream broadcasting.Phil Maguire, who was seconded from the BBC to become the Prison Radio Project's co-ordinator, said that although the scheme was aimed primarily at teaching literacy and numeracy - in a prison population with an average reading age of 11 - it is hoped that some of the material produced will be used to engage local communities and prisoners in debate.Listeners will hear prisoners taking part in rehabilitation programmes addressing issues such as offending behaviour and victim empathy.The scheme has the enthusiastic backing of the prison service. Mike Shann, the governor of Winson Green - one of the three biggest jails in the system - said a radio station will further add to the range of work skills the prison provided.He also believes the project will "open up" the prison to the local community.On a personal level, Mr Shann is looking forward to a prison version of Question Time, where inmates can voice grievances directly to him.He expects a lively exchange and said it will take him back to the time when his job gave him daily contact with those in his charge.These days, he added, his job was more about budgets and managing the 17 governor grade staff that he oversees.The BBC may have struck gold with this scheme. The public at large seems to have a fascination for life behind bars and the corporation's benevolence may reap rich dividends.Mr Maguire said his aim was to see high-quality speech-based programmes making their way from the prison landings to local and national radio. It promises to be an interesting and productive journey.· Eric Allison is the Guardian's prisons correspondent· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
