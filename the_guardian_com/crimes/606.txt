A woman arrested after a stabbing attack that left two children dead and a baby seriously injured has been detained under the Mental Health Act, police said last night. The 35-year-old woman, who is believed to be the children's mother, has been in hospital since the incident at a house in Carshalton, south-east London, on Friday but will now be transferred to a secure mental health unit, Scotland Yard said.A 39-year-old man questioned in relation to the incident was released earlier in the day, and will face no further action, police said. He has been bailed to return to a police station at a later date in relation to another matter, the details of which police would not release.A five-year-old boy and his four-year-old sister received multiple stab wounds during the attack on Friday night and both later died. A six-month old girl was also attacked and remains in hospital in a "critical but stable" condition after undergoing emergency surgery.Officers were called to the house at 10.30pm on Friday after what police thought to be a "domestic incident". The victims were taken to hospital and the two older children were pronounced dead at St Helier hospital in Carshalton shortly before midnight.Postmortem examinations on the two victims are expected to be carried out early next week.Jay Raman, 36, who knows the family, said of the dead children: "The boy was always riding up and down on his bike. You couldn't get him off it. They were brought up as you would want a child to be brought up. They were well-mannered and well-behaved."Neighbours said the couple, who lived with their children in the Â£300,000 two-bedroom property in the London suburb, were thought to be from a Tamil area of Sri Lanka and had moved to the area in the last year.The property remained cordoned off yesterday as officers carried out an examination of the scene.
