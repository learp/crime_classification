Attitudes to crime are hugely influenced by newspaper reports, with tabloid readers almost twice as likely to be worried about crime as those who favour broadsheets, according to government figures.The latest Home Office survey on crime showed the tabloids' penchant for human interest stories involving violence and law-breaking have had a marked effect as 43% of tabloid readers believe crime has increased "a lot" compared with just 26% of broadsheet readers.Tabloid readers were more than twice as likely to fear being mugged, with 16% admitting they were "very worried" about a possible assault compared with just 7% of broadsheet readers.When it came to the threat of physical attacks, the difference was even more marked with 17% of tabloid readers claiming to be "very worried" compared with just 6% of broadsheet readers.This year was the first time the Home Office asked interviewees in its annual crime survey about their newspaper reading habits.The survey of 40,000 adults seemed to justify the government's fear its message about falling crime levels is not getting through to large chunks of the population.However, the Home Office statistics chief, Professor Paul Wiles, declined to draw any inference from the results. "There are all sorts of different interpretations," he said. "It might be self-selection of reading different newspapers or it might be down to social demographics. "But it is a factual statement that people who read different newspapers have different beliefs about what's happening with crime."Overall 38% of interviewees believed the crime rate had risen a lot and 35% said it had increased a little in the previous two years. In fact, the latest figures show the risk of a person becoming a victim of crime is at an all-time low.Â· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857
