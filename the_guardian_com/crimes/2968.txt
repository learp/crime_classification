In the latest government U-turn, ministers have axed plans to scrap compensation payments to victims of minor criminal assaults.The Ministry of Justice had wanted to limit payments under the criminal injuries compensation scheme so that only seriously injured victims would be eligible, saving £50m on a bill to taxpayers that last year stood at £449m.But critics claimed the move would leave victims unable to seek redress for attacks and accused the government of putting deficit reduction before compassion.A ministry spokesman said: The government is committed to providing the best possible support for victims of crime – maintaining compensation for the most seriously affected – and to reforming the criminal injuries compensation scheme to put it on a sustainable financial footing."We have listened to the views expressed in parliament and will now consider our next steps."The shadow justice minister, Rob Flello, welcomed the U-turn, saying: "Even contemplating these cuts that would have affected innocent victims of crime shows this Tory-led government is out of touch.The move comes a week after the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, was ousted from the department and replaced by Chris Grayling, who is seen as more rightwing.Just last week, the junior justice minister Helen Grant, newly promoted in the recent Cabinet reshuffle, defended the proposed changes in the Commons. She said: "We concluded that the scheme needed to focus resources on the victims who are most seriously affected by injuries that they suffer as a result of deliberate violent crime committed in England, Wales and Scotland.Grant told MPs the revamped criminal injuries compensation scheme represented "a coherent and fair way of focusing payments on those most seriously affected by their injuries, within an affordable budget".
