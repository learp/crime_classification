A tormented teenager was able to murder a 10-year-old girl because of a muddle between police and lawyers over a previous abduction, an inquiry ruled yesterday. The report by child protection authorities also backed complaints by the victim's parents that there had not been enough openness about the violent potential of Paul Smith, now 21, who had allegedly carried out two other assaults on young girls.He was jailed for life in October 2004 for stripping and suffocating Rosie May Storrie at a family party the previous Christmas. It only emerged after the trial that he had escaped charges two years earlier for tying up and gagging a teenage girl at the point of an air rifle and forcing her into the boot of his father's car.The inquiry headed by Paul Tudor of Lincolnshire Safeguarding Children Board found that Smith, who has Asperger's syndrome and was bullied at school for his learning difficulties and stilted speech, was known to all relevant agencies, but none had the full picture.In particular the potential menace of the abduction in 2001 had been overlooked because lawyers and a detective had failed to tell senior officers and prosecutors that they were discontinuing the case. If Smith had been prosecuted for the kidnapping there would have been pre-sentence and possibly psychiatric reports, the inquiry noted. "No single agency had full knowledge of all the alleged incidents [involving Smith], so opportunities for professionals to identify Paul's incrementally risky behaviour were limited."The trial jury was not told of the kidnap because the judge ruled that the hallmarks - a sudden flare-up of temper ending with the car swerving off the road as Smith was overcome by remorse - were different.The inquiry also found that protectiveness and rifts within Smith's family had contributed to friends' and neighbours' ignorance that the awkward teenager might be a growing threat to young girls.He had been accused of pushing a 12-year-old girl on to a bed and grabbing her between the legs, and of forcing another on to a bed and tying her up. Mr Tudor said that the first incident had been dismissed by Smith's parents as "clowning around, nothing malicious".This caused a split in the wider family which meant that the more serious tying up incident had not been pursued by relatives "for fear of causing a family row".The report says: "Due partly to the family dynamics and fallout and partly to Paul's parents' natural defensive and protective reaction, it is unfortunate that his incrementally risky behaviour was not identified and that appropriate professional help was not sought."Mr Storrie said after the trial that he had been given a "sanitised version" of the kidnap by Smith's father which made it sound like joyriding. Rosie May died in hospital the day after the assault.Mr Storrie said yesterday: "Now we are in possession of the facts we are outraged and we feel let down by the authorities. Had we known we would have been able to take steps to protect our daughter."Smith withdrew an appeal against his conviction last year, but his family have always maintained his innocence. They did not attend the publication of the report or issue a comment.
