A former member of the British National party was fined £200 today after he admitted leaking the names and details of thousands of party members online.Matthew Single, appearing before Nottingham magistrates, admitted revealing the names, addresses and occupations of around 12,000 members on a blog. Charges against his wife, Sadie Graham-Single, were dropped.District judge John Stobart ordered 37-year-old Single to pay an additional £100 towards the costs of the prosecution."Anything that is posted on the internet has the effect of opening a Pandora's box," he said."What you put on the internet can never be taken from it, and while there may be some members in this organisation who do not deserve to be protected by the law, they should be able to expect that officers within the organisation will not abuse the information provided to them."He said the law "exists to save people from such revenge attacks", adding: "It came as a surprise to me, as it will to many members of the party, that to do something as foolish and as criminally dangerous as you did will only incur a financial penalty."It comes as no surprise to me that somebody to do with an organisation that prides itself on Britishness is in fact living off the British people on jobseekers' allowance, and that is why the fine is so low as to be ridiculous."Police officers, teachers, church figures and lawyers were among those revealed to be BNP members, with some complaining that the leaks had exposed them to the risk of dismissal from their jobs or disciplinary action.More than 160 complaints were made to police after attacks on BNP members and their property, it was revealed in court. White powder, purported to be anthrax, was put through people's letterboxes, swastikas were daubed on doors and there was an arson attack on one member's vehicle, officers said.John Walker, a BNP spokesman, said some party members were considering bringing civil cases against Single and his wife."It's an absolute disgrace. As far as I'm concerned, it should have been a custodial sentence," Walker said."There have been some real victims in this case. People had their homes attacked and some people have lost their jobs."Speaking outside the court, Detective Sergeant Chris Reynolds said he was disappointed with the outcome of the investigation, believed to have cost about £50,000."It's taken a great deal of work to get the case to court," he said. "There was pretty serious stuff after what happened. People were fearful for their safety."The list of names was leaked on the web in November 2008. Information disclosed included contact details such as mobile phone numbers and the names and ages of children in a family membership.Some of those named complained that they had been mistakenly included on the list after having asked for information about the party. Others said they were no longer members.The BNP called the leak "malevolent and spiteful" but said the list was out of date and included the names of members only up to 2007.The party called police and obtained a high court injunction to stop the list being published, but was forced to admit it was relying on the Human Rights Act – which it opposes – to protect members' privacy.Police charged Single, who was living in Nottingham at the time of the leak, under the Data The BNP leader, Nick Griffin, claimed at the time to know the identity of a person who had leaked the information, saying it was a hardline senior employee who disagreed with the direction of the party and had left it in 2007.The leak revealed bitter party infighting. It emerged that Griffin and his deputy, Simon Darby, had taken court action against six disgruntled former members, including Single and his wife, a BNP councillor on Broxtowe Borough Council, in 2007. In December that year, an internal dispute led to the resignation or expulsion of 60 local and national BNP officials.Single, who trained BNP members in security, was part of a group of rebels who had been calling for the expulsion of three other senior officials – John Walker, the national treasurer, his deputy, Dave Hannam, and Mark Collett, the director of publicity, whom the rebels accused of bringing the BNP into disrepute. When the rebel leaders were sacked by Griffin, a large number of party officials resigned in support or were expelled.
