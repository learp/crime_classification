You report on psychiatry professor Peter Tyrer's demand that "a £200m scheme to treat some of Britain's most dangerous killers should be abandoned" (Psychiatrist calls for £200m killer rehabilitation scheme to be ended, 27 May).He claims it is "too expensive", had "no positive results", left some prisoners "more aggressive than before they entered jail" and that "many people had been detained unnecessarily".As senior clinicians within a dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) unit, we are concerned Tyrer's comments that "it seems patients have not been helped" are misleading and could seriously impact on the availability of psychological treatment for offenders, and others, with mental health problems.Tyrer's research remit was restricted: there was little contact with treating clinicians or with prisoners receiving treatment. So how could he conclude that prisoners "spent only 10% of their time doing anything resembling therapy" and that the programme "is accompanied by an observed deterioration in functioning, quality of life and aggression"? By juxtaposing his findings regarding two distinct services governed by separate legislation – prisons and hospitals – Tyrer risks confusing readers about the validity of detention.He claims that 85% of those in treatment are "detained unnecessarily", are "in prison for homicide or violent offences and should have been released at the end of the sentence", and argues that they are merely being "warehoused". In fact, 100% of prisoners in the scheme are legitimately detained, serving sentences for serious violent or sexual offences.The Labour government assertively addressed difficulties people had in accessing psychological treatment to overcome childhood sexual and physical abuse. The DSPD initiative ensured that psychiatry no longer neglects its responsibility to distressed people who don't respond to traditional interventions such as medication and electroconvulsive therapy. It ensured that those whose mental problems underpinned their offending would also have the right to psychological treatment – thereby helping to protect the public.Tyrer, suggesting the scheme costs "almost a million pounds per person", misrepresents the actual cost and fails to report the savings resulting from improved quality of prisoner life, with fewer of them requiring segregation.Psychiatrists largely subscribe to the opinion that these clients are untreatable. Indeed, in 1988, psychiatrists Lewis and Appleby found that merely labelling an individual as "personality disordered" led to 70% of psychiatrists identifying the patient as less deserving of care than one labelled "mentally ill". In 2003 Tyrer told a conference that "Nothing positive will ever come out of the DSPD programmes, especially those within prisons". One cannot dismiss the notion that his conclusions merely reflect a long-held bias.
