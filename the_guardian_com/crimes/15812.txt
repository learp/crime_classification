The Madeleine McCann investigation faced a fresh setback today after reports that the second in command on the case, chief inspector Tavares Almeida, had requested an extended leave of absence.Mr Almeida is head of the unit within the judicial police in Portimao that has been investigating Madeleine's disappearance on May 3.The news came just two days after the police chief, Goncalo Amaral, was removed from the case and demoted.A police source told Portuguese daily newspaper 24 Horas: "As a rule, requests of a short, medium or long duration are granted."It is very unlikely to be denied. If that happened it would be the first time in the PJ [judicial police]." Mr Almeida refused to confirm or deny the report, telling the newspaper: "I don't speak to journalists."He has held the rank of chief inspector for the past six years, previously working at the robbery unit at the national headquarters in Lisbon.A colleague described him as "an excellent investigator, especially in the area of violent crime"."He's very good, very committed and persistent," he said.Mr Almeida is said to have requested a "licenca sem vencimento", an extended period of absence usually used for study or training.There is no maximum duration but they generally last between a month and a year.The newspaper said Guilhermino Encarnacao, director of the judicial police in Faro, is the favourite to replace Mr Amaral as the head of the judicial police in Portimao. Alipio Ribeiro, national director of the judicial police, said the appointment was "a priority" and would be made by next week.Mr Amaral was informed by fax that he was to be removed from his position as the head of the judicial police in Portimao earlier this week.The national director acted swiftly after Mr Amaral accused British police of helping Gerry and Kate McCann and "forgetting" they were suspects in the disappearance of their daughter.The four-year-old went missing from her family's apartment in Praia da Luz during a family holiday.
