The trial of a convicted child killer accused of murdering a sixth-form student was halted today and the jury discharged.The judge, sitting at Chelmsford crown court, said 62-year-old Peter Tobin was ill, needed surgery and was unfit to stand trial.Tobin, who was convicted of murdering 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton in December, denies murdering 18-year-old Dinah McNicol.The trial began on 23 June, but jurors have not heard evidence for more than a week because of Tobin's illness.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith today told the panel Tobin had shingles with "complications".He said the problem would require "surgical intervention".Lawyers later said a new trial date had been fixed for 14 December, and the hearing was expected to last for five days.McNicol, of Tillingham, Essex, disappeared in August 1991 after attending a music festival in Liphook, Hampshire. Her remains were found in the garden of a house in Margate, Kent – where Tobin lived in 1991 – in 2007.Hamilton vanished from Bathgate, near Edinburgh, in February 1991. Her remains were found buried in the same garden in Margate in 2007.Jurors were told Tobin had been convicted of murdering Hamilton, and was serving a life sentence for the crime.They were also told Tobin had a conviction for indecently assaulting two 14-year-old girls in 1994.
