Places at Britain's prisons will run out in the new year without dramatic government intervention, the president of the Prison Governors Association warned today.At the association's annual conference Mike Newell called for radical reform to reduce the number of inmates entering the country's jails.He said new increased sentencing powers for magistrates and fast-track convictions had contributed to the drastic rise in prisoner numbers, from 41,500 in 1994 to 72,379 at the end of last week.There were a number of radical options facing the home secretary, Mr Newell said, which he described as "unpalatable" including curbing current sentencing powers.He told the conference near Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire: "The main issue is the overcrowding in prisons and the sentencing policy, which is affecting the numbers in our prisons. The fact is that we have not got enough room and we have run out of options. "We can always squeeze one or two here or there but short of building new prisons - which we cannot do overnight - we predict that we will be out of places by January. We haven't got the space to cope."Home Office modelling to bring a better police force and probation service and changes to the court system with fast-tracking all add up to thousands more people going to prison."He suggested reducing the custodial remand population by using a combination of electronic tagging and regular reporting to police. A Home Office spokesman admitted that overcrowding posed a "serious challenge", but he added that the Home Office was reviewing the way it manages the proson population and that, over the last five years, it had created 9,000 new places in the country's jails."The home secretary has said that prisons should only be used where necessary. However, a custodial sentence is and will always remain the appropriate form of sentence for sexual and violent and other serious offenders," he said.Other speakers at the three-day event include prison service director general Martin Narey, prisons minister Hilary Benn, prison and probation ombudsman Stephen Shaw, and Harry Mawdsley, chairman of the Magistrates' Association.
