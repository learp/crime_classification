The boyfriend of the young jobcentre worker Joanne Nelson, who vanished on Valentine's Day from the home they shared in a quiet suburb of Hull, yesterday accepted responsibility for her death.Paul Dyson, a wood machinist, made the admission without entering a formal plea to a murder charge at Hull crown court. His barrister, Gary Burrell, told the recorder of Hull, Judge Michael Mettyear: "It is important for the court and for the deceased's family to know that Paul Dyson admits the unlawful killing of Joanne Nelson." Ms Nelson was reported missing on February 14, sparking a huge hunt by police, soldiers and volunteers across much of East and North Yorkshire. The body of the 22-year-old was found on March 24, concealed in woodland 50 miles away near Malton, North Yorkshire. Dyson, 30, had been charged with Ms Nelson's killing when the body was found, first appearing before Hull magistrates on February 22. He is charged with murdering her on or around February 13 "at a place unknown". Judge Mettyear said the media could report the admission of responsibility but otherwise normal reporting restrictions on preliminary hearings applied. Dyson was returned to jail after being remanded in custody to appear again at Hull crown court on June 30 for another plea and directions hearing.
