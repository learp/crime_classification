A worrying omission from the headline figures in the Crime Survey for England and Wales (Fall in murder and violent crime, but increase in rape, survey finds, 25 April) are those relating to religious and race hate incidents. This category is absent from the survey report and enquirers to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are instead pointed in the direction of the Home Office, whose "overview" of hate crime wraps up together religious, race hate, homophobic and disability hatred and comes to the conclusion that there has been a steady fall over the past five years.Contrast this with the Metropolitan police crime statistics, which show a slight but continuing upward trend in religious and race hate crime in the capital but with Islamophobic incidents rocketing by 65% in the year to March 2014.At a time when Ukip's vile posters are degrading streets throughout the country, certain tabloid newspapers are stepping up their vitriolic and frequently inaccurate attacks on migrants, and public discourse on the subject of immigration is poisoned by politicians of most parties trying to "out-tough" one another on the subject, is it not time that the authorities paused from patting themselves on the back over the fall in crime and gave more attention to this worrying specific increase and its causes?Phillip CooperHammersmith and Fulham Refugee Forum• While the reduction in crime is clearly welcome, it is regrettable that the ONS data is not organised in such a way as to extract percentage changes for both domestic violence and hate crime, since these are incorporated into the more generic crime headings. For the victims of such crimes, their daily experiences of oppression, name-calling, personal violence and attack dominate their lives. Any reduction in overall crime offers no solace at all to them, and until these are recognised as discrete and heinous acts, nothing substantial will be done about them.Andy Stelman(Retired assistant chief probation officer), Bishops Castle, Shropshire• The class-refracted conflicts that John Harris recalls (Britain's bootboys may be gone, but are we really more at peace?, 25 April) have given way to new patterns of crime reflected in Cardiff University's latest violence and society research (Report, 23 April). This must surely have some connection to the class realignment if not transformation John alludes to, especially as they are common across "post-industrial" societies.Indeed, the division of knowledge and labour between the traditionally manual working class and the non-manual middle class has been eroded by the applications of new technology in successive work reorganisations. As a result, the polarising postwar pyramid has gone pear-shaped, with a new middle-working/working-middle class intermediate between the upper or ruling class and a section of the formerly unskilled working class relegated to underclass status. The consolidation of this new Americanised class structure may have been marked in England by the 2011 riots that John also recalls but everyone else has forgotten.Patrick AinleyUniversity of Greenwich• John Harris's piece was most perceptive, but I feel he and other commentators have missed a key factor in the decline in violent crime: ecstasy. From the late 80s to mid-90s an entire generation who would have been brawling in pub car parks was getting off its face on E at raves, and instead of scrapping were hugging complete strangers and telling them they loved them. This largely broke the intergenerational transmission of the macho street brawl culture and closed or changed the nature of the places that used to provide the arenas for it; it has never recovered. Ian SimmonsMonkseaton, Tyne & Wear• How interesting that as crime falls, everyone seems reluctant to give any credit to a range of positive, evidence-based policies introduced post-1997, which were designed to create a fairer society and a better future for young people. National drug and alcohol strategies, a brilliant youth justice system, the well-targeted Connexions services for young people, education maintenance allowances to encourage young people to stay in education, the teenage pregnancy strategy, a great "New Deal" for young jobseekers, and many other initiatives were all designed to look holistically at disadvantaged young people and help them become useful pro-social citizens. The Labour party is particularly guilty of not realising how good they were in government, and not making the obvious case for retaining these well-researched, cost-efficient policies.Sheila HutchinsTregony, Cornwall
