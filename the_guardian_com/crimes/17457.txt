Downing Street billed Tony Blair's crime plan as a renewed "get tough" drive against the 500 most prolific offenders but the detail of the 105-page document reveals much more far-reaching proposals, such as a check on every child when they move to secondary school to identify potential criminals.The package has a battery of such future "eye-catching" initiatives, such as fingerprint-only access to MP3 players, crowd scanners that detect bomb devices, to league tables for courts and a future review of the police. It even advocates compulsory health insurance for all foreign visitors.The level of detail and micromanagement by Number 10 of these Home Office policy areas suggests that even after 53 criminal justice bills in a decade, Tony Blair is leaving office deeply frustrated at the slow pace of reform of the police, prisons and probation services.He makes clear that he believes that much more sweeping workforce reforms are still needed. This is not surprising when you start looking at all the extra staff that will be needed to run the early intervention, community punishment and other new programmes being contemplated.But beyond the eye-catching initiatives, many of the policy ideas sound familiar. The renewed targeting of the most prolific offenders to cut a disproportionate amount of crime is a relaunch of a drive first announced by David Blunkett in 2004.The results of that programme are not as rosy as Downing Street paints them today. Yes it achieved a 43% reduction in the conviction rate of the 7,800 offenders selected to take part in October 2004. But that meant they were convicted of 55,000 offences before they took part in the programme, and 31,400 while they were on it, hardly a major endorsement of a flagship government programme.
