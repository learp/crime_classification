A motorist has described how he looked over to see his wife "covered in blood" after a piece of concrete the size of a bucket was dropped on their vehicle from a bridge.Steve and Carol Manley were driving home after visiting friends when the missile was launched from a bridge on the A12 in Essex, leaving Mrs Manley with fractures to her face and ribs, and internal injuries."There was a bump on the roof of the car, as far as I could tell," her husband said. "I thought I had hit something in the road. When I turned around and looked at my wife to ask her what it was, I noticed that the front of the car was destroyed. My wife was covered in blood. There was a concrete block on her chest and leg."Mr Manley said his 57-year-old wife had only recently left hospital after an operation on her stomach, where the concrete block landed."My first reaction was to try to get the concrete block off of my wife," he said. "The concerns that were running through my mind were that my wife couldn't breathe, she couldn't see, there was blood pouring from her face. I was concerned because she had an operation on a spinal injury about two or three years ago."Only recently she had come out of hospital from having an operation on her stomach, and the concrete block was on the stomach, so you can understand I was in no state to know anything or do anything."Mr Manley said he had been driving at about 45mph and enjoying a "quiet conversation" with his wife when the block hit their vehicle at 10.05pm last Thursday. He escaped with minor cuts and bruises; his wife is recovering at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex.Pictures released on Thursday show her with a bloodied face, oxygen mask and severe bruising around her eyes.The pair were hit 40 minutes after another motorist, Lisa Horne, 26, escaped unharmed when a rock the size of a football smashed through her windscreen.Police are treating both incidents, which happened eight miles apart, as attempted murder and are investigating whether they are linked to more than 30 similar incidents on bridges along the A12 during the past three years.
