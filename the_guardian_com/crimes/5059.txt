Violent women are stretching police resources, with increasing numbers being arrested, police have warned. The chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, Paul McKeever, called it a 'new phenomenon'.'Clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets,' he said. An average of 240 women a day are arrested for violent offences in England and Wales.McKeever said young women were also joining violent gangs. 'It's a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service,' he said.Meanwhile, the number of crimes committed by girls aged 10 to 17 in England and Wales has gone up by 25 per cent in three years to 59,000, Youth Justice Board figures show. But critics say the increase is down to the police dealing with violent women more formally. Susan Batchelor, of the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research, said 'Traditionally young women have been much more informally socially controlled than young men, and we may be seeing some changes.'
