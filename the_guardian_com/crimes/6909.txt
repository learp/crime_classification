The sister of a woman who is on the run after their mother was murdered appealed for her to turn herself in yesterday. Marion Edgington, 60, was stabbed to death last weekend and yesterday police said that her daughter Nicola, 25, was the only suspect. Mrs Edgington was described yesterday by her family as "perfect in every way".Her body was discovered by Sara and Thomas Edgington, her two youngest children, in the early hours of Saturday at her semi-detached cottage in Forest Row, near East Grinstead.Police said it was vital that they found Nicola, whom they wanted to arrest on suspicion of murder. At a press conference the family appealed for her to give herself up. Sara, 20, said: "Nicola, turn yourself in to the police. We cannot come to terms with what has happened until we know where you are."Detectives leading the murder inquiry were unwilling to discuss events that led to the killing, saying only that they were searching an area of Woolwich, south-east London, for Nicola.But it is understood the family had met up on Friday evening and had a row which had escalated. Detective Chief Inspector Adam Hibbert said the events on Friday evening were "integral to the inquiry" and the murder was being treated as a "domestic incident". An autopsy revealed she had died from stab wounds."As such, I do not believe Nicola to be a risk to the public," he said.Nicola is described as white, 1.6 metres (5ft 3in) tall, with long fair hair.
