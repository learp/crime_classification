A drunk driver who crashed his Rolls Royce into a Tesco store because he had a grudge against the company was today jailed for 16 months. Robert Caton, 50, had downed two bottles of whisky before he ploughed the luxury car into the front window of the store in Andover, Hampshire, in May this year. Winchester crown court heard that Caton got behind the wheel and made two attempts to crash into the store as shoppers fled. Six women suffered cuts, bruising and shock and one woman, who was five months pregnant and had already suffered two miscarriages, needed to go to hospital.
