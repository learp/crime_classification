A murder hunt was launched yesterday after a man aged 27 was found injured in an alley in Nottingham city centre shortly after police were called to an "incident" at a nearby nightclub. The victim was treated by paramedics but died on the way to hospital. A Nottinghamshire police spokeswoman said officers were called to the Paris nightclub in the Lace Market at 2am and the man was found near the Pitcher and Piano pub. Nottinghamshire police refused to comment on a local media report that suggested the victim died after a suspected shooting. A postmortem was being carried out yesterday. PA
