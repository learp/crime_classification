The intergalactic space hero Buzz Lightyear, who normally puts the wind up the evil space emperor Zarg, has shopped a petty thief in Hereford.Police and a tracker dog were drawing a blank in the market town when a familiar electronic voice crackled out: "Buzz Lightyear to the rescue - to infinity and beyond." West Mercia officers did not have to engage hyperdrive to find their man - shoplifter Shaun Markey, 27, was crammed into a niche under a concrete road bridge yards away. He admitted to Hereford magistrates that while squeezing into his bolthole he had pressed the button on the Â£26.99 Buzz, activating one of the model's eight battle cries. Makey, unemployed, admitted grabbing the toy from Woolworth's in Hereford and running into a small warren of paths by the town's Great Western Way bridge. The area was surrounded by shop staff who had given chase while calling police. Markey will be sentenced next month. The court heard he had been left without money for a fortnight when his bank cleared his benefits to pay debts.
