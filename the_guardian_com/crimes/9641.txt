Relatives of two of the five women murdered by Steve Wright today urged the government to bring back the death penalty following his conviction.Statements read out on behalf of the family of Tania Nicol and Paula Clennell — Wright's first and last victims — called for the killer to face the same fate as his victims."Today as this case has come to an end, we would like to say justice has been done but we are afraid that whilst five young lives have been cruelly ended, the person responsible will be kept warm, nourished and protected. In no way has justice been done," said the Nicol family.Describing Wright as a "monster", they added: "These crimes deserve the ultimate punishment and that can only mean one thing.""The public must insist the government ensure the return of the death penalty for these kinds of things or many other families will go through the kind of suffering we have endured."Clennell's mother, Isabella, said Wright's "lies and excuses" made her feel sick. "Who knows, she [my daughter] may have been off the drugs and leading a normal life. At least she would have had that choice. Steve Wright took that choice away from her and the other four girls."I wish we still had the death penalty because this is what he deserves. He has murdered five girls but at the same time ruined a lot more lives."Annette Nicholls' family expressed relief that Wright was no longer capable of terrorising young women."At last we can rest in peace that this man is no longer on the streets of Ipswich ready to take another girl's life."But they added: "No punishment this person receives will ever be enough for us. "This man has robbed a little boy of a mother he adored, the parents of a loving and much loved daughter and siblings of a loving sister."
