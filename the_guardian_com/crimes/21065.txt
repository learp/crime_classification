An experienced ferry officer was yesterday found not guilty of the manslaughter of three yachtsmen who died after their boat sank off the Isle of Wight.The jury in the trial of Michael Hubble has yet to decide on three other charges under the Merchant Shipping Act that his conduct was likely to have caused death or injury to the three men.James Meaby, Jason Downer and Rupert Saunders died after their yacht, the Ouzo, sank in August last year.Hubble, 62, from Folkestone, Kent, was the officer of the watch in charge of the P&O car ferry Pride of Bilbao at the time the Ouzo vanished.It is accepted that the 37,500-tonne ferry passed very close to a yacht at around the time the Ouzo disappeared. The prosecution had claimed that yacht was the seven-metre-long (23ft) Ouzo and it was either knocked over or swamped by the giant ferry.It was alleged that the men could have been saved had the alarm been raised. Instead, the prosecution claimed, Hubble hoped for the best and steamed on towards northern Spain.Hubble remained impassive as the verdict clearing him of manslaughter through gross negligence came back, and simply bowed his head. The jury will return to Winchester crown court today for its seventh day of deliberation. Hubble faces three charges of engaging in conduct as a seaman that was likely to cause death or serious injury.During the six-week trial, the jury has heard that the three men, who were school and university friends, left Bembridge on the Isle of Wight on the evening of August 20 en route to Devon to take part in the Dartmouth regatta.Saunders, 36, from Tooting, south London, was the skipper of the Ouzo, a vessel which was 24 years old but well-maintained. Meaby, also 36 and from Tooting, and Downer, 35, from Kent, were also competent and keen sailors.All three were found dead with their lifejackets on and inflated. Meaby is believed to have remained alive in the cold, dark water for at least 12 hours and the other men at least three hours.Hubble, who had 42 years' experience at sea, has maintained throughout the trial that he had a close-quarters incident with a yacht but it was not the Ouzo.In the witness box he said he was "perfectly happy" that his vessel had missed a yacht and that he had no reason to call the captain. He claimed unusual manoeuvres he made were only to give the yacht room and he did not consider it an emergency.The jury was also told that experts from South Tyneside college calculated that the Ouzo was close to a 3,000-tonne tanker called Crescent Beaune and not the Pride of Bilbao at the time it went missing.The captain of the tanker, Alaistair Crichton, told the court he had broken the law when he had only a second officer on his bridge that evening.
