More than 1,000 pieces of rare sci-fi memorabilia seized by police from a criminal couple are to go under the hammer in Northern Ireland.Costumes used in the Star Trek films, including Scotty's jacket, a replica Millennium Falcon from Star Wars and remote control Daleks are among the lots in the unusual collection.The diverse and valuable haul was once owned by a husband and wife who built it up using their ill-gotten gains.The 55-year-old woman from West Yorkshire pleaded guilty last December to stealing £2.3m from her employer, a Halifax-based firm that supplies commercial laundry equipment, between 2005 and December 2012.Her 48-year-old husband pleaded guilty to laundering £924,000 of the stolen cash between July 2009 and December 2012.
