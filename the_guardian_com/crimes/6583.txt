The use of Taser weapons by British police must be tightly controlled, Amnesty International says today, in a report linking the stun guns to the deaths of more than 70 people in North America. It calls for a "rigorous and independent" study of the guns.The M26 Taser fires two needle-tipped darts attached to copper cables which deliver a 50,000-volt charge. It is designed to temporarily incapacitate by cramping muscles, and was given to forces across England and Wales after trials. "Many experts believe Taser shocks may exacerbate a risk of heart failure to people ... under the influence of drugs or suffer underlying health problems," Kate Allen, Amnesty's UK director, said. The Home Office said yesterday the M26 Taser would be made available to firearms officers "as a less lethal alternative for use in situations where a firearms authority has already been granted". Amnesty acknowledges that Tasers can sometimes be used as defensive weapons as an alternative to firearms but says it seems that in the US, Tasers had been used against unruly children as young as nine; pregnant women, one of whom soon after lost her baby; unarmed, mentally ill people; and those who simply ignored police instructions.
