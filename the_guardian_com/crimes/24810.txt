Mulenga shot Oyebola with a converted replica automatic pistol three weeks after the ban on smoking in public places came into force in July last year.The 46-year-old was shot through the back of the neck while drinking at the Chateau 6 bar in Fulham Broadway, west London, after asking a group of men to stop smoking.Mulenga fired four shots and two hit Oyebola. Fifty other people inside the bar were left diving for cover or rushing for the exit.Oyebola was a former British heavyweight title holder who won a bronze medal in the 1986 Commonwealth games.The judge, Peter Rook, told Mulenga: "This was nothing short of a brutal killing carried out for the most trivial of reasons."
