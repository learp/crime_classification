A woman attacked by "lottery rapist" Iorwath Hoare in 1988 today lost her appeal against a decision that she could not claim compensation for the psychological trauma she suffered.Lawyers for the 77-year-old former teacher - referred to as Mrs A - argued that the normal six-year limit for claiming compensation after a deliberate assault should be set aside in this case.However, the Master of the Rolls, Sir Anthony Clarke, Lord Justice Brooke and Lady Justice Arden upheld the earlier decision and said they were bound by an existing House of Lords ruling. Mrs A was 59 when Hoare - who by then had already subjected six other women to sexual assaults, including rape - attacked her in Roundhay park, Leeds.Hoare, now 53, was jailed for life the following year and spent 16 years in prison. He bought a winning National Lottery ticket worth £7.2m while on day release from prison in 2004 and now reportedly lives in a £700,000 house near Newcastle.In October last year, a high court judge upheld an initial decision that Mrs A's compensation claim should be struck out because it had been brought more than six years after the assault. The 1980 Limitation Act gives a non-extendable six-year period for such claims. At the appeal hearing in February, Mrs A's counsel, Alan Newman QC, told the three-judge panel that Hoare had no assets before his lottery win, meaning a civil action would have been "neither sensible nor proportionate". She began her claim after hearing of his new wealth.He said there was something "very wrong in the law" if his client was not able to claim compensation for Hoare's "vicious and disgusting" attack.The judges had to decide whether, under these circumstances, the 1998 Human Rights Act meant Mrs A should be allowed to claim compensation beyond the six-year limit, he said.Today's ruling, however, said that because the six-year limitation period had expired before the Act came into force, it could not be used.The Law Commission, the official law reform body, recommended five years ago that the law should be reformed to prevent further injustices. The government has accepted the case for change, but has not yet legislated. Mrs A's appeal is one of three test cases going through the courts testing the strict six-year limit.Mrs A - who is being represented on a no win, no fee basis - was awarded £5,000 by the criminal injuries compensation scheme, which she pledged to repay if she won money from Hoare.
