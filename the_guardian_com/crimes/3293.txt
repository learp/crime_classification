Four conmen who swindled almost £600,000 from the life savings of vulnerable and elderly people have been jailed.The men, who had worked for various building companies over the years, conspired to trick their victims into paying for building works they did not need at inflated prices, Chester crown court was told.The scale of one fraud, in which they tricked a victim into letting one of the gang buy his house for about £40,000 less than it was worth, was breathtaking, said Judge Nicholas Woodward.Mark Dodd, 50, Neil Jones, 38, Kevin Sweeney, 37, and Paul Williams, 50, were jailed for "fleecing" four vulnerable victims out of their life savings by gaining their trust and betraying them in the most cynical way, the court was told.Beatrice Price, 80, entrusted Jones with her finances after he gained her trust, only to have almost £50,000 of savings siphoned from her accounts.Williams forged 83-year-old Winifred Owen's signature to write a cheque to his daughter for £14,750 during a bogus visit to check her windows. He did the same to Price on a separate occasion.Dr Peter Grant, a retired GP, was tricked into dropping the price of his sister's bungalow and their former family home, which he was selling for her because she had learning difficulties. The property was bought by Sweeney for a fraction of its true value.Dodd was sentenced to five years, Sweeney to four-and-a-half years, Jones to four years and Williams to 18 months in jail.Andrew Thomas, prosecuting, told the court: "The defendants fall to be sentenced for their part in an overlapping series of frauds and thefts with a total value in excess of £600,000."Their victims were private householders who were canvassed by them in relation to dubious building works. In each case, the defendants built a relationship of trust with the victim before using it either to commit fraud or theft."Dodd, of Aigburth, Liverpool, denied conspiracy to defraud Grant over £445,000 in building works but was found guilty by a Chester jury on 1 October.Jones, a salesman, of Bebington, Wirral, tried to pass himself off as a financial adviser.He admitted conspiracy to defraud Price for £49,535 of building work; conspiracy to defraud Grant over the £445,000 works and over the sale of the bungalow – Lime Cottage in Chester – to the tune of £40,000.The total value of his fraud amounted to more than £534,535, Thomas said.Williams, of Tranmere, worked for the other defendants as a self-employed salesman, apparently selling door-to-door, the court heard. He admitted theft of £7,840 from Price and theft of £14,750 from Owen.Sweeney and his 38-year-old wife Nicola, live at Lime Cottage in Chester, the property formally owned by Grant. Sweeney, previously from Huyton, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to the same charges as Jones.Nicola Sweeney, a local government worker, admitted transferring about £57,000 in proceeds of the fraud committed on Grantand was sentenced to 10 months in jail, suspended for two years.Judge Woodward said the crimes were "calculated, deliberate and sophisticated". He told the defendants: "You were ruthless in extracting every single penny you could."Addressing the specific fraud on Grant, in which the gang "played different characters" to get him to lower the price of the Lime Cottage, Judge Woodward said: "Dr Peter Grant is a very decent man who has spent his life working for the community and helping to care for his disadvantaged sister who is the other victim of this charge. The scale of the fraud on those people is simply breathtaking."This con was reminiscent of the type of activity that is sometimes glamorised in Hollywood films. Each of you entered into the scene at different times playing different characters, all of whom appeared to be independent. The reality was, this was a cynical scheme to divest your victims of their life savings."
