A man who shouted racist abuse at a pensioner before throwing his walking frame off a bus has been jailed for 16 weeks, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.Kashif Samuels, 25, launched the attack on a packed 149 service in north London on 15 October. He was arrested after footage was posted on social media of him screaming obscenities at his victim before throwing the walking frame out of the vehicle.Samuels, from Tottenham, was handed the 16-week jail sentence at Highbury Corner magistrates court after previously admitting racially and religiously aggravated harassment.The sentence was increased because of the “hostility shown towards the victim’s disability” and the “racially and religiously aggravated nature of the offence”, the CPS said.Spokesman Gerallt Evans said: “This case has quite rightly caused shock and outrage among the general public.“Kashif Samuels used abusive anti-Muslim and racist language against the victim and caused distress and alarm to the other passengers on the bus. Not only did he shout and swear at the victim but also threw the victim’s walking frame from the bus when it came to a halt.“This appalling outburst was caught on camera by a public-spirited fellow passenger and left Samuels no choice but to plead guilty.“Hate crime of any kind will not be tolerated in London. Members of the public should be able to travel on the city’s transport network without fear of violence, abuse or harassment and we will continue to work with our police partners to bring those that commit these crimes to justice.”
