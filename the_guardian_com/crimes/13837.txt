The policeman in charge of the "loans for peerages" investigation has told MPs that "significant progress" has been made and that a number of people have been interviewed under caution. Deputy assistant commissioner John Yates, of Scotland Yard, said yesterday: "We have already identified a number of issues that merit further detailed examination."Four would-be peers, Chai Patel, Sir David Garrard, Sir Gulam Noon and Barry Townsley, pulled out of Tony Blair's honours list after it was revealed they had given secret loans to Labour. The four have already been interviewed - but not under caution - as potential witnesses should the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decide to bring a case under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act.Mr Yates confirmed the initial investigation would be confined to the provision of loans and "the nomination by parties to the House of Lords appointments commission 2005 and the sponsorship of city academies and the nomination for honours that might be associated with such sponsorship".At a meeting with the Commons public administration committee, Mr Yates and Carmen Dowd, head of the special crime division at the CPS, urged MPs not to proceed with an inquiry by interviewing people which could "unwittingly undermine the criminal investigation". But MPs decided last night to start their inquiry today by questioning Sir Gus O'Donnell, cabinet secretary, and Lord Stevenson and Lord Hurd, members of the Lords appointments commission. They will also take legal advice on whether they can call Lord Levy, Mr Blair's fundraiser, and the four donors nominated for peerages or whether to postpone the inquiry.
