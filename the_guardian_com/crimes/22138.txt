A police manhunt is underway for two “dangerous” brothers wanted in connection with an acid attack that left a woman with severe burns to her face, neck and arms.Hampshire police want to speak to Billy Midmore, 22, and Geoffrey Midmore, 26, both from London, following the assault outside a restaurant in Southampton on Friday.The 37-year-old woman had the corrosive substance thrown in her face and was taken to Southampton general hospital with “significant burns” and remains in hospital for treatment. Police have warned the Midmores are known to have contacts in Southampton, Basingstoke, London and the south-east and urged them to “give themselves up now”. Acting DI Will Whale said: “I would appeal to Billy and Geoffrey to give themselves up now. We will carry on with our manhunt until we find you, so make it easier on yourselves and come forward. “We consider them to be dangerous individuals and clearly a potential risk to members of the public.”Billy is described as white, 5ft 8ins, with blue eyes and a scar on his left arm, while Geoffrey is white, shorter at 5ft 1in, with green eyes and a scar on the right side of his face.Police previously described the attack, outside Turtle Bay restaurant in Guildhall Square, as “rare and isolated”, and said the attackers were known to the victim.Turtle Bay staff gave the woman first aid at the scene, where firefighters also washed around a quarter of a pint of acid from the pavement.
