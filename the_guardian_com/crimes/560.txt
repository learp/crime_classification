A 14-year-old boy has been sentenced to six years in detention for killing his stepfather in a savage knife attack with his adult brother.Jerome Ellis, 14, and Joshua Ellis, 23, stabbed Neil Tulley, 54, to death as he lay on a sofa at the family home in Guildford, Surrey, last August.A jury at Guildford crown court found Jerome not guilty of murder but guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter on the basis of loss of control. Joshua was found guilty of murder.Tulley, who was in a relationship with their mother Marie, was caught by surprise as he lay "asleep or nearly asleep" at the time of the attack, which was so severe he was nearly beheaded. He suffered more than 60 blows to his body.Judge Christopher Critchlow told Jerome: "The evidence is not clear as to who did what in that savage attack – it may be that Joshua did more than you … You accept that you used the knife and you knew what you were doing." Joshua is due to be sentenced at the same court on 22 May.The brothers went on the run after the killing and were found in a churchyard by a member of the public.Joshua told the man that Tulley, a painter and decorator by trade, had been abusive and they could not take it any more.In what Critchlow described as a tragic case the judge noted that Jerome had been neglected and was effectively living in an "abusive environment". Of Jerome's part in the attack, Critchlow said the evidence suggested it "happened spontaneously and with a lack of premeditation".The sadness and trauma that had infected his young life "does not reflect at all well on the adults involved in your childhood", the judge said.Critchlow said: "This case is unusual and difficult to categorise in my judgment but you never would have gone and done what you did but for your brother coming into your room that night."The judge told Jerome that the court was "mindful of the fact that you did not have good parents or good parenting", noting that he lived with his father, who was frequently drunk, until he was about 11.His mother lived in a home that was dirty and cluttered, plus there was evidence that she was "lazy and preferred to watch children's programmes - you were neglected", the judge said. The court heard that Jerome would try to look after his siblings and had a close bond with Joshua, who had become a recluse living in the attic.
