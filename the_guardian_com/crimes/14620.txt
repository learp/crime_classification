The slow death of Tony Blair's flagship measure against antisocial behaviour, the asbo, was confirmed yesterday by official figures showing the number of new orders issued had dropped by 34%.The Home Office figures also showed that breach rates had soared to 61% among teenagers as the total number of asbos fell from 4,123 in 2005 to 2,706 in 2006, with the downward trend believed to have continued over the past 12 months.The death knell for the asbo came 18 months ago when the first Whitehall evaluation revealed that the orders were widely seen as a "badge of honour" by offending teenagers, their parents and even by some criminal justice professionals.The fate of asbos was sealed when Gordon Brown's lieutenant Ed Balls, the secretary of state for children, said last July that every time a young person got an asbo it was failure and he hoped to live in "the kind of society that puts asbos behind us".In a speech on antisocial behaviour, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, made no attempt to revive the use of asbos but instead urged greater use of alternative "early intervention" measures, such as parenting orders, acceptable behaviour contracts and support orders to nip bad behaviour in the bud. She also raised the prospect of a country-wide ban on drinking alcohol on public transport as part of wider talks with transport operators on tackling antisocial behaviour. Boris Johnson's alcohol ban on London Transport buses came into effect this week.The home secretary said this year marked the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the asbo, "a groundbreaking innovation". Although it had been irresponsibly dismissed as a gimmick, the orders had answered the needs of despairing communities: "After years of no one taking responsibility, the asbo was powerful proof that people no longer had to suffer in silence or just put up with it," said Smith.Labour local authority leaders used to compete at the annual party conference over numbers of asbos secured against juvenile offenders, but soon after Brown moved into Downing Street the cross-government respect taskforce was dismantled and Louise Casey, the "asbo tsar", moved to lead a Cabinet Office project on crime. She was not at yesterday's Home Office conference, entitled Anti-Social Behaviour, We're Not Having It.The figures published yesterday show that the asbo breach rate for teenage offenders rose from 47% in 2005 to 61% in 2006; for adults the growth was from 38% in 2005 to 43% in 2006.Smith said a much wider range of tools was now being used to tackle antisocial behaviour, with the use of housing injunctions, eviction orders and parenting contracts rising sharply last year. She praised Operation Leopard, a four-week project run by Essex police covering 14 persistent young offenders who received daily home visits by the police, repeat warnings and relentless filming of their movements. An extra Â£255,000 of new funding was also announced for an antisocial behaviour action squad to use the wider range of measures available, including moves against poor parenting.Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, reveals today that a model juvenile unit at Thorn Cross in Cheshire, which had been preparing teenage offenders for life outside prison, was shut last month by the Youth Justice Board, largely for financial reasons. She said the unit, which could take 80 youngsters, had been the only open establishment for under-18s in the prison system and the only juvenile jail performing well on all the criteria set by inspectors. "This is a model that should be built on, not abandoned," said Owers, who described the move as disappointing and a retrograde step: "This is therefore an obituary, rather than a report on progress."The Youth Justice Board said that only a third of the places in the unit at Thorn Cross had been filled on a regular basis and keeping the unit open would have been poor value for money.
