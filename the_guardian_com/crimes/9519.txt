Two people have been taken into custody after an airgun incident near an Ayrshire school in which 11 children were injured.Strathclyde police said a 15-year old and an 18-year old had been detained following the incident near Auchinleck academy on Wednesday afternoon.The injured children, aged between 12 and 16, were taken to Crosshouse hospital, near Kilmarnock, and Ayr hospital, but none of them were said to be seriously injured. Police said they were mainly suffering from bruising and grazing to their legs and torsos.Police were alerted at 1.40pm, following reports of an incident involving an airgun on Church St, less than half a mile from the academy.Parents of the children involved had been informed straight away, said East Ayrshire council. "We can confirm that there was an incident in Auchinleck today," a spokeswoman said. "The school responded immediately, informing the police and parents of the children involved, and sought appropriate medical attention. The council is working closely with the school to ensure that the school, the children and their families are appropriately supported."The spokeswoman said the academy would re-open on Thursday, and it was likely that counselling would be available for pupils if they need it. "That is normal for anything out of the ordinary in a school," the spokeswoman added.A member of staff said locals at the Boswell Arms had watched the news in shock on the pub's satellite television, unaware of what had been happening. "No one knew anything until we saw it on the TV. So, yes, [there was] some shock."Auchinleck is a small town near Mauchline and Cumnock in East Ayrshire, about 35 miles south of Glasgow.Scotland's education secretary Michael Russell said: "My thoughts are with the pupils and families involved in this extremely disturbing incident. Concern about the misuse of air weapons is widespread and long-standing in Scotland."The Scottish government is in contact with both Strathclyde police and East Ayrshire council about what happened, and ministers are being kept fully informed."Responsibility for air weapons is to be transferred from Westminster to the Scottish parliament, and action will follow."
