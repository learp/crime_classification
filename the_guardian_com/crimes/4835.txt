An elderly care home resident who repeatedly stabbed a member of staff has pleaded guilty to attempted murder. Fred Butcher, 79, was charged following the “unprovoked attack” with a knife at a residential home in Maidstone, Kent in late January. He entered his plea at Maidstone crown court on Friday and was remanded in custody to be sentenced on 9 June.A Kent police spokesman said Butcher inflicted severe wounds to the head and body of the woman. “He was only prevented from causing further injuries when a visitor to the premises, who witnessed the attack, pulled him away from the victim and forced him to drop the weapon,” the spokesman said. “The visitor then sat astride Butcher as police were called. When officers arrived at the scene Butcher told them that he had meant to kill his victim but hadn’t managed it.” Det Insp Tristan Kluibenschadl said: “This was an entirely unprovoked and extremely violent attack on a woman who was simply trying to do her job. “It would appear Butcher harboured resentment towards his victim over some trivial matters at the home.”He said the staff member had been in hospital for several weeks and was recovering slowly, but that the attack “will no doubt have a profound impact on the rest of her life, both physically and mentally”.It had created considerable distress and fear for other residents who were nearby when the attack happened, he said.
