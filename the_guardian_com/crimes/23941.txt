Throughout four months of intense investigation, frenzied media attention and swirling innuendo, Kate and Gerry McCann, at the centre of the extraordinary storm, have remained resolute in their insistence of three absolute truths. Their daughter Madeleine was kidnapped, she could still be alive - and to suggest that they had any involvement is utterly absurd.Today, however, the months of muttered doubts and increasingly open accusations against the couple came to a climax. Kate McCann, after 16 hours of intensive questioning over two days, was named by police as an arguida, or official suspect, in the presumed death of their daughter, who was nine days shy of her fourth birthday when she vanished.The police line of investigation, the family's spokeswoman Justine McGuinness confirmed, was that rather than being snatched from the family's apartment on the evening of May 3 while her parents dined in a nearby tapas restaurant, Madeleine had allegedly died in the family's apartment at some point earlier that evening. She said 22 questions had been put to Mrs McCann relating to "a series of ridiculous allegations", relating to alleged DNA evidence found on her clothes and a trace of blood allegedly discovered in the car that the couple hired 25 days after Madeleine vanished. The "clear suggestion", she said, was that Mrs McCann had been responsible for her daughter's death.Asked whether the line of questioning centred on the allegation that Mrs McCann, a GP, had been the primary agent, with her husband, a cardiac surgeon, as a secondary figure, Ms McGuinness confirmed that this was the case. "There's a fear that perhaps she might be arrested for a crime that we have no idea was committed by anybody and that she absolutely did not commit," she said, adding that Mrs McCann was "absolutely horrified" at the turn of the investigation.Mrs McCann was not arrested or charged, however, leaving the police station in Portimao, close to the resort of Praia da Luz where her daughter disappeared, at around 3.30pm. Gerry McCann was also interviewed today.The implication of the developments is that the police are investigating whether Madeleine's body could have been recovered and moved weeks after her disappearance, at a point when the world's media was scrutinising the couple's every move.The McCanns continue to deny vehemently any suggestion that they were involved in Madeleine's disappearance.The couple launched legal action last month against a Portuguese magazine reported that police believed Madeleine could have died from an accidental overdose of sedatives. Their spokeswoman said that the couple "have not, would not, and would never conceive of using sedatives on their children".Writing in his online blog before he too attended the police station in Portimao, close to Praia da Luz, the town where the family were holidaying, Gerry McCann said today: "The suggestion that Kate is involved in Madeleine's disappearance is ludicrous. Anyone who knows anything about the 3rd May knows that Kate is completely innocent. We will fight this all the way and we will not stop looking for Madeleine."The police investigation, which appeared to be floundering in the initial weeks after Madeleine's disappearance, has gained new impetus since a team of British officers and two dogs from South Yorkshire police re-examined the key sites early last month. These included the home of Robert Murat, a local man who was designated an arguido on May 15 but who has never been arrested or charged, the apartment from which Madeleine vanished, a number of vehicles used by the McCanns and their friends, and unspecified locations around Praia da Luz. The dogs were trained to detect the odour produced from the fluids released when a body decomposes after death, and can be used to detect where a body has been buried or stored.Minute samples of blood discovered in the apartment in which the family had been staying were sent to the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham. A single drop of blood from a fingerprick, at 0.05millilitres, is more than enough for a DNA match, experts said today.The McCanns' own account of the events surrounding their daughter's disappearance has remained consistent since the first hours of the investigation.According to the couple, on the evening of May 3, the night before they were due to return to the UK after a week's holiday, they left Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings asleep in their holiday apartment in the small Algarve town of Praia da Luz and went to meet seven friends with whom they had been holidaying for one final dinner.Madeleine had attended cr√®che that afternoon at the Ocean Club resort where they were staying, and was collected at 6pm. At 8.30pm the couple joined their friends at the dinner table, but they have insisted the children were looked in on at approximately half-hourly intervals. At 10pm, Kate McCann' discovered her daughter was gone.Very few verifiable details have emerged from the investigation, but local media have published detailed accounts of the evening, apparently based on the leaked witness statements of the rest of the party. According to a report in the Sol newspaper, the friends told police Gerry McCann checked in on the children at around 9.05pm, and that another member of the party, Matthew Oldfield, did the same at the McCann apartment half an hour later. What is unclear, however, is whether the parents physically looked in on the children every time or merely listened at the window to see if they were crying. Only one of the four couples, the newspaper said, was using a baby-listening device. Mr Oldfield, the newspaper said, had noticed "more light than usual" in the apartment.It was while Mr McCann was away from the table, having run into an acquaintance outside his apartment, that Jane Tanner, a third friend, saw a man walking in the direction away from the McCann apartment carrying a child over his shoulder wearing pink pyjamas, as Madeleine was.Today the seven friends - most of them also doctors whom the couple had come to know professionally - issued a collective statement saying they were "totally appalled at any suggestion that Kate had anything to do with Madeleine's disappearance"."She is innocent; we know this because we are her friends, we were with her on the night, and we witnessed first hand the unimaginable grief Kate and Gerry suffered and continue to suffer," the statement said.It has been reported for some weeks that the investigators had concerns about supposed discrepancies between the friends' accounts, which appear mostly to relate to minor inconsistencies in their timings of the comings and goings from the dinner table. But Gerry McCann's brother John said today that the accidental death theory would have been impossible in practice."It doesn't make sense if you look at the timelines on the night," he said. "They were there with other people, they had children to put to bed - it's not feasible. Everybody who knows Gerry and Kate know that to implicate them is ridiculous."It would seem, however, that the police focus has turned increasingly to the period between 6pm and 8.30pm when the couple were alone with their children.The implication, one that the McCanns and their supporters find ludicrous, is that Madeleine's body would have been concealed in an undisclosed location and lain undetected throughout the fingertip search of the town and its surrounding area in the days following her disappearance, before being moved some weeks later.But one of Britain's leading forensic pathologists has raised questions about the suggestion that the body could have been stored before moving it almost four weeks later."A body is not in very good condition 25 days after death, especially in a Portuguese climate," said Derrick Pounder, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Dundee. "The decomposition smell would be obnoxious, lingering and very difficult to get rid of." The only way to stop decomposition, he said, would be to put it in a freezer or to use specialist chemicals which would be very difficult to obtain.Asked about the possibility of DNA transferring to clothes or other materials, Prof Pounder said modern techniques were so sensitive, "it's very easy to have an innocent contamination. It is a very powerful technique but sometimes its power is its weakness."
