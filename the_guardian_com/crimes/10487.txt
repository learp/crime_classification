Military boot camps for young persistent offenders and Victorian style philanthropy for "deeply scrambled" under-fives, was proposed yesterday by the shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin.Mr Letwin's tough and tender message included the warning that criminal gangs were now substitutes for family and community networks. He praised the two-parent family, but in a break with Conservative tradition did not call for tax breaks to support marriage. He admitted he was shocked by the upbringing of many young people in Britain, acknowledging that his privileged background had not exposed him to their "depraved lifestyles, neglectful parenting or orgy of vandalism". He said young offenders were responsible for a third of all criminal convictions. Turkish and US models of near military intervention, with persistent offenders being offered education in camps with the spectre of prison if they abused their privileges, were appropriate, he said. He praised the Victorian moralists' solution using voluntary helpers in groups such as the Scouts and Sunday schools movement. "If the worst outcome of this is that people who would be mugging old ladies go to the church or mosque instead, that would be a good outcome." Reconviction rates were lower in systems offering education, mentoring and detox programmes, he said. And, renouncing Tory rhetoric that criminals were "evil" by choice, he accepted that many youngsters were forced on to a conveyor belt of crime by the age of four.
