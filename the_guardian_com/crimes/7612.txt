Former IRA prisoner Colin Duffy appeared in court today charged with murdering two soldiers outside their barracks in Antrim.The 41-year-old North Armagh republican appeared at Larne magistrates court this morning. There was a heavy security presence in and around the court house with armed police officers patrolling the area.Bail was refused and Duffy was remanded in custody until 21 April to appear at Antrim magistrates court.Duffy, who is denying all the charges, smiled at his wife during the hearing. His legal team said afterwards that they would be going to the high court in Belfast on Monday to attempt to get their client freed on bail.In addition to the two murder charges, Duffy was also charged with five counts of attempted murder and one of having a firearm and ammunition.Sappers Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, were shot collecting pizza outside the Massereene barracks on 7 March.A Vauxhall Cavalier, believed to have been driven by the soldiers' killers, was abandoned outside nearby Randalstown after the shootings.An incendiary device, which was intended to destroy the car, failed to detonate.Earlier this week Duffy was briefly freed from detention after Northern Ireland's lord chief justice ruled that his incarceration, along with six others, was unlawful.But he was re-arrested inside Antrim police station on Wednesday and charged earlier today with murder.
