The uncle of two-year-old Casey Leigh Mullen was today jailed for life after admitting he raped and killed her.Michael Mullen, 21, was told he would serve a minimum of 35 years in jail after he pleaded guilty to the crimes at Leeds crown court.Mr Justice Simon said Mullen was "a very dangerous man capable of lethal and violent sexual crimes against children". The judge added that it was unclear if there would ever be a time when Mullen was not a threat.Mullen was arrested after the toddler was found in a pool of blood at her home in Oak Tree Crescent, Gipton, Leeds.A postmortem examination showed the toddler died from compression of the neck.The judge said: "At about 7.45pm on Sunday February 11 this year after an afternoon of drinking you arrived with your brother at Oak Tree Crescent. At some stage you went upstairs alone and you entered the bedroom of Casey Leigh Mullen. There you raped her and then killed her."Those bare outlines are dreadful enough, but what is particularly horrifying about this crime is that she was your niece and she was a child of two years and two months."The strong likelihood is that you covered her face with your hand while you were raping her. You then strangled her with a ligature, which you applied to her neck for not less than 30 seconds. The rape and murder of this little girl by someone she trusted and loved were appalling crimes."Mr Justice Simon said Mullen was two and a half times over the legal alcohol limit for driving at the time of the crime and noted that this could have affected his behaviour.Mullen, of Lawrence Road, Leeds, has been remanded in custody since his first appearance at Leeds magistrates court in February.The court heard how police found an image of Casey, naked from the waist down, on Mullen's phone.Police also found sexual images of children on his computer, including one which involved sadism, downloaded between October 2006 and February.The judge said: "Police investigations have shown that you had used your computer to download indecent images of children and images of sexual abuse of children. It's clear that these offences were aggravated by strong paedophilic urges."Psychiatric reports revealed that Mullen fell within the normal range of IQ and did not have a mental illness. But reports also said he had a psychopathic disorder which was not treatable.The judge added: "How and why you came to commit these crimes against Casey, who would have felt safe and secure in your presence, is beyond all understanding."Casey was discovered by her mother, Samantha Canham, 21, at their home at around 9.30pm on February 11.The child lived in a rented house with her mother, her 20-year-old father, David Mullen, and her three-year-old brother.A neighbour and family friend Sarah Pringle, 22, described at the time how she went to the house after hearing a commotion.She found Casey's mother screaming hysterically and the little girl covered in blood. She tried to revive Casey as blood poured from the child's ears and nose.Police and paramedics arrived and Casey was brought out of the house as anxious neighbours looked on.The incident sent shockwaves through the tight-knit community, where residents were devastated by the loss of a "lovely little girl", who was "always smiling".Casey's parents had moved into the house around 14 months before the attack. Near neighbours of the family said they called Casey "Smiley" because she was such a friendly, happy child.After the hearing concluded, Casey's parents issued a statement expressing their relief at the sentence.It said: "We have some very happy memories of Casey Leigh and she will always be in our thoughts and in our hearts."She was a special little girl. We thank the good people of Leeds and particularly all those who sent us cards and letters. Those were a great comfort to us."We would also like to thank West Yorkshire Police for their hard work and dedication - we know at times it couldn't have been easy. We would now like to get on with our lives in peace and attempt to come to terms with the events of the last few months."The senior investigating officer in the case, detective superintendent Steve Payne, said: "Casey Leigh Mullen lived a short life which was brought to a very brutal end by a man she should have been able to trust."The sentence given by the judge has ensured that Michael Mullen will remain behind bars for a very long time and will no longer present a danger to young children."
