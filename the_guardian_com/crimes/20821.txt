A man was left disfigured after being attacked because of a relationship he was having with a married woman, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Awais Akram, 25, looked like "a zombie from a horror movie" after the assault last July. Akram was burned and bleeding from his nose and eyes and with flesh hanging off his body, prosecutor David Markham said.Akram was allegedly targeted after his relationship with Sadia Khatoon was discovered by her husband and family.The court heard that Khatoon, who had met Akram online, helped lay a "deadly trap", luring him to the scene of the attack "whether willingly or under some pressure from those who discovered the relationship". Akram was stabbed and beaten and had sulphuric acid poured on him. He received 47% burns and serious stab wounds.Khatoon's brother, Mohammed Vakas, 26, and her cousin, Mohammed Adeel, 20, were said to have planned to kill Akram "as an act of revenge" for the relationship, and a 17-year-old youth was also recruited.Adeel and Vakas, both of Walthamstow, north-east London, and the teenager, who cannot be named, deny conspiring with Khatoon and her husband, Shakeel Abassi, to murder Akram. Vakas has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, a charge his two co-defendants deny.Khatoon and Abassi were last known to be in Pakistan, Markham said.The court heard that Akram and Khatoon began their relationship in March or April last year. They would later meet at her home in Walthamstow while her husband was out. In July last year, Khatoon telephoned Akram and asked him to go to an internet cafe to pick up an airline ticket for Pakistan. But the court heard he "walked into a trap" and was subjected to "a savage attack" by a group of men.The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
