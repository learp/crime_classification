More than 26,000 DNA profiles were left off the national database for up to nine years because of failures by Home Office forensic scientists and the police, it emerged yesterday.The blunder was discovered in July 2005 and reported to senior officials. But ministers were not told until January, despite a demand by John Reid, the home secretary, when he took over from Charles Clarke a year ago, that all major problems in the department be disclosed.The Forensic Science Service (FSS) is expected to face fresh embarrassment today when an independent review reports on its work in the Damilola Taylor murder and comparable cases.The Home Office said yesterday that the DNA failure had led to nearly 200 crimes involving 85 suspects going undetected for up to 11 years; offenders included one paedophile, three robbers, nine burglars, 19 drug dealers and 62 thieves.The Liberal Democrats said last night that bad news had once again been smuggled out of the Home Office long after the problem had been identified, and asked why ministers had not come clean earlier.The DNA shambles was tucked away in the small print of the national DNA database annual report published yesterday; it disclosed that in July 2005 the FSS identified 26,200 profiles returned to it between 1995 and 2004 because they could not be loaded on to the database. More than 90% of the samples involved had been left off the database since 2001, and no attempt was made to reload them until July 2005, when the backlog was discovered and the FSS, the police and the Home Office began an investigation.The FSS said that in most cases they had been left off because of discrepancies between the information entered on the police national computer at the time a DNA sample was taken and the written information the police sent with the sample. "If there is a discrepancy or information is missing, the sample fails to load and cannot be reloaded until the discrepancy is resolved," it said. The Association of Chief Police Officers said that the errors were made either by the original police force or the forensic laboratory involved.The FSS and the police admitted yesterday that only 20, 049 of the "lost" samples had now been put on the database. A further 6,089 could not be loaded for "either technical or legal reasons". Acpo said that 355 new matches had now been made with crime scenes, leading to the arrest of 85 suspects for a total of 183 offences.
