News that a UK revenge porn law will mean perpetrators face up to two years in prison is heartening. The swift and decisive action the UK has taken to respond to such heinous behaviour is a beacon of hope for those victimised around the world, not least because most countries are refusing to hold websites liable.The response of the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service and the House of Lords has also cast a harsh light on the shortcoming of the US’s response to the growing problem of revenge porn. Unfortunately, of the 14 US states with laws addressing this phenomenon, most – if not all – have been lax in enforcing them. When there have been attempts to enforce the law, the cases have been mishandled to the detriment of victims.Meanwhile, law enforcement officials continue to shame and demean victims who turn to them for help. Legislators are supporting bills, but halfheartedly, with many failing to take a strong stand on the issue.Activists and advocates have fought against the American Civil Liberties Union, which staunchly opposes most revenge porn legislation while dismissively acknowledging the victims who have been fired from jobs, or kicked out of college, or who have taken their own lives – not because of embarrassment but due to the isolation and helplessness they have been subjected to in a country where social media platforms deem doctored images of women “controversial humour”.
