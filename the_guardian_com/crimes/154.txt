David Cameron's talk of an "all-out war on gangs and gang culture" and a national citizen service echoes the "eye-catching initiatives" Tony Blair once demanded from his Downing Street staff to combat the idea that he was in any way soft on crime.When Cameron and his home secretary, Theresa May, took office last year, they went out of their way to insist they would not respond to every crisis by coming up with "headline-grabbing programmes".For example, May was widely congratulated for not rushing through new law-and-order legislation tightening up even further Britain's gun laws in the wake of the Raoul Moat shootings last summer.But last week's riots seem to have unnerved Cameron and his closest staff. Tough talk by the prime minister of a "social fightback" to match the "security fightback" has already produced ringing headlines, but how much policy flesh is there on these promises?As one senior Whitehall official observed: "It is all a bit hazy at the moment. It is getting close to a classic case of Downing Street making it up on the hoof. The prime minister has announced it – now policy officials are trying to work out how on Earth they make it happen."So what, in specific terms, has the government proposed?Loss of benefits from convicted riotersCameron did not endorse this specific policy in his speech, but some argue he has laid the ground for such a move by arguing that the welfare system needs to be reformed to tackle the "slow-motion moral collapse" in Britain's "broken society". The absence of the proposal from the speech probably indicates it has yet to be endorsed by the cabinet.The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, has not been slow to try to fill the policy vacuum with detailed plans to completely remove benefits from some looters and make those of others conditional on attending a rehabilitation programme including regular checks on behaviour.Anyone who gets a prison sentence already automatically loses their benefits, so the Duncan Smith plan will extend this to those given community sentences. But there are strong critics, including Liberal Democrats, who fear the plan will backfire and actually encourage those punished in this way to turn to crime as they end up in an even more desperate situation – at least those in prison get fed and accommodated.Others point out that there is no automatic way for the courts to stop the benefits of convicted offenders, and the plan would be very difficult to enforce.But underlying the policy is an ideological point that says welfare benefits are a privilege and not a right, and those who choose to break the law should be treated as outlaws and forced to live outside the law and, for that matter, society. It is a recipe for brutalisation.Security fightbackCameron says he is giving the police the power to remove face masks and other coverings from rioters and looking at giving them more powers to confiscate their property.But these measures will require legislation and, however quickly amendments are added to the current protection of freedoms bill, they will not be law until next spring. On police cuts, Cameron is in "no surrender" mood, and signalled that May would step up the argument that more police could be made available for frontline policing while forces still take their "fair share" of cuts. This is proving increasingly difficult to defend.All-out war on gangs and gang cultureCameron says it is time the British police introduced a US-style "zero-tolerance" approach to gangs. But many of the lessons of Boston's Operation Ceasefire have already been absorbed by British police and replicated in London's Operation Trident, in Strathclyde's anti-gang programme and in the multi-agency approach in Manchester.A lot of these initiatives have been around since the early 2000s, but have never really been given huge funding or momentum. Cameron promises this will now be a national priority, but any programme also needs to tackle the burgeoning gang culture inside prisons and young offender institutions.Society fightbackThe prime minister's main promise is to "turn around the lives of the 120,000 most troubled families in the country" by 2015.This echoes Gordon Brown's 2008 promise to target "more than 110,000 problem families with disruptive young people". They include families with children who have been excluded from school, who have been in trouble with the law or who are identified as likely to be in trouble later on.The family intervention programme – under which local services provide support to families with multiple social, economic, health and behaviour problems – has been widely praised by all parties.But the latest official figures show that, in 2009-10, only 3,518 families were actually in the programme and it has helped only 7,300 families since being set up in 2006. This year's figures are due next month but are unlikely to be much higher, with more than half of local authorities declining to take part in a programme that is not cheap to implement.Expanding this programme to 120,000 families within four years seems more than ambitious. Cameron blames "bureaucratic" problems but, for many local authorities, it is a "Rolls-Royce" solution they cannot afford.The ringfencing of family intervention programme money ended in May 2010.National Citizen ServiceA pilot scheme giving 11,000 volunteer 16-year-olds the chance to spend three weeks, including a fortnight away from home, delivering local community projects and mountaineering, abseiling and canoeing started this summer.It is not compulsory, and is much more Duke of Edinburgh award scheme than national service.
