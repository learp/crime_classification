The former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis faces a possible prison sentence after being convicted of indecently assaulting a woman working in television almost 20 years ago.The one-time Top of the Pops presenter, who has faced two trials since being arrested two years ago over allegations of historical sexual abuse, was found guilty by a majority of 10 to two of groping the woman, who was working behind the scenes on the BBC comedy The Mrs Merton Show in 1995.He was acquitted of indecently assaulting another woman while he was appearing in a production of Aladdin in 1990, and cleared of a third charge of sexually assaulting a journalist on which the jury failed to reach a verdict.Travis, 69, charged under his real name of David Griffin, looked stunned as he left the court with his wife, Marianne, after being granted bail. He will be sentenced on Friday.His counsel told Southwark crown court that the “custodial threshold has not been met”, and said the judge could order Travis to carry out unpaid work as a punishment.The judge Anthony Leonard QC warned Travis: “All options remain open.” The maximum sentence is 10 years in prison.Outside court, Travis, who became a household name in the 1970s, declined to comment, telling journalists: “I’m not speaking to anybody right this moment.”The jury of six men and six women, who took 19 hours and 15 minutes to reach verdicts, had been told he was an “opportunist” who thought he had the “perfect right” to grope women.The jury heard that on 17 January 1995 he approached the researcher working on The Mrs Merton Show, on which he was a guest, as she stood smoking in the corridor. He commented on her “poor little lungs” before putting his hands on her breasts for at least 10-15 seconds until she ran away.She spoke to police after Travis was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault relating to eight women and one 15-year-old girl at his original trial in February. The jury failed to reach verdicts on two counts and Travis faced a retrial on both.One was the alleged indecent assault of a woman between 1 November 1990 and 31 January 1991. The woman, then in her 20s, claimed that while working on Aladdin they were alone in his dressing room when he put his hand inside her trousers. He was found not guilty.The second related to a female journalist who alleged that Travis assaulted her in his home following an interview in 2008, claiming that he touched her chest and held his hands there for several seconds. The jury was again unable to reach a verdict.Travis was first arrested in October 2012. The presenter, whose long-running Radio 1 breakfast show earned him the soubriquet “the Hairy Cornflake”, is the third person to be convicted as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal to investigate allegations of historical sexual abuse linked to the entertainment industry.Jenny Hopkins, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in London, said: “David Griffin, also known as Dave Lee Travis, indecently assaulted a young woman by touching her in a way that was not only deeply invasive but also against the law. We thank the jury for their careful consideration in this case and we respect all the verdicts of the court today.“The prosecution of sexual offences is often difficult and complex, perhaps even more so when the allegations are from some years ago. We will continue to consider cases and, wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, we will work with police to build strong cases which can be put before the court.”In a statement, the Metropolitan police said it “would encourage all victims who have been subjected to sexual assault to make contact with police whether the abuse was recent or non-recent. The passage of time will not prevent offenders being investigated and brought to justice.”A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC is appalled by the crime Dave Lee Travis has been convicted of.”The court heard from two other woman, a foreign journalist and a woman who served Travis drinks in the Isle of Man in the 1980s, who also claimed they were groped by Travis but were not complainants in the trial.Giving evidence, the veteran DJ denied the claims, telling jurors the women were lying. He called on a host of defence witnesses; the jury heard him described as the “perfect gentleman”.The criminal proceedings have taken a toll on Travis. He has sold the Buckinghamshire home he shared with his wife of 43 years in order to pay legal bills.He was inducted into radio’s hall of fame in 2010, capping a 50-year career that started on the offshore pirate station Radio Caroline and which was halted on his arrest when he was dropped by Magic AM.Mark Castle, from the charity Victim Support, said Travis had added to the distress of his victim by accusing her of being a liar. “Today’s conviction is a vindication for all victims of indecent assault who were attacked by someone so famous that they feared they would never get justice,” he said.There have been 17 arrests under Operation Yewtree. The PR agent Max Clifford, 71, the first person to be convicted, was jailed for eight years for a string of indecent assaults on four women and girls. The TV entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, was jailed for five years and nine months for 12 indecent assaults against four girls.As well as the three convictions, the former pop star Gary Glitter and the ex-Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning are facing prosecution in separate cases. Driver David Smith was due to face trial but took his own life before he could do so.Eight people – including the comedians Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr – have been told that no further action will be taken, and another three, including the broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, remain on police bail.
