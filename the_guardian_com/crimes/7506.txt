Two teenagers arrested in connection with a number of sex attacks around a university campus in Manchester have been released by police.A 14-year-old boy and 18-year-old man must return to a police station later on Sunday to be questioned further by officers, Greater Manchester Police said.The boys were arrested on Saturday after a senior detective issued a photofit and said the wanted offender – said to be as young as 12 – needed to be caught before the assaults escalated.Following the police appeal, the pair were arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and were questioned in custody.Three separate attacks have taken place near the grounds of the University of Manchester in the past month.The first two assaults took place within 15 minutes of each other on Saturday 21 September.A 27-year-old woman was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 6.15pm but the offender ran off when she screamed.The next incident followed in Oxford Road when a woman aged 21 was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left a library.She walked away and was then sexually assaulted by the assailant, described as a young Asian boy.The third attack took place in Lloyd Street North at about 2.15pm on Saturday 5 October.A 32-year-old woman was approached by two young boys and sexually assaulted by one of them. He was described as Asian, aged 12 to 13, and carrying a rucksack on his back.Following the arrests, Detective Chief Inspector Colin Larkin said: "These crimes have shocked everyone and I am pleased to say that we have now made two arrests."I would like to thank members of the public and the media for their support and the information they have provided and as a result we are now in a position where two people are in custody and are being questioned."However, we still remain in the early days of this investigation and there is still a lot of work to be done."I want to reassure the community that, while we have made arrests, we will continue to investigate these appalling incidents so we so can establish all the facts and who is responsible."I would continue to appeal to anyone who either has information about these three attacks or has information about any other incidents of this nature to come forward."Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 4223 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
