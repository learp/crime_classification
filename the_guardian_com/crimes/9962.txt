Homeowners who cause problems for their neighbours will be evicted under proposals outlined today by the prime minister, Tony Blair.Mr Blair revealed plans to evict nuisance neighbours and leave them to fend for themselves in what could be seen as the toughest move to date to curb antisocial behaviour.Those guilty of causing a persistent nuisance will be subject to a closure order. Only those with vulnerable children will be rehoused by councils - but in a different area.Homeowners will have their houses boarded up for at least three months in an attempt to curb antisocial behaviour, he told the Sun today.The new measures would be enforced by local councils and police. Full details of the plan will be released after a three-month consultation beginning next week.Other measures due for consultation will give police extended powers to close drug dealers' flats and other premises used for breaking the law.The civil liberties of people to live free from fear are paramount, Mr Blair reportedly told the Sun."People have to know that if they are making life hell for others they are going to pay the price", Mr Blair said. "There's a duty to respect the rights of those who live around you."He added: "They mustn't be allowed to think that nothing will happen to them if they carry on. Once they start to realise there is a comeback from the community, you often don't need to carry out the punishment.A Downing Street spokesman confirmed today's report. "This is already policy in Scotland," he said. "Police can close premises for up to three months and that is what we are consulting on doing in England and Wales. It is subject to consultation."
