Danielle Jones could be alive, the barrister defending her uncle on charges of abduction and murder told Chelmsford crown court yesterday.Stuart Campbell, 43, denies kidnapping and killing his 15-year-old niece, who disappeared on her way to school on June 18 last year. Her body has never been found. The court has heard that Danielle had no passport, that her bank account was untouched and that the last confirmed sightings of her were at around 8am on the morning she vanished. But Michael Borrelli QC, defending, in his closing speech told jurors: "It is quite possible this girl had simply decided to not to go to school, simply decided not to go home and had not [been kidnapped] from Coronation Avenue." Evidence from one witness - who saw a girl she thought resembled Danielle later that day - "raises a perfectly reasonable hypothesis that suggests she may well not have been the victim of a crime when she set out at 8am that morning," he added. "The fact that after the 19th Danielle's phone was no longer registering proves maybe that her battery is dead but - we hope - it doesn't prove that she is." The teenager's only apparent contact with family or friends after her disappearance came in text messages to Mr Campbell, which the prosecution allege the defendant sent to himself using her handset. Mr Borrelli told the jurors: "Unless you are sure that Mr Campbell was in East Tilbury [Danielle's home] on the morning in question, you cannot be sure he is guilty of these crimes. "He did not do it and the prosecution cannot prove he was there to do it," he said. The prosecution allege that Mr Campbell, from Grays, Essex, murdered his niece because he was sexually obsessed by her and fixated on teenage girls in general. Evidence showed that he had visited numerous "schoolgirl" websites. The case continues.
