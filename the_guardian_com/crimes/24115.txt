The first comprehensive overhaul of the laws on prostitution for 50 years is to be announced shortly by the home secretary, David Blunkett.Home Office ministers promise that the review will "consider all the available options, no matter how radical".The main focus is expected to concentrate on tackling the involvement of organised crime in prostitution, its links with heroin and crack cocaine abuse, and the public nuisance that it causes. It is expected to lead to a new clampdown on pimps and kerb crawlers as well as overhauling the laws on brothels and soliciting.There is also expected to be a strong emphasis on finding new ways of helping women who are trapped in the vice trade to escape from the often-violent sex industry.It will include new strategies to prevent young people being drawn into prostitution, support for those who find themselves involved in it, and measures to deal with its impact on communities.A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that work on defining the scope of the cross-departmental review was nearly complete: "We want to do a thorough job. It is the first time that these laws have been looked at for 50 years. We hope to publish as early as possible."But ministers will also consider the growing pressure from senior police officers and some local authorities, such as Birmingham, to legalise "zones of toleration" where soliciting would be decriminalised as long as there was no public nuisance. An experiment in Edinburgh along these lines was recently abandoned.Prostitution is not illegal in Britain but there are more than 35 offences, including some dating from the 1950s, such as soliciting and "living off immoral earnings" which criminalise the trade.The Magistrates' Association has repeatedly called for an overhaul of the law, saying it is ineffective and unenforceable, with women appearing in court time and again.The Sexual Offences Act, which has just reached the statute book, includes tougher penalties for those who engage in human trafficking for prostitution and those who sexually exploit children and adults for commercial purposes.The Home Office has issued guidance stressing that those under 18 who are involved in prostitution should be treated as victims by the police and criminal justice system.Ministers have also funded projects to look at helping women involved in prostitution to find an escape route from the vice trade.A Home Office green paper published in 2000 acknowledged that the law on soliciting and loitering for women was archaic and the official description of a "common prostitute" was demeaning. It also recognised that there have been recent changes in the law around the world with the Netherlands and Germany allowing regulated prostitution, and Sweden changing the law to criminalise those who buy sex, rather than those who sell it."It is suggested that regulating prostitution enables more effective action against trafficking and the exploitation of children, greater safety and less stigma for those sex workers who fully exercise their choice to do that work."Others argue such regulation increases the use of men and women as commodities of trade, that allowing a legal market merely increases the illegal activity and that selling sex is unacceptable in a civilised society. There was no consensus across a set of widely diverging views," the Home Office paper concluded.The former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, is supporting the moves to change the law, saying that his attitude to prostitution changed after he befriended a young teenage prostitute who is now a Church of England priest. She convinced him that the present laws work against women breaking free of the culture of violence that surrounds life on the game.The last full-scale review of the law in this area was the 1954 Wolfenden committee on homosexual offences and prostitution. The legislation that followed is now widely seen as contradictory. The 1956 Sexual Offences Act was said to push women on to the streets, the 1959 Sexual Offences Act was said to push them off the streets, while the 1985 Sexual Offences Act forces them to make dangerous judgments in a matter of seconds before jumping into a stranger's car.Ministers acknowledge that nearly every model for dealing with prostitution has been tried in Britain over the last 700 years.In the 15th and 16th centuries there was an early experiment in state-regulated prostitution, with the Bishop of Winchester insisting that a prostitute who took money from a customer should "ly still with him" all night.
