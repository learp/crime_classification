Primary schools that push their pupils academically reduce antisocial behaviour among children, a government-funded study suggests. Researchers who followed the progress of about 3,000 children to the age of 10 say schools that set challenging targets for pupils improve behaviour and may influence other aspects of a school's culture.The authors say that this leads to fewer pupils getting into trouble, particularly those who never had education, playgroup experience or care outside the home before they went to school.The study said this was important "because some have claimed that a focus on academic progress may lead to poorer outcomes in other aspects of development".Researchers from Nottingham and Oxford universities and Birkbeck College and the Institute of Education in London tracked the way children mixed and behaved as part of a wider project trying to establish the most effective pre-school and primary education.They also said there was new evidence to show that some pre-school experience outside the home before the age of two has long term benefits, encouraging children to be kind and considerate, sharing treats and toys with other youngsters and volunteering to help.Those that attended good pre-schooling, most often found in nursery schools and centres integrating early learning with day care and other services, showed better behaviour across the board at 10, according to teachers.Overall the researchers conclude that it was a combination of experiences at home and at school that helped children succeed.
