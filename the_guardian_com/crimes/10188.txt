The controversial US rapper Snoop Dogg has won the latest round in a long-running battle with the UK Border Agency to be allowed into the country.The 38-year-old, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was originally denied entry in 2007, forcing him and fellow rapper P Diddy to cancel the British dates of their European tour.The ban relates to his arrest at Heathrow airport in 2006 following a fracas involving members of his entourage.In 2008 the ban was lifted when an immigration judge found no evidence the rapper had been responsible for any public disorder. But the UK Border Agency challenged the decision and it went to an asylum and immigration tribunal. Earlier this week the tribunal announced its decision that to deny him entry had been wrong."We are disappointed by the tribunal's decision in this case," a UK Border Agency spokesperson said today. "We are studying the determination carefully and will take a decision whether to appeal."The performer has had a series of brushes with the law in recent years. In 2007 he pleaded no contest to gun and drugs charges in the US. The same year he was barred from entering Australia after failing a character test. Last year he was cleared of assaulting a fan at a 2005 gig in Seattle.In 1993, the year his hugely successful debut album Doggystyle was released, he was charged as an accomplice to the murder of Phillip Woldermarian in 1993 but cleared of involvement after a highly-publicised trial.The rapper, who joined the Nation of Islam last year, has released 10 albums and recently appeared on the re-recorded version of We Are The World for victims of the Haiti earthquake.
