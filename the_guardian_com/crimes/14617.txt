A man will today appear in court charged with the murder of 18-year-old Laura Torn.Guy Beckett, 31, of Owston Ferry in north Lincolnshire, was charged by Humberside police last night and is due before Scunthorpe magistrates this morning. Mr Beckett was also charged with arson at the Red Lion pub in Owston Ferry on April 25, two days before Ms Torn's disappearance. She vanished following a midnight lock-in at a pub in Owston Ferry, her home village, 12 days ago; she had been celebrating passing her driving test with her parents and brother Martin, 13, and was also about to apply for training as a police cadet. After an intensive search by police, a body found in a haystack beside a farm track in the hamlet of Misson, on the Yorkshire-Nottinghamshire border, was yesterday identified as hers. A pathologist said she had been strangled. Humberside police said that a number of items she was thought to have had with her at the pub had yet to be found, including a Sony mobile phone, a silver watch, a denim handbag with a floral-patterned shoulder strap, and a large, hooped silver earring. The teenager was found after police had drained marshes around the rivers Trent and Humber. One of her distinctive, platform-soled boots was discovered on the Trent riverbank near Owston last week, but nothing else. The search then shifted from the Owston area to woods eight miles away at Gringley-on-the-Hill and then to Misson. "We want to hear from anyone who saw anything different or suspicious, any people or any unfamiliar vehicles acting in a suspicious manner on the night of Sunday April 27, when she disappeared," police said yesterday in an appeal to local people. Ms Torn's father, Peter, said that his daughter had been cheerful and ebullient in the pub that Sunday, after having an argument with a male friend earlier in the evening but patching it up.
