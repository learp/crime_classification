Ministers were challenged yesterday to recognise public concerns about their ill-defined right to resist burglars in their own homes by providing parliamentary time for a backbench Conservative bill designed to clarify the law.Anne McIntosh, Tory MP for the Vale of York, won fifth place in the annual ballot to introduce a private member's bill at Westminster and has chosen to try to allow householders to use more than the current "reasonable force" to resist domestic intrusion.In the wake of the imprisonment of Tony Martin, the farmer who shoot a teenage burglar in the back, opinion polls have shown growing concern. Last year Labour blocked a similar bill .At a Commons press conference, Ms McIntosh said: "It is a clear matter of principle that people have the right to reasonably defend their family and their property. This should not just apply to domestic but also to commercial property."The MP knows that unless non-Tories support her bill and ministers provide government time to allow it to pass through the Commons and Lords, it has little chance of succeeding.Tony Blair has expressed sympathy with householders' concerns, but No 10 said he would not support the bill.
