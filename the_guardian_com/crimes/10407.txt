Detectives are working to establish how long a 13-year-old girl was alone on a boat before she was found and the bodies of her mother and her mother's partner were recovered from a river.Detective superintendent Jes Fry, head of the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigations team, said inquiries were ongoing into how long each of the couple was dead before they were pulled from the river Bure on Sunday.He refused to comment on reports that the mother, who has not been named, had been dead for several days.But it is understood that the girl, who was found alone and unharmed on board the family's rental boat, was cared for and fed throughout last week. It is not thought she was locked inside the boat.Postmortem results have shown the woman died before entering the water, probably as a result of strangulation.The man died primarily as a result of drowning. It is thought he killed himself and might have also used another method, such as an overdose."All circumstances point towards this being a domestic incident and we will continue to investigate in order to put a full set of evidence before the coroner," said Fry. "The girl has been interviewed by specialist officers. Her welfare is our paramount concern and we will continue to support her and her family."Divers brought in by police launched a search after officers, alerted by a boat hire company concerned that one of its vessels had not returned, found the woman's daughter alone on the boat moored in an isolated inlet between Wroxham Broad and Salhouse Broad.Police have not yet identified the man and woman, both in their 40s and from Surrey. The fact that the bodies were found in water has complicated the identification process.The man is not a UK national, meaning it could take days to obtain dental records and other forms of identification from his home country, believed to be the US.The girl was being cared for by family in Norfolk.The man was found dead near the body of his girlfriend by police divers searching the river on Sunday.The couple had been holidaying on the Norfolk Broads with the woman's 13-year-old daughter for about a week and are said to have enjoyed meals at local pubs.The spot where the boat was moored is isolated and away from official stopping places. It is surrounded by wood and marshland with no foot access. Water in the area where the bodies were found is shallow.Some reports suggest the boat had been moored at the same spot for most of the week with few signs of life on deck. But others reported seeing the family enjoying a barbecue on board on Friday night.Several items, including a computer and bed sheets, were removed from one of the cruiser's bedrooms by forensic specialists after it was moved to a boatyard in nearby Horning. Detectives have refused to comment on claims that a sex toy was among items taken as evidence.A spokesman for Le Boat, the company which owns the boat, told the Eastern Daily Press the family had hired boats and holidayed on the Broads before.â€¢ This article was amended on 5 September 2012 to clarify that divers who searched the river were not police divers.
