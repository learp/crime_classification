The roll call of Labour's anti-crime initiatives over the past four years has been breathtaking. Next time round, we can expect more of the same. The manifesto promises less crime in a "democratic, decentralised and diverse" society. Much of the detailed thinking can be found in Labour's 10-year anti-crime plan: Criminal Justice: the Way Ahead. But can it work? Crime reduction partnershipsThe biggest crime-fighting achievement in Labour's last term was the introduction of "crime reduction partnerships" where police, local authorities, probation, health authorities and others work together at local level to tackle crime. The principle is radical and obvious: responsibility for crime control should be placed on those agencies that have the means to achieve it. The 376 partnerships in England and Wales are now in place, but many are struggling. Their crime reduction projects have often been poorly conceived and ineptly implemented, driven by too little analysis and too much political pressure to deliver fast. If the partnerships are to take better root, the Home Office will have to deploy its new safer communities fund more cleverly, to provide incentives for joint working and to allow time to do the job properly, without stifling creativity. Much will depend on the nine regional crime reduction directors, appointed last year to support and champion the partnerships. The safer communities initiative is to dovetail with more broadly focused initiatives: new deal for communities; neighbourhood renewal; sure start; and the children's fund, for example. The theory is right but the sheer ambition of the enterprise makes it hard to assess the prospects of success.  The police There is a firm consensus between the main parties that more police are needed. The public demand for more visible policing is so overwhelming that only a kamikaze politician would point to falling crime and mouth the question, "Why more police?". Labour's bid is for 6,000 extra officers over three years. In truth the last 15 years have seen less police "out there". More rigorous legal accountability (called red tape by cynics) has reduced patrolling time. Extra numbers will go some way to offsetting the deficit. However, numbers alone will not achieve a more responsive police service. Nor will extra bobbies on the beat have any significant deterrent effect on burglary, robbery or car theft. Certainly there are good uses to which extra officers could be put. They could lead to more accessible and responsive policing, focusing on problems of crime and disorder as negotiated between local police and the communities they serve. In the long run more responsive policing should enhance police legitimacy, improve public cooperation and cut crime. Such an enterprise could fail badly, however, if it were hijacked by proponents of "zero tolerance" crackdowns on "yob culture". Neighbourhood wardens could also play an important role; the risk is that local authorities will shy from spending enough on high quality staff. A key task is to recover the morale of the police workforce. Some commentators have linked poor morale to the Macpherson inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence. The linkage is questionable. A better argument can be made about the link between managerial style and police morale. The gulf between officers on the ground and their managers is palpable. Chiefs talk the language of crime control through performance management. Frontline officers hear this as "policing by numbers", and themselves too often "play the numbers game", making sure that performance targets are met rather than public interests served. Whether Labour - and police chiefs - will have enough self-discipline to decentralise policing, giving real power to local divisional commanders and their partners, remains to be seen. Reforming the criminal process Labour has a wide-ranging "modernising" agenda, to make the wheels of justice turn faster and smoother. Many proposals are welcome, especially the existing reforms of the youth justice system and the plans for a more efficient crown prosecution service. Criminologists have long argued that certainty and speed of punishment have a higher deterrent impact than draconian penalties. We now punish a smaller proportion of offenders than we did 20 years ago - but punish them more heavily. It is time to redress the balance. Over the last four years the courts have been given many new powers for dealing with offenders. Some sit well with the evidence-based approach of the rest of the reform agenda. Drug treatment and testing orders (DTTOs) are a good example. Others mine a more authoritarian seam. Curfew orders, parenting orders, anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs), drug testing orders (as distinct from DTTOs) have all provoked criticism. The concerns focus on the imposition of unrealistic responsibilities on offenders or their parents, on the overly broad definitions of the behaviours that could attract these orders, and, as in the case of ASBOs, the use of civil law procedures. In practice, take-up for these provisions has been slow, and beset by practical problems and expense. For the coming term, the key set of provisions will be in the sentencing framework review, still to be published. At one level, we can expect a rational and coherent set of proposals designed to give sentencers greater flexibility. Sentencers are likely to get a "cafeteria" menu of disposals - penal, rehabilitative and restorative - from which to assemble a sentence. One option is likely to be "custody plus" in which part of a sentence is served in prison, and the rest under some form of community supervision. Another proposal is to give the courts clearer powers to sentence on record, allowing the targeting of the 10% of offenders who are thought to commit up to half of all crime. If one were designing a rational criminal process afresh, this is the sort of framework one would want. The difficulty is that penal policy is often made more for political than rational reasons based on evidence. The framework runs two risks. First, sentencers tend to be both greedy and cautious: greedy in wanting punishment and rehabilitation and reparation if all are on offer; cautious in ensuring that punishment is always on the list. If a cafeteria system is introduced, the most likely upshot is that offenders will get more intrusive and more expensive penalties than at present - "custody plus" instead of probation, reparation and probation instead of a fine. There is also a real risk that the 100,000 "persistent offenders" might well be misidentified as such, and over-punished. The way to avoid this "ratcheting-up" is to introduce the framework in a way that fetters sentencers' discretion to over-punish. This leads us to the second problem, which is that in a populist penal climate, few politicians will risk looking soft on crime. The framework proposals could thus push up prison numbers beyond the current all-time high of 65,000. In short, the sentencing framework would be ideal - if only one could keep the politics out of sentencing.
