One of the oldest men to appear at the Old Bailey has admitted killing his nephew after mistaking him for a burglar.Ezekiel McCarthy, 84, was said to be confused when he plunged a knife into Desbert Welsh, 50. He denied murder and his plea to a manslaughter charge was accepted by the prosecution.The incident happened on 13 November last year at McCarthy's ground-floor flat in sheltered accommodation where he lived in Cricklewood, north London.The pair had been drinking and celebrating McCarthy's birthday, which was a few days earlier on 8 November. They arrived at McCarthy's home in the early hours, and in the morning McCarthy knocked on a neighbour's door seeking help.A female friend saw McCarthy outside, holding a knife with blood on it, said Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting. McCarthy told her: "This bloody man. I don't know how he got in my room."He later told police: "I was defending myself."Rees said: "This is a dreadfully sad case involving the killing of a nephew by his uncle, thinking he was an unknown intruder."Medical reports indicated that McCarthy had suffered an acute episode of delirium or confusion brought about by medical conditions linked to his age.Welsh died three days later from a stab wound which pierced his liver and caused complications. Alex Milne QC, defending, said the death had had an impact on the whole family. McCarthy could not believe what he had done and could not associate the victim with his nephew.Mr Milne said: "He is destroyed. He is mortified. He could not in his wildest dreams harm his nephew."McCarthy was bailed to 4 December for reports on his dangerousness. Judge Peter Beaumont, the recorder of London, warned him that all options were still open to the court.
