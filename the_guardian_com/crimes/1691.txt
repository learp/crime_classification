A 13-year-old was stabbed in a London street yesterday afternoon, less than a week after Damilola Taylor was killed as he walked home from school.The black boy was walking with an Asian friend in Hackney Wick, north-east London, when they were approached by two youths who stole a mobile phone and cash from the Asian boy, also aged 13. A passerby intervened and the robbers left, but they returned when the two boys were on their own, punching the Asian and stabbing his friend with a knife, leaving him seriously injured. London Ambulance Service said he had cuts to his stomach but his condition was stable. Meanwhile a gang of youths aged 10 to 14 has become the focus of the Damilola Taylor investigation. The youths were loitering in Peckham, south London, on the night he was stabbed and bled to death. Witnesses have told Scotland Yard detectives that between six and 10 boys were outside the library where the 10-year-old had joined an after-school computer class last Monday. An anonymous 999 call reported a bottle fight between youths shortly before the time Damilola was attacked, but police officers who went to the scene found no evidence of the incident. Detective Superintendent David Dillnutt said: "We are still seeking witnesses at the library from about 3.35pm when Damilola arrived. There was a group of youths outside _ this is a particular square where children meet." Police believe a woman in a red anorak with a small child was also outside the library, and would be a valuable witness. The fresh appeal for information came following the arrest and release on Saturday of two boys, aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old woman. During a press conference yesterday Mr Dillnutt dismissed reports that Damilola's family believed their son, who was born in Nigeria and had moved to the UK four months ago, was being bullied by West Indian youths. "We have no evidence of this. The family is not saying this is a racial incident or a racist attack. "We simply do not know if there is a link between the bul lying that had been complained of by Damilola's family and his death." Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, acknowledged that there were tensions on the estate where he was killed. "What is being said is that there is a certain amount of tension between racial groups," he told London Weekend Television. "We must not deny that, but we must also not build that up into a situation where there's more violence." Sir John said 70 officers were on the case. All of Damilola's classmates at Oliver Goldsmith primary school have been seen by detectives, and 100 adults have come forward with information. He died in a stairwell on the North Peckham estate minutes after being stabbed in the leg as he walked home. A memorial service for the boy was held yesterday in Peckham. Â•The government will this week announce plans to ex tend youth curfews to anyone aged up to 16. Local councils and the police have the power to impose curfews on children aged 10 and under. However, this power has not been used on a single occasion in two years. Ministers hope their plans, to be spelt out in the Queen's Speech, will help communities tackle anti-social behaviour. The police have powers to take home anyone believed to be under 16 in an area covered by a curfew order; if no parent is at home, the police can detain the youth overnight. Ministers will also review policy on the carrying of knives by re-examining the Offensive Weapons Act. A knives amnesty following the murder of London teacher Phillip Lawrence in 1995 proved only a partial success. More than 40,000 weapons were handed in, but the number of attacks involving knives has continued to rise. Related stories More about the Damilola Taylor case
