The UK failed to protect a mentally ill man who was kicked and stamped to death by a schizophrenic cellmate, and failed his family in the aftermath, the European court of human rights ruled yesterday.The court in Strasbourg ordered the government to pay Paul and Audrey Edwards £20,000 in compensation and £20,000 in legal costs and expenses for four breaches of the European convention on human rights over the death of their son, Christopher. The ruling - together with recent high court judgments in cell death cases - will force the government to rethink the procedures for investigating deaths in custody to make them more open and give families more right to hold public authorities accountable. Mr and Mrs Edwards fought for six years to expose a catalogue of failures by the system both before and after their son's death. Helped by the campaigning group Liberty, they took their case to Strasbourg after discovering how limited their remedies were in the UK. Christopher Edwards, who had tentatively been diagnosed as schizophrenic, was remanded in Chelmsford prison in 1994 after he was arrested for approaching women and making inappropriate comments. He was joined in his cell by Richard Linford, a paranoid schizophrenic with a history of violence, who kicked him to death. The Strasbourg court ruled that the UK authorities not only failed to protect the life of Mr Edwards, but failed to give his family proper access to an open and rigorous investigation and a remedy in the courts. In a joint statement, Mr and Mrs Edwards said: "Justice has been achieved for Christopher, for his family and, in the future, for all those in custody and their families. "We are delighted at the judgment. The obligation is now on the government and on all the public agencies involved to see such a tragedy never occurs again."
