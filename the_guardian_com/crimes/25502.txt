A predatory paedophile who snatched a child from her bath, raped her and left her naked and bleeding in a freezing Tyneside back street was warned yesterday that he might be jailed indefinitely.Peter Voisey, 35, who was released two years after a similar attack at a swimming pool, was found guilty with the help of "bad character evidence" which became admissible only after the 2003 Criminal Justice Act.A jury unanimously convicted him of abduction, rape and sexual assault after hearing about the earlier incident and two sexually motivated burglaries. Mobile phone records and partial DNA links also broke down his initial denials of last December's attack.Newcastle crown court heard that the six-year-old child had been playing with her new Christmas bath toys when Voisey slipped in while probably casing the flat for a burglary. He grabbed the girl, smothered her screams with his hand and assaulted her twice during a 15-minute drive round the area, near the Tyne Tunnel.The head of the inquiry, Det Chief Insp Jim Napier, said that in spite of initial local incredulity he had believed the girl's story as soon as he heard it. He said "She was a first-class witness, especially considering her age and the traumatic experience."Voisey broke down in tears behind glass screens in the dock as the girl's parents also cried in the public gallery. Judge David Hodson told him: "You must expect to receive a sentence either of life imprisonment or an indefinite sentence for public protection." Voisey was remanded in custody until a sentence hearing in December.The court heard that his name had figured immediately in the police hunt because he was on the sex offenders' register after the earlier attack at Macclesfield, Cheshire, in 2001. Voisey grew up partly in North Tyneside and avoided the area because his record was known locally, but computer checks traced him to Blyth, some 10 miles north.The court heard details of his troubled childhood, which saw him taken into care and convicted of serious arson when he was 15. His marriage broke up as he drifted through a succession of jobs.He was arrested two weeks after the attack. A footprint in the girl's bedroom partially matched his trainers, DNA particles swabbed from the child were similar to his profile and mobile phone mast records showed that his phone had been in North Tyneside, not Blyth, that night.The child's mother said: "It's every mother's nightmare to think your children aren't safe in their home."
