A British Muslim convert detained at the Channel tunnel was today convicted and sentenced to 15 years' jail for terrorism offences.Andrew Rowe, 34, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of having a notebook containing details on how to fire mortar bombs and a code for terrorism.But the jury of six men and six women could not agree on a third charge of having a pair of socks, adapted with a cord, for terrorist purposes.The judge sentenced Rowe to a total of 15 years in prison after saying the government should consider life sentences for similar offences.Rowe, of Maida Vale, north-west London, had denied the charges which followed his arrest in October 2003.The prosecution alleged that the socks rolled into a ball and attached to a cord, could have been used as a mortar bung or to clean a mortar tube. But Rowe told the jury he had used it for a target for martial arts kicks and that traces of explosives found on the ball were from his trip to Bosnia in 1995.The book and code were found at addresses associated with him in London and Birmingham, the court was told. Searches of his homes in both cities revealed a notebook filled with instructions on how to operate mortar bombs, and a secret code made up of mobile phone models.A search of his former flat in west London in August 2003 resulted in police finding a WH Smith notebook with 22 pages of handwritten notes on how to aim and fire a mortar.Following his arrest, the court was told, officers went to his estranged wife's home in Birmingham. There they found a piece of paper containing the code inside a video cassette case in a cupboard.Mark Ellison, prosecuting, said the code "made it possible to communicate in an innocent message which only spoke about mobile telephones".Giving examples of the code, Mr Ellison said money was Nokia 3310, trouble-police was 3410, weapon 3610, airport 3310, army base 3331.There were also codes for explosive materials which made it a "shopping list for terrorism", Mr Ellison said.A draft of a letter on the other side of the paper said Rowe was travelling abroad on "mobile phone business" and said he would soon be meeting a man who needed his help. Rowe had travelled extensively after converting to Islam. He had been to places of conflict and had had four passports in seven years, Mr Ellison said.Afterwards, the director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, said: "This was the first trial prosecuted by the CPS (crown prosecution service) counter-terrorism division, set up in May, which draws together the skills and knowledge of the CPS's most experienced terrorism lawyers to tackle the changing threat to public safety."The challenge we successfully met was to prove to the jury that although there was no direct link between Andrew Rowe and a particular terrorist act, possession of those items together with other supporting evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude that he had them for the purpose of terrorism."
