The American flatmate of the murdered British student Meredith Kercher confessed that she heard her screaming shortly before she died, it was reported today.The Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera said Amanda Knox, one of three people held by police on suspicion of Ms Kercher's murder, told officers in an interview that she covered her ears when she heard the 21-year-old student screaming in her bedroom in Perugia.Ms Knox, 20, remains in custody with her Italian boyfriend, 24-year-old Raffaele Sollecito, and Diya Lumumba, the manager of a bar in the Italian city.The three were arrested yesterday, four days after Ms Kercher was found with her throat cut at her student accommodation.Police found her semi-naked body in a pool of blood, covered by a duvet in her bedroom. Detectives have suggested that she had tried to fight off her attackers before she was killed.Arturo De Felice, Perugia's police chief, today said Ms Knox had accused fellow suspect Mr Lumumba of being in Ms Kercher's room when screams were heard on the night of her death.Mr De Felice said she had claimed after hours of questioning that she and Mr Lumumba were at the house she shared with Ms Kercher last Thursday when he entered Ms Kercher's bedroom.According to Corriere Della Sera's account of the police interview, Ms Knox said: "Patrick and Meredith were in Meredith's room, while I had stayed in the kitchen."I can't remember how long they were together in the room, but I can only say that, at a certain point, I had heard Meredith screaming and I was scared, so I covered my ears."After that, I don't remember anything - my head is very confused. I don't remember if Meredith called out or if I heard thuds because I was upset, but I can imagine what was happening."With all three of those arrested being held on the same charges, police are also leaving open the possibility that Ms Knox and Mr Sollecito were directly involved in the murder.Ms Knox and her boyfriend were said to have previously told police they were not with Ms Kercher on the night of her death. The lawyer for Mr Sollecito said his client insisted he was innocent.Another Italian newspaper, Corriere Dell'Umbria, quoted a neighbour of Mr Lumumba, who heard him shouting: "I haven't done anything" as he was arrested.The suspects are being held separately in isolation at a Perugia prison. On Thursday, a local judge will consider evidence prepared by investigators and could order the formal arrest of the three.Ms Kercher's parents and sister ended their visit to Perugia today. Her father, John, left a note on the steps of the city's cathedral, which read: "Love you forever Meredith. All my love Dad xxxx."It has also emerged that there is a story on Ms Knox's MySpace site about two brothers discussing the drugging and rape of a girl.Ms Knox studied at Perugia's University for Foreigners with Ms Kercher. Her MySpace site also refers to her working at a bar run by Mr Lumumba.At a press conference yesterday, Mr De Felice said Ms Kercher may have been made to have sex by her killers. "This was probably a sexually motivated killing," he said."It's an ugly story in which people which this girl had in her home, friends, tried to force her into relations which she didn't want," the Italian interior minister, Giuliano Amato, told a news conference.
