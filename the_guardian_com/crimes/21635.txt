The mother of Mikaeel Kular, the three-year-old boy reported missing from their Edinburgh home in January, has admitted killing her son.  Rosdeep Adekoya. Photograph: RexRosdeep Adekoya, 34, had been charged with murder but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide when she appeared at the high court in Edinburgh on Friday.Adekoya sparked a major police and public search for Mikaeel after claiming he had disappeared from her home in Drylaw overnight.Hundreds of people helped police, coastguards and other volunteers search for him in local streets, woods and along the shoreline in the two days before his body was found 20 miles away in woodland in Fife.The crown accused Adekoya of punching Mikaeel on various occasions between 12 and 15 January, striking his body against a hard object and inflicting blunt force trauma injuries to his head and body.She was also accused of failing to seek medical attention and murder. Prosecutors said she wrapped the boy in a duvet, put his body in a suitcase and drove him to a house in Fife where the family used to live with a relative before burying him.Advocate depute Alex Prentice told the court: "The basis for the plea tendered being accepted is that the crown accepts that the accused had no intention to kill Mikaeel and that the assault perpetrated upon him, although severe, fell short of the wicked recklessness required for murder."The court heard that Adekoya's internet history showed searches including "I find it hard to love my son", "I love all of my children except one", "Why am I so aggressive with my son" and "Get rid of bruises".Mikaeel died on the night of Tuesday 14 January from injuries inflicted the previous Sunday.His mother lost her temper when he was repeatedly sick after a trip to a Nando's restaurant at the city's Fountain Park, the court heard. She smacked him and struck him on the body and head with a clenched fist. When Mikaeel was sick for a third time, she dragged him to the shower by his arms and beat him heavily on his back as he lay over the bath edge.Prentice said: "It's likely that the internal damage was inflicted during this last beating."Over the next few days Mikaeel's condition worsened and he was kept out of nursery. He was assaulted again on the Monday after being sick and became listless.His mother did not take him to a doctor because of the bruising, the court heard.By Tuesday night, Mikaeel was said to be quiet and was giving a limited response to his mother's questions."He would have been in significant pain but was put to bed," Prentice said. "The pain would have increased significantly while Mikaeel became dangerously ill and finally dying as a result of the injuries inflicted upon him by the accused."It was during that night that he died. The accused discovered his body on the floor when wakening the children in the morning."After the discovery, Adekoya took his twin sister to nursery before driving straight to Fife.Prentice said: "At the time, it appears that the accused had placed Mikaeel's body in a suitcase and put him in the boot of her car."Masts captured signals that showed her mobile phone travelling from Edinburgh across the Forth bridge.Adekoya dabbed her eyes repeatedly with tissues as the narrative of her crimes was read to the court.She waited until 7.15am on 16 January to dial 999 and report her son missing. Officers who attended the flat reported that she initially appeared "very upset and distressed".But inconsistencies began to appear in her account of events to police, who by the Friday evening "suspected that all was not as she had indicated".During a police interview she broke down and told officers: "It was an accident and I panicked. I am going to go to the jail." Asked where Mikaeel was, she replied: "In the woods behind my sister's house".Adekoya then took officers to her son's body in the woods, telling them he was "to the left under trees in a suitcase" which she had covered with branches.Prentice said: "Detective Sergeant Phil Richards undid the straps of the suitcase and opened the camouflage material within which was the body of Mikaeel Kular, who was quite clearly dead."The final cause of death was found to be "blunt force abdominal trauma".Mikaeel had more than 40 injuries to his body, including bruises to his back, chin and cheek, trauma to the brain, haemorrhage in the spinal cord and injuries to his arms.Prentice said: "If medical assistance had been called for, death might not have resulted."Defence counsel Brian McConnachie QC said the case was "truly tragic … above all else for Mikaeel Kular in his loss of life at such an early age".He also pointed to the tragedy faced by the boy's father and the "extraordinarily difficult" time for the family of the accused who were having to come to terms with their grief and the fact that Adekoya caused the death.McConnachie told the court the case was also a tragedy for Adekoya: "Rosdeep Adekoya is not a monster. It would appear she has been a young mother with a number of underlying problems, which the court will hear about in due course, with five young children."He went on: "It seems that there has been an accumulation of circumstances which have caused Rosdeep Adekoya to act towards Mikaeel over a relatively short period of time, less than 24 hours, in a manner she has never acted in the past towards him, or to any of her other children … It appears from every source … that this has been a brief period when this young woman has lost her temper and behaved in a way which is totally out of character for her."He said she had to live with the consequences of her actions for the rest of her life.McConnachie said Adekoya initially tried to act as if nothing had happened and had panicked.The QC said that, until the next court hearing, the defence would still be investigating "psychological aspects of this case as far as Mrs Adekoya is concerned".Mikaeel's father left the court after the hearing without making any comment.Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham of Police Scotland said: "Mikaeel's disappearance and death deeply impacted on his family. It also resonated across the community in which he lived."During the initial stages of the inquiry we appealed for information about Mikaeel's whereabouts as concern for him grew. The local community assisted us greatly in that search. What followed was an incredible level of support and assistance to one of the biggest missing person inquiries Police Scotland has undertaken."He said the search was helped by specialist police investigative and search support officers."Sadly our inquiries led us to Kirkcaldy the night after he was reported missing and the discovery of his body," he said."I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the public for all of their help during the search efforts and the continued support provided to police and Mikaeel's family during the course of this investigation."A spokesperson for the Crown Office said Adekoya had pleaded guilty toculpable homicide, attempting to defeat the ends of justice by concealing Mikaeel's bodyand falsely claiming that he was a missing person, instigating a large scale search."It would be inappropriate for us to comment further until the case has concluded and sentence has been passed."Sentencing will take place at the high court in Edinburgh on 25 August 25.
