Armed police are guarding the judge, prosecuting lawyers and some witnesses who testified against Nicholas van Hoogstraten when he was tried for manslaughter.The property tycoon was freed last week when his conviction for hiring two hitmen to gun down a business rival, Mohammed Raja, was overturned. He had served one year of a 10-year sentence. Now, Scotland Yard's special protection unit is guarding the trial judge, Mr Justice Newman, amid fears that people connected to the 58-year-old multimillionaire landlord might seek revenge. A press spokesman for the Metropolitan police refused to comment on any protection matters. But the Guardian understands that police bodyguards accompany the judge when he is out in public. He has also had panic buttons and alarms fitted at his home, as have several of the prosecuting counsel and witnesses. In September 2002, Mr Van Hoogstraten was cleared of murder, but found guilty of the manslaughter of Raja, 62. David Croke, 60, and 56-year-old Robert Knapp were sentenced to life imprisonment for shooting Raja at his home in south-west London. The attorney general has launched an inquiry into claims that witnesses were threatened into changing or retracting evidence. Mr Van Hoogstraten has nine convictions, the most serious of which was damaging the home of a clergyman with a hand grenade in 1968, for which he received a four-year sentence. He has described his tenants as "filth", business rivals as "maggots" and ramblers who cross his land around his East Sussex mansion as "scum". At a court appearance in 1992, he warned that the judge would get his "comeuppance".
