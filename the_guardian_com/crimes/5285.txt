The Metropolitan police will review the evidence in the Jill Dando case again in the wake of Barry George's acquittal for the murder of the TV presenter, it emerged last night.Scotland Yard, which had been under pressure to explain what it would do after George walked free from the Old Bailey at the end of his retrial last Friday, announced the decision following a meeting of senior detectives yesterday. After talking to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell, who was in charge of the original Dando inquiry, and Commander Simon Foy, head of the Yard's homicide and serious crime unit, Assistant Commissioner John Yates said the evidence in the case would be reexamined in an attempt to find new leads. Although another force could have been drafted in to sift through the evidence, Scotland Yard decided that it would keep charge of the inquiry. Yates said: "This remains a Met police investigation. Officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate, led by Commander Simon Foy, will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny ... to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case."He stressed that the case remained open and reminded the public of the Â£50,000 Crimestoppers reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer.Yates also pointed out that the Met's inquiry had already come under considerable scrutiny, adding: "This investigation has been subject to numerous reviews and assessments since 1999, by the Met's internal review group, the Crown Prosecution Service, Criminal Case Review Commission, two senior independent Treasury counsel and the court of appeal."Foy, responsible for investigating serious crimes in London, said on Friday police were "disappointed" at the Old Bailey verdict. He and his team face the prospect of combing 2,500 witness statements and 3,700 exhibits for new clues about the killing of the TV presenter on her west London doorstep nine years ago. The announcement came as George said he believed Dando's killer would never be found. "To be quite honest and practical, I don't think they'll ever find who done it," he told Sky News.
