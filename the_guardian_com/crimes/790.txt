A woman in her late 50s has been arrested in connection with one of the most notorious murders of the Northern Ireland Troubles – the abduction, killing and secret burial of the west Belfast widow Jean McConville.The 57-year-old woman was detained by police officers in the west of the city on Wednesday morning and taken to Antrim police station for questioning.She has since been released pending a police report being sent to prosecutors.McConville was the most famous of the "disappeared", up to 16 victims of the IRA who were murdered and then buried secretly across Ireland in the 1970s and 80s.Last month a former IRA negotiator with the British government, Ivor Bell, was charged with aiding and abetting in the murder of the 37-year-old mother of 10. Bell, who is out on bail, denies any involvement.McConville, a Protestant-born widow, was dragged out of her flat in front of her children by armed IRA members in the Divis area shortly before Christmas in 1972. The IRA only admitted they had killed her in 1999 after a high-profile campaign by families of the "disappeared".The IRA alleged that she was an informer but an investigation by the former police ombudsman Dame Nuala O'Loan concluded the widow was not working for the security forces as an agent.Her murder has cast a long shadow over the peace process and the political settlement in Northern Ireland. The former IRA hunger striker and one-time commander of the Provisionals in Belfast Brendan Hughes alleged that the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, gave the order that McConville be buried in secret and that the future leader of the republican movement came up with the idea of creating a covert IRA unit that would "disappear" suspected informants.Adams has always denied any role in the murder and has protested that he was never in the IRA.Hughes, a former friend of the Sinn Féin chief who died in 2008, made his allegation on a tape recording for the Belfast Project, an archive of testimonies from ex-IRA and loyalist paramilitaries who would speak frankly about their involvement in violent acts during the Troubles.The case against Bell is allegedly centred on another tape recording for the archive, which was meant to become a groundbreaking historical project for Boston College in the United States. However, the Police Service of Northern Ireland pursued the tapes through the courts in the US and have acquired some of the material which allegedly relates to the McConville murder.
