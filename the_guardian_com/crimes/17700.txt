Four RAF servicemen have admitted taking part in a scam to smuggle more than 1 million cigarettes into Britain on military flights from countries including Afghanistan, it emerged today.Hauls of cigarettes were flown into RAF bases in Oxfordshire and Wiltshire before being transported to the north of England, where they were sold at profit.Corporal Thomas Warren, 27, 31-year-old Corporal Stuart Helens, 43-year-old Sergeant Stuart Walker and Senior Aircraftman Paul Garbutt, 31, admitted their part in the conspiracy.Three civilians have also pleaded guilty to being part of the scam. A fourth civilian, Louisa Garbutt, 36, denies being involved and is standing trial at Bristol crown court.Ian Dixey, opening the case for the prosecution, said the service personnel had exploited their position of trust.He said: "There was an ongoing arrangement to buy cigarettes abroad and smuggle them into this country via RAF flights and then distribute them without any tax being paid in this country."The cigarettes were sold for substantially more than they cost the defendants. It was dishonest."The conspiracy was discovered when customs officers searched an aircraft after it landed at RAF Lyneham, in Wiltshire, and found 950,000 cigarettes from Kabul stashed in a cardboard box. It is claimed that some of those involved made Â£30,000 each.Garbutt, from Billingham, Cleveland, pleads not guilty to conspiracy to cheat the public revenue and acquisition of criminal property. She is the sister-in-law of Paul Garbutt.Her trial continues.
