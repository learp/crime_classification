Websites that fail to protect children from sexual predators could face legal action from a new online child protection agency.The huge popularity of social networking sites such as MySpace, where millions of youngsters have posted personal information, has increased concern at the potential for paedophiles to 'groom' youngsters for abuse through the internet.Websites that are "obstructive or unhelpful" would be "named and shamed" and legal action against them would be considered, said Jim Gamble, the former anti-terrorist police officer who heads the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre."I would no more ban the internet as a whole than ban a library, but you need to look at those sections that create a risk. Then you have to think about inhibiting people from going to it," Mr Gamble told the Financial Times.The centre was set up earlier this year to provide a single point of contact for the public, police and companies such as Microsoft, AOL and Visa and the communications industry to report the targeting of children online.It offers advice and information to parents and potential victims of abuse and works with police forces around the world to protect children.The centre secured its first conviction in June when student Lee Costi was jailed for nine years for having sex with two teenage girls he met on the internet.Last month, as part of its partnership with the Centre, Microsoft put a "report abuse" button on its MSN Messenger chat software so users can report suspected sexual predators directly to the police.Mr Gamble said the "report abuse" button was part of the centre's "Safer by design" plan, which was designed "to make predators have a lack of confidence because of what is going on behind the scenes while they are online".· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
