The disgraced former royal harpist Jemima Phillips has turned to publicist Max Clifford to help her get her career and life back on the rails.Phillips, who admitted being hooked on heroin during the period she was playing for the Queen and Prince Charles, has been given a 12-month community order for handling stolen goods and attempted fraud.After the hearing concluded today, Phillips said: "I'm glad it's all over. I've got no further comment to make. You can speak to Max Clifford – he's representing me."Clifford confirmed that he had met Phillips after a member of her family contacted him. Clifford said he "liked her" but played down the suggestion she would sell her story. He said she would do a few interviews to "hopefully limit the damage".At her sentencing hearing at Gloucester crown court, "before and after" pictures of the 28-year-old musician were shown to the judge, Michael Harrington.Simon Burns, prosecuting, said the images illustrated "the obvious transformation showing the ravages of drug addiction, crack and heroin – what can only be described as a spectacular fall from grace".Paul Grumbar, for Phillips, who played at the wedding of Charles and Camilla, said that since her arrest she had made "valiant efforts" to get clean and had not taken drugs for at least three months."This is a very, very vulnerable girl. She had an appalling childhood, abuse, tragedy in her family, the death of her younger brother, the illness her sister suffers from — a dreadful life coupled with a spectacular talent, but a very weak personality."He said she had disastrous relationships with men, including her co-accused, William Davies, 41, of Cheltenham, who was jailed for four and a half years for four burglaries. Phillips was cleared of burglary but convicted of handling stolen items that were found in her Ford Galaxy. She admitted trying to use a building society book stolen by Davies to withdraw £500.Phillips, from the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, was told she would be closely supervised during her sentence and required to undergo drug rehabilitation.Grumbar said she had only gone "off the rails for a very, very short period".The judge told Phillips: "Before you met William Davies you were of previous good character. It is clear you are an extremely talented musician, but also for the last five years you have been addicted to class A drugs."
