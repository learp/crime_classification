A former Sunday school teacher was found guilty of killing her police officer husband and her lover's wife in a double murder that she and her co-conspirator then spent 20 years pretending was a case of suicide.Hazel Stewart – once a glamorous regular on the social scene among the affluent circles of Northern Ireland's northern coast – now faces a life term for colluding with her dentist lover.After a three-week trial at Coleraine crown court the jury of nine men and three women took just two hours to unanimously convict the 48-year-old of the May 1991 murders of RUC officer Trevor Buchanan and Lesley Howell.As the verdict was handed down shortly before 3pm, Stewart could be heard breathing heavily while her daughter Lisa shouted out in court: "No, it's not fair." Her second husband, David, cried as he reached across the court to comfort his two children.In a statement after the verdict, the family of Lesley Howell said they "were comforted that those involved in the murders of Lesley and Trevor have finally been brought to justice".Howell's daughter Lauren said her mother had been "loving and devoted" and the family "bitterly regret the horrible way she was taken from us".Outside court Gordon Buchanan, Trevor's brother, said that while there was satisfaction that justice had been done, there was no cause for celebration.Stewart will be told next Friday how long she will serve in prison for the double murder.For nearly two decades Stewart hid the fact that she and her ex-lover Colin Howell had planned and executed a murder.Stewart had stood accused of plotting with Howell to poison their respective partners so they could start a new life together.Colin Howell is serving a 21-year prison sentence after he admitted to the murders last year. Their two victims were found dead in a car filled with carbon monoxide fumes in a garage behind a row of houses in the Co Derry seaside resort of Castlerock.The RUC believed the pair had died as a result of a suicide pact because they had each found out that their spouses had betrayed them.But the story started to unravel when, after an apparent breakdown, the dentist walked into a evangelical church to confess to his crime in 2009. He was then taken by church elders to Coleraine police station where he implicated Stewart in the meticulously planned murder plot.In 15 taped interviews with Police Service of Northern Ireland detectives, Stewart claimed that she was too terrified of Howell to intervene in the plot, that she was another of his victims, a vulnerable woman enticed into the dentist's evil web.The jury, however, failed to believe her claims that she had been too frightened to stop Howell and had not actively participated in the murders.In the words of the prosecuting lawyer Ciaran Murphy QC during the three-week trial, Stewart had been centrally involved in an act of "gruesome extermination" with her lover against their innocent victims to whom they were married.
