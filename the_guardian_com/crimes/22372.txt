A burglar who murdered an 87-year-old war veteran for drug money has been jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years in prison.Daniel Crompton, 24, sobbed in the dock after the jury forewoman delivered the verdict that he murdered widower Frank Worsley.But two hours later as he was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence he shouted at the jury: "I hope you are pleased with yourselves!"Crompton, who had committed 47 previous offences – including robbery and splashing a cup of boiling hot sugared water over a fellow inmate in jail, was found guilty following a two-week trial at Manchester crown court.A grandfather of two, Worsley died from a stroke less than three weeks after being battered by Crompton, an unemployed cocaine user.Jurors looked shocked as Worsley's 999 call was played to the court during the trial. On it, he begged the operator: "Help me please. He's hit me and beaten me and attacked me and taken my wallet."Worsley had been awoken by Crompton standing over his bed before punching him in the face with demands to say where he kept his money.Crompton admitted two burglaries on the same night last summer, including the burglary of Worsley's house, but denied murder, claiming his victim was injured in a struggle.The defendant had already burgled one house that night after bingeing on drugs and alcohol, then he burgled Worsley for money to buy more drugs, taking £85 from his victim's wallet.Passing sentence, Mr Justice Turner told Crompton: "Daniel Crompton, you have been found guilty of the murder of Frank Worsley, an innocent and defenceless 87-year-old man."You neither knew or cared if the house was occupied so great was your craving for further cocaine."Your attack on Mr Worsley was as brutal as it was cowardly."A second world war veteran, Worsley, who served in the Royal Navy medical corps, was attacked at home in Longfield Road in Bolton, Greater Manchester, at about 12.40am on 3 August last year.He had lived at the mid-terrace house with his wife Mary, since 1949, and had put extra locks on doors after they were burgled in 2010.Worsley had nursed his wife for 25 years during her illness with multiple sclerosis, until her death in September 2012. They had been married for 62 years and received a message from the Queen when they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.He was also a founder of a church-run youth club and Sunday school teacher at his local church, St Bedes, in Bolton.The court heard Worsley was still active despite his age but he suffered from a heart condition.He took the medication warfarin, which prevented his blood from clotting.But after being admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital for treatment after the burglary, doctors had to stop this medication so his blood would clot to prevent bleeding on his brain from the beating by Crompton.Worsley then suffered a stroke on 7 August and died on 20 August after his condition deteriorated rapidly.Outside court Worsley's family released a statement.It said: "The last eight months have been extremely difficult for all our family and friends."We have lost Frank, who was an integral member of the family and was still living an independent life until the actions of Daniel Crompton on that night resulted in his tragic death."Frank had been a carer for his wife, Mary, who suffered from MS for a long time and since she passed away 11 months earlier, he was adjusting to life on his own with the support of his family."We could be more accepting of his death if it had been of old age, peaceful and dignified. Instead it wasn't peaceful, he wasn't comfortable, he was scared, agitated and distressed as a result of this callous attack. He was in pain and there was nothing that could be done. It wasn't easy to watch him lose his fight for life over the following two and a half weeks."Frank was a good, decent man who was loved by all who knew him. He was well known in the community and always looked to help others, young and old alike when he could."We are very pleased with the verdict, although we will never fully recover from this traumatic loss."There are no winners in this case. Everyone involved has had their lives affected to a greater or lesser degree since that fateful day, but it was Frank who paid the ultimate price with his life.
