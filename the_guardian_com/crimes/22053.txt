Teenagers caught with knives will be forced to tour casualty units and meet the relatives of stabbing victims, under government plans to combat the glorification of weapons within gangs.The move to confront those on the verge of more serious offending with the horrific consequences of knife culture comes as new figures show the number of convictions for carrying a knife in schools rose sixfold in a decade, with the vast majority of offenders not jailed.Last week alone saw at least eight knife killings nationwide.Under plans to be unveiled by Gordon Brown on Tuesday, young offenders convicted of all crimes will be forced to carry out community service on Friday and Saturday nights, to keep them out of trouble, while pubs and clubs will be fast-tracked for closure if searches reveal their customers routinely carry knives. Parents will face tougher intervention, including being made to attend their children's court cases, and teenagers on the streets late at night will be taken home by police if they are considered in danger. But Downing Street has shelved plans championed by the Children's Secretary, Ed Balls, for the running of young offender institutions to be transferred to children's trusts - partnerships of local councils and other agencies that would prioritise children's welfare over punitive regimes - and watered down plans for a radical shift away from prison. One cabinet minister said Gordon Brown had made a serious mistake in dropping Tony Blair's anti-yob 'respect' campaign and was now belatedly reviving it. The shift suggests that Balls, Brown's protégé in Cabinet, who had pushed hard for a more liberal approach, is losing influence as cabinet rivals jockey for position around the beleaguered Prime Minister. The Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will today unveil plans targeting seven so-called hotspots for gang violence, including London, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. Smith, who said she was 'shocked at the tragic and senseless loss of life', wants to expand pilot projects where teenagers caught carrying knives are introduced to relatives of stabbing victims, and to prisoners serving time for stabbings, to bring home the tragic potential implications.However, many of the measures are extensions of existing powers, leaving ministers vulnerable to claims they have no fresh thinking. Chief constables already have powers to press for the closure of pubs involved in violence, although Smith is writing to all 42 forces in England and Wales asking them to exercise those powers. And while trading standards officers will carry out 'secret shopper' checks on whether retailers sell knives illegally to under-16s, only 71 people have been convicted of under-age knife sales in five years despite previous supposed crackdowns.Official figures from the British Crime Survey for the first three months of 2008, to be published later this week, will show that, while crime has fallen again overall, some categories of violent crime rose. For the first time, the survey will separate out knife crimes from injuries inflicted by other sharp instruments, such as broken bottles.Home Office figures obtained last week by Jeremy Browne, the Liberal Democrat frontbencher, show that the number sentenced for possessing an offensive weapon in school rose from only 15 to 90 per year between 1996 and 2006 - although it peaked at 139 in 2004. Brown has pledged to introduce new laws if needed, but the figures suggest some existing legislation is barely even being used. In nine years, only 12 people have ever been convicted of the offence of encouraging violence using knives, introduced to stop marketing which glorifies weapons or suggests their use in combat.Browne said the government should stop 'legislating to create the impression that it's acting' and tackle the cultural factors behind knife use, adding: 'Strong penalties have a part to play in addressing violent crime although the government should not give the impression that they're acting with greater severity than is the case in reality.'The Youth Crime Action Plan to be launched by Smith, Brown, Balls and the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, will still promote alternatives to custody, such as 'intensive fostering' schemes, where a teenager is placed with foster parents and must behave well in order to earn privileges such as watching television. They will reject calls for an automatic prison sentence for knife possession, with ministers arguing privately that some children carry knives in self-defence because they are frightened by their peers. But critics said more radical changes had been dropped. 'This plan has clearly been highly controversial and subject to constant redrafting,' said Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo. 'It is disappointing that central government is not going to provide funds to ensure that local authorities can put in place services that will significantly reduce youth crime.'A separate report from the charity 4Children this week will argue that up to a third of under-18s now in custody were there for non-violent offences and could serve community sentences instead.Director Anne Longfield, said: 'Community sentences wouldn't be a soft option, but it wouldn't be putting them into custody where they get expert tuition in how to be a serial offender.' Nick Herbert, the shadow justice minister, said the government's community sentences 'aren't remotely tough' and it only opposed jail for knife crimes because the prisons were too full.· Police in Bolton, Greater Manchester, are hunting a knifeman after a teenager was stabbed in the neck on Friday evening as he sat in his car.
