Police today defended their decision to issue an e-fit image of a burglary suspect who appeared to have a lettuce on his head.

Photograph: Hampshire police/PAHampshire police issued the picture to try to trace a distraction burglar who stole Â£60 from an elderly woman in Stockbridge. The offender was described as being about 40 with wavy blond-grey hair.But the e-fit showed the man with green hair, which amused residents said looked like a lettuce. Officers said a technical problem has caused the unusual hair colour and admitted it was not the "best quality".A police spokeswoman said: "We make every effort to ensure that the e-fits we circulate are as accurate and detailed as they possibly can be from the description provided by the witness."This is borne out by the quality and detail contained within the facial features. We are, though, currently experiencing technical problems with the quality of the hair and are waiting for an upgrade to the system from the company who provides us with the software."She said the police had a duty to identify criminals, prevent crime and protect the public. "While the hair on this image may not be of the best quality, it takes nothing from the overall clarity of the facial features. It would therefore be wrong to withhold the release of the e-fit just based on this technical issue."We would never release an e-fit a victim disagreed or was unhappy with and in this instance the victim fully supported the publication of this image."Detective Constable Danielle Robinson said police would like to hear from anyone who had information about the burglary or who recognised the man in the e-fit image.
