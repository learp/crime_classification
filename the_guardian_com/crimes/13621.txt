William Hague is so obsessed with Labour's mastery of the media that he has deluded himself into thinking that elections are won by the number of banner headlines he can seize.His aides have therefore been preening themselves this morning as they survey the front pages which are all dominated by Mr Hague's pledge to change the law to give greater protection to people who are forced to defend themselves against burglars.Tony Blair grabbed the headlines with policy announcements while in opposition and we are just following his example, goes the thinking among members of the Hague inner circle.Unfortunately for Mr Hague there are two crucial differences between the Labour party in the run-up to the general election of 1997 and today's Conservative party.All of New Labour's major policy changes were announced after a lengthy period of work in which they were tested on countless focus groups and subjected to rigorous tests to assess how much they would cost. The policies were also designed to reach out to voters in the centre ground where Mr Blair knew the election would be won.Mr Hague's speech today, which follows hard on the heels of his pledge to lock up all asylum seekers, appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to the outcry over the jailing of Tony Martin. The farmer has barely been in jail for a week and the Tory leader has announced a major change in the law which would introduce a "strong presumption" in favour of people forced to defend their homes.Unlike Labour's efforts to reach out to new voters, Mr Hague's speech appears to have been inspired by an outcry in the rightwing press and among his own backbenchers.Labour and the Liberal Democrats wasted little time in condemning the speech, with one Labour MP accusing the Tory leader of fostering a "lynch mob mentality".But in a sign of how far Mr Hague has lurched to the right, a chief constable was also moved to criticise his plans. Northumbria's Crispian Strachan said that Mr Hague's proposed change in the law would lead to a "serious increase in violent crime".The Hague inner circle will be unmoved by such remarks. They have privately given up on the next general election. They are just attempting to shore up their core support, which will mean lots of headline-grabbing speeches to appeal to the right with little effort to appeal to the broader electorate.
