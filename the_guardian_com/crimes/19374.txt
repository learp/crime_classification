James Robin, 18, was running late and the chain on his own bike was broken.Yesterday Reading crown court heard how Robin stopped the 16-year-old riding his BMX along a footpath and threatened to stab him and throw him off a bridge unless he handed over the bike. He also took small change, a lighter, a mobile phone and cigarettes.Robin, who admitted two counts of robbery, was sentenced to 39 months in a young offender institution. He had previous convictions for burglary and theft.
