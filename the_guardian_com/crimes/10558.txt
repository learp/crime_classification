I don't know how we are going to cope with this. Mum is in total shock. I can't put into words how we are feeling at the moment. Agnes was a wonderful person. She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We need these people to be caught."Agnes's mother Safura had said: "I wasn't there with my daughter when it happened. It's so hard for me. It has been an incredible shock."The Met's detective chief inspector John Crossley said: "I do not believe Agnes was the intended target, which makes this case all the more tragic."
