Cumbria's deputy chief constable said his force had been stretched by the massacre that left one of Britain's smallest forces investigating one of the biggest mass shootings on UK soil. Stuart Hyde said: "Throughout the day we have been dealing with a very fast-paced operation that stretched over three hours, and emergency services responded during very difficult, challenging circumstances ... thanks to the support of our colleagues at the Civil Nuclear constabulary and neighbouring forces, we were able to respond."He said the killings followed a harrowing coach crash a week ago, which killed two teenagers and a man. Last year officers had to deal with floods which killed one of their colleagues."This has truly been the most exceptional, challenging incident that Cumbria has had to deal with in a long time," Hyde said. "This has shocked the people of Cumbria to the core."Policing the rampage around 30 crime scenes would have challenged any police force. Cumbria's force covers the second largest area in England but with 1,284 officers is one of the smallest. A senior officer said: "You don't keep standing armies for this sort of event."The most comparable crime is the 1987 Hungerford massacre in Berkshire in which 16 people died. A former Thames Valley officer said such a crime stays with officers and police chiefs for years. Cumbria will face major challenges and questions, including where the gunman got his weapons, the support of victims, and not least, supporting its own officers who faced the possibility of being under fire.
