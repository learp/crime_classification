John Reid last night threatened court action against the prison officers' union in a dispute which may derail his plans to open new prison accommodation to cope with the jail population crisis.The dispute is over the knock-on effects of redeploying prison officers to staff the new HMP Kennet, which is to be converted from an old wing of Ashworth special hospital, Merseyside, at a cost of Â£19m within the next three months as an emergency measure.The threat of court action was made after the Prison Officers' Association last night refused to give an assurance that it would not "induce" any of its members to take industrial action, which is in theory illegal in the prison service, over a new contract to provide cover elsewhere for the staff needed at the new prison.The move comes before a warning by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, today that the rapid rise in the prison population is putting the public at risk by corroding attempts to cut reoffending rates.Ms Owers, in her annual report, is also expected to be sharply critical of the home secretary's lack of a strategy to deal with 2,000 new prisoners now serving "indeterminate" sentences without a fixed release date.She will be critical of the failure to release more than 1,000 foreign national prisoners who remain in prison despite having completed their sentences.The chief inspector will highlight the scale of self-harm among vulnerable women prisoners and the plight of those jailed with mental health and drug addiction problems. She will also point out the strain they place on staff struggling to cope with oversubscribed rehabilitation programmes.Mr Reid was given a temporary respite yesterday by jail population figures for England and Wales showing that the galloping increase to 80,000 seen in the first three weeks of this month has appeared to slow down.This was in the wake of his appeal to the courts to find alternatives to prison for non-dangerous offenders.Prison numbers dropped over the weekend by 180 to fall below the 80,000 mark, with about 120 in emergency police cells.But Mr Reid made it clear in a round of interviews yesterday that it will take two and half years - at least until 2009 - to sort out the Home Office's problems. He said he had the "endurance and determination" to see it through.A tantalising reference to a Sunday night conversation "discussing these matters with Gordon" by him in a BBC Today programme interview was said to refer to talks about his plan to split the Home Office into two, with separate ministries of justice and national security, which will go to the cabinet on Thursday.But if prison numbers resume their upward spiral the pressure on the home secretary to take more radical action will increase.Lord Woolf, the former lord chief justice, yesterday urged him to release thousands of non-dangerous offenders to ease overcrowding and to suspend the operation of legislation that requires the judges to "use more and longer sentences than are necessary".John Denham, the Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said yesterday that he personally wanted to see alternatives to custody made more credible in the eyes of the public.Mr Denham argued that those undertaking community work schemes should be put in uniform so that the public did not think they were escaping punishment.
