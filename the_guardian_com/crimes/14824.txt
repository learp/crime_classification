A Labour MP drove 200 miles without wheel nuts on his car tyres. John Mann reached his Nottinghamshire constituency from London before making the discovery, when he found one of his car wheels had nearly fallen off.The Bassetlaw MP said he believed the incident was more likely to be a result of an interrupted attempt at stealing the wheels rather than an attempt on his life. He noted strange noises while driving up the A1 but thought they were coming from the engine. It was only at the end of his trip that he found his front wheels had been stripped of their wheel nuts and that all four locking nuts had been removed from each of his tyres. The wheel hubs had been replaced to hide the theft.He said: "The consequences of this madness does not bear thinking about. I and others could easily have been killed. Nobody could have spotted that the wheel nuts had been removed, which makes the callous nature of the crime even worse."The MP said only registered garages had equipment to remove locking wheel nuts but it was possible keys could be reproduced. He called on motoring groups to audit their security devices as a result.The incident comes after Nottinghamshire Police launched an investigation earlier this year after Mann's wife Jo White, a Labour councillor, received a dead bird through the post.The Metropolitan police is investigating.
