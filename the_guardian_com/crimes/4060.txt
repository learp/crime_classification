The home secretary, Charles Clarke, today announced plans for a shake-up of police forces in England and Wales which could see the number of forces cut by half within 18 months.The current 43 forces could be cut to as few as 20 under one overarching police authority, Mr Clarke told the Police Superintendents' Association conference."The modern threats we face today from terrorism, international drug and people traffickers and financial crime gangs need police forces which have the resources and capabilities to match the criminals," he said."Currently, some forces are simply too small to meet these challenges."However, Mr Clarke rejected calls from some superintendents for all forces to be amalgamated in a single national force."A jump straight from where we are to a national police force would be a step too far," he said."If we were to move down that route the implication is that national politicians could have responsibility or influence for operational matters. That would be a dangerous course."Reducing the number of forces was a key recommendation of a report published last week on the structure of the police service by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.British police services range in size from small forces such as Wiltshire, which covers barely more than 400,000 residents, to London's Metropolitan police, which covers more than 7 million.But Mr Clarke stressed than putting together super police forces should not diminish community policing on the ground.Beneath the national and area forces, the government envisages two levels of neighbourhood community police and district council-sized command units. "I think you do need a strong local base for policing," Mr Clarke told the BBC. "The danger is of a national force being rather remote from people in different communities and different parts of the country, and I don't really think we are in a position to go that far."
