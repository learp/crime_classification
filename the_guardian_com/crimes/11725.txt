Max Clifford used his fame to "bully and manipulate" vulnerable young women, including a 14-year-old girl, to perform sex acts on him over 20 years, a court has heard.The celebrity publicist used his London office as "his own sexual fiefdom" to indecently assault a series of naive women who sought jobs in showbusiness, the prosecution claimed. In one alleged incident, Clifford undid his trousers to expose his penis while speaking to a 19-year-old woman who wanted to audition for a film role and asked her to "look at my penis, isn't it tiny?"Opening the prosecution case against Clifford at London's Southwark crown court on Thursday, Rosina Cottage QC described the PR guru as "a man who likes to play games with people" and who thought he was untouchable.Clifford denies 11 counts of indecent assault against seven alleged victims, including a 14-year-old girl, between 1966 and 1984.Wearing a grey jacket and a white open-necked shirt, Clifford listened to proceedings with the aid of a hearing loop in the dock.Cottage told jurors: "He is a man who likes to play games with people and you will hear evidence of the games that he played with these girls and young women."As the years went by and he got away with his behaviour he must have thought he was untouchable, and no doubt thought no one would complain and if they did they would not be believed."Cottage told jurors that Clifford's alleged victims and other witnesses – aged between 12 and 19 – were emboldened to complain to the police by the Jimmy Savile scandal in late 2012."You will hear not only from the women named on the indictment and their friends and families, but also other women who give evidence of the sexually predatory behaviour of the defendant and the fun he had at their expense," she said."Aged between 12 and 19 as they were all at the time, these women were vulnerable to the attentions of a man experienced in taking sexual advantage of their naivety and their willingness to please. His office was his own sexual fiefdom."He toyed with their inexperience and treated them with contempt – he continues to do so by denying their allegations."The court heard that Clifford told a 14-year-old girl in 1966 that he could arrange for her to meet any of the stars he represented.After giving her a lift in his car, Clifford allegedly pounced on the teenager and said that if she wanted to meet famous people, "this is what you've got to do"."As we will see repeated in one way or another over the next 20 years, this is what he would say to get what he wanted sexually," Cottage told jurors. "He groped her as she fought him off, terrified as to what might happen. She was able to open the car door and ran away."Cottage told jurors they would hear evidence showing that Clifford's offices in Bond Street, central London, served as his "own playground".One former receptionist said she saw a secretary performing oral sex on him in his office and, on another occasion, he pinned the then 18-year-old against the wall and groped her breasts. "He did as he pleased sexually in the office and took what he wanted when he wanted," Cottage said.Jurors were told that one of the most serious allegations against Clifford concerned a 12-year-old girl he is accused of indecently assaulting on a family holiday to Spain in 1983.Clifford is alleged to have put his hand beneath her bikini bottoms and forced her to masturbate him in a jacuzzi after encouraging her to find out where he was ticklish, the court heard.The assault took place when the pair were alone, moments after they had been joined in the jacuzzi by Clifford's daughter, it is alleged.Cottage said the allegation was not a charge on the indictment only because it happened overseas and in 1983 the law did not allow crimes outside England and Wales to be tried in this jurisdiction. "You hear of these matters now as they support the prosecution case," she told jurors.Another girl, who was 15 at the time, alleges that Clifford told her to take off her bra after inviting her to his offices with the promise of finding her modelling work.She alleges that Clifford sexually assaulted her at Fulham football club's training ground after taking her for a drive in his yellow Jaguar in 1977, the court heard. Clifford met the girl and her family on holiday in Torremolinos, in Spain, where he complimented her on her looks and said he would introduce her to the world of showbusiness, according to the prosecution.Clifford shook his head in the dock as the court heard that in a separate alleged incident he invited a 19-year-old model to his office for a film audition in 1979 or 1980 and, while they were talking, undid his trousers to expose his penis and said: "Look at my penis, isn't it tiny? What can I do with this?"Shortly after, the teenager received a phone call from a man with an Italian accent – alleged to have been Clifford using a fake accent – who asked her if the PR man had shown her his penis and if she thought it was tiny, Cottage said.At a second meeting with Clifford, he again took out his penis and spoke about its size, the court heard. "In fact, he hardly spoke about the film part and just kept on about his penis size and exposing his penis to her," Cottage said.Clifford denies knowing any of his accusers, the court heard, and if he had met them "nothing such as they describe would have happened". A former EMI Records junior press officer, Clifford has acted as a powerful intermediary between the press and on-screen stars for more than five decades.He was first arrested in December 2012 and charged last April under Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree inquiry.Clifford denies the charges.The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.
