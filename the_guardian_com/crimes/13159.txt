Douglas Carswell, the Eurosceptic and libertarian Tory MP, turned crimefighter in his own constituency on Friday and promptly gave a four-sentence news report via Twitter."Just chased and caught a shop lifter in Clacton â€¦., waiting for police." Seven minutes later, he tweeted again: "Police response time pretty effective. Arrested. Now off to my advice surgery."Carswell later explained: "I was in the centre of Clacton going from one constituency appointment to the next as MPs do on a Friday. I heard someone shout and saw someone trying to run away. There was a store detective shouting at them."The 42-year-old MP gave chase and closed on the man down an alley, putting him against the wall. "I collared him literally. When I was chasing him I caught a glimpse of a Lacoste logo from items falling out of his pockets. I guess he was in his late 20s, early 30s." Carswell reckoned he had chased the runaway about 150 metres.He told his quarry that he had been captured by his local MP but is not expecting his support in the next election. "It would be optimistic to mark him down as undecided."While two store detectives guarded his catch, the MP went back to the main street to pick up a radio one of them had dropped and saw an elderly man being attended by passersby after being knocked over in the dramatic chase, "not by me", he insisted.The tweets were easily explained by parliament's answer to a comic-book superhero. "As I was chasing [the man] I had my iPad tucked under my arm. I sent a tweet almost without thinking about it," he explained. The police had soon arrived with handcuffs. "It was reassuringly quick. They took him and put him into the back of a car. I am always keen to avoid trouble. I have been involved in nothing like this before."Essex police said that they had arrested a 29-year-old man of no fixed address after he was detained by store security and a member of public following the theft of aftershave from Boots. The man was still in custody.
