Despite the heartbreak involved, the law treats the theft of a dog the same as the theft of any other possession. An investigation by the Mirror, which looked at figures held by 35 police forces, found that dog theft had increased by 20% to 1,310 in the year since February 2014. More than a third of these dogs were Staffordshire bull terriers, though the paper reports that other breeds most often targeted included chihuahuas and German shepherds, and Kent had the highest number of thefts with 205 (figures from the Metropolitan police were not included).But Nik Oakley, spokesperson for Dog Lost, which works to reunite lost and stolen dogs with their families, believes thousands more dogs are stolen each year. “We say that about a third of the dogs we help reunite are reunited in suspicious circumstances and, on the basis that we had 12,000 dogs reported missing to us last year, we can say about 4,000 of those were probably stolen.”It used to be an opportunist crime – a dog taken from outside a shop, for instance – but now “it’s much more about organised crime, where particular places are targeted, [such as] kennels, where there can be multiple thefts, particularly for valuable dogs.” Stolen dogs are sold on, or used for breeding; despite alarmist stories, they are rarely used as bait in dog fights, says Oakley.Sylvia Tabor, from Dog Theft Action, says she has heard of dogs being taken from back gardens or while out on their walks, and says owners should be vigilant: “Don’t leave it tied up outside a shop, or in your car, keep an eye out when it’s in your garden, keep it within sight on a dog walk.” She would like the law to be changed to include harsher sentencing for people convicted of dog theft. “At the moment, a dog is treated as a chattel in law, like a laptop or mobile phone, so the sentencing isn’t taken seriously. We want the law to change so dogs are treated as living creatures.”
