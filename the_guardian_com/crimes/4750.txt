Seven highly endangered species of baby tortoises worth Â£1,500 on the black market and measuring the size of a 50p piece have been stolen from an animal sanctuary in Cornwall.A visitor stole the rare reptiles from the Tortoise Garden in Sticker, Cornwall, prompting a sniffer dog search of the nearby area, police said today.The sanctuary houses about 450 tortoises from around the world in monitored environments. Co-owner Joy Bloor said the stolen tortoises were particularly vulnerable to a change in environment and needed constant care.Bloor said there was a strong possibility that the tortoises were "stolen to order", possibly by a collector. Rare species of the reptile are much sought after on the black market.Six out of the seven baby tortoises were Hermann's tortoises, bracketed among the most endangered species in the world. The seventh is a rare South African leopard tortoise and needs water every day."They are just babies and they have different needs," said Bloor, a long-time collector, who has opened the sanctuary to the public for the last 10 years. "It's destroyed and disappointed me. I wish I could close the garden for good, but I can't afford to keep this place going without leaving it open to the public."Under normal circumstances, strict rules governing the trade of tortoises means it would be difficult to sell one without an accompanying microchip, but these tortoises were too young to have a transponder inserted.Police are looking for a white male in his mid 20s with short, dark brown hair, who speaks slowly with a slight London accent.The theft last Friday has prompted the British Chelonia Group, which oversees the conservation of tortoises, terrapins and turtles, to offer a reward to anyone with information."Anyone offering for sale these baby tortoises are committing a most serious offence and could face a punishment of five years in prison," said John Hayward, the co-ordinator of the group's national theft register.He said the group was seriously concerned as these extremely rare reptiles would not be receiving the appropriate diet.
