Amanda Knox, the US student jailed for murdering Meredith Kercher, has appealed to a civil court in Perugia, Italy, to prevent distribution over the internet of a made-for-television film about her case.Knox, who is appealing against her 26-year sentence for stabbing the British student in 2007, told the court she was "devastated by this invasion into my life and the way I'm being exploited".The film, called Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy, was broadcast by America's Lifetime network last month and can now be downloaded from the internet.Knox told the judge she had seen a trailer for the film. "I consider it the pinnacle of the repeated violations by the media against my person, my personality and my story," she said. "It does not correspond with the truth."After the court hearing on Thursday, Carlo Dalla Vedova, a lawyer representing Knox, called for its removal from the internet, pointing out that one site was now offering the film with Italian subtitles.The case was adjourned to 4 July.As Knox's appeal against her sentence continues, a team of forensic experts called by the appeal judge has reported that a knife prosecutors believe is the murder weapon bears such a small quantity of DNA that it cannot be retested. A police forensic expert told Knox's first trial that DNA belonging to Knox was on the knife."There are no traces of usable DNA and for us that's a positive thing," said Luciano Ghirga, a lawyer representing Knox.But Francesco Maresca, a lawyer representing the Kercher family, said the finding was no surprise. "The police scientist said all along the DNA had been consumed during testing and this just confirms that," he said.Kercher's torn bra clasp was originally found to contain DNA belonging to Raffaele Sollecito, Knox's former boyfriend, who was sentenced to 25 years for participating in Kercher's murder at the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia.But the new evidence review found the metal part of the clasp has now rusted and cannot be retested.
