The family of the murdered wife and daughter of Neil Entwistle accused their son-in-law of "unbearable" betrayal yesterday, as he pleaded not guilty to the murder in a Massachusetts court.After a two-minute hearing at Framingham district court that brought Mr Entwistle face to face with the family of his wife Rachel for the first time since she was shot dead last month, Mrs Entwistle's mother and stepfather voiced amazement at the accusations facing their son-in-law."Seeing Neil Entwistle standing accused of this awful crime gives us little comfort and in fact only adds to our immense pain and suffering," a family friend said in a prepared statement on their behalf. "We are astonished and devastated to learn of the hidden life of Neil Entwistle. We never suspected he was anything other than a loving son-in-law, husband and father."Neil betrayed our trust in so many different ways that it is almost impossible to describe. To think that someone we loved, trusted and looked up to could do this to our daughter is beyond belief."Prosecutors said last week they believed the unemployed computer programmer killed his wife and daughter Lillian after running up tens of thousands of dollars in debt. According to court papers released this week, he searched the internet for information on how to kill people and commit suicide, days before the deaths. He also looked up escort services and other websites offering help finding sexual partners in the Boston and Worcester areas of Massachusetts, police said in search warrant documents.The family's statement added to concern that voluble media attention and comment will undermine prospects for a fair trial.Mr Entwistle's lawyer, Elliot Weinstein, who was appointed by the court because he cannot afford to hire a legal representative, told reporters after the hearing: "I don't know that Mr Entwistle will ever be able to get a fair trial on these charges. I am certain that anybody watching this telecast or reading the reporting of today's arraignment has already formed an opinion with respect to Mr Entwistle's guilt and that opinion is based upon the reporting, and absolutely no facts and absolutely no evidence."Mr Entwistle agreed to be extradited when he appeared in court in London last Friday, and was handed over to US marshals at Gatwick airport on Wednesday. He had left the US for his parents' house in Worksop the day after the double killing. The judge ordered him to be held without bail until a further hearing on March 15.
