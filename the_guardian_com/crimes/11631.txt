The commander in charge of the police who shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes today denied being "out of control" in the build-up to the tragedy.Cressida Dick, the deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, defended her handling of events leading up to the death of the innocent 27-year-old Brazilian.Giving evidence at the Old Bailey, Ms Dick admitted that some decisions had been taken without her being kept informed.But she insisted that although this was "not ideal" it was incorrect to suggest she had not been in "proper control" of the incident.Ms Dick was also questioned about her decision not to close a bus stop outside the flats that morning, and why other senior officers appeared to have given orders that it should be closed.Clare Montgomery QC, prosecuting, told the court: "It is inconceivable that you [Ms Dick] were properly in control of your control room."Ms Dick replied: "It is not what I would like, making that level of decision without me being informed. If they did make that decision I was not informed."I don't think it means I was out of control."The Met is being prosecuted over an alleged "catastrophic" series of failures leading to the death of De Menezes at Stockwell tube station.On July 22 2005, he was followed by police surveillance teams who believed him to be the suspected July 21 bomber Hussain Osman.De Menezes was later killed after being shot seven times in the head by officers. The Met denies a single charge under health and safety laws.Today, the jury heard about where Ms Dick believed her firearms officers to be when De Menezes left his flat in Herne Hill, south London, at around 9.30am.Ms Dick said she had been informed by her tactical firearms adviser, known as Trojan 80, that they were "making their way as quickly as they could".She added: "As it became apparent that he [De Menezes] could be going to get the tube, I was encouraged by what I was sensing from Trojan 80."Ms Dick was also asked about whether she had been aware of concerns expressed repeatedly by an officer codenamed Derek - a surveillance team leader on the ground - about the deployment of firearms officers.The court heard that Derek was "upset" that he had on three occasions tried to relay his concerns that the firearms team should have been briefed at a territorial army centre closer to Osman's flat.Miss Montgomery recounted evidence from "Nick", an officer in the control room, that he relayed Derek's concern to Trojan 80 while Ms Dick was present and nodding her head, and asked her whether she remembered this.Ms Dick replied: "No, I don't remember that conversation at all. It was very busy and we all had our different roles."It is perfectly possible I didn't hear what was said."
