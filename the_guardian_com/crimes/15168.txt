Police believe grenades allegedly used by Dale Cregan, the main suspect in the murder of two police officers and two other people, came from the former Yugoslavia and were military issue. The availability of the Yugoslavian grenades, albeit in limited numbers on Britain's streets, are a bitter and unintended consequence of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the former Yugoslavia through the early to mid 1990s.On Tuesday morning, in a street in northern England, the geopolitical earthquake that convulsed Europe in the last part of the 20th century, had devastating consequences for two young British police officers.The last criminal campaign of attacks using grenades occurred in Merseyside. In March five people were jailed for gun and grenade attacks in a feud in Liverpool that lasted from 2009-11. In at least four attacks the grenades used were a M75 grenade originating from former Yugoslavia, where it was developed for military use.Part of Greater Manchester police's investigation will be to hunt down the suppliers of the grenades, which at this early stage are believed to have come through organised criminals.Cregan is under suspicion for the murder of two police officers in a gun and grenade attack, and for two other killings, one of which involved a grenade.One senior Metropolitan police source said the use of grenades was unheard of, and a Greater Manchester police spokesperson said Tuesday's attack was the first time their officers had encountered grenades.In the Merseyside incidents the gang involved were hired thugs who staged attacks for crime barons.According to the Liverpool Echo, over three years, the UK Police National Bomb Data Centre based inside the counter terrorism unit at Scotland Yard, dealt with 14 confirmed incidents involving grenades.Seven of those took place within 10 months on Merseyside at the height of the attacks orchestrated by the gang.Today Merseyside police said the grenade attacks stopped when the gang were arrested.A spokesperson for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: "The use of grenades is rare and there is no intelligence of an increase in their use or availability."Police sources said even the accidental recovery of grenades, as in when police raid an address looking for other items, usually involved grenades left over from the second world war.One senior detective source said grenades would be a poor weapons for criminals to use. They are indiscriminate, the attacker has to ensure they are a sufficient distance away not to injure themselves. The source added also the use of grenades would also "bring the heat down" from police.In 2003 Merseyside police have a record of a grenade incident in Liverpool city centre, but no details about whether the explosive was military issue or homemade.In February 2011 a former soldier was convicted of trying to murder his wife by planting a stolen grenade in her car outside their Kent home. Nicholas Fabian had stolen the British military issue grenade from a firing range during weapons training. A fly-off lever from the L109 British army issue explosive grenade and safety pin were found by police along with a J-shaped fishing hook on the ground near the car, following the explosion.Examination of the debris suggested the grenade had been strapped to the inside of the driver's side wheel-arch. A nylon line was attached to the grenade pin at one end and the fishing hook at the other.Many Irish gangsters have long standing links with English criminals especially in the north-west of England and Manchester in particular. One Limerick based crime gang runs a major fencing operation selling off high grade stolen goods in the Greater Manchester area as well as running drugs to and from across the Irish Sea.The use of grenades has been seen in the Irish Republic and was seen some years ago in Northern Ireland.In 1993 for instance the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force almost shipped into Northern Ireland tonnes of former Warsaw Pact military hardware including semtex explosives, rocket launchers, rifles,machine guns and Soviet-made grenades. MI5 and Special Branch intercepted the first of these shipments via Cleveland in north-east England.Security experts at the time said their importation would have "tipped the balance of terror" in the loyalists' favour.Among neo-nazi terror groups the Combat 18 organisation, which had established links with faction of the UDA headed up by Johnny "Mad Dog" Adair had exchanged weapons including grenades with the loyalists. Although it should be pointed out most of Combat 18's bomb attack were of the home made variety and were the work of a number of former British soldiers with neo-nazi sympathies.Most of the standard military grenades imported into the Northern Ireland are believed to have degraded or else been decommisisoned.
