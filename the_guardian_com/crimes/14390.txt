Jurors are considering the fate of a Northern Ireland woman accused of colluding with her former dentist lover to kill their spouses and make their deaths look like a suicide pact.Hazel Stewart denies murdering her husband, Trevor Buchanan, and her ex-lover's wife, Leslie Howell, in May 1991. Stewart's former dentist and lover Colin Howell, 51, is already serving a 21-year prison sentence in Maghaberry jail after pleading guilty to the murders.In his summing up, Judge Hart told the jury in Coleraine they had to consider whether the pair had been "in it together".Hart acknowledged the public attention on the case and asked the jury to put that aside and make their decision based on the evidence.In his closing speech, Paul Ramsey, defending, denied that 48-year-old Stewart had been part of a joint enterprise with Howell, saying the murders were carried out by a ruthless man who had reached the point of no return. Ramsey said Howell had regarded his client as weak, vulnerable and easy to control."This is a difficult, distressing and heart-rending case," he said. "We have listened day after day to horrific, almost unbelievable evidence as to what happened on that night in 1991. It is a tragedy, but we must not compound that tragedy by a miscarriage of justice," he said.Trevor Buchanan, 32, and Lesley Howell, 31, were found dead in a car filled with carbon monoxide fumes in a garage behind a row of houses known as the Twelve Apostles in the seaside town of Castlerock, Co Derry, in May 1991.At first, police thought they had died in a suicide pact brought about by their distress over their spouses' affair. It was only when Howell confessed to his church elders and then to police in January 2009 that Stewart was arrested.Howell first gassed his wife as she slept on the sofa of their home in Coleraine. He then drove her body to the far side of the town, where he murdered Buchanan by the same method before taking the two bodies away to give the appearance of suicide.
