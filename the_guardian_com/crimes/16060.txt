Large numbers of prisoners who pose no danger to the public are trapped in jail because society has become risk-averse over whether to release them on licence, the chair of the Parole Board for England and Wales said tonight.Speaking to the Guardian, Sir David Latham said that public reaction to cases such as Jon Venables, the killer of James Bulger recalled to prison last month, heightened the danger of politicians and parole board members making "skewed decisions" based on wrong assumptions about the risks offenders would pose to the public.As a result, he said, "large numbers" of prisoners are kept in jail, probably unnecessarily."Our release rates have reduced in the last few years in a way which is arguably an over-reaction to public concern about the reoffending by released prisoners," said Latham, who became chair of the board last February. "Actually, the serious further offending rate of released prisoners is just 1-2%; a level that has remained stable for many years."The risk, said Latham, is that "hard cases, like that of Venables, can end up making bad laws".Latham spoke as the Parole Board is expected tomorrow to officially begin considering the case of Venables, a process that will involve calling the 27-year-old for interview and hearing evidence from witnesses about the risk he poses to the public.Latham said he realised his message might be "distorted" by the tabloid press but thought it was important to have the debate out in the open. He said: "Any publicity about something that goes wrong in relation to somebody being released on parole is bound to make it more difficult to present the argument to the public that we have to operate in a way which means that some risk has to be accepted."People might think I'm saying we were right to release Venables in 2001 but what I'm saying has nothing to do with the release of Venables. That's a far more difficult and complex debate."What I'm saying is: Please, we're a risk-averse society. Don't let that skew us when making decisions and don't let hard cases make bad law."In the context of the Venables case, he said: "One can only hope that ultimately, people will be prepared to appreciate that those of us who have to make these difficult decisions will do so fully accepting the way the public is likely to react."But we have none the less to make our decision based on the material before us and applying the statutory tests imposed on us."If we took any other attitude, we would be moving towards simply not releasing anybody unless and until we were certain they were never going to offend again and that's not an acceptable, civilised approach to the job we have to do."In this sort of context, we're not talking about whether they're going to misbehave; we're talking about the risk to life or limb. Which may or may not be what we're talking about in the context of Venables."Latham admitted he was worried about how his message would be interpreted by the public. "I am concerned by the way this [interview] could be used by the tabloids to distort the real value of what I'm trying to say but it is important to have this debate."Society needs to realise that we can't create a world which is free of risk. What society has to determine, is what level of risk it is prepared to accept."I'm concerned that the society we're presently living in, is becoming too risk averse. That means that society is perhaps unrealistic about the level of risk it should be prepared to accept."The consequence, said Latham, is that "real injustices" are allowed to occur. Unless society was prepared, he added, to take a "more sophisticated attitude" to the risks posed by prisoners released on licence, the criminal justice system would continue to incarcerate people, who would never reoffend if released, for many years longer than they were sentenced to by the court.That is unjustifiable, he said. He pointed out that society had agreed it is wrong to deprive people of their liberty for something they might do.Once the tariff period for the offence has been served, there needs to be a proper and rigorous justification to keep anyone in prison, he said."I'm not confident that justification can be honestly made in all cases at the moment. It follows that there are a very large number of people who are in prison and going to remain there who will, in fact, never offend again."That seems to me to be an uncivilised approach to punishment on the one hand and a betrayal of society's right to protection from those who offend, on the other."Keeping prisoners in jail for longer than necessary is not just contrary to their human rights, he argued, it is also detrimental to society in general."Firstly, within prisons, the position is that there is a very large population of prisoners who do not know when they're going to be released even though they have completed their tariff period in prison. That's not good for discipline or morale."Then, the longer they're in prison the more difficult it is for them to be rehabilitated, which is a very real problem."Finally, it costs us a lot of money: you, me, the taxpayer. We have people in prison costing the country a lot of money for no benefit."While praising the justice secretary, Jack Straw, and his predecessor, Lord Falconer, for defending the independence of the board he also criticised the former home secretaries John Reid and David Blunkett for their interference."I think Reid's intervention, particularly in 2006 when he criticised the board for the level of releases, had a significant effect on release rates. The proof is there in our release rates, there's no getting away from it. None whatsoever."You can say: 'Ah, but we're independent so are not affected by it,' but we're people. If the Parole Board members feel they will be pilloried if they make a mistake, that's bound to have an effect on the way they're going to decide things."
