England footballer Ashley Cole was today banned from driving for doing more than 100mph in a 50mph zone.The Chelsea star claimed he was being chased by paparazzi when a speed gun recorded him driving his black Lamborghini Gallardo at 104mph.Magistrates at Kingston, Surrey, today imposed a four-month ban and £1,000 fine.However, Cole's legal team immediately launched a bid against the ban, which will be considered later.Cole, who is married to singer and presenter Cheryl Cole, was on the A3 in Kingston when he was clocked speeding. Though he denied the charge he was convicted at an earlier hearing.Today Patricia Baskerville, chairwoman of the magistrates, said: "We have taken into account Mr Cole's clean licence. However, this was an incident of excessive speed, over twice the speed limit on the road and these were exceptional circumstances which we need to mark."For the offence of speeding, Mr Cole will be disqualified for a period of four months and will pay a fine of £1,000."He was also ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and £300 costs to reflect his income and the seriousness of the offence.Cole, who was not present, was warned if he did drive while disqualified, he could face prison.His defence barrister asked for 21 days to pay, which magistrates laughed at, but granted.Cole's lawyer Katherine Hodson said her client was "regrettably" unable to attend the hearing because he was playing a match tomorrow night and would be travelling today.An attempt by her to get sentencing adjourned was rejected.Her application on the driving ban was expected to be considered later.At the earlier hearing, Richard Lomax, for the prosecution, described the events of 17 November 2008.He said: "The defendant was stopped and spoken to and the words he said at the time, when it became plain that somebody was pointing a speed camera at him, were: 'Can't you do anything about those idiots who keep chasing me?'"Cole told police he thought he was driving at 80mph when he was stopped just after midday.Lomax said: "The crown says there can be no other sensible construction of the words uttered by Mr Cole at the time than that he was conceding he was driving at a speed more than 50mph."It is plain that he found the attention of persons with cameras unwelcome and he was trying to get away from them."The only sensible inference, therefore, is that he was going too quickly."He added: "It cannot be a defence to the offence of speeding that one is trying to get away in the circumstances of members of the press showing excessive attention."
