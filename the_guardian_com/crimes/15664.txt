The home secretary, Charles Clarke, today made a plea to housebuilders, planners and architects to think about reducing crime when designing and building new communities.He pointed out that fear of crime is the biggest problem perceived by residents in their neighbourhoods.But speaking at the government's Sustainable Communities summit in Manchester, he insisted that crime could be reduced by better design.In a question time session at the summit, Mr Clarke cited the example of a reduction in car crime, which he attributed to better security features on modern vehicles. "The same applies to the way communities are built," he said."It is very important in any sustainable development that security and crime prevention is the core of every community initiative," he warned delegates.Mr Clarke said he was a "big believer" in the idea of designing out crime on estates and new developments. The home secretary also defended the government's decision not to pilot its controversial measures to relax the drink licensing laws. He said the government had piloted too many ideas and added: "It's much more important to go ahead and do it, when you know something is right."On the same platform the education secretary, Ruth Kelly, said the government's plans for more specialist vocational schools would help break down racial barriers in divided communities.She said that such schools would bring more faiths and racial groups together at school age. "That would be a huge contribution to community cohesion," she said.
