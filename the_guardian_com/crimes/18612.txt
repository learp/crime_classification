Record prison numbers yesterday forced the Home Office to announce that Buckley Hall women's prison, Rochdale, is to change its role to provide 350 extra places for adult men.The jail population topped 77,000 in recent weeks and ministers' hopes of "capping" the growth in numbers at 80,000 in England and Wales are beginning to look slim.The decision to change the role of Buckley Hall reflects the relentless rise in the numbers of adult male prisoners over the past eight months. The number of women behind bars has remained relatively stable and there are 850 vacancies in women's jails.The rise in numbers is putting pressure on the home secretary, Charles Clarke, to come up with initiatives to persuade courts to make greater use of alternatives to prison.The prison population in England and Wales stood at 76,984 yesterday, just below the total number of available cell spaces of 77,000.The current prison building programme envisages use of extra houseblocks to boost numbers to 80,500 by 2007.Buckley Hall was opened in 1994 by Group 4. It was brought back into the public prison service in 2000 when the contract was put up for tender again.It was turned into a women's prison four years ago.Lady Scotland, minister of state for offender management, said the decision to change the function of any prison was very difficult. "But we need to be able to react quickly to the constantly changing nature of the prison population."
