Police hunting the killer of a pregnant schoolgirl found murdered in a Shropshire churchyard yesterday released a man they had arrested and questioned over five days.The 27-year-old man was released from custody around lunchtime, after being arrested on Thursday afternoon. He was questioned over the murder of Amy Williams, 14, whose nearly naked body was found on December 27 in grounds belonging to St Michael's church, in Telford, near her home. Over the weekend magistrates had granted detectives extra time to hold the man, who comes from the Telford area. The man was released without charge and is not on bail. Amy was last seen on Boxing Day after leaving a family party. Police are still appealing for anyone who saw her in the 12 hours between the last sighting and the discovery of her body to come forward. A postmortem examination established she had been strangled, although detectives said there was no obvious sign of a struggle. Results of further tests to determine whether she had been sexually assaulted are due this week. The arrest of the man, the only one known to have been made so far by detectives hunting Amy's killer, came hours after her family made an emotional plea for the public's help in catching her killer.
