We want to send a clear message that abuse of this kind will not be tolerated and that we are taking robust action. I'd urge anyone who recognises these people to contact us as soon as possible."Portsmouth have reiterated that there is "no place" for homophobia in football and have welcomed a police investigation. Pompey's communications director, Gary Double, said: "There is no place for it in football and that is the view of most people in the game and most fans. The police involvement in this matter can have a positive effect. Sol is co-operating with the police investigations and has given them his views on it."Peter Tatchell, the human rights activist for OutRage!, has urged the FA to bring policies for dealing with homophobia in line with those of racism. "The abuse against Sol Campbell is totally unacceptable. Bigotry has no place in any sport," he said. "At all matches, stewards should be required to identify fans who shout homophobic abuse and the FA should secure the agreement of the police to arrest them in the same way that they arrest racist fans."The offence of indecent or racist chanting at a designated football match under the Football Offences Act 1991 can be punished by a fine of up to Â£1,000 and can also lead to ban on attending matches.Anyone with information should contact Operation Decorum on 0845 0454545 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
