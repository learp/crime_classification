Two Thai fishermen who pleaded guilty to raping and murdering a Welsh backpacker will learn on Wednesday if they are to be executed, after their trial was completed in six hours yesterday.While the evidence against Bualoi Posit, 23, and Wichai Somkhaoyai, 24, over the January 1 attack on Katherine Horton appears to be watertight, the unprecedented speed of the investigation and trial has raised questions about the impartiality of Thailand's police and judicial authorities.Murder cases usually take months to conclude in Thailand, but in this instance the interval between the incident and sentencing will be 17 days. The police pulled out all the stops after prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra warned the publicity of the case was harming the country's reputation and tourism industry.Bualoi and Wichai were arrested on Monday following the deployment of more than 100 of Thailand's best detectives to the island of Koh Samui, where the 21-year-old Reading University student was attacked while talking to her mother in Cardiff during a late evening walk along Lamai beach.They were charged on Wednesday, the 156-page police file was given to prosecutors on Thursday, who arranged a special after-hours court hearing that day for pleas to be entered, and the trial was held yesterday.The prosecution called eight witnesses and the defence none. The defendants, who were manacled and in leg chains, were twice offered the chance to give evidence but it was suggested on both occasions that their statements would suffice.Both times they merely nodded, although considering their education level is almost non-existent it is doubtful they truly understood the situation.At one point Bualoi was asked by his lawyer, Amarin Nuimai, if he regretted his actions. He replied: "If I could roll the time back I would not have done it," to which Wichai nodded. Unfortunately for them, this was after the judges had left the courtroom. Mr Amarin denied the proceedings had been conducted with undue haste. "We have followed standard procedures," he said.The evidence against the two defendants includes their confessions and DNA taken from Ms Horton's body. The forensic expert who did the tests, Pattana Kitkailart, told the court yesterday the odds of the defendants' DNA matching that found were six billion to one.Sunai Phasuk, a representative of Human Rights Watch in Thailand, welcomed the police's "exemplary" work but told the Guardian it also "highlighted the disturbing trend of double standards and the lack of independence of the police and courts."When there's political pressure they can take swift action to solve a case quickly," he said."But with ordinary cases or when there's no political interest in bringing justice to the victims, like in southern Thailand, usually nothing happens."He was referring to three mostly Muslim provinces in the otherwise overwhelmingly Buddhist country where dozens of members of the security forces have been accused of crimes while suppressing an insurgency since 2004 but none has been brought to trial.Somsri Hananuntahuk, the head of Amnesty International in Thailand, said the government must also take some of the blame for Ms Horton's death."Cases like this involving fishermen have happened in the past but the victims have been illegal migrants or Burmese, so no one cares. The government needs to find a way out for these fishermen. They need some education."
