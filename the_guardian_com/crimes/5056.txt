One person died and another was injured in an apparent gangland shooting near a funeral in south London.Witnesses described hearing six shots and shouting as the incident unfolded on Thursday afternoon when scores of people were leaving Camberwell Old Cemetery in Peckham Rye, south London after the funeral of 17-year-old car crash victim Joel Morgan, also known as Jozey.It is not known whether there was any connection between the two events.Officers from Operation Trident, which investigates gangland homicides in the capital's black communities, are leading the investigation into the shootings, the Guardian understands.Metropolitan police detectives, who have yet to release details of the victims, are trying to establish whether the pair who were targeted were among mourners attending the funeral.Jamie Younger, who was in the area, told LBC radio there was a mass funeral taking place at the cemetery and he believes the shooting happened as everyone was coming out.He said: "I drove past I think just as the incident happened. There was a big fight sort of outside a letting agents. There was a big fight and then lots of people just ran off crying and it seems like someone was shot."Scotland Yard confirmed that officers were sent to the scene as a hunt was launched for the gunman.A spokesman said: "Police were called to the junction of Forest Hill Road and Rockells Place at 3.04pm to reports of a shooting. London ambulance service also attended. One person was confirmed dead at the scene."The spokesman said a second person was believed to have suffered gunshot wounds and was taken to hospital.London ambulance service deployed two cars, three ambulance crews, three motorcycles, the air ambulance, a hazardous area response team and two officers to the scene. They were protected by police as they entered the area.One mourner, who did not wish to be named, said he did not think the shooting was linked to the funeral.The man, who could not leave the area because his car was trapped inside the police cordon, said: "Someone said that there were fireworks going on. It seems a shame that everyone is linking it to the funeral when we do not know."
