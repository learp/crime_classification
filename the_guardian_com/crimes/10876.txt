Sexual harassment and "lad culture" are rife on university campuses, with more than a third of women reporting that they have suffered unwelcome advances in the form of inappropriate groping and touching, research shows.In a survey of 2,156 men and women by the National Union of Students (NUS) published on Monday, 37% of women and 12% of men who responded said they had faced unwelcome sexual advances. Under UK law "inappropriate touching and groping" constitutes sexual assault, though the survey does not use the term.Launching the study, the NUS president, Toni Pearce, called on university authorities to stop "passing the buck" and acknowledge the problem on British campuses.The online survey paints a woeful portrait of "laddism" at UK universities. The NUS defines lad culture as a set of "behaviours and attitudes that … belittle, dismiss, joke about or even seem to condone rape and sexual assault".As many teenagers begin their university careers at freshers' week, the findings suggest some could experience face sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the university environment.More than a third of women (36%) who took part in the survey said they had experienced unwanted sexual comments about their body compared with 16% of men. Two-thirds said they had seen students tolerate unwanted sexual comments, and just under a third reported gender-based verbal harassment.The survey suggested the telling of rape and sexual assault jokes was commonplace, with two-thirds of those taking part admitting to witnessing it in the university environment.More than a third of respondents were aware of promotional materials around their university that had sexualised images of women, with 51% of women and 33% of men agreeing that the images made them feel uncomfortable. Examples included naked pictures of women accompanying a call for more photos of "top student totty", and girls pictured kissing on a flyer.Three-quarters were aware of online communities such as Uni Lad and The Lad Bible, aimed at male students, which 63% of women and 43% of men felt contributed to an unfair representation of women.In contrast, the study revealed a worrying lack of awareness among students of reporting procedures or provisions to prohibit and tackle such behaviour – 60% said they were unaware of any codes of conduct at their university or student union.As a result of the findings, the NUS is launching a pilot scheme in a small number of unions to assess the impact of lad culture and examine the adequacy of measures in place to tackle the problem, with a long-term aim of developing a cross-institutional strategy.Pearce said: "These stats show that harassment is rife on campus, but we still keep hearing from universities that there is no fear, no intimidation, no problem - well this new research says otherwise."Sadly, all of these elements exist in campus life, we know because we hear it from students. Today I say to universities everywhere the pass the buck approach of 'not on my campus' is now completely unacceptable. They must acknowledge the problems and join us in confronting them."Laura Bates, of the Everyday Sexism campaign, is ambassador for the NUS lad culture national strategy team. "Students are experiencing sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the university environment. It is worth mentioning that one category of such experiences 'inappropriate touching and groping' actually constitutes sexual assault under UK law. Though many students would not label it as such, this normalisation and lack of awareness is a major part of the problem."The survey was conducted online between 18 August and 4 September; 57% of the respondents were women.
