A conman has been told he faces a long prison sentence after admitting he pocketed Â£300,000 in donations meant for the Help for Heroes charity.Christopher Copeland, 51, recruited teams of workers to set up donation stations at supermarkets around the country over an 18-month period.They used his fleet of former military vehicles in Help for Heroes livery, and encouraged shoppers to put money into charity buckets. The teams collected at shops including Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's on at least 15 occasions, police found.The workers, who were paid expenses, would spend three or four days a week collecting, staying in Copeland's vehicles or a hotel. They handed the cash to Copeland, of mid-Devon, who put it into his personal bank accounts.Exeter crown court heard the scam took place between 1 February 2010 and 17 September 2011, when Copeland was arrested. He admitted one charge of fraud by false representation and one charge of concealing criminal property, relating to the stolen donations.Judge Philip Wassall adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports but warned Copeland he faced a lengthy jail term. "It is difficult to imagine a fraud with greater aggravating features," he said.The fraud charge states that Copeland was accused of taking the donations knowing that he did not intend to pass them on to Help for Heroes, contrary to section 1 of the Fraud Act.David Sapiecha, prosecuting, said Copeland would now face proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.Representing Copeland, Rosaleen Collins said her client and his family had been attacked at their home since his arrest. "When this matter was publicised before, there were some serious threats to Mr Copeland and his family to such an extent that police had to fit an alarm in his property," she said.Jo Brookes, Help for Heroes' income protection officer, described Copeland's actions as devious. "We're appalled that Chris Copeland exploited the goodwill of so many people towards our wounded men and women in such a calculated, devious way," she said."The money he stole never reached us, or the thousands of heroes we support, because he used organised, criminal tactics to intercept it."Help for Heroes is grateful to our local fundraiser who first spotted what Copeland was doing, and to the police and the courts who have made sure he didn't get away with it.Copeland, who was bailed, will be sentenced on 15 September.
