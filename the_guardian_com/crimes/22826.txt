The unit fine system, under which penalties are linked to an offender's income, should be reintroduced to help to end the ratcheting up of punishment in Britain, the chief inspector of probation told MPs yesterday.The home secretary, David Blunkett, has been asked to consider the plan to reverse the decline in use of fines by the courts in the past 12 years. Rod Morgan, chief inspector of probation, yesterday told the Commons home affairs committee that offenders who are also benefit claimants should have fines deducted directly from social security payments to ensure that they do not go uncollected. "Offenders who a decade ago were being fined are being given community penalties. Offenders who would have got community penalties are now getting short prison sentences. The short-term prison population has increased significantly and they are the group most likely to reoffend, and for whom we do the least." He said the decision to abandon the unit fine system in the early 1990s had been a "disastrous error", with the proportion of offenders fined by the courts falling from 45 per cent in 1991 to 28 per cent today. Anomalies could be overcome by exempting from the new scheme cases, including motoring offences, in which assumptions were made about income because the defendant did not appear in court. The unit fine system had been abandoned because it had not been well designed. "There is a nettle parliament has to grasp in relation to fines. As many as two-thirds of defendants in magistrates' courts are dependent on state benefits - are people on benefits capable of being fined?"
