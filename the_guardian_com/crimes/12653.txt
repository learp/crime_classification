Politicians may love antisocial behaviour orders. But not all frontline professionals have been so enamoured with them, and a new campaigning organisation hopes to tap into that scepticism.Asbo Concern is to be launched next month. Coordinator Matt Foot, a criminal defence solicitor, explains: "The government is irresponsible promoting Asbos - which often criminalise people for behaviour that is not criminal - when there is no evidence that they work. We have serious concerns about the way they are used and want to organise the broadest possible coalition to put pressure on the government for a full review."Foot says 13 organisations - including the National Association of Probation Officers, the Community and Youth Workers Union, the British Association of Social Workers (BASW) and Action for Children's Rights - have already signed up to the campaign's statement of aims.At a series of informal meetings, frustration with Asbos bubbled up time and again. Everyone has an Asbo story to tell, from the International Collective of Prostitutes to youth workers and lawyers.Asbo Concern says the orders are a blunt instrument that do nothing to help young and vulnerable people integrate better. The order issued to a suicidal woman, banning her from jumping into the river Avon, is only the latest crazy-but-true Asbo tale.Ruth Cartwright, BASW professional officer, says: "Social workers are angry at the role they are having to play. We are also concerned at the way Asbos are criminalising young people and vulnerable adults."Iain Taylor, 16, chairs the equality board of Greenwich Young People's Council, and is involved in Asbo Concern in a personal capacity. He says: "Asbos simply attempt to scapegoat a section of the community who are vulnerable. Young people being one of the targets, I feel it's important for them to be part of this campaign."Â· The launch meeting of Asbo Concern is at Friends Meeting House, Euston Road, London NW1, on April 7.
