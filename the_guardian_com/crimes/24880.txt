The Liberal Democrats' former treasurer says he warned a senior party official to be wary of accepting donations from Michael Brown, a fraudster who weeks later gave the party £2.4m of stolen money.Reg Clark, who was in charge of the party's finances for five years, said he described the behaviour of Brown, a fast-talking Glaswegian who claimed to be a trader, as being "very odd" and worthy of caution in a conversation with Charles Kennedy's adviser Anna Werrin in February 2005.Clark then resigned from his position. The following month, Brown gave the party its largest donation from an individual.Brown, 45, is now on the run from the authorities and has been hiding in the Dominican Republic having been convicted in his absence of theft and false accounting and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. The party has refused demands to pay any of the donated money to Brown's victims.The parliamentary ombudsman's office is launching an inquiry into the Electoral Commission's clearance of the donation. Clark said he was never questioned by the commission's inquiry.Clark said he decided to resign after Brown had given his first tranche of £100,000. But, before he left, Clark said he told Werrin, the "gatekeeper" of the then leader Kennedy, that he was concerned about Brown's background and reliability."On the basis of the way that he [Brown] had behaved towards me, my final words to Anna Werrin, who remained a very good friend of mine [she died last December], were 'this guy is very strange, his behaviour is very odd, you should check him out before you take any more of his money'. Whether they did [check him out] or not, I can't comment," Clark said. "That was the day I resigned. I don't know if my words were passed on to Charles Kennedy."Clark said he first met Brown in November 2004, just a few months before the general election when the party was in desperate need of funds.Brown had taken the unusual step of walking into the party's offices in Cowley Street, Westminster, and offering a donation. He was not a party member, was not registered to vote and lived in Spain – but he was accepted with open arms.Clark said they were initially talking about a donation of about £10,000, but he persuaded Brown to increase the amount to £100,000.By mid-December, Brown met Kennedy in the first of a number of encounters but his relationship with Clark soon began to falter. Clark claimed he had been in talks about Brown investing in Clark's businesses at Brown's instigation.Unbeknown to Clark, Brown gave £100,000 to the party in early February 2005 through the British subsidiary of his Swiss-based company 5th Avenue Partners. Brown promised more money for the Lib Dems, but only if they sacked Clark, he claimed.Clark said he was shocked to discover that senior unnamed party officials backed Brown over him."I resigned after discussions with senior members of the party when it became clear that I did not enjoy their support and my position was that it was impossible to go forward. I never took a single penny from Michael Brown and I was not responsible for the receipt of any money from him."Clark, who was a Lib Dem parliamentary candidate at the last election, said that he was sure that party officials regretted, with hindsight, accepting Brown's money.He said: "They had prima facie evidence that the guy was prepared to meet a political party, discuss a donation, instigate a business discussion and turn around and say this business discussion is inappropriate and you should get rid of this guy. How weird is that behaviour? I would have liked to have had the backing of my colleagues but I didn't."I think they made an error of judgement in refusing to back me and they probably, in retrospect, made an error of judgment in taking his money."Kennedy was asked to comment on Clark's claims but did not respond to calls or emails.Senior Lib Dems insist Brown's donation was accepted in good faith. On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, Kennedy said the Lib Dems went "the extra mile" in clearing Brown's company 5th Avenue Partners as a proper donor.The parliamentary ombudsman's investigation, prompted by a member of the public, is now looking at the Electoral Commission inquiry into the donation.In November 2009, the inquiry cleared the party of any wrongdoing and said they had checked out Brown and his company properly. But it was condemned by Brown's victims as a whitewash.If it decides the commission acted improperly, the ombudsman can recommend that it reopens the case.The commission has refused to say who it interviewed while coming to the conclusion that Brown's company was "carrying on business" and therefore a permitted donor.The high court has ruled that Brown's company was set up solely to perpetrate a multimillion pound fraud.A crown court heard that Brown had given the money to the Lib Dems to give himself an air of influence while conning his victims, including the former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards, out of more than £40m.The Guardian revealed last week that Brown was living, until two weeks ago, in the Dominican Republic coastal resort of Punta Cana. City of London police are negotiating his possible return, but there is no extradition treaty with the Dominican Republic.Two men have been arrested over Brown's disappearance and have been bailed.
