Closed-circuit television has been credited with ensuring the conviction of a railway worker who tried to bundle a teenage girl into bushes late at night.Dieter Graw, 46 and married, faces a prison sentence after admitting the attempted kidnap in the middle of Doncaster in June last year. He was remanded in custody yesterday at Hull crown court by Judge Jackie Davies, who told him: "You will receive a custodial sentence, I warn you of that now." The term will depend on probation and psychiatric reports on Graw, who lives in Great Heck village, near Selby. The court heard South Yorkshire police had been inundated with calls after CCTV film was shown on local television and BBC Crimewatch. The images showed Graw trying to talk to the 16-year-old before grabbing her and forcing her towards the bushes. The girl, who has not been named for legal reasons, struggled furiously and eventually broke free and escaped. Detective Superintendent Richard Fewkes, who led the inquiry, said: "Her bravery in putting up a struggle is one of the reasons she escaped but she has been significantly affected by these events." The judge told the 30-minute hearing that background inquiries would assist in calculating the level of risk Graw posed. The court heard that Graw had almost been caught at the time of the attack, as his actions had been spotted by CCTV monitoring staff in the council control room. They had been prompted to watch the area by an off-duty police officer who phoned in to express concern about a young girl out alone at 3am. Detectives were at the scene within minutes but the railway worker had fled. The girl told police he had picked her up but had panicked when she struggled and screamed, hoping passersby or staff at a nearby service station might hear.
