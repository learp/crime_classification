This is an edited excerpt from Shahin Munir's diary on 8 August 2008. She is a friend of Mevish Ahmed, one of Shafilea's sisters.Oh my God. Today I met up with Mev. And we went to the park. She was very nervous. Her arm kept shaking and she said that's what happens when she gets paranoid. We were just talking about how everyone treats her like shit. Eventually she told me what happened to her sister Shafilea. They all went Pakistan, to sort her out. They sedated her as she didn't actually want to go.Then the bleach thing happened and that was an accident but their family just said let her die. Shafilea was very ill. She lost a lot of weight.But her mum told Mev to stop caring for her, like stop trying to feed her.That night, like when everything happened, Shafilea came home from work and they started shouting at her because she had a T-shirt on and she forgot her coat. Her dad went mad and started proper hitting her. Mev tried to stop it but her mum pushed her away. Then Junyad got a plastic bag. Alesha had run up by this point. They used the bag to suffocate her.One to two minutes gone. Just like Mev wrote. That's it, that's how it happened. Mev's mum tried to tell her Shafilea had ran away. Then they disposed of her body. But Mev's scared. They say things like: "You know what happened to the other one."
