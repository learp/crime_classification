The wife of a convicted terrorist received a 12-month suspended sentence at the Old Bailey on Friday for failing to provide information that might have helped police and security services.Ayan Hadi, of Acton, west London, had already admitted failing to alert the authorities when her husband Richard Dart, a white Muslim convert, had planned to fly to Pakistan for combat training, she also pleaded guilty to failing to provide information that she knew or believed might have helped secure the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of her husband for an act of terrorism.Yesterday Mr Justice Sweeney sentenced her to 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years, a two-year supervision order, plus a separate order meaning she will have to tell the authorities her whereabouts for the next 10 years.He told Hadi that "justice could be tempered by mercy" particularly in cases involving someone who is vulnerable or in a relationship with a defendant."You have demonstrated remorse for your behaviour," said the judge. "This experience has made you aware of your responsibilities, which you should have been aware of in the first place."Dart was jailed for six years in April with two co-conspirators, Jahangir Alom and Imran Mahmood, for engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism. Mahmood received nine years and nine months, and Alom was jailed for four years and six months. At the time they were sentenced, the judge said they were all "committed fundamentalists" who would have been prepared to kill.Dart and Alom travelled to Pakistan to try to get terrorist training, and took advice from Mahmood who had already visited the country, the court heard.Former BBC security guard Dart also discussed bomb-making with Mahmood, and spoke of targeting the Wiltshire town of Royal Wootton Bassett â€“ which became a focal point for the repatriation of UK soldiers from Afghanistan.Friday, Mr Justice Sweeney told Hadi that there had been "an element of choice" in her decision not to alert the authorities after Dart revealed his intentions to her in November 2011.He also noted that having a first husband who was "clearly abusive" towards her had "coloured in part your relationship to the information" and said Dart had put her "in a difficult position" by making her "choose for your love for him" and balancing out her duty to tell the authorities.The court heard that Hadi was of good character and that neither she nor any member of her family had shown any extremist sympathies.
