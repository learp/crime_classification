A man has been found guilty of mugging a friend of the royals as he was speaking to Prince Harry on the phone.Winful Taylor, 27, of Stockwell, south London, denied robbing Thomas van Straubenzee, taking two mobile phones and a wallet, last November. But he was found guilty by the jury after two hours of deliberation at Kingston crown court.The robbery sparked a security scare because Van Straubenzee's Nokia phone contained telephone numbers of several members of the royal family. The jury was not told about the full extent of his relationship with the royals as the judge deemed it irrelevant to the case.But before the start of the trial, the court heard he had been talking to his old schoolfriend on his mobile when the mugging happened near Battersea Park. Taylor and another man, who has not been caught, took the 29-year-old's wallet and two mobile phones.The jury was told Taylor previously admitted two robberies carried out in 2006 and was convicted earlier this year of an attempted robbery carried out with another man in Hyde Park five weeks before the mugging of Mr van Straubenzee.Two days after the robbery, police found Taylor with two mobile phones. One was a Samsung and one was Mr van Straubenzee's red Nokia.Mr van Straubenzee's wallet and BlackBerry have not been recovered.Taylor denied responsibility for the robbery, and said he bought the phone for Â£20 from a friend the previous day.
