A teenage mother has been shot in the street with two friends while clutching her 11-month-old son in her arms.Jessica Chrichlow, 18, collapsed to the ground alongside two sisters – named locally as Sammy, 17, and Alex, 19 – after being caught in the crossfire of a botched gang attack, witnesses said on Friday morning.Detective Chief Inspector Mick Foote said: "It was a random, reckless act and we are fortunate we are not dealing with a fatal shooting here."Police said it was "hugely fortunate" that the baby escaped injury.The three victims had been outside in John Fearon Walk, north Kensington, west London, enjoying balmy temperatures when the attacker got off a bike and screamed "motherfucker" at the group, a neighbour, who did not want to be named, said.Foote added: "I do not believe the girls were the intended targets. What's particularly devastating is that the young girl was carrying a young child."This was totally unprovoked."As a hunt was launched for several young men seen on bicycles on the west London housing estate last night, the officer said he was "working on the basis" that the shooting was gang-related.One neighbour said her 12-year-old daughter saw the shooting from her bedroom window.Jacky Cinesey said: "I have sent her to school in tears today. These girls were just outside enjoying the sunshine. It's horrifying."
