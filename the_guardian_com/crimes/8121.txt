Lawyers representing the jailed Muslim cleric Abu Hamza today told the court of appeal that the six-year delay in prosecuting him had made a fair trial impossible.Hamza was jailed for seven years in February after prosecutors argued that he had preached "terrorism, homicidal violence and hatred" during sermons he gave at the Finsbury Park mosque, in north London, and elsewhere.An Old Bailey jury convicted him on 11 of 15 charges of incitement to murder and race hate offences.However, Edward Fitzgerald QC today said it was "unfair and oppressive" to put him on trial in 2006 for speeches made between 1997 and 2000.Mr Fitzgerald, representing Hamza in his challenge to have his convictions overturned, said subsequent terrorist atrocities including the September 11 attacks on the US and the London bombings, in addition to a sustained campaign from the media and leading politicians, had "prejudiced" his chances of a fair trial."Because of the delay in prosecuting the appellant, the atmosphere had been poisoned against him in a way that would not have happened had he been subjected to a timely prosecution," Mr Fitzgerald told the court.During Hamza's month-long trial, the prosecution alleged he had acted as a recruiting sergeant for global terrorism during sermons delivered at Finsbury Park and in Luton, Blackburn and Whitechapel, east London.Hamza was convicted of inciting his followers to murder non-Muslims and Jews and of possessing a terror "manual" called the Encyclopaedia of the Afghani Jihad.The book featured a dedication to the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, and a list of potential targets including Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower.Hamza - who was not present in court for the appeal proceedings - has claimed the case against him was politically motivated.His appeal, expected to last for two days, is being heard by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, sitting with Mr Justice Penry-Davey and Mr Justice Pitchford.
