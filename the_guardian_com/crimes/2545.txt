The TV host Judy Finnigan has been criticised after suggesting during a live TV show that a rape victim did not receive any “bodily harm”.The former This Morning presenter was making her debut on ITV’s Loose Women on Monday afternoon when she made her comments during a discussion about the footballer Ched Evans who has served half of a five-year sentence for raping a woman in a hotel room.But her comments have aroused anger among some viewers who felt she was downplaying the seriousness of the crime.The presenters were discussing Evans’ case following reports he may return to Sheffield United following his release.Finnigan said: “If he does go back, he will have to brave an awful lot of comments obviously from the fans who are there.“But, having said that, he has served his time, he’s served two years. The rape - and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape - but the rape was not violent, he didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person. It was unpleasant, in a hotel room I believe, and she had far too much to drink.“That is reprehensible but he has been convicted and he has served his time. When he comes out, what are we supposed to do, just actually to refuse to let him do his job even though he’s already been punished?”But some viewers posted messages on Twitter after the show to criticise her comments.One said: “Did Judy just justify rape on loose women? Sick. It’s always wrong no matter what the circumstances are.”Another wrote: “Can’t believe that Judy has just said on Loose Women it wasn’t a bad rape, any rape is bad and wrong. Disgusting.”
