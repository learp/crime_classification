A householder arrested on suspicion of murder after the death of an intruder at his home has been cleared of any wrongdoing.Raymond Jacob, 37, suffered fatal stab wounds in a struggle at the Stockport house of courier boss Vincent Cooke.Cooke, 39, was later released on bail pending further inquiries into the incident in the early evening of 17 September, but on Friday was told by the Crown Prosecution Service that he would face no further action.Detectives investigating the stabbing said they had to determine whether it was "a criminal act" or if it fitCooke's claim of self-defence.Cooke was initially at home alone at the detached property in Midland Road, Bramhall, at around 7.50pm but his wife, Karen, and their 12-year-old son returned during the mel√©e. They escaped unharmed.Police and paramedics gave first aid to Jacob, who was a known offender, but he died shortly afterwards.Jacob's family later said they had been "distressed" at the events and supported the police inquiry to find out what happened.A 33-year-old man from Heald Green, Stockport, is in custody charged with aggravated burglary in connection with the incident and is due to appear in court in December.
