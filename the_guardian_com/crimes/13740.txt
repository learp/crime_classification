One of Britain's most wanted criminals has been captured in South Africa, sources have confirmed.Former ostrich farmer turned drug trafficker Martin Evans, 52, had been on the run since 2011.He was given a 21-year jail term for drug smuggling, which saw him lead an organised crime group supplying cocaine, MDMA and ecstasy between 1999 and 2001. He absconded while on temporary licence six years into his sentence.The former Young Businessperson of the Year from Pontarddulais, Wales, had previously given the authorities the slip while waiting to stand trial for fraud.Days before he was to face justice for swindling 115 investors out of their savings in a £900,000 ostrich farm scam, he fled to Spain.While trying to evade capture for that offence, he went on to lead an international gang smuggling at least £3m-worth of ecstacy and cocain into Britain.A police source said: "Martin Evans was arrested in South Africa. He is one of the National Crime Agency's most wanted individuals."Investigations are ongoing as whether he was committing further offences under an alias while in South Africa."The agency lists Evans on the most wanted section of its website.The article reads: "Between 1999 and 2001 Evans led an organised crime group supplying cocaine, MDMA and ecstasy. The proceeds were converted into foreign currency and transported to the Netherlands to fund further drug consignments."The agency said Evans had been known to use the aliases Martin Roydon Evans, Martin Wayne Evans, Anthony Hall and Paul Kelly.Tracking down Evans was a global operation, given his previous links to the US, Netherlands and the Caribbean.In 2012, the Serious Organised Crime Agency said it believed the disgraced businessman was one of eight British fugitives hiding in Cyprus.Evans turned to crime when his once-successful double-glazing firm collapsed.
