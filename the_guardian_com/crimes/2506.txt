A senior Metropolitan police press officer has been suspended over allegations that he leaked information to journalists.The Met confirmed that the veteran press man, Mike Cobb, who has spent 27 years with Scotland Yard, has been suspended pending an inquiry into claims that he disclosed "unauthorised information" to the press.It is believed he was called into a meeting with his bosses more than two weeks ago and told he was being put on temporary leave. No details about who made the allegations or what specific information he had divulged without alleged authority were given to him, said one friend in the press."A senior press officer attached to the Met's directorate of public affairs has been suspended on March 25 pending an inquiry by the director of public standards into allegations of the disclosure of unauthorised information to journalists," said a police spokesman.Mr Cobb is well known to reporters on the national and regional press - over his long career he has dealt with some of the biggest police investigations, including the Clapham train crash, the Iranian embassy siege, the Marchioness pleasure boat disaster on the Thames and the murder of Nigerian schoolboy Damilola Taylor.The Crime Reporters Association has written to Scotland Yard to express its concern."It was Mike's job to be open with the press and he was one of the biggest advocates of openness at Scotland Yard, which at the best of times can be very trying to deal with. It seems he is now being penalised for this. It was his job to disclose information to the press," said one crime journalist.The DPS, the director of professional standards, has started calling crime correspondents investigating the alleged leaks, although it is understood Mr Cobb has yet to be formally interviewed.The relationship between the police and the media has been a source of controversy for many years.An anti-corruption investigation conducted by the Met in 1999 revealed that a detective agency run by former officers was acting as an intermediary between the press and police.In February 2002 a detective working on the Jill Dando murder investigation was ordered to resign from the force after it was revealed that he had leaked information about the case to the press.Detective Constable Robert McKenzie was found guilty at a police disciplinary tribunal of failing to disclose contact with the media and to obey a lawful order, although Scotland Yard refused to reveal the nature of the information he had leaked to the press.The editor of the Sun, Rebekah Wade, admitted recently that she had paid police officers for information in the past, prompting calls for an inquiry into media payments to the police.Giving evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into media intrusion in March, the former News of the World editor said the newspaper had paid police for information in the past.However, her replacement as News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, quickly interjected to say: "We have always operated within the code and within the law."The head of corporate affairs at News International issued a statement to the press, pointing out that "it was not company practice to pay police for information".
