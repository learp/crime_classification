Press AssociationA martial arts expert who strangled his partner after learning that she planned to leave him for another man was jailed for life today. Alan Jermey was told he must serve at least 16 years after being found guilty of murdering Mercedes executive Kirsty Wilson by an Old Bailey jury.Judge Martyn Zeidman today said he had done a "terrible thing" by killing his "kind, vibrant, beautiful" partner.Jermey, 41, a car salesman with a black belt in kung fu, used his skills to throttle her, leaving few external injuries, then set her body alight to try to make it look as though she had died in a fire. But the blaze at their home in Woking, Surrey, failed to take hold.The court heard that Jermey hatched a plan to kill Wilson, 34, after learning she planned to leave him for her married boss, Simon Goddard. But he was not prepared to lose her, their two daughters, or the four-bedroom house where they lived together in Woking, Surrey.He secretly ordered a 100,000-volt stun gun over the internet so he could knock her out before killing her in August last year.After pouring petrol over her, he arranged her body to make it look as though she had fallen asleep watching television and clambered on to an extension roof with their two daughters.Jermey, who worked for a car firm near Heathrow, told the court he had gone to bed early and left Wilson downstairs when he was woken by an explosion and was prevented from saving her by thick smoke. But when firefighters arrived, there were only a few wisps and they noticed he seemed calm and unconcerned about what had happened to her after they rescued him and his young daughters.The judge said the killer had "imposed a life sentence of weeping" on his partner's parents and dealt a "devastating blow" to his children. He added that the crime was aggravated by some clear premeditation, as shown by the removal of a smoke alarm before the murder, and that Jermey had jeopardised his children's lives by starting the fire in an attempt to destroy evidence.
