Conditions at the privately run immigration deportation centre at Gatwick airport are fundamentally unsafe, according to a damning report by the chief inspector of prisons published today.Dame Anne Owers says that a year after the opening of G4S-run Brook House immigration removal centre she and her inspection team were disturbed to find one of the least safe immigration detention facilities that had been inspected.Her report says bullying and violence were serious problems at the time of their inspection in March and – unusually for immigration detention centres – drugs were also a serious problem.Those who were about to be deported or had been recalcitrant were placed in two oppressive holding rooms, which are windowless and seatless. Owers says they should be decommissioned immediately.Many of the 400 male detainees held at Brook House are ex-prisoners facing deportation. A number of them told the inspectors their experience at the removal centre was worse than their time in prison."Our surveys, interviews and observations all evidenced a degree of despair amongst detainees about safety at Brook House which we have rarely encountered. At the time of the inspection, Brook House was an unsafe place," says Owers's report.Although the centre – which is built to the same standards as a category B prison – is designed to hold detainees for no more than 72 hours, the report says the average time spent in Brook House is three months, with one man having been there for 10 months. Its design as a short-term holding centre meant there was insufficient activity or education facilities.A significant number of staff left after an outbreak of serious disorder in June last year when detainees started fires and damaged one wing."While many staff tried hard to maintain order and control, many felt embattled and some lacked the confidence to manage bad behaviour," says the report."A number of staff reported feeling unsupported by managers, detainees claimed that some staff were bullied by more difficult detainees."The result was a confrontational approach in the treatment of detainees with a high use of force, separation often used as punishment, – which is against detention centre rules – and restrictions on freedom of movement in an attempt to combat violence.The report says force had been used to restrain detainees by staff 78 times in the previous six months.The chief inspector said force was generally used in line with approved techniques. However on one recent occasion a detainee was moved to temporary confinement after urinating through his door.The report says: "The officer's own record read: 'I entered first with the shield. A was standing up by the table and I hit him with the shield.' Another officer in the team had recorded that (officer N) used the shield to hold the detainee against the table in the room. Detainee folded his arms behind the shield." In a later incident in the same the same officer N is recorded having used his shield to pin a detainee to his bed.The chief inspector also details the use of the separation unit and cites the case of a detainee who was taken to a psychiatric institution after more than 80 days in separation for disturbed and disruptive behaviour."The challenges of opening a new immigration removal centre should not be underestimated, particularly with inexperienced staff and challenging detainees, many of them ex-prisoners," said Owers."But none of this can excuse the fundamentally unsafe state of Brook House, which must be urgently addressed by G4S and United Kingdom border agency."David Wood, director of criminality and detention for UKBA, said it was disappointed with the report, but accepted its broad conclusions. "That is why we have acted so swiftly to implement the vast majority of the improvements recommended," he said, citing the introduction of an anti-bullying policy, a comprehensive drugs strategy and additional support for staff."The vast majority of detainees in Brook House have committed very serious crimes, including drugs, sex and violent offences," said Wood."The centre, therefore, faces a number of challenges on a daily basis. We are absolutely committed to meeting these challenges and the remaining improvements will be made in the next few months."
