A "bigoted and racist" neo-Nazi was planning to use tennis ball shrapnel bombs in a hate campaign against Asians, a court heard today . Neil Lewington, was said to have been on the brink of a bombing spree when he was "fortuitously" arrested for being drunk and disorderly at a Suffolk railway station. Police found he was carrying two home-made fire bombs in a holdall, the Old Bailey heard. In a raid on the 43-year-old's home in Tilehurst, Berkshire, which he shared with his parents, police found a bomb factory, it was alleged. Lewington denies eight charges under anti-terrorism and explosives laws.
