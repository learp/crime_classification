Three people who kept an epileptic man in a locked garden shed for four months were given lengthy prison sentences today after it emerged that their victim was beaten, burned and humiliated over a minor debt.Kevin Davies, 29, was found dead by paramedics in the kitchen of the home of David Lehane and Amanda Baggus on September 26 last year.He had been held in a shed bolted from the outside in the garden of the house in Bream, Gloucestershire, between May and September 2006, during which time he was repeatedly assaulted and fed on leftovers and scraps such as potato peelings.Tests revealed there was weed killer in his body and he had extensive bruising covering his body, as well as burn marks that a pathologist said could have been caused by a hot knife. His ribs and larynx were fractured and burns covered 10% of his body.Baggus kept a diary in which she chronicled the punishments they had meted out to their vulnerable victim and scornfully recorded his cries for help.They also filmed him inside the shed, bullying him into saying he was staying there voluntarily and was being treated well, in a disturbing hostage-style video in which he seemed frightened, emaciated and weak.Lehane, 35, Baggus, 26, and their lodger Scott Andrews, 27, had originally been charged with murder, but the charge was dropped after experts were unable to rule out that epilepsy may have contributed to his death. However, it is unlikely that his death had been caused by his medical condition.In May this year, the three defendants pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Lehane and Baggus were each given 10-year sentences by Mr Justice Gray at Bristol crown court, and Andrews was given nine years.The judge said what they had done had been "truly appalling and utterly inhumane".He said of Mr Davies: "Since the death of his father in March 2006, his life is said to have lacked structure. He needed sympathetic treatment, but what you meted out to him over many weeks was the very opposite of that."Ian Pringle, prosecuting, told the court that Mr Davies had been treated like an animal."What emerged from the investigation into Kevin Davies' death was that he had effectively been held captive at the home of the defendants for a period of nearly four months," he said. "That he had been abused for that period of time. He had been assaulted, he had been beaten and he had effectively been kept like a dog in a locked garden shed at night."In short, the last few months of this man's life must have been utterly miserable and inhumane."Mr Davies, who suffered from severe epilepsy, had been described in court as gullible, naive and vulnerable. He had known Lehane and Baggus for some years but had fallen out with them after a car crash in May last year.The court heard that Baggus had blamed Mr Davies after a car overturned, and that this incident kickstarted their systematic torture and abuse. She felt he owed her money and considered this was a good enough reason to keep him at their address while she helped herself to his social security money to pay household bills and debts.In one barely literate diary entry, dated August 5, she wrote: "He was playing up last nite, banging in the shed. So later that night both Scott and Dave hit Prick until quite late, cause Prick made a load of shouting."Patrick Harrington, defending Lehane, said "things had got out of hand" but said it had been "an unsophisticated enterprise". He said Mr Davies was homeless and an alcoholic and was grateful to be allowed to stay in the shed.Detective chief inspector Geoff Brookes, of Gloucestershire police, described the defendants' behaviour as extraordinary and bizarre. "Only they can say exactly what motivated them," he said.In a statement, Mr Davies' family said: "Although nothing can compensate us for Kevin's death, we feel the sentences validate our faith in British justice."Neighbours in the village said they could not believe they had no idea what was happening.On one occasion, a boy kicked a football near to the shed, causing his captors to go berserk. The boy's older brother said: "In a few seconds of him being up there looking in the garden, they were out coming on the estate, shouting and raving, using dreadful language - totally inappropriate - just basically going crazy over someone going near to their garden."The shed has since been replaced by the new tenants of the house.
