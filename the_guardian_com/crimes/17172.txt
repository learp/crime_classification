A woman who murdered her parents for their money with the help of her husband and then buried them in their back garden where they lay undiscovered for 15 years is facing a life sentence.Susan Edwards, 56, and her husband Christopher, 57, were found guilty at Nottingham crown court of murdering Patricia and William Wycherley.The bodies of the Wycherleys were unearthed from the back garden of their home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, last October.Prosecutors at Nottingham crown court claimed the debt-ridden couple committed the murder between 1 and 5 May 1998.Susan Edwards claimed she was provoked into shooting her mother while staying with her parents over a bank holiday after her mother shot her father.She claimed she returned the following weekend with her husband, where she confessed to what had happened and he helped her to bury the bodies.The couple said they continued to claim the dead pair's benefits and pensions to cover up the shootings.The defendants, who were arrested last October, admitted obstructing the coroner in the execution of his duty and the theft of a Halifax credit balance.Susan Edwards also admitted her mother's manslaughter, but both denied murder.As the jury of eight women and four men delivered its unanimous verdicts, neither gave any reaction.
