Detectives in Sheffield are investigating the "planned and carefully executed" murder of a suspected gangland figure who was shot at the wheel of his expensive car.Lester Divers, 32, was killed shortly after saying goodbye to his girlfriend at his terraced home in Freedom Road, Walkley. Neighbours were awoken by the Lexus's horn blaring continually after Divers slumped forward on to the wheel. He is thought to have died instantly from a single shot to the head fired at close range. Police are examining a burned-out Ford Escort found shortly after the shooting, a quarter of a mile away. Det Supt Kevin Hardy said that several neighbours had heard the shot but initially mistook it for a firework. Divers was known to police but officers are keeping an open mind on alleged drug-dealing or revenge motives. A separate investigation was launched in Sheffield at the same time, after a young adult's jawbone was found on moorland near the city. A body was discovered in a ditch nearby. South Yorkshire police said that the death was being treated as recent and suspicious. A post mortem will be carried out today.
