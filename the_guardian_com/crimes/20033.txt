A 93-year-old woman found severely injured in her own home four weeks ago following an apparently savage beating has died in hospital, police said.Emma Winnall, from Moseley, Birmingham, died in the early hours of Tuesday from complications connected to her injuries, which included a fractured skull and broken arm, West Midlands police said.Shortly after the attack, on the night of 30 April and 1 May, police released a photograph of Winnall in her hospital bed, showing the shocking extent of the beating.The inquiry has become a murder hunt. While a 56-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man were arrested almost two weeks ago and are due to answer bail in July, the officer overseeing the investigation said it remained "very much live".Superintendent Richard Baker, head of major crime for West Midlands police, said the attack had been "traumatic and cowardly". He added: "Clearly, this has now become a murder inquiry. But given the extent of Emma's injuries, combined with her age and vulnerability, this investigation has always been treated with the same level of seriousness as a murder investigation."Detectives were able to speak to Winnall twice in the days after the attack. Other lines of investigation included local CCTV footage, house-to-house inquiries, possible forensic evidence results and the results of a postmortem investigation, due to take place on Wednesday, Baker said.He said: "I really do firmly believe that the key to solving this particular crime lies within the community," saying that the area where Winnall lived was usually very quiet, meaning anything at all which seemed out of the ordinary could be significant.Baker said: "This was a shocking attack on a defenceless, elderly woman as she slept in her own bed. No one capable of carrying out such a despicable attack deserves protecting. I'm asking people to look into their consciences and if they have any suspicions about who may be responsible to contact police."We have a team of detectives working on the case and we are determined to catch whoever is responsible. This case has touched communities across the West Midlands and beyond with countless offers of support, plus gifts and flowers, being made to both Emma and her family."A week after the attack, Winnall's daughter and son made a public appeal for information. The daughter, Joyce Blencoe, said: "It's broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum in hospital manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came."
