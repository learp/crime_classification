The police should use stop and search powers more often in order to tackle street crime and gun offences, a prominent figure in the black community said yesterday. But the call by Mike Best, editor of The Voice magazine, for a resumption of a tactic condemned as racist was criticised by police and black groups. Speaking on BBC television yesterday, Mr Best said he was concerned about the number of black youths killed in shootings. The parents of many of those who died, he said, believed their sons would still be alive if they had been stopped and searched. "Most people would prefer not to be stopped and searched, but increasing crime is warranting that and the majority of people who have nothing to hide won't mind very much," he said. Research shows that random stop and search was five times more likely to be used against black people. The police had moved away from "unprofessional" standards and, he said, the tactic would now be used more sensitively. Operation Trident, Scotland Yard's campaign to combat the growth of drugs related shootings within the black community, recovered round 600 firearms in London last year. Responding to the call on the same BBC programme, Commander Bob Quick, who runs Operation Trident, said: "Indiscriminate stop and search is not necessarily effective. [It] needs to be intelligence led." The National Black Police Association's president, Ravi Chand, said: "We accept the rising gun crime problem in the cities but feel stop and search is not the panacea." The Police Federation, however, welcomed Mr Best's call, saying that stop and search was the best way to recover hidden weapons.
