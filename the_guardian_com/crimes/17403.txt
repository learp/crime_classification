A rare-breed dog that was strangled and dumped in a canal has become the subject of the first canine killing to feature on the BBC programme Crimewatch. Two-year-old Troya, a Spanish presa canario, was stolen from her kennel in Stockport on Christmas Eve and her body was discovered more than three weeks later floating in a canal in nearby Romiley. She had been hanged with a length of washing line and was found with a supermarket carrier bag secured over her head with curtain wire. Her death is being investigated by both Greater Manchester police and the RSPCA, with more than £2,000 being offered to help find her killer. A social media campaign which lobbied Crimewatch’s spin-off show, Crimewatch Roadshow, led to the programme launching the appeal on Friday, complete with a reconstruction of the theft. The dog’s owner, Anthony Taylor, 34, described Troya as his best friend. He told Crimewatch: “Everybody loved Troya, everybody. She was part of the family.” The GMP officer Joseph Torkington told the programme the killing was horrific. Troya was taken in the early hours of 24 December 2015 from her kennel behind Taylor’s home. She was found floating in the canal on 18 January, prompting the creation of a Facebook page dedicated to investigating the death. The page has more than 13,000 supporters. Wellwishers raised money for a private autopsy that revealed the dog had been hanged or strangled. The animal campaigner Chops Owen said it was the first time Crimewatch had featured a dog that had been deliberately killed.
