Delroy Grant committed at least 146 crimes – including 23 sexual offences – after police missed at least three chances to catch him, it has been revealed.The 53-year-old, dubbed the "night stalker", is one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders and is likely to spend the rest of his life in jail for carrying out what is feared to be more than 500 attacks on elderly people.Senior police were forced to apologise on Thursday for the blunder that ruled him out of their inquiry in 1999, leaving the father of seven free to continue his campaign of terror for another decade, during which time he raped three elderly women and sexually assaulted 20 more pensioners.Police also admitted to two other possible missed chances over the years that might have led to his arrest.Detectives have linked 203 attacks to Grant, who targeted victims as old as 89, including at least 10 men.They fear, however, that the former minicab driver could have committed hundreds more burglaries, rapes and sexual assaults during his 17-year campaign of terror across south London between 1992 and 2009.Masked, gloved and dressed in black, Grant would break into the homes of pensioners living alone after dark. Cutting phone lines and removing lightbulbs, he woke his victims by placing a gloved hand over their mouth or dazzling them with a torch.Such was the terror and shame of the "humiliating and degrading sexual assaults", many of Grant's victims – the youngest of whom was 68 years old – never told the police what had happened to them.Other victims were so terrified and ashamed they did not even tell their closest relatives, instead spending their final years terrified that their homes would be broken into and they would be attacked again.Some of the elderly victims who found the courage to go to the police have since died of natural causes. They never saw their rapist brought to justice.A jury at Woolwich crown court, who had been deliberating for eight hours and 29 minutes, on Thursday reached a majority verdict of 10 to two on all 29 counts against Grant, of Brockley, south-east London.He was convicted of three rapes, one attempted rape, six indecent assaults, one sexual assault, 16 burglaries and two attempted burglaries after a three-week trial..Judge Peter Rook QC told Grant that his convictions were "of the utmost gravity".He said: "You should appreciate the sentence you receive will be what is called an indeterminate sentence."The family of at least one of the pensioners attacked by Grant is expected to read out a victim impact statement in court on Friday. Rook is expected to sentence Grant after the relatives have been heard.After the verdict, Commander Simon Foy, head of the Metropolitan police's homicide and serious crime command, called Grant "a perverted, callous and violent individual".He apologised for the police's early failures to catch Grant – failures, he admitted, that "led to [Grant's] continued offending for so long afterwards".He added: "We are deeply sorry for the harm suffered by all those other victims and for our failure to bring Grant to justice earlier."In 1998, two rapes carried out by Grant were linked by Scotland Yard. The investigation became their biggest-ever search for a serial rapist. Despite spending tens of millions of pounds, however, Grant was only arrested by luck in November 2009, after being spotted running from a house he had been attempting to break into.The first police error came in 1999, when officers were given Grant's name but went to the wrong address and took DNA from a different man with the same name.Officers missed a second chance to catch Grant after his car was reported near one of the crime scenes. They are understood to have visited Grant's house but only spoke to his wife, who has MS and uses a wheelchair, and for whom Grant was a full-time carer.The third blunder was in 2001, after a Crimewatch appeal saw Grant's name given to the police. The lead, however, was taken no further because his name was accompanied on the police database by a "code one" DNA elimination notice.A huge retrospective inquiry into the failures of the Met investigation will now be launched. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) criticised the "basic policing errors" and "simple misunderstandings" that undermined the Met's investigation.Deborah Glass, IPCC commissioner for London, said confusion over a suspect and a poor response to a burglary led to the failure to arrest Grant. "It is clear that a simple misunderstanding had horrific consequences," said Glass. "Police missed the opportunity because confusion led to the wrong man's DNA being compared."Grant was linked by DNA to 12 of the 18 crimes that made up the 29-count trial indictment, but has refused to admit to what he had done. His refusal to admit to this crimes had, said Foy, hindered efforts to trace the extent of his crimes.Instead, Grant tried to blame his son, Delroy Junior, then accused his first wife, Janet Watson, 53, of trying to frame him by collecting his body fluids during their four-year marriage between 1975 and 1979 and arranging for an accomplice to plant them at the scenes of the burglaries.It was a defence branded as "utter, utter rubbish" and "pure fiction and fantasy" by Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting.Laidlaw said the burglaries "really [are] the stuff of nightmares and the type of case that keeps us all awake at night".The attacks started in October 1992 when Grant burgled and raped an 89-year-old woman in Shirley, Croydon.A six-year gap followed before he indecently assaulted and tried to rape an 81-year-old woman in Warlingham, Surrey, in September 1998. There was a spate of six attacks in 1999, between June and August, including the rape of an 88-year-old woman in Orpington, Kent, and the rape of an 82-year-old in Addiscombe, Surrey.In October 2002 Grant indecently assaulted a 77-year-old during another burglary in Shirley, before committing four further burglaries between 2003 and 2009.On 13 August 2009 he sexually assaulted a 77-year-old man as he burgled his home in Thornton Heath and carried out another two burglaries in October, before being caught fleeing from the scene of an attempted break-in in Shirley.
