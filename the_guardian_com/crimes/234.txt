A gang of masked and hooded youths, who resembled a "pack of wild animals", unleashed dogs on a 16-year-old boy before stabbing him to death, a court heard today.Seyi Ogunyemi died in a gang attack in Larkhall Park, south London, after being stabbed six times in April last year, the Old Bailey was told.His friend, then 17, was also attacked when the pair were confronted by up to a dozen youths with two dogs, jurors heard.His friend received apparent dog bites and was stabbed nine times, but survived the attack "by pure good fortune". The case was "unusual if not unique" because dogs had been deployed as "weapons" in the initial stages of the attack, said Brian Altman QC, prosecuting."At the time of the attack both dogs were unleashed, and chased and then brought down and savaged their victims, giving their human masters an advantage, enabling them then to access their victims in order to stab them with knives," he told the court.Brothers Chrisdian Johnson, 22, and Shane Johnson, 20, and 18-year-old Darcy Menezes were among the pack.Chrisdian Johnson owned one of the two dogs used, Altman said, an adult male Staffordshire bull terrier-bull mastiff cross named Tyson, "not unsuitably".The other, an adult female brindle Staffordshire terrier called Mia, belonged to Menezes.The gang of around 12 attackers, alleged to be from the Otre gang, otherwise called the Otra or G-Street gang, were "patrolling" their "home turf" of the Larkhill Park Estate, off Wandsworth Road in south London at around 7pm on April 27 last year, said Altman.According to witnesses the males, aged between 15-20, were wearing dark hooded tops, with the lower halves of their faces covered. They seemed to be "on a mission" or "having a common purpose", jurors were told.Having spotted a group of six youths who they believed to belong to the rival ABM gang, from the nearby Stockwell gardens estate, they unleashed their dogs, with "devastating effects", said Altman. "It was described by one shocked observer as "vicious" and as mirroring the behaviour of a pack of wild animals," he said.Ogunyemi was brought down by the gangs' dogs before being stabbed six times in Larkhill Park. Two blows fatally pierced his aorta, and despite having emergency surgery he died at the scene. Two other men were stabbed in the attack.Chrisdian Johnson, 22, and his brother Shane Johnson, 20, both of south Lambeth, south London, along with Menezes, 18, of Clapham, south London, each deny murder and attempted murder. The trial continues.
