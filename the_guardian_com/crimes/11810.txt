Recruitment of "more Muslim police officers" (Report, June 27) will do little to increase understanding and sensitivity towards Muslim communities. It is seven years since the Stephen Lawrence inquiry concluded that extra numbers alone leads to more desk clerks and constables, but no officers in positions to influence attitudes.The home secretary needs to set realistic targets for recruitment, retention and promotion of officers who identify as Muslims. There are 30,000-plus police officers in London's Metropolitan Police. The number who define themselves as Muslim is about 300. Muslims in London are some 7% of the population. To reflect that 7% the Met should be deploying nearly 3,000 Muslim officers.The home secretary can also give support to the Associations of Muslim Police Officers in the Met, and in the Greater Manchester Police, to build on the successful model of black police associations.
