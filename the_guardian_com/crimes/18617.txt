More 12 to 14-year-olds would be locked up under government plans to reform the youth justice system, claims a children's charity.Proposals published by the Home Office to accompany the children's green paper would allow the courts to impose custodial sentences on all children in that age group who commit serious crimes - including serial burglary and actual bodily harm - and not just persistent offenders as at present.The document, Youth Justice - the Next Steps, states that a child aged 12-14 could be locked up for up to a year.Sharon Moore, policy manager for the Children's Society, said the proposals to make it easier to lock up 12 to 14-year olds contradicted the green paper's pledge that every child matters.She said: "This plan appears to ignore that between 1998 and 2002, 12 boys aged 16-17 killed themselves while in custody."The Home Office denied that the proposal would increase the number of children in custody.A spokesman said: "The proposals would amalgamate the existing detention and training order (DTO) and the intensive supervision and surveillance order into a new intensive supervision or detention order (ISDO)."This new order will not include the persistence criteria in the DTO but the judge will have discretion to decide whether a custodial or community based sentence is more appropriate.He added that the Home Office would expect that custodial sentences would usually be handed down to repeat offenders of serious crimes.But he was unable to specify what crimes would be considered serious with regards to the ISDO.Ms Moore did welcome the admission in the document that more could be done to address serious welfare concerns in the youth justice system and the commitment to the use of bail for young offenders.But she criticised the narrowness of the Home Office's proposals given the continued criticism by the United Nations of England's youth justice system. She said: "The government has restated its commitment to this country having one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in Europe - at 10 - and a system that still sends too many children to jail. "By doing this it has missed a real opportunity to really show that all children matter."
