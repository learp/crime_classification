The package of new measures on managing known sex offenders unveiled by John Reid, the departing home secretary, this morning falls far short of the "historic victory" that the News of the World claimed for its "Sarah's Law" campaign in April during this year's local elections.Then Labour sources floated the idea that parents would be told how many sex offenders live in their neighbourhood or on popular routes to schools.The News of the World celebrated the decision, while children's charities and the police were horrified at the prospect of renewed vigilante attacks and sex offenders going underground.The result is the cautious package detailed to MPs today in which there are only really two new elements.The first is that lone parents are to get a legal right to ask if a new boyfriend or partner is a paedophile.This will put into law the kind of "best practice" that already exists whereby the police and probation service will warn a variety of people, including parents, headteachers, and employers, if they think a convicted sex offender poses a risk.The change will mean that in law if a single mother asks about her suspicions about a new partner the police and probation will be legally bound to consider disclosing his criminal background, if he has one and still poses a risk.It comes with safeguards. Anyone falsely posing as a girlfriend or partner or misusing the information to fuel vigilantism or harassment could themselves face police action, including prosecution for incitement.The police and children's charities seemed satisfied yesterday that these stringent safeguards will ensure that the new package is not a recipe for tabloid-fuelled vigilantism that has seen paediatricians attacked and sex offenders hounded.This leads to the second major change announced today. The 30,000 sex offenders on the national register, of which only several hundred are the "critical few" predatory peadophiles, will all have to tell the police in future when they form a relationship with a woman with children.Perhaps the most valuable statement made by Dr Reid today was his judgment that Megan's Law, as the publication of paedophiles names and addresses on websites is described in the United States, has been a failure.Justice minister Gerry Sutcliffe, sent to the United States to look at the idea, said that it had driven sex offenders underground to avoid identification.It would appear that government ministers, not for the first time, having courted the tabloid press during an election campaign over one of the most emotive offences in the criminal calendar, have avoided assuaging their populist appetites, when it actually comes to the detail of making policy.
