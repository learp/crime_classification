The owner of Alton Towers is facing a multimillion-pound fine after it admitted breaking health and safety laws over the rollercoaster crash that seriously injured five passengers.Two people had their legs amputated after the collision on the Smiler ride in June last year, while three others suffered life-changing injuries.The five most seriously injured victims appeared in court in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, on Friday morning as the theme park’s owner, Merlin Entertainments, pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules.District judge John McGarva said the firm faces a “very large fine” when it next appears at Stafford crown court on 20 May, with the figure possibly reaching seven figures.The guilty plea is believed to make Alton Towers the first major UK theme park whose owners have admitted a criminal breach of health and safety laws.Joe Pugh, 19, and his girlfriend Leah Washington, 18, who both suffered serious leg injuries in the crash on 2 June last year, stood shoulder-to-shoulder outside North Staffordshire justice centre as a lawyer read a statement on behalf of the victims.

He added: “Given that such serious injuries could be sustained on a fun day out, it is hardly surprising that a criminal offence was committed. However, it is comforting for the families that a plea of guilty has been entered rather than the victims having to endure a drawn-out trial.“Today is not seen as a victory; the families are not motivated by retribution, but inevitably this guilty plea will be a milestone along the way to psychological rehabilitation. Regrettably the physical recovery will be a lifelong process.”A total of 16 people were injured when their carriage collided with an empty carriage on a low section of the ride, which can reach speeds of up to 50mph. The five seriously injured were Washington, 18, and Pugh, 19, from Barnsley; Vicky Balch, 21, and Daniel Thorpe, 28, from Buxton in Derbyshire; and Chandaben Chauhan, 49, from Wednesbury, West Midlands.Passengers were trapped more than seven metres (20ft) from the ground at an angle of about 45 degrees before eventually being freed by emergency workers.The Smiler reopened in March, nine months after the crash, prompting Balch to accuse the theme park owner of putting money before safety.After an internal investigation, Merlin Entertainments said in November that the crash was a result of human error because an operator decided to override a safety system.

In one photograph, the front bumper of the carriage that carried the passengers can be seen almost completely caved in towards the front row of seats.Bernard Thoroughgood, counsel for the HSE, which brought the prosecution, told the court that the flagship rollercoaster “was not as safe as it should have been”. He said the ride was “mechanically sound” but there was no proper procedure in place for staff in the event of an error. Thoroughgood said the victims had submitted impact statements to the court in with they said their pain was “indescribable” and many said “my life and my family’s life has been turned upside down”.Outside court, Neil Craig, head of operations for HSE in the Midlands, said: “Those injured on 2 June last year had every right to expect a carefree and fun day out. The incident was profoundly distressing for everyone involved, both physically and mentally. It left some with life-changing injuries. We hope this first milestone will help those affected to continue their recovery from this tragic incident.”Merlin – which also owns Legoland, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye – said it overcame a fall in revenues at its theme parks to post an annual pre-tax profit rise of 0.3% to £250m in the year to 26 December.It said Alton Towers had a significant fall in visitor numbers after the accident, which resulted in the 200-hectare (500-acre) theme park in Staffordshire being shut down for four days.
