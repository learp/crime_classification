Detectives investigating the attempted murder of a 39-year-old woman in Clissold Park, north London, today arrested a 15-year-old boy for the second time, Scotland Yard said.The woman, who has not been identified, was stabbed while jogging in the park on December 5 2003. Her life was saved by a passing doctor, who stemmed the flow of blood before emergency services arrived. The boy was held on December 15 last year in connection with the Clissold Park stabbing and the murder of the American artist Margaret Muller, who died after a knife attack in another, east London park.Following the first arrest, the teenager, from Stoke Newington, was given police bail, which was later cancelled. He was arrested again today in connection with the Clissold Park stabbing and was being questioned at a north London police station, police said.Ms Muller, who was 27, was also stabbed while jogging, in Victoria Park, east London.Detective chief superintendent Jon Shatford, who is heading the investigation, warned women in the area to be vigilant after noting similarities between the two attacks."We are going to work on the basis that the man responsible for this attack is the same man responsible for the attack on Margaret Muller," he said after the second attack."We will continue on that basis until we prove otherwise."When the teenager was arrested for the first time last month, a 24-year-old man was also held in connection with both stabbings and was later released on police bail. The two suspects are not linked, police said.Both had been due to answer police bail on January 12 but were told they were not required to do so. Police know of a further eight people in the park at the time of the attack. They have released images of the victim's clothing, hoping it will prompt the memories of passers-by and encourage them to contact police.
