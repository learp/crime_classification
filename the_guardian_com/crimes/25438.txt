Five police officers, who allegedly stood by chatting while a prisoner choked to death, are to face charges of manslaughter through gross negligence.The sergeant and four constables from the Humberside force are already due to go on trial next month accused of misconduct in a public office, but the more serious charge is now added to the indictment. The five denied the misconduct charges last year at a preliminary hearing in Hull, where former paratrooper Christopher Alder, 37, died in the central Queen's Gardens police station in April 1998. The new charges follow an application by the crown prosecution service to Teesside crown court, where the trial is expected to start on April 10. After two days of legal argument, Mr Justice Roderick Evans agreed that charges of manslaughter by gross negligence should be made. He said he was satisfied that it would be in the public interest to test the more serious accusation. The accused are custody sergeant John Dunn, 40, and constables Matthew Barr, 38, Neil Blakey, 42, Nigel Dawson, 39, and Mark Etherington, 36. All are from Hull and on bail. Alder, who was a father of two, won a medal for service in Northern Ireland before he left the army to start a course in computer studies. A memorial for him, which was held this week in Hull to mark the fourth anniversary of his death, was addressed by his sister, Janet Alder.
