The gangland crime boss Terry Adams faces financial ruin after being handed a bill yesterday for £4.7m for his legal costs.Adams, who is serving a seven-year sentence for laundering £1m, will have to sell his homes in north London and Cyprus, his yacht and his cars if he is to have any hope of paying the costs.Police sources said yesterday it was not known where the crime boss's estimated £11m criminal fortune has been hidden. "There is a lot of fear out there - people may be holding some of the money but they are too frightened to come forward."During four years of legal wrangling in the criminal courts, the 52-year-old godfather insisted that thousands of hours of MI5 surveillance tapes recorded at his home be transcribed at a cost of £2m. He was represented by three legal teams at various times, having sacked the first two sets of barristers in the months and years after his arrest in April 2003.Adams, who led the notorious north London crime syndicate the Adams family, is already facing a bill of £750,000 in compensation and has been ordered to pay £50,000 towards the prosecution costs of his trial. He pleaded guilty to one charge of money laundering in March after a plea bargain which resulted in all other charges against him being dropped and his wife, Ruth, walking free.The Legal Services Commission calculated the costs of his defence as £4.7m and said yesterday it would be reclaiming the full amount in order that the public would not have to pay a penny towards the costs. A court will decide on Monday whether Adams will have to report details of his assets to the authorities under a financial reporting order for the next 15 years.
