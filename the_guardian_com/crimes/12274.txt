A teenager thought to be Britain's youngest contract killer has been jailed for life for shooting a young mother dead for just £200.Santre Sanchez Gayle, 16, was told he must serve at least 20 years behind bars for the murder of Gulistan Subasi, 26, in March last year. He was just 15 when he shot Subasi with a sawn-off shotgun in Hackney, east London.CCTV footage showed him resting the gun on the front gate of the flat where she was staying and blasting her in the chest while she was on the doorstep.Gayle, known by his gang name Riot and related to two other convicted killers, was convicted of murder after boasting of the crime to another youth.The teenager, of Kensal Rise, north-west London, was sentenced at the Old Bailey alongside Izak Billy, 22, who recruited him for the hit. Billy, of Willesden, north London, was also found guilty of murder, and given a life sentence with a minimum term of 22 years.Subasi's former partner Serdar Ozbek, 28, was accused of ordering the shooting but was cleared of the crime, along with four other defendants.Judge Stephen Kramer told Billy and Gayle: "It was an efficient, ruthless and calculated execution." The judge told Gayle that his "youth and immaturity" were factors in the crime.But he added: "Anyone seeing the short but telling CCTV clip of the shooting cannot but be struck by the chillingly deliberate and cold-blooded way in which you went about your business."The judge described Gayle as a low-level cannabis dealer who expected to be paid £2,000 for the murder but was only paid £200. "You were an easily led, immature youngster, who, if money was involved, was capable of violence out of loyalty, having cynically been used by others. You shot and killed Gulistan for money, and at the bidding of an older man who you were trying to impress."The judge said it was not possible to say who was behind the killing or who recruited Billy to find someone to carry it out. Subasi had been staying with her mother and was about to celebrate the birthday of her young child.The judge told her killers: "You have deprived a mother of a much-loved daughter and a son of his mother." He told Billy: "You took advantage of your younger friend, Gayle. You knew he would do as he did at your bidding for money."
