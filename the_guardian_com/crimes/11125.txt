The City fraud squad is boosting by a third the number of police who will work on complex cases with the Serious Fraud Office. The police force will start recruiting 26 more officers next month, and will work more closely with the SFO on serious fraud cases across the south-east. The initiative will target fraud by organised criminals in the region. "We are a magnet for organised criminals who come from all over the world to attack the City," said Chief Superintendent Ken Farrow, head of the City's fraud squad. The SFO, which is staffed by specialised lawyers and accountants, has long complained that it cannot get the police support it needs for its cases. Many forces outside of the City have little financial crime expertise. Robert Wardle, director of the SFO, said that there had been a £40m to £70m fraud recently where they could not get any police aid at all. "Economic crime requires skills, knowledge and experience that some forces don't have, the City of London has it in abundance," he said. The Home Office is providing £1m a year for the extra officers. The SFO and the police had wanted more money to house them in the same building, but failed to get government backing. The Corporation of London is also putting in an extra £1m a year. The police are hoping to get "early successes" in cases and win more government funds. The police will encourage the regional police forces outside of the south-east to merge their fraud squads. The SFO is also getting more funds, with an expected increase to £35.4m in two years' time from this year's budget of £23.4m.
