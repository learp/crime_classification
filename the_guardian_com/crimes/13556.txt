Police community support officers from today have the power to detain suspects who refuse to provide their names and addresses, the Home Office minister Hazel Blears announced last night.Home Office research published yesterday shows the public has a high level of satisfaction with the work of community support officers but there is confusion over whether they are uniformed constables. The interim study found the 4,000 community support officers spend the majority of their time on high-visibility duties, and in nine forces where they are on patrol the public feels safer on the streets. It also concludes that when overall crime rates fell in city centre beats where community support officers had been introduced there was evidence of it being displaced to other areas. Ms Blears said the CSOs, with the record number of police officers, are a key part of the government's strategy to tackle crime. "Giving them the power to detain suspects will make them even more effective in helping to build safe communities. The results of the evaluation show that CSOs are valued by the public and police officers." The power of community support officers to detain people who refuse to give their names and addresses was tested in six police forces and used in 452 incidents since January 2003. The report of the pilot schemes said there was "no indication of there being a significant risk to either the CSO or the detainee as a consequence of the exercise of the power to detain". But Jan Berry, chairman of the Police Federation, said she was strongly opposed to more powers being given to CSOs. "They are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the police service and therefore should not be placed in a potentially confrontational situations, which detaining someone clearly is."They did not have the appropriate experience, the right training or adequate safety equipment to deal with detention, which placed the wellbeing of the public, the police and themselves at risk.
