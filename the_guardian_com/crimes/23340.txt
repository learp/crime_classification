The national DNA database contains the profiles of almost 40,000 innocent children, the Home Office said today.Junior minister Meg Hillier said the profiles of about 39,095 10- to 17-year-olds who "had not been convicted, cautioned, received a final warning/reprimand and had no charge pending against them" were on the database.Hillier said figures obtained from the national DNA database and the police national computer in April showed they contained DNA profiles of 303,393 under-18s. "Of those, 264,297 (87.1%) had a conviction, caution, reprimand or had received a final warning," she said.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, said it was wrong to store the DNA of innocent people and argued there were serious shortcomings when it came to convicted criminals."These startling figures show that the government is building a national DNA database by stealth," he said."There can be no excuse for storing the DNA of innocent adults, let alone children, who are entirely blameless."This is an intrusive policy that gives far too much sensitive information to the state, when we know that ministers cannot be trusted with its security."The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, said: "This is yet more evidence that the DNA database is totally arbitrary with tens of thousands of innocent kids on it but not every offender in our prisons."We need to have a parliamentary debate on the issue and put this database on to a statutory basis."Last month, a government-appointed advisory body said there should be a more straightforward system for innocent people to have their samples removed from the database.
