The gunfight at the Co Durham corral is to go to local magistrates after an exchange of fire which would have startled Wyatt Earp.Instead of long-barrelled revolvers, Sunday's duel involved a novelty water gun and police-issue CS gas spray. The August heatwave exchange took place as Gary Parker, 26, pottered home from his mother's paddling-pool birthday party at the Bonny Moor Hen pub, which she and his father run, in Stan hope. Still toting the air-powered water gun, which sends out a sustained and powerful jet, Mr Parker and friends "carried on having our water fight" in Stanhope's market square, he said yesterday. A number of vehicles got splashed - including a police car which had its driver's window down. A spokesman for Durham police said: "The police officer was hit in the face at close range by a jet from a pressurised water pistol. He was momentarily blinded and for a brief period had difficulty controlling his vehicle." The consequences could have been serious, the spokesman said, and the subsequent use of CS spray was necessary. Mr Parker, who tried a range of water weapons at the 47th birthday party, said the shot had been accidental. "I can't believe it went as far as it did. Fair enough if he had had a word with me, but to spray me with CS gas was out of order." Magistrates in Bishop Auckland will decide next week whether Mr Parker committed a public order offence, resisted arrest, and caused danger to a road user.
