A married railway worker was last night charged in connection with a string of sex attacks on girls and women across the south-east of England.Antoni Imiela, 48, from Appledore, Kent, was charged with nine offences of rape, Detective Superintendent Mark Warwick, of Thames Valley police, the acting head of Operation Orb, confirmed. "This is a complex investigation which has involved five police forces working together in close cooperation. The cooperation and close working continues," he said. The attacker has struck against women and girls aged from 10 to 52 across London, Kent, Berkshire, Surrey and Hertfordshire in the past year. More than 100 officers from five forces were involved in Operation Orb, the biggest manhunt since that for the Yorkshire Ripper. Mr Imiela was arrested in his car at a police roadblock on the M20 near Ashford on Monday night, and had been held for questioning at Folkestone police station. He was charged by Kent police 72 hours later, and is due to appear before Canterbury magistrates this morning. The first of the charges relates to the rape of a 10-year-old girl in Ashford, Kent, on November 15 2001. The other charges relate to rapes this year, four of which took place in July: of a 12-year-old girl in Bracknell, Berkshire; a 30-year-old woman in Earlswood, Surrey; a 26-year-old woman on Putney common, south-west London; and an 18-year-old woman in Woking, Surrey. There are charges relating to two rapes in the following month: of a 52-year-old woman on Wimbledon common, south-west London, on August 6, and a 26-year-old woman in Epsom, Surrey, on August 7. The other two charges concern the rapes of a 13-year-old girl near Woking on September 6, and a 14-year-old girl in Stevenage, Hertforshire, on October 25.
