Knife crime is "extremely rare" in rural areas, the police said today, after new figures showed that 65% of knife crime is confined to five big cities in England.In the first detailed break down of the problem, Police recorded 20,985 offences involving knives last year in England.The statistics included a force-by-force breakdown, which showed that more than 65% of these crimes were confined to five cities and their surroundings: Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and London.In the capital alone there were 7,428 recorded instances of knife crimes. The second highest figure was recorded in the West Midlands with 2,303 incidents. Third was Greater Manchester with 2,294.By contrast recorded knife crime in predominantly rural areas was typically low - 100s or fewer. In Dorset there were just 47 instances of knife crime last year.Staffordshire police, which recorded 219 offences, said knife crime was "extremely rare" in the county.A spokesman said: "That's only four offences a week across an entire county covering 1,048 square miles with a population of more than one million people."He said Staffordshire neighbourhoods do not suffer from the type of gang culture existing in some inner city areas, but police are not complacent.Hampshire police said its 388 incidents of knife crime made up 18% of the total number of attempted murders, woundings and robberies in the county.A spokesman said that this was one of the lowest percentages in the country.Inspector Alistair Nichols said: "The figures demonstrate that we do not have a significant knife crime culture in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight."However, when violence involving knives does occur, it can have a huge and devastating impact on everyone's lives."That's why we're working hard to get knives and other offensive weapons off our streets, by increasing awareness and encouraging communities to provide us with information about those who do carry knives, so we can take appropriate steps before someone is seriously injured."
