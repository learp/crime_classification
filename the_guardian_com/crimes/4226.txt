Some of Britain's best known construction firms co-operated with a secret "blacklist" that prevented thousands of workers from getting jobs, a court heard .More than 40 firms were involved in a database of 3,213 construction workers that was used to vet potential employees, Knutsford crown court was told.Private investigator Ian Kerr, who administered the list on behalf of The Consulting Association – described in court as a construction trade association – was fined £5,000 for breaching the Data Protection Act.Knowledge of the blacklist emerged in March when offices of the Consulting Association, in Droitwich, west Midlands, were raided by the Information Commissioner's Office.Kerr, 66, of Stoke Heath, Worcestershire, pleaded guilty to a breach of the Data Protection Act in May.The firms allegedly paid Kerr to check his files for details of each worker's trade union activities and conduct at work. The files were said to contain warnings about workers such as "ex-shop steward, definite problems, no go", and "poor time-keeper, will cause trouble, strong trade union".John Wyn Williams, prosecuting for the ICO, told today's hearing: "The Consulting Association was funded by a number of leading construction companies throughout the country."It would collate and provide information to construction companies in relation to individuals seeking employment in that industry."Wyn Williams said the database included names, dates of birth and national insurance numbers."It also included conduct which may impact on an individual's chances for further employment. This information was to be used covertly. Individuals on the database were not aware of it and could not challenge the accuracy of the information."Over 40 subscriber companies from the construction industry used Mr Kerr's service."The ICO said it believes Kerr ran the blacklist for up to 15 years.It has named around 40 companies which subscribed to the database, including Amec Construction, Balfour Beatty and Morgan Est.Wyn Williams said the association's accounts showed that between 2004 and March 2009, when it ceased trading, around £478,000 was paid to the organisation by various firms.Jamie Strong, defending, said Kerr was one of four employees of the Consulting Association earning £48,000 a year at the time of the ICO raid.He said most of the information on the blacklist was provided by the construction firms to share with other companies in the industry. He described Kerr as the "central point of contact" and said: "Mr Kerr facilitated the exchange of information."Judge Stephen Clarke said: "The nature of the list was to provide to major construction companies a list of people effectively for them to avoid employing. The list may or may not have been accurate. There was no way for you to find out if you were on such a list."Angry former construction workers, sitting in the public gallery, jeered Kerr as the sentence was passed.The ICO alleged that construction firms subscribed to Kerr's system for a £3,000 annual fee. Companies could add information to the system and pay £2.20 for details held on individuals. Invoices to construction firms for up to £7,500 were seized during the raid.The entries contained information such as names, dates of birth, national insurance numbers, locations and trades alphabetically listed on pages which had been processed on electronic media.
