The London mayor, Boris Johnson, forced to return from holiday, reportedly in North America, visited Clapham Junction, the scene of some of the worst London rioting, on Tuesday.Johnson faced severe criticism from local residents, who complained that they had not had enough protection from police.When asked by one angry resident why he had not come home from his holiday earlier, the mayor replied: "I came as fast as I could."Straining to make his voice heard over the heckling, he thanked everybody who had come to clear up. "That is the real spirit of London," he said, before telling those who owned a shop or business in the area "how very sorry I am for the loss and damage you have suffered".But the local residents who had gathered refused to be placated by his words, shouting: "What happened?" and: "Where were the police?"Shouting above them, Johnson tried to continue with his set speech, saying: "I also want to say to the people who have been involved in instigating these riots, those who have been robbing and stealing, that they will be caught, they will be apprehended and they will face punishments that they will bitterly regret."But the heckling continued. "I know there are questions about the police response and about police numbers," the mayor shouted over the crowd. "I understand that, and we are certainly going to be dealing with those."A woman interrupted, saying: "You talk about robust policing. What does that actually mean?""Tonight, we are going to have huge numbers of police on the streets," Johnson replied."But where were they?" shouted another woman. "By 5pm, we knew they were going to hit. I was in my salon when a brick came through the window, and no one was there to defend me."Johnson said: "I know, I know, I understand â€“ that is why we are putting many more police on the street."It's time that people who are engaged in looting and violence stopped hearing economic and social justifications."Further down the street, he received a warmer response from up to 300 residents brandishing brooms and waiting for police to finish forensic examinations and open up the road for cleaning.They cheered as him as he thanked everybody "for coming out today to help clear up the mess of last night".
