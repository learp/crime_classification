A widower shot dead by a police marksman after his colleague's baton gun twice failed to fire was lawfully killed, an inquest jury ruled yesterday. Martial arts enthusiast Philip Prout, 53, was only yards from the officers with a samurai sword raised above his head when the fatal shot was fired.He had earlier threatened to "top" his sister after spending the afternoon of last year's May 3 bank holiday drinking beer and vodka, the six-week hearing in Plymouth, Devon, was told.Police had called at Mr Prout's home in Lewannick, Cornwall, after his sister dialled 999 and said that he had threatened to "top" her after an argument. She said he had "at least a gun and a machete" in his house.Mr Prout went to bed at about 10.15pm. But marksmen surrounded the house soon after midnight. A police negotiator made contact with Mr Prout several times, but he said he had done nothing wrong and would only come out armed.In the early hours of May 4, Mr Prout emerged from the home brandishing the sword over his head. It was then that he was shot. He died later at Derriford hospital in Plymouth. A search of his house after the shooting uncovered no firearms.
