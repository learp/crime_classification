Police have arrested two people after a burning body was found near Bradford and are not connecting it with the murder of two men whose remains were found nearby.A 39-year-old and a 32-year-old man were arrested by West Yorkshire police on suspicion of murder. The burning body was found on Thursday by firefighters in Pit Hill park near the village of Tong, where the separate discovery of two young male bodies had been made on Tuesday evening.Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, who is leading the investigation of the second case, said: "We are not drawing any connection to the recent incident on New Lane, in Tong. I believe the answers to this discovery near Holme Lane lie locally and we would ask anyone who may have any information or any witnesses to contact the police immediately."Taylor said a house on Eggleston Drive was being forensically examined. It was raided by police on Thursday. A postmortem examination on the body is taking place.Police were called to the Holme Wood estate in south Bradford at about 6.30am on Thursday where firefighters found the body on a bonfire.
