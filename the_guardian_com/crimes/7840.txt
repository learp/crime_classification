The man accused of murdering the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury today protested his innocence in a dramatic courtroom outburst.Mohammed M'Barek, the flamboyant earl's former brother-in-law, claimed the death was an accident and appealed to the new French president for justice. Mr M'Barek stands accused, along with his sister Jamila M'Barek, who was married to the earl, of murdering the 66-year-old aristocrat.But today, as the jury was sworn in to begin their long-awaited trial, Mr M'Barek told the court: "I have been in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing. It's scandalous. French justice is scandalous."Former nightclub hostess Jamila M'Barek is accused of paying her brother to murder Anthony Ashley-Cooper, whose badly decomposed body was found in a ravine in the south of France in April 2005.The earl, who enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle, had gone missing from his hotel on the French Riviera five months earlier.Ms M'Barek, 45, and her brother, 43, appeared at a court in Nice charged with premeditated murder.Mr M'Barek has admitted killing the earl during a drunken row in November 2005, but, in an outburst before a packed courtroom, he insisted: "I am innocent, my sister is innocent. It was an accident."He then appealed to new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice.The lawyer for the Ashley-Cooper family said the facts of the case did not bear out the defendants' story.Philippe Soussi told the court: "We hope to show this was a premeditated act. All the material elements of this case indicate a premeditated act."The dead earl's son Nicholas, who is now the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury, sat in the public gallery along with his mother Lady Christina and his aunt.The earl, who was educated at Eton and Oxford, inherited his title from his grandfather at the age of 22, along with the 9,000-acre family estate in Dorset.Ms M'Barek and her brother both deny murdering the earl. The trial is expected to last three days.
