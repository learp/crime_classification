The fashion designer Nicole Farhi was threatened with a knife and strangled until she passed out during a robbery outside her own home, a court heard today.Farhi is alleged to have been the victim of two brothers who are accused of attacking a series of lone women and one man in wealthy areas of London.Wood Green crown court was told that Matthew and Daniel Mykoo followed their victims before striking them, and stripping them of jewellery and money.The jury heard that the French-born designer was attacked from behind in the driveway of her Hampstead home in April last year. It is claimed that Daniel Mykoo forced his arm around her throat, and his brother, Matthew, wielded a knife during the ordeal. Farhi lost consciousness for a few minutes as the pair took a ring and her Rolex watch, said John Carmichael, prosecuting. She pleaded to keep the watch which had sentimental value but the pair refused. Her husband, the playwright Sir David Hare, gave chase as the robbers fled, and managed to take down the registration number of the car they used.Carmichael said the pair would sometimes use stolen cars during the robberies and had the number plates changed before the next attack.Daniel Mykoo, 28, has admitted the offences but Matthew Mykoo, 27, of Brent, north London, denies 16 counts of robbery and one charge of taking a car without consent.The trial continues.
