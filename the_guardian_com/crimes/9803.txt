Victims of Jimmy Savile were ignored, laughed at and told they were "lucky" the DJ had paid them attention when they first confided in others, according to an NSPCC report.There was an "overwhelming belief" among Savile's victims that they would not have been believed if they had reported his crimes at the time, child protection experts said, with a significant number still yet to tell their family or friends.The NSPCC director of national services, Peter Watt, said: "The responses these victims received when they first revealed Savile's sickening crimes make heart-rending reading."They were ignored, dismissed, not believed, laughed at and astonishingly told in some cases they should feel lucky he had paid them attention."The NSPCC interviewed 26 victims of the late DJ for the report, which was commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to find out why so many victims stayed silent for so long.Four of the 26 individuals were adults when they were abused, but the others were children.The report reveals that a number of victims who were staying in hospital when they were abused told staff at the time but were not taken seriously. Another victim reported the incident to police but no action was taken.Each of the interviewees said they would not have come forward had they not seen the stories of other victims in the media in the wake of the Savile scandal in October 2010."Some remembered feeling that an elder – particularly a celebrity like Jimmy Savile – must know better than they did," the report says. "All participants said that they would not have come forward now had they not seen the stories of other victims in the press."There were also cases where participants also remembered feeling conflicted, and wondering if they should feel flattered or grateful that he had 'chosen them'."Savile, who carried out the crimes at the height of his fame as a BBC Radio 1 DJ and Top of the Pops presenter, was seen by his victims as a "charitable, good guy" who raised a lot of money for charity, the report says. "This led to feelings of hopelessness and inferiority in his victims, who felt there was no way that their word would have been believed over his."Watt said everyone should be aware of signs of abuse to "ensure there is never a repeat of the Savile scandal" and praised the victims' "true courage" coming forward.He added: "Half a century on, the world finally discovered just how dreadful his crimes were – something these men and women had known all that time but felt powerless to do anything about."The report found that Savile's victims suffered wide-ranging repercussions from the abuse throughout their lives, including mental health problems, substance abuse and thoughts of suicide.Some said that seeing images of Savile in media reports triggered flashbacks and made them feel physically sick. Others said they could remember vivid details about the attack, including the smell of Savile and the last words he spoke to them.Her Majesty's inspector Drusilla Sharpling said the report "vividly portrays the pain and anguish suffered by Savile's victims"."Despite the difficulties they have faced, victims have highlighted important ways in which police responses can be improved," she added."We owe it to them to make sure that the police service responds positively and ensures victims are supported, listened to and treated with compassion."
