An investigation has began into the fatal shooting of a suspected armed robber by an off-duty police officer in Belfast yesterday. The man, who has not been named, was shot after the police officer said he saw him holding a knife at a petrol station in Albertbride Road, east Belfast. The man was shot at around 7pm and the Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed that he later died. The incident is being investigated by the Police Ombudsman's office. The police said this was "normal procedure" in incidents when officers fired baton or live rounds.
