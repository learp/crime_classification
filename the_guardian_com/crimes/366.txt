An ex-fiance of socialite Tamara Ecclestone has denied trying to blackmail her for £200,000, telling a court their break-up 10 years ago had "destroyed" him.Derek Rose, 33, went out with Ecclestone, 28, when she was 17 before they split up in August 2002.In November 2011, having already sold one story about her for £10,000, it is alleged Rose orchestrated a blackmail letter claiming he would sell his story to a newspaper helped by co-defendant Jakir Uddin, 20.Giving evidence at London's Southwark crown court, Rose said he went out with Ecclestone for nearly two years, describing their break up as acrimonious.Asked by his defence lawyer, John Coffey QC, whose decision it was to part ways, he answered: "Mine. Because I found out she had been cheating on me."Questioned about how he now felt about an "offensive" email he sent to Ecclestone after they broke up, the father-of-one said: "Embarrassed, ashamed. But at the time I was heartbroken, upset and destroyed."Rose, who said he earned a living from nightclub promotion and property, was asked why he sold his story to the Mail on Sunday in 2002.The court previously heard that he had been disappointed by the angle the article had taken as it had focused more on Ecclestone's father, Formula One boss Bernie, than on her."At the time I was quite hurt and I wanted to tell more about Tamara than the family," Rose said."The family were quite good to me."I had an offer from the Sun which was a lot more but I knew that the Mail would be a lot better for Tamara."The Mail was at the house almost every day and had an almost vindictive attitude towards Tamara and the house."I knew they never read the Sun."Rose told jurors he met Uddin in August or September 2011 and the pair became friends.He said that when the media production student asked him if he would be the subject of a university project, he agreed and they made a short film in which he talked about his relationship with Ecclestone.He said he was shocked when Uddin later contacted him to say he wanted to sell the footage to the tabloids."I didn't want this story to come out in the public domain," he said."It would be embarrassing for me, embarrassing for my son and it's not something that I would do."Rose said he told Uddin he "wanted nothing to do with it".Rose, from north London, and Uddin, from Birmingham, both deny blackmail.The trial continues.
