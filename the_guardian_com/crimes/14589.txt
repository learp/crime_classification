The shadow home secretary, David Davis, today said government plans to ban deactivated guns by the end of the year would "do little more than paper over the cracks".His comments came after the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, speaking during a visit to Liverpool, said tough new laws would be brought in to target the supply of deactivated guns that were then reactivated and used in crime."Tackling gun crime is key to making people feel safer and more secure in their communities," she added. "We already have the tightest controls in Europe, but there is more we can do to remove the threat of gun crime."I have asked the Serious Organised Crime Agency to prioritise gun crime to ensure we are doing all we can to target the supply of guns, generate fresh intelligence and reduce the use of guns amongst serious organised criminals," she added.However, Davis said deactivated weapons accounted for a tiny proportion of gun crime."While we welcome any action, however overdue it may be, to tackle the scourge of gun crime, the government's own figures show that, in 2005-06, there were only eight incidents where deactivated or reactivated weapons were used - just 0.04% of gun offences," he added.Davis said "sustained action" was needed to tackle the other 99.6% of gun crime, which he said had increased fourfold over the past decade, including a "sustained drive" to tackle serious drug abuse in Britain. He also called for a dedicated UK border police force "to stem the tide of drugs and guns" entering the country as well as less red tape for police and more prison places.The Association of Chief Police Officers' firearms spokeswoman, Sue Fish, welcomed the proposals to outlaw deactivated guns, saying they "account for around 10% of all criminally used firearms submitted to the forensic science service".She added that although recently deactivated guns were difficult to reactivate, they were often used to "threaten and instill fear in the public".A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that new restrictions would affect all firearms adapted before more stringent standards for deactivating guns were introduced in 1995, including antiques.The move could therefore affect collectors and exhibitors of historic weapons such as flintlock pistols."Pre-1995 means exactly that. We are aware that that might affect museums and collectors so any legislation would take that into account and would be proportionate," the spokeswoman said.Firearms collectors have spoke out strongly against the new measures. Julian Tacon, a collector for 25 years, said they could have a major impact on collectors but predicted that they would be ignored by criminals."This could make life more awkward for legitimate people and collectors," he added. "A ban on antique firearms would be very worrying."Prior to Smith's visit, Merseyside police launched a series of gang and drug-related dawn raids. Twenty-eight people were arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs in the Croxteth and Norris Green areas of Liverpool, with the number expected to rise.The raids, carried out on 31 addresses, were led by the Merseyside police anti-gun Matrix team.
