An NHS nurse who was convicted of sexual grooming after plotting to behead and eat a girl has been jailed for nine years.Dale Bolinger, 58, bought an axe from a DIY shop in Broadstairs, Kent, the day before he tried to meet the 14-year-old, whom he had groomed online.He chatted with the teenager, a Mexican girl called “Eva” said to be living in Germany, on a website called the Dark Fetish Network (DFN).In conversations, Bolinger described sex acts he wanted to perform on her and how he would murder her, which she said she wanted to happen.After a four-day trial at Canterbury crown court in July, Bolinger was found guilty of attempting to meet a girl under the age of 16 following sexual grooming.Before the trial, Bolinger admitted other charges, including administering a poison or noxious substance after he put a cloth soaked in dry-cleaning fluid over his friend Urlene King’s mouth in July 2010.He also pleaded guilty to making indecent pseudo photographs of children, and seven counts of publishing an obscene article.As he was jailed today for the 11 offences, a judge said his behaviour was “abhorrent, shocking and dangerous”.Bolinger, a US citizen, was made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order to stop him using the internet without permission by Judge Adele Williams.Psychiatrists ruled that Bolinger, whose family have disowned him, was not suffering from mental illness.Bolinger stood in the dock with his head bowed and hands clenched in front of him as Williams told how he had had fantasies of cannibalism since he was a child.Jailing Bolinger, she told him: “You demonstrated when giving evidence that you are an arrogant and manipulative man.“You have shown no remorse and indeed cannot understand why anyone should find your behaviour in any way abnormal or perverted, let alone criminal.“You lack any insight into your behaviour and fail to understand that right-minded people will find your behaviour abhorrent, shocking, repulsive and dangerous - dangerous because, by talking about these activities, there is always the risk that your fantasies will tip over into actions.“There was always the real danger that you would inflame or incite people with whom you were discussing these activities to move from fantasy to action themselves.”Prosecutor Martin Yale told the trial that internet chats involving Bolinger on the DFN site about beheading and eating women and girls were discovered by the FBI in New York.Investigators found the email address meatmarketman@rocketmail.com was being used in Kent and Bolinger was arrested after the information was passed to Kent police.In chats with other users, Bolinger - who used a picture of supermodel Naomi Campbell on his profile – claimed to have eaten a 39-year-old woman and a five-year-old child.His profile, under the name Chris C, listed his interests as “cannibalism, mainly the hunting and preparation of young but sometimes not so young women”.At his trial, chat logs were read out between Bolinger and users in which he referred to beheading a 14-year-old, eating children while their mothers watched, and cooking and eating a pregnant woman and her foetus.Bolinger told the court he did not believe “Eva” – who used the surname “Gonza” but later told him it was “Nada” – was a 14-year-old girl.He told police he thought she was probably a man in his 30s “surrounded by pizza boxes” who would be dead by his 40s. He denied that he would decapitate someone in reality.But prosecutors said it was clear Bolinger did believe “Eva” was a 14-year-old girl, and he had bragged to others in chat logs about the proposed meeting in Kent with her.The court heard that Bolinger had taken his fantasies beyond chatrooms before. In July 2010, he put a cloth soaked in dry-cleaning fluid over King’s mouth.After his arrest at the hospital where he worked, police searched his home and found indecent pseudo-images of children aged four to 16 that had been digitally manipulated.In a police interview, Bolinger said he started having fantasies about cannibalism at about the age of six, and he blamed his domineering mother for his “weird” behaviour.He told officers: “By the time I got to 14, I turned into the villain of the piece and I wondered what it would be like to eat a girl.”Bolinger told police he had never discussed his fantasies with his wife of 34 years, Rosemary, or their children, and said he felt ashamed.When questioned about the images, Bolinger, formerly from Canterbury, told police: “I do not find children sexually attractive but I do find them interesting as a food source.”In mitigation, defence counsel Paul Jarvis said whoever Eva was “she was clearly a willing party for whatever was going to happen”.And he said that in relation to the offence against King, it was Bolinger himself who stopped after he “came to his senses”.Jarvis said Bolinger’s family had deserted him, he faced severe difficulty in ever finding work again and had “little to look forward to bar advancing years”.
