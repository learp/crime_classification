Detectives hunting the killer of a heavily pregnant teenager have arrested a second man and issued CCTV footage of her last known movements.Amy Williams, 14, was found dead in the grounds of St Michael's church in Madeley, Telford, on December 27. Yesterday West Mercia police said they had arrested a 28-year-old man from Telford. Another local man, who is 27, was arrested a week ago and released without charge on Monday. The CCTV footage shows Amy, who was six months pregnant, walking from Telford town centre towards a community centre 90 minutes after she left a family party at her uncle's house on Boxing Day in Sutton Hill, Telford, at 9pm. Her body, naked apart from a pair of pink socks, was found by a man visiting a grave in the churchyard at 9am the following day. Detectives are trying to find her missing clothes - a pink tracksuit and white Kappa trainers. A postmortem examination revealed that she had been strangled. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Morgan, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: "We still need more information about Amy's movements on the night in question - what was she doing and who was she with? "The tracksuit and trainers remain a vital element of evidence which we need to find. Anyone who finds such items should also contact us immediately." He said the investigation was making good progress. Amy's father, Mark Williams, 41, has made a public appeal for information to catch his daughter's killer.
