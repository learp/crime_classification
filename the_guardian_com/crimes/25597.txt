A care home manager who killed an elderly woman and stole prescription drugs to feed her own habit created a "closed system of relationships" that meant her criminal activities were not spotted by the authorities, a review has concluded.Rachel Baker, who is serving a 10-year jail sentence, was so trusted by residents' relatives and by health professionals that breaches of rules and concerns over her behaviour were not spotted or acted on.A serious case review also revealed that Baker was not actually registered to provide nursing care – which gave her access to the controlled drugs she abused.The then regulator, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI), failed to pick up that she was giving such care and had controlled drugs on the premises. Local doctors – who did know – were unaware of the rules and so did not step in.Baker was jailed at Bristol crown court last year for the manslaughter of 97-year-old Lucy Cox, a resident of the Parkfields nursing home in Butleigh, Somerset, who died after a fatal dose of a strong painkiller.During her trial it emerged that Baker stole thousands of doses of drugs such as diamorphine and Tramadol prescribed for Cox and other residents, taking them herself.To explain why her residents needed large quantities of drugs used for palliative care, some of the elderly people at the home had to die, the prosecution claimed.It was also alleged that Baker may have got a "perverted" kick out of being in control of elderly people's lives.The investigation began when two whistleblowers came forward and led to police exhuming the bodies of three former residents.Officers close to the case remain suspicious that Baker may have been responsible for other deaths.The serious case review accepted that Baker was trusted and well-regarded by the local community, by residents' relatives and by professional colleagues."At the centre of these events is the very unusual figure of a trusted professional registered nurse who broke the law and failed to uphold her code of professional conduct," the review said.It claimed Baker had "allowed the needs of her addiction to take precedence over the needs of the vulnerable older people for whom she was responsible". This led to the "serious neglect and abuse that was exposed in the criminal proceedings".The review said the "strong reputation" of Parkfields and Baker had almost created a "closed system of relationships"."Concerns raised by staff in the home through their line managers were referred to the home manager [Baker] and GPs' confidence in the home manager's views about her residents' needs meant they tended to refer queries raised with them back to her for an expert nursing opinion."It concluded: "Habitual confidence was overriding critical inquiry."The review spelled out that though Baker was a registered nurse, she was not entitled to provide "nursing care" for residents."District nurses noticed this breach of the regulations and raised it at different times over a number of years with the home manager [Baker], their manager and GPs but the issue was not resolved," said the report.This resulted in Baker having "more direct involvement in residents' nursing care than was usual or appropriate". It also gave her access to a store of controlled drugs.The report said GPs were "not aware of the different regulations governing the provision of nursing care".The CSCI simply did not know Baker was giving nursing care and had the stock of drugs despite carrying out regular inspections.The review found that some GPs and other health staff did query the high levels of prescriptions for residents."But there was no obvious way in which these concerns and any pattern that might have emerged from them could be brought together," the review said.Also highlighted is the number of times the agencies involved in overseeing homes like Baker's changed."During the period under review the regulatory organisation had changed twice, primary care trusts had been formed and then reorganised, district nursing services had two changes of management arrangements, out-of-hours service arrangements had changed more than once and the social services department had changed its responsibilities," it said.The review said many lessons have already been learned but added: "Even if the necessary improvements identified during the course of the review had been in place at the time of the events, it is not clear that these could have come together at any point to identify the true nature of the manager's behaviour."
