A breastfeeding mother and an office worker detained during a May Day protest for more than seven hours without food, drink or toilet facilities lost a high court claim for damages against the Metropolitan police yesterday.The test case brought by Lois Austin and Geoffrey Saxby is now likely to go to the court of appeal. The two were among about 3,000 people who were corralled in Oxford Circus, central London, from 2pm until 9.30 by police during the anti-globalisation demonstration in 2001. Ms Austin, 35, from Southwark, south London, was a protester but Mr Saxby, 48, from Hastings, East Sussex, was on an errand for his employer. Both claimed damages for false imprisonment and a breach of their right to liberty under the European convention on human rights. Both were given permission to appeal. But Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that the police's actions were justified. Ms Austin was not allowed to leave to pick up her 11-month-old daughter from a creche and Mr Saxby claimed police ignored him when he told them he was not involved in the demonstration. Ms Austin said: "We are worried that protesters are being criminalised for going on the streets and making their protests heard against war and world poverty." Her solicitor, Louise Christian, said: "Hopefully the court of appeal will take a different approach, otherwise the problem will be that the police will see this as a green light to use this tactic again."
