With 35 officers and specialists, the UK's e-crime unit – based at Scotland Yard – is tackling a criminal threat said by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, to be second only to terrorism.The unit responsible for tackling cybercrime operates in a fast moving environment where criminals are often several steps ahead of law enforcers. Stephenson and other senior officers acknowledge there are too few investigators dedicated to this kind of crime.The deputy assistant commissioner Janet Williams, head of e-crime investigations, says criminals can flit across countries in a split second, and her officers can follow a trail across more than nine jurisdictions within half an hour.Her team provides the expertise to investigate across the cyber world. But with criminals' systems faster and more sophisticated than those of the police, the unit has turned to private companies for support. Without them, police say they could struggle to keep up.The e-crime unit draws on 10 companies who will tip off the police if their computer systems detect a new attack. The companies, thought to include banks, have better intelligence systems than the police and much bigger budgets. They inform the unit of attack methods adopted by cyber criminals, new trends of criminality, intelligence and the latest defensive positions.The e-crime unit was set up in 2009 with £7.4m from the Home Office and the Met over three years. But – with one report saying recently that cybercrime cost the UK more than £27bn a year – Williams wants more money and 20 more staff for her unit.
