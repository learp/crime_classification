Labour is to consider setting up community courts as a people's alternative to magistrates courts, in what it describes as a drive to "renew the contract between the citizen and the state".The proposals are floated in the latest round of National Policy Forum discussion documents unveiled yesterday by the party chairman, John Reid. The proposals would form part of a manifesto designed to win Labour an historic third term.Community courts, supported by the Home Office minister Lord Falconer, would be designed to bring the law closer to people. They might become arbiters in disputes between neighbours or deal with antisocial behaviour such as littering and graffiti. A range of other community issues such as pollution, the siting of mobile phone masts and traffic control, including often unpopular traffic calming measures, could come under the courts' control. The papers suggest that Labour needs to establish a consensus at local level on acceptable standards and behaviour. The report argues that renewing respect, one of Mr Blair's vogue words, would help to knit the fabric of society back together. The papers also intervene in the controversy involving the lord chief justice Lord Woolf, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, and Downing Street over the value of imprisoning minor offenders. It comes down on the side of non-custodial sentences for less serious offences, arguing jail is an expensive response to crime and "increasingly seen as the answer for only the most serious crimes". The documents call for new ideas to impose discipline in schools, extend specialist schools and extend cooperation on selection policies between local education authorities. It also suggests further work on a radical rebalancing of funding for local government from the centre to the locality although the paper does not hold out hopes of early reform.
