Two more men have been arrested by police leading the manhunt for Michael Cope, who is wanted for the "sustained and vicious" murder of Linzi Ashton in Salford. Ashton's body was found at her home in the Winton area on Saturday.Late on Tuesday night two men aged 26 and 27 were arrested by Greater Manchester police. Officers have been granted more time to question a 25-year-old man arrested on Monday. All three remained in custody on suspicion of assisting an offender, a police spokesman said.On Tuesday police released CCTV footage of Cope buying snacks hours before it is believed Ashton was murdered. A reward of £5,000 has been offered for anyone who might be able to help trace Cope.Police said Cope, 28, had been in a brief, acrimonious relationship with Ashton, 25, a barmaid at the Duke of York pub in nearby Eccles. They had been seeking to arrest him since the end of April when Ashton made a complaint of rape against him.Her body was discovered by a relative at her home in Westbourne Road shortly before 6pm on Saturday. Her two daughters Daisy, two, and Destiny, seven, were not at the address at the time. A Home Office postmortem concluded that she died as a result of pressure to the neck and multiple injuries.Police think Cope could still be in the Salford area. The CCTV footage shows Cope buying snacks, alcohol and soft drinks from Best One on Liverpool Road, Eccles, at about 10.45pm on Friday. He was wearing a black coat with the hood pulled up over his cap in an apparent attempt to partially cover his face. Police think he went to see Ashton after this sighting.Police say Cope is dangerous man and have warned the public not to approach him. Crimestoppers, the independent charity, is offering the £5,000 reward for anyone who has information leading to his arrest and conviction.
