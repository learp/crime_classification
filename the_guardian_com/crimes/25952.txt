Police have arrested five teenage boys in connection with a fire in a scrap metal yard beneath the M1 in north London which forced the closure of the motorway for several days.The boys, aged between 14 and 17, were arrested on Wednesday morning in Barnet and Harrow, London, the Metropolitan police said.They were being questioned about the fire that severely damaged the raised section of the M1 on 15 April and about two other fires at the nearby Moat Mount Open Space between 14 and 16 April.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Roycroft said: "Although we are pursuing a number of active leads into these fires we would still ask that anyone who has any information about these crimes contact Barnet police."The fire at the Apex Metal Recycling yard, close to Scratchwood Services, closed a seven-mile section of the motorway throughout the following weekend. Engineers, who initially battled to prevent the entire elevated roadway from collapsing, propped up the section with 200 tonnes of steel.The motorway partly reopened in both directions the following Monday. It was another three days before that part of the M1, between junctions one and four, was fully open again. The road could be closed again for permanent repairs.Philip Hammond, the transport secretary, has asked the Highways Agency and Network Rail to assess the scale of the threat posed by businesses located near main rail routes and motorways.
