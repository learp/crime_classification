A professional cricketer who stabbed his lover to death in front of her four-month-old son and his 10-month-old daughter was jailed for life yesterday.Bevon Williams murdered Melanie Horridge, a mother of three, as she pushed her son's pram through an alleyway in Chorley, Lancashire. At the time of the attack, Williams had his daughter with him, also in a pram. The couple had being having a secret affair while Williams was involved in another relationship with the mother of his daughter. Williams, 27, argued with Miss Horridge after she threatened to expose the affair, Preston crown court heard. They had previously had a child together in 2001. She was stabbed 24 times in February this year as she walked from her mother's home to a telephone box. Three teenagers found Miss Horridge, 25, in a pool of blood in the alleyway after being alerted by her son's crying. The teenagers called a neighbour, who tried to resuscitate her before calling an ambulance, but she died from her injuries later that day. Sentencing Williams, who admitted murder, Mr Justice Leveson said he would serve a minimum of 11 and a half years. "You snuffed out the life of another human being, depriving the children of their mother," said the judge. "The problems which confronted you on this terrible day were entirely of your own making." The judge refused to accept Williams' claim that he had not taken a knife along with him when he quarrelled with Miss Horridge, but had picked one up from the floor. "I'm sure you had a knife on you and had previously carried a knife, and in the heat of the moment you decided to use it with terrible consequences," he added. Williams, from Chorley, arrived in the UK from Tobago in 1998. At the time of the murder, he had been poised to sign for West Leigh cricket club.
