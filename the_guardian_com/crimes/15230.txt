The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, is to make an attempt to end weeks of controversy over his call to the courts to use more community sentences for first-time burglars.Lord Woolf insisted last night that his statement today would "not modify or retract any part" of the advice he issued before Christmas but was "a response to inaccurate reporting" of his guidelines. It is thought to be unprecedented for the lord chief justice to issue a sentencing guideline and then twice have to publish clarifications making clear his precise intentions. A letter to all judges which also accused the media of misreporting his guidance was sent out to the courts on Christmas Eve. The decision to issue the new clarification follows a fortnight in which the Conservatives have tried to portray a cabinet split over the sentencing of burglars. On Saturday the home secretary, David Blunkett, criticised the lord chief justice, say ing he agreed with the policy but questioned his presentational skills. "I don't blame the lord chief justice, because he is not a politician, but when you communicate it is very important that people understand the signal, the message," Mr Blunkett said. He spelled out how Lord Woolf might be expected to clarify his guidance. He said some people - including judges - had misinterpreted the advice to mean that defendants facing a number of charges including burglary should escape jail if it was the first time they had committed burglary. In fact, "they go to jail if they have committed a number of offences, or they have been violent or it is absolutely clear that community sentencing, including drug treatment, has failed", Mr Blunkett said. The new advice, issued as a court of appeal judgment on December 18, says most first-time burglars should not get an immediate prison sentence if there are no aggravating factors. The prison population now stands at a record 72,500.
