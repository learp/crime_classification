A crack addict who stole secret papers about the release of Maxine Carr, the former partner of the Soham murderer Ian Huntley, was jailed for 16 weeks by Hendon magistrates yesterday.Part-time decorator Darren Jacobs, 33, from Gospel Oak, north London, was also given an anti-social behaviour order, banning him indefinitely from the Hampstead area because of his history of breaking into cars. The court was told Jacobs stole items worth around £1,000 belonging to a civil servant, Bettina Crossick, and her daughter. The car, parked in Hampstead on May 11, also contained secret documents about Carr. The documents, later found on Hampstead Heath, reportedly related to her new identity on her release from prison. Jacobs was described by the prosecution as having an "excessive interest in motor vehicles". He had previously admitted two counts of theft from the car, plus a further theft at Sainsbury's on May 8, and a breach of conditional discharge on the same day. Applying for the Asbo, prosecutor Brinder Soora said Hampstead was considered a car crime hotspot by police. The court heard Jacobs had 26 previous convictions, dating from 1987. Defending, Nicholas Rosenfeld said the father of two had a £40-a-day drug habit."He has a longstanding crack and heroin problem," he said. "Really, until that is addressed, he is going to be facing problems."
