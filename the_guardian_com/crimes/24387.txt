Crime recorded by the police in England and Wales fell by 7% in the 12 months to June, according to Home Office figures published today.The unexpected drop included proportional declines in violent crime and firearm offences, but the death toll from gun crime rose from 53 in the same period a year ago to 56.The Home Office figures also showed that despite the sharp drop in recorded crime, fear of crime levels and concerns about antisocial behaviour remained high and public confidence in the criminal justice system - the police and the courts - fell on five out of seven measures.The latest results from the British Crime Survey, which criminologists regard as a more reliable measure of trends in crime, showed no change in crime levels, continuing the stable trend seen over the last two years.The BCS, which is based on 40,000 interviews, found that the risk of being a victim of crime remained at 24% - the lowest level since the survey began in 1981.The Home Office figures showed 1.29m offences recorded by the police between April and June this year, down from 1.39m over the same period in 2006.The largest fall was in property crime - including burglary, criminal damage and car crime - which fell from just over 1m offences to 932,000, a 7% drop.Robbery was down 9% to 23,000 cases, violence against the person down 8% to 256,000 incidents, and sexual offences also fell 9% to 14,000 crimes.The only category to see an increase was drug offences, which were up 14%. Some 55,000 people were dealt with between April and June this year.The rise is believed to reflect the greater targeting of class A drugs including heroin and cocaine, and an increase in warnings handed out for cannabis possession in the wake of the reclassification of its status.Firearms offences dropped to 9,712 cases in the year to June, from 10,351 in the previous 12 months. The number of incidents involving serious injury fell from 435 to 388 over the same period, but the death toll rose slightly. The majority of incidents involved handguns.The Home Office minister, Tony McNulty, said: "I am encouraged that the BCS shows stability after historic falls and the police figures show that total recorded crime is down by 7%."Reductions in violence against the person, domestic burglary and criminal damage all point to significant progress."
