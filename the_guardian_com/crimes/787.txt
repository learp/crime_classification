The government is planning to introduce a national non-emergency police phone number in the next two years as part of a "copper's contract" to improve public satisfaction.Around 44% of the population contact the police every year about a range of issues, from being a victim of crime to reporting nuisance behaviour. The majority get in touch by telephone. But one of the biggest causes of discontent is how officers deal with phone calls from the public. A report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary this year found this was a problem for many of the 43 forces in England and Wales.Yesterday, David Blunkett, the home secretary, told the Police Superintendents' Association annual conference that he wants one phone number for non-emergency calls to ensure callers are dealt with quickly and efficiently.This might mean a same-day visit from uniformed officers, a return phone call the next day, or referral to another relevant authority, such as housing or health. "It's a sad reflection that, in the Mori poll, the more contact people have with the police the less satisfied they were with the service," Mr Blunkett told delegates at the conference in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. "People are not getting through, they don't know what's happening. People are not being polite. It's the one area of greatest dissatisfaction and, if we can turn this round, we can turn round how people see the police service." He said the key was making sure that staff had sufficient training to ensure calls were followed through and victims of crime were supported. Mr Blunkett said the long-term objective was fully co-ordinated public services. Rick Naylor, president of the Police Superintendents' Association, agreed. He said: "When you get joined-up police, local authority and victim support action, people feel reassured.It's important that we, as agencies, show we care about victims. It helps them get their lives back on track."
