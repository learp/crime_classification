The Mongolian Embassy in London today agreed to lift immunity for the son of one of its diplomats who has been quizzed over the rape of a schoolgirl.The 18-year-old student has been questioned by detectives over the attack last Friday on a 16-year-old near Kensington Palace, west London.Sources close to the investigation said officers expected to charge the man later today.The girl was allegedly grabbed from a bus stop in the vicinity of Kensington Road at about 1.25am and forced into a park.The attacker, who claimed to have a knife, subjected the victim to a 20-minute ordeal that left her needing hospital treatment.It has been reported that once the suspect was arrested, he attempted to claim immunity under the 1961 Vienna Convention, which allows diplomats, their families and embassy staff to escape prosecution in foreign countries.But the Foreign Office asked the Mongolian ambassador in London, Dalrain Davaasambuu, to lift the immunity.A spokesman said: "It is our standard practice to ask embassies to waive immunity in serious cases."
