A gang of armed "hoodies" led by the killers of city lawyer Tom ap Rhys Pryce were jailed yesterday for 150 violent robberies over eight months.The Kensal Green gang have been likened to "a pack of animals" by victims, and repeatedly rampaged tube carriages, stabbing people in the neck, chest or legs. One woman was threatened with rape if she did not surrender her valuables.The campaign of violence began in June 2005, and culminated with the murder of Tom ap Rhys Pryce on January 12 last year, for which Donnel Carty, 19 and Delano Brown, 18 were jailed for life last year. The pair followed him from Kensal Green tube station in north-west London and stabbed him repeatedly for his mobile phone, an Oyster card, and Â£20.A five-week trial at Middlesex Guildhall crown court heard that most of the robberies - many involving Carty and Brown - took place on the Bakerloo line, with others on the Central, Northern, Metropolitan, and Hammersmith and City lines. Toyan Vassall and Kariem Al-Ebadi, both 18, Ishmael Cowell, 23, and 17-year-old Harry Bees were convicted on Monday of conspiracy to rob, and a number of wounding charges. Aaron Dennis, 19, and Sebastian Chidi, 18, earlier admitted conspiracy to rob and wounding offences.The gang compiled a "good mugging guide" which they scrawled on an underground map , rating various areas.Notting Hill was "good eating, but a bit hot" - a reference to the relatively heavy police presence there. Neasden was marked "fight back", an acknowledgement that victims tended to resist. Colindale was a clear favourite, with "++". The gang knew the location of CCTV cameras at the stations, and would on occasions clamber over fences to avoid them.Judge Henry Blacksell yesterday told the jurors for the first time about Carty and Brown's murder of Mr ap Rhys Pryce."Sadly the same sort of things you have had to listen to led to the death of a victim," said the judge; he will sentence the convicted on March 19.
