A man accused of stabbing a pregnant woman and her unborn baby to death claims he had sex with her at her boyfriend's invitation hours before she died, a jury has heard.Nikitta Grender, 19, was raped and murdered in a violent stabbing in her flat in Newport, south Wales, in February 2011. The knife penetrated the body of her unborn daughter, already named Kelsey-May and the teenager's charred body was found in the burnt-out flat in Liswerry.Police believe the killer set the bed where she was found alight in an attempt to destroy evidence.Carl Whant, 27, of Bettws, near Newport, is charged with murder and child destruction under the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929. He is also accused of rape and arson. He denies all charges.Whant, a former nightclub bouncer, is the second cousin of Ryan Mayes, 17, the murdered woman's boyfriend and father of the unborn child. The pair worked together as double-glazing salesmen and had been out drinking together on the night of the murder.Newport crown court heard on Friday that Whant belatedly claimed he had sex with the couple at their flat hours before the murder.A defence statement issued to the prosecution for the first time last month also claimed Whant and Mayes had previously had a threesome with another woman.Gregg Taylor QC, prosecuting, said Whant's claim had never been made to the police during 26 interviews.Reading out part of the statement he said Whant claimed he had returned to the couple's flat so Mayes could change before going out.He said he saw Grender was lying on the bed in the bedroom lying and he went to the kitchen to smoke a cigarette."After five minutes Ryan called me into the bedroom and I saw he was naked lying on top of Nikitta who was also naked."He invited me to have sex with her. I agreed and proceeded to have consensual sex with her. I did not wear a condom. After sex I went to the kitchen where Ryan was ironing his jeans."Taylor said when the claim was put to Mayes he dismissed it immediately, saying it never happened.
