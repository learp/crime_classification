A woman is to be charged in connection with an acid attack on a shop worker that left her with horrific injuries, the Crown Prosecution Service has announced.Naomi Oni, 21, suffered burns and lost her hair and eyelashes after the chemical was thrown at her in Dagenham, east London, on 30 December.On Tuesday the CPS announced it had authorised Scotland Yard to charge Mary Konye in relation to the attack.The senior crown prosecutor, Damaris Lakin, said: "I concluded that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest to charge Ms Konye with throwing or casting a corrosive fluid with intent to burn, maim, disfigure, disable or do grievous bodily harm."Konye will appear before Barkingside magistrates court in Ilford, Essex, on Wednesday.
