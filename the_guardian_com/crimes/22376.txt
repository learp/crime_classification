A government initiative to get criminals on drugs to kick the habit was "more like a get out of jail free card" than a rehabilitation programme, the Commons public accounts committee says in a report released today.It says that only 25% of those who accept the rehabilitation programme ever complete it - with wide variations across the country. The expansion of drug treatment orders instead of sending people to prison is a major plank of the Conservatives' anti-crime manifesto for the next election. The findings of the committee of MPs chaired by Tory MP Edward Leigh, suggests that the scheme needs major revisions if it is to be successful. The report says the probation service had great difficulty in "keeping often chaotic drug users on intensive and highly structured programmes long enough to achieve sustained reductions in drug misuse and offending behaviour." The MPs say there must be more commitment from of fenders in between their arrest and trial to ensure that they will benefit from the programme. The report says that some offenders found it difficult to break the drug habit because they shared rooms with other drug users. Others found it difficult to claim benefits while they were on the programme and complained they lacked support after they had completed the programme. The best results were in Dorset and Warwickshire where 71% and 62% of offenders completed the programme. Worst results were in Kent where 8% completed the programme. The cost of the scheme worked out at £6,000 a place compared with £30,000 for a prison place.
