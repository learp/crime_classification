The former Scottish Socialist party leader Tommy Sheridan and his wife, Gail, have gone on trial for perjury after allegedly lying in their £200,000 libel victory over the News of the World.Sheridan, a former member of the Scottish parliament and Celebrity Big Brother contestant, has been accused of repeatedly lying in their libel trial about his affairs and about his alleged visits to a "swingers' club" in Manchester.The prosecution also claims he tried to persuade senior party figures and friends to lie on his behalf.Gail Sheridan, a former British Airways air steward, is alleged to have helped her husband win the libel case by giving him several false alibis during their court victory against the News of the World in 2006.The new trial, before Lord Bracadale and a jury of 13 women and two men at the high court in Glasgow, is expected to last for up to 10 weeks, making it the longest perjury trial in Scottish legal history.The couple arrived hand in hand at court this morning to cheers and applause from about 35 Solidarity and Socialist Party Scotland activists, who carried placards reading "Defend Tommy and Gail Sheridan", "The real criminals? Blair and Murdoch", and "Put the News of the World on Trial".The prosecution has cited 181 witnesses, including the women who allegedly had affairs with Sheridan, took part in group sex sessions with him and allegedly witnessed his visits to hotels for his affairs.The Sheridans both deny the charges and are preparing to call up to 20 defence witnesses. The first Crown witness is due to begin their evidence this afternoon.The couple were prosecuted for allegedly lying under oath after they won £200,000 in damages four years ago against the News of the World, which had printed a series of lurid articles in 2002 and 2004 accusing Sheridan of being an adulterer.The detailed, seven-page indictment, or charge sheet, also accuses Sheridan, 46, of lying about the length of his affair with one prosecution witness, Anvar Khan, and of denying allegations by another witness, Katrina Troll, that he had taken her back to his marital home in Glasgow.Gail Sheridan, 46, allegedly told the libel trial she and her husband were at home together on several weekends in 2001 when he was accused of being at Cupids, the Manchester club; the prosecution claims she was working in Miami at the time. She is also alleged wrongly to have claimed that the couple were together when her aunt came to visit from the US in June 2002, when Sheridan was allegedly having group sex in a Glasgow hotel.An outspoken figure, Sheridan is well known in Scotland for his long career as a socialist activist and anti-poverty campaigner. He came to prominence during the anti-poll tax protests in the 1980s and early 1990s.He won a seat in the Scottish parliament in the first elections in 1999 for the SSP, and sat as a list MSP for Glasgow until the 2007 Scottish elections. He left the SSP in 2006, setting up a rival party, Solidarity, with other SSP MSPs and activists. None of the six SSP and Solidarity MSPs was returned at the 2007 elections. Sheridan took part in Celebrity Big Brother in 2009, and was the fifth housemate to be evicted.
