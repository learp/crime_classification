A teenager has been banned from wearing a hooded top or cap in public for five years after terrorising residents in a Manchester suburb.In what is believed to be the first antisocial behaviour order of its kind in the country, Dale Carroll, 16, could face prison if he steps out in public in the teenage uniform of hoodie or baseball cap. The Asbo also bans him from congregating with more than two people apart from family members, entering Collyhurst Village, where he lived with his mother, and possessing fireworks, axes or chainsaws. Manchester magistrates heard how he was a member of a gang of youths who ran amok in his neighbourhood for nearly three years. The teenager attempted to hack down a CCTV lamppost with a chainsaw, threw fireworks at cyclists, pulled someone from a bike and threatened the person with an axe, and illegally drove a car on to a pavement and down steps near the local pub. Breaching the conditions of an Asbo is a criminal offence for which he could be jailed for up to five years. "This young man has caused absolute misery for the people he has terrorised in this neighbourhood, and is out of control," said Eddy Newman, Manchester city council's executive member for housing. "He should be absolutely clear we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and unless he radically changes that behaviour, he faces a long period in custody." Richard Garside, of the Crime and Society Foundation, said it was "idiotic" to use an Asbo to determine whether a teenager could wear a hoodie or cap. "Legal powers are increasingly being used to micro-manage youth behaviour."
