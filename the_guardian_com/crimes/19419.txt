Each of your victims was your patient. You murdered each and every one of your victims by a calculated and cold-blooded perversion of your medical skills. For your own evil and wicked purpose you took advantage of and grossly abused the trust each of your victims put in you. You were, after all, each victim's doctor. I have little doubt each of your victims smiled and thanked you as she submitted to your fearful administrations.Mr Justice Forbes, sentencing Shipman"The CPS, the police and prosecution counsel have worked together to bring to justice the most prolific serial killer this country has known. The judge has said that the sentence of life imprisonment will mean life. Our over-riding thoughts rest with the families of Dr Shipman's victims. They have waited a long time for today's outcome and have shown enormous patience and dignity throughout the ordeal of this long trial." Robert Davies, crown prosecutor in Oldham and Hyde"He is convicted of 15 murders over three years. The police investigated about 130 deaths over that time. Say 100 were murdered, then multiply that by 10 because he has been practising for 30 years. There is the potential for about 1,000 deaths - but that's pure speculation." Manchester coroner John Pollard "Our sympathies lie with the very many families who have been victims of these dreadful crimes. As an individual, Harold Shipman betrayed the trust of his patients. He also betrayed the professionalism of our country's dedicated family doctors. I will be making a statement on the implications of the Shipman case to the House of Commons tomorrow, but for tonight, all our thoughts should be with the victims and their relatives." Health secretary Alan Milburn"We live in a society where we have to trust doctors. It's only now that any of us is starting to question this blind faith."
