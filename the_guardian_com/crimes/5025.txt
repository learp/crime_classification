The UK's Islamic community was yesterday horrified to learn that 40 Muslim graves in a London cemetery had been desecrated in a faith hate attack thought to have been sparked by the Madrid bombings.Headstones were smashed and pictures removed from the graves in Charlton cemetery in the south-east of the city. Police believe the vandals struck between 4pm on Wednesday and 8am yesterday and are treating the desecration as a crime motivated by religious hatred. Detective inspector Karl Amos, of Greenwich Community Safety Unit, said the culprits would have been easily able to spot which graves belonged to Muslim families. "All the damaged graves were grouped together on one side of an area of the cemetery. Their style is different from most of the graves around and Muslim names would have been clear from the inscriptions. "We are treating this crime with utmost seriousness. It appears to have been motivated by hatred of the Muslim faith. We utterly deplore the sentiments behind this crime as well as the crime itself and are seeking to reassure the faith leaders in our community that this sort of thing will not be tolerated." Inayat Bunglawala, spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, said he had detected increased hostility towards Muslims in the UK since the September 11 attacks, and the Madrid bombings had heightened Muslim fears of a backlash. "It's not just graves that are being attacked but mosques and buildings used by Muslims," he said. "Wrecking graves is the most cowardly kind of attack - an attack on the dead - and it is just hurting innocent families."
