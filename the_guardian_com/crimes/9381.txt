We write as five grieving mothers, whose daughters were imprisoned for non-violent offences, but who died in the so-called care of the Prison Service: Sarah Campbell (Styal, January 2003); Jennifer Clifford (Bullwood Hall, February 2003); Sheena Kotecha (Brockhill, April 2004); Paige Tapp (Send, April 2004); Rebecca Turner (Low Newton, July 2004).The Prison Service has now reported the death of yet another woman prisoner, (Record female jail suicides feared, October 14), Mandy Pearson, 37, at New Hall, in West Yorkshire. She is the 12th woman to die this year and the third inmate to die at New Hall in the past six months. Lessons are not being learned, and the crisis in women's prisons continues. Insufficient regard is being paid to the legal duty of care owed to these vulnerable women.We accept that offenders' crimes create victims, but our daughters' deaths - and the deaths of other prisoners - have created a further set of victims. Prison is supposed to be about loss of freedom, not loss of life. Magistrates and judges must act responsibly and stop sending women, many with psychiatric and drug-dependency problems. to the punitive regime of a prison, when they are in need of treatment and care.
