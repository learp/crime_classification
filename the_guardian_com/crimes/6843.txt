The implication of Deborah Orr's piece (G2, 21 January) on the life sentence passed on Frances Inglis is that the judge had a choice and made the wrong one. She elides the fact that a life sentence is the only sentence legally possible for murder. Successive governments have set their face against suggestions, supported by the judiciary, that the sentence for murder should be discretionary. Perhaps Ms Orr might like to take these suggestions up, having done the homework first.Paul CollinsSenior resident judge, Central London Civil Justice Centre• Thank you for the excellent article by Deborah Orr. I have long thought that judges should be more specific on why a custodial sentence is necessary: what part is deterrent, what part punishment, what part protection of the public? In the case of Frances Inglis, if punishment is regarded as right, what good will jail do?Dirk TinbergenLeicester
