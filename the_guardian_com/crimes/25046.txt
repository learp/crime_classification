Two men have been charged in connection with the death of Jolanta Bledaite, the Lithuanian woman whose head was found on a Scottish beach by two children.The men, aged 19 and 40, both Lithuanians, are expected to appear at Forfar sheriff court today. Police divers recovered more body parts in a suitcase at the bottom of Arbroath harbour at the weekend after an extensive underwater search. Forensic science experts are checking whether the dismembered remains belonged to Bledaite. Bledaite's head, wrapped in a plastic bag, was discovered by two sisters, aged eight and 11, who were playing on Arbroath beach last Tuesday. Officers searching the shoreline then found two hands. Detective chief inspector Graham McMillan, the investigating officer, said: "It's still too early for me to say specifically what body parts are contained within the suitcase. The contents of the case will have to be emptied and examined under a very controlled environment within the police mortuary at headquarters in Dundee." He said that police were continuing to trace the victim's last movements. Officers were searching properties in Brechin and carrying out door-to-door inquiries in the area, he said. An appeal for information has already led to hundreds of calls from the public. McMillan urged people to continue to provide help. A flat in Earlsden House in Southesk Street, Brechin, was sealed off by Tayside police officers. The building houses migrant workers from eastern Europe. The victim came from Alytus in Lithuania. Her father, Sarunas Bleda, 60, was told of his daughter's death last Friday.
