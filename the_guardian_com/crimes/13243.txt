Levi Bellfield, who lived 50 yards (46 metres) from where 13-year-old Milly Dowler was last seen alive in Walton-on-Thames, seemed to have escaped the net when police, conducting house-to-house inquiries, knocked 10 times at his rented flat without response but made no inquiries of the landlord as to who lived there.Bellfield went on to murder Marsha McDonnell, 19, in 2003, and a French student, Amelie Delagrange, 22, in 2004, by striking them over the head with a blunt instrument; and to attempt to murder Kate Sheedy, 19, by running her over in his car, also in 2004.
