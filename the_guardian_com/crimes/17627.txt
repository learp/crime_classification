The former leader of Hull city council threatened yesterday to take legal action against Sky TV after he was cleared of five charges of indecent assault against a teenage boy.Colin Inglis, who also chaired Humberside police authority, was cleared on Friday of a sixth charge involving the boy, who is now 37 and cannot be named for legal reasons. The alleged victim lived in a children's home in the city more than 20 years ago. He had told Leeds crown court that Mr Inglis, then a social worker, had performed oral sex on him twice at the Spring Cottage home. Other charges related to an alleged indecent assault in a shower during a camping trip in Rhyl, a second in the shower after a game of squash at a Hull sports centre and a third in the bathroom of the children's home.The jury, which took four hours to reach majority verdicts yesterday, had heard that Mr Inglis's relationship with the boy had been examined in a 1997 police investigation which had not led to any charges. In January, the Independent Police Complaints Commission asked for the second inquiry, prompted by a Sky TV investigation, to be broadened to include the earlier allegations.Mr Inglis had originally faced 14 counts of indecent assault but he was found not guilty of eight of them earlier in the trial on the orders of the judge, James Stewart QC. He told the jury that although Mr Inglis had been charged with 10 counts relating to oral sex, the former resident of the children's home had said in the witness box this had happened only twice.Graham Hyland QC, prosecuting, had told the court the boy woke regularly to find Mr Inglis standing in his room after performing oral sex on him and had found him masturbating by his bed.Mr Inglis, 49, who has always strenuously denied the allegations, chose not to give evidence in the two-week trial. His barrister, Malcolm Swift QC, described the boy, now a married and working as a financial adviser, as a liar who had a propensity to make false allegations.In a statement read outside court, Mr Inglis said: "I've always believed strongly in the presumption of innocence, the right to silence and the right to trial by jury. Despite attempts by many politicians of both main parties over the past dozen years to water down these principles, this trial has reinforced these beliefs." He said he would discuss with his lawyers what action he might take against Sky and two newspapers.Mr Inglis hit the headlines in 2004 when he refused to comply with an order from David Blunkett, the then home secretary, to suspend Humberside's chief constable, David Westwood, following the Bichard report into the Soham murders.Sky News said the channel stood by "its investigation and its related reports", which were "conducted to the highest journalistic standards".
