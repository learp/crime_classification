Tom Hayes, a 33-year-old former UBS and Citigroup trader, has been charged with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud for his alleged role in manipulating the price of benchmark interest rates at the heart of the banking industry.Hayes was one of three individuals arrested in December as part of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office which has been pursuing a criminal investigation into so-called Libor-fixing for almost a year.All three were questioned, and residential addresses searched, before they were released on police bail. Hayes on Tuesday morning became the first to be charged by the SFO during a scheduled meeting at Bishopsgate police station. In a short press release prosecutors did not give further details of the alleged offences or even when they were said to have taken place.Hayes must now appear before Westminster magistrates court for a hearing at 10am on Thursday, where limited further details of the charges are expected to be read out. Given the seriousness of the alleged offences the case is likely then to be swiftly referred up to a crown court for pre-trial hearings.Hayes' lawyers declined to comment.News that Hayes was to be charged on Tuesday morning leaked to the Wall Street Journal on Monday night. The Journal noted he had not commented on the allegations but had sent a text in January saying "this goes much much higher than me".Hayes has already been charged in December by the US authorities with conspiracy, wire fraud and an anti-trust violation. It has been reported that he has denied any wrongdoing.After a £290m fine on Barclays a year ago exposed the Libor-rigging scandal, the government created the parliamentary commission on banking standards to make recommendations on cleaning up the City.The commission, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, is due to report on Wednesday and is expected to call for individual bankers to take more responsibility for their actions and call for bonuses to be deferred for 10 years to reduce risks being taken.The commission has taken a wide-range of evidence and chancellor George Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech later on Wednesday to set out reforms to the banking industry and possibly kickstart a sell-off of the stakes in state-owned banks.After Barclays was fined, Swiss bank UBS and bailed-out bank Royal Bank of Scotland were both subjected to disciplinary action by regulators in the US and UK. The UK market regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has said that it has four other cases of Libor rigging under investigation.The SFO has been looking into possible criminal offences since July last year. It has received additional funding for its Libor investigation of £1.5m each year for three years.
