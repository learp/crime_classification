A ship featured in one of the Pirates of the Caribbean films has been targeted by thieves.Clothing bearing the ship's insignia, a lifebuoy, a US flag and a waterproof suit were stolen on Saturday morning while HMS Bounty was docked at Custom House Quay in Greenock, Inverclyde.A Strathclyde police spokeswoman said officers were called at 7.20am, about three hours after the items are believed to have been taken. "The immersion suit and life ring were later recovered," the spokeswoman said.Police are looking for two teenagers seen around the time of the thefts. They were described as 16-18 with slim builds and light brown hair.The original HMS Bounty was the scene of a mutiny more than 200 years ago when the master's mate, Fletcher Christian, angered and humiliated by continual abuse from Captain Bligh, took control of the ship.Three weeks out of Tahiti and en route to the West Indies with a cargo of breadfruit plants, Christian and the mutineers put the captain and 18 crew in the Bounty's launch. Bligh navigated the launch more than 3,000 miles to safety in 41 days using only a sextant and a pocket watch, according to tallshipbounty.org, which provides information on the replica ship and the ports where it docks.In the 1960s, the ship featured in Mutiny on the Bounty, starring Marlon Brando, and more recently it appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.
