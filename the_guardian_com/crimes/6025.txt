When he won more than £7m on the Lottery after buying a ticket on day release from prison, Iorworth Hoare might have thought his fortunes had changed for the better.Jailed for life in 1989 for the attempted rape of a 59-year-old teacher, Hoare, a serial rapist, was released in 2004 shortly after his win. He settled into a quiet lifestyle in a semi-detached redbrick house in Sunderland, indulging his fondness for expensive art and antiques.But at no stage did Hoare, 56, think of compensating his victim who received a modest £5,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board following his conviction.Hoare's seeming indifference, however, came back to haunt him as he quickly earned the sobriquet 'the lotto rapist'. Newspapers started fulminating on the iniquities of allowing prisoners to gamble. There was a tabloid feeding frenzy as reporters desperately attempted to track him down, and public outrage when it emerged tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money was being spent on protecting him in a safe house, as well as lewd stories from his neighbours who accused him of being a peeping Tom.And now Hoare, who was twice imprisoned for sex attacks in the Seventies and Eighties, finds himself unwillingly dragged back into the limelight. His victim, who still suffers nightmares, will this week make legal history when she brings a groundbreaking case for damages - which could run into millions of pounds - in the House of Lords. The case, the first of its kind to go the highest court in England and Wales, could establish a legal precedent if it is successful because it would effectively extend the deadline within which victims can sue for compensation.DLA Piper, the law firm acting for the woman who is known only as Mrs A, is pursuing a civil claim for damages against Hoare for assault and battery and psychiatric injury.'I decided to take this claim forward in order to fight for justice for myself but far more important for others who will also face similar injustice in the face of an unfair and out-of-date legal statute,' Mrs A told The Observer. 'The claim is not about money but about trying to achieve a just result by either persuading the judiciary to change the law or at the very least drawing attention to the existing legal anomaly which results in such unfair results.'Mrs A's decision to take her case to the Lords comes after she failed to win damages in the lower courts. As the law currently stands, a claim for damages due to intentional sexual assault must be brought within a six-year limitation period. But her lawyers will argue this limit needs to be addressed.'We want to see a change in the law to ensure Mrs A is fairly compensated for the damage and suffering she has had to endure as a result of being attacked by Mr Hoare,' said the victim's lawyer, Damian Crosse.'My client and others like her should be able to gain justice through the civil courts and there is clearly an anomaly in the law as it stands that is preventing them from doing so. If the claim now being pursued by my client had been issued within six years of the date of the attack there is no doubt that she would have been successful in her civil claim against Hoare.'Currently the courts have the discretion to extend a three-year limitation period for civil claims for damages in respect of personal injuries. But this does not extend to claims involving a deliberate assault.Mrs A's lawyers, who are working on a no-win no-fee basis and will donate any proceeds they make from the case to rape support charities, argue that intentional assault cases should have the benefit of a discretionary extension.They are supported in their view by a study by the Law Commission which has recommended courts should have discretion in individual cases.'We want to see the present law changed to allow claims of genuine merit to be pursued through the courts and we are willing to fight as far as we have to in trying to achieve that aim,' Crosse said.'The law on limitation has to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of claimants and defendants. As it currently stands the law does not get that balance right in intentional sexual assault cases.'If the law were changed in the manner we suggest, then the court would still need to be persuaded to exercise its discretion in favour of the claimant and extend the time for bringing a claim.'Perhaps some good may come from Hoare's indifference after all.
