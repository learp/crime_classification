A man who faked his own death so his former wife could claim a £300,000 payout on their life insurance policy was caught out when he visited his GP six months after he "died".Ahmad Akhtary, 34, got hold of a fraudulent death certificate from Afghanistan stating he had died of a "brain trauma" after an accident there in 2006.His ex-wife, Anne, a 43-year-old mother of triplets, then submitted a claim to Norwich Union for the £300,000 payable on their joint life policy if one of them died, a court heard. But it was not long before the unsophisticated plot went wrong because Akhtary continued to live openly in Gloucester and keep appointments with his GP.James Cranfield, prosecuting, told Gloucester crown court that Norwich Union investigators were alerted to the scam when they heard that Akhtary had been to see his GP six months after his alleged death. No payment was ever made to the couple.The investigators confronted his former wife about her claim and she admitted the truth. Akhtary was caught out when his fingerprints were found on the Afghan document and he eventually pleaded guilty. His ex-wife also admitted the attempted deception as well as a charge of forgery. Judge Mark Horton sentenced both to nine months' jail, suspended for two years. Akhtary was ordered to do 60 hours of unpaid community work and his ex-wife 40 hours.
