Jury selection has begun in the trial of the PR guru Max Clifford, who is accused of a string of historical indecent assaults.The 70-year-old denies 11 counts of the offence relating to seven alleged victims, aged from 14 to 19, between 1966 and 1984.On Wednesday, jury selection began at Southwark crown court and it is expected that the prosecution case will be opened by Rosina Cottage QC on Thursday.Wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and patterned tie, Clifford listened to proceedings through a hearing loop from the glass-walled dock.Eighteen potential jurors were chosen from a pool of around 60, and a final panel is due to be sworn in on Thursday.Judge Anthony Leonard QC told them: "The trial cannot be heard without a jury. It is a fundamental principle of our justice system that someone accused of a serious offence is tried by a jury selected at random."He said sitting on a trial expected to last up to six weeks might be "a considerable burden", but that jurors might find service "an interesting and responsible" experience.The potential jurors were read a list of names and asked if they knew any of the people mentioned.The judge also asked them: "Are you or any family member or close friend connected to the Yewtree investigation?"He described the inquiry as one "looking into a number of alleged offences of historic indecent assaults".The third question posed was: "Have you or any family member or close friend worked with or for Max Clifford in a professional capacity, or in voluntary or charity work?"Clifford, famed for representing celebrities including Simon Cowell and Jade Goody, was arrested in December 2012 and charged last April.Sending the panel home until Thursday at 10am, the judge warned them not to discuss the case with anyone."Do not speak to anyone and do not let anyone speak to you about the case you are going to be trying."You know it involves Max Clifford and you know it involves indecent assault so please do not let anyone speak to you about that."He also warned them about being influenced by publicity and told them not to search on the internet for any information relating to the case, saying: "You are not permitted to look on the internet for any information in relation to the case you are trying."Outside court Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, said the 15 months since his arrest had aged him.He said: "It has been for 15 months a very dark cloud for myself, my family and loved ones."I stick by everything I have said in the past."He left with his lawyers in a waiting taxi.
