Three men who spent a total of 46 years in prison because of miscarriages of justice today lost their legal battle not to have to pay "living expenses" for the time they spent behind bars.Judges at the House of Lords decided by a four to one majority that those wrongfully jailed must pay back 25% of their compensation.The case was brought by Michael Hickey and his cousin Vincent, who were wrongly convicted of the murder of Carl Bridgewater, a newspaper boy, in 1978, and Michael O'Brien, who was wrongly convicted of murdering a Cardiff newsagent in 1988.Michael and Vincent Hickey's convictions were quashed by the court of appeal in 1997 after 18 years in prison and they were awarded £990,000 and £506,220 respectively - subject to 25% deductions for their saved "board and lodgings" expenses.Mr O'Brien was awarded £670,000 compensation after spending 10 years in jail. His award was subject to the same deductions.The three men appealed to the House of Lords against a court of appeal ruling that the independent assessor - who decides the level of compensation paid in miscarriages of justice cases - was entitled to make deductions for the living expenses they would have faced had they not been locked up.The law lords also dismissed a second challenge, again by a majority of four to one, over deductions from compensation for past criminality.Lord Brown said it was not hard to understand why the deduction for "saved living expenses" had aroused strong feelings among men "incarcerated in prison for many years for crimes they never committed".But he said that to award them their loss of earnings without taking these expenses into account would be to over-compensate them.Lord Bingham agreed, saying it was the assessor's task to work out the true figure for loss of earnings.He said if the prisoners were awarded the full sum, "they would in reality be better off than if they had earned the money as free men, since as free men they would have had to spend the minimum necessary to keep themselves alive".Only Lord Rodger did not agree with the deduction for living expenses. He said it was not hard to see why the men would feel that they were in effect paying for their keep during the long years when they were wrongly deprived of their liberty.Andrew Neilson, a spokesman for the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the decision was "disappointing".He said: "Deducting living expenses from the compensation awarded to victims of miscarriages of justice is unnecessarily vindictive and it's disappointing that the law lords have endorsed this policy."Ultimately these were innocent men deprived of their liberty for many years. In truth, there's no price that could be paid for those lost years in custody and to reduce what compensation they have received to pay for 'board and lodgings' is petty and mean."
