A man has been sentenced to at least 10 years in prison after he admitted the murder of a student following a So Solid Crew gig 14 years ago.Adebayo Ekun, 39, was sentenced to life with a minimum of 10 years for killing Marcus Hall, 18, who was repeatedly stabbed, beaten and stamped on after the concert at a nightclub in Luton in March 2001, Bedfordshire police said.Five people were convicted between 2001 and 2002 for the part they played in his murder, but Ekun avoided arrest and fled the country. He was eventually located in Nigeria in February as part of an operation involving the National Crime Agency and the Nigerian authorities.He pleaded guilty at Luton crown court on Friday. DS Mark Devine said: “The conviction of Adebayo Ekun highlights the fact that if you commit, or are involved in, serious crime such as this, there is no place to hide.“Despite the passing of 14 years, Bedfordshire police has continued the hunt for the final outstanding offender to this vicious and brutal murder.“This was a vicious attack that cost a young man his life. This group thought they were above the law, but violence is not acceptable and we hope this gives a strong message that we are committed to do all in our power to catch those responsible, no matter how long it takes.”
