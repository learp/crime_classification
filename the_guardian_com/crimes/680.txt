A City banker has appeared in court charged with strangling his wife at their London home. Neil Ellerbeck, who worked for HSBC at the bank's Canary Wharf headquarters, was arrested on Friday after paramedics called to the couple's house found the body of his wife Katherine. He was charged last night with her murder and today appeared before magistrates in Enfield, north London, who remanded him in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on February 23. A postmortem found Mrs Ellerbeck, 46, died of asphyxiation and manual compression of the neck. Ellerbeck, 45, had been arrested at the scene in Canford Close, Enfield, and taken to an east London police station for questioning. HSBC denied suggestions that Ellerbeck had lost his job as a result of the banking crisis. Ellerbeck was chief investment officer in the liquidity business of the bank's asset management division, according to the agenda for a presentation he gave on behalf of the bank in Singapore last year.
