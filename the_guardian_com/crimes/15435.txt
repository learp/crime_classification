The government policy on antisocial behaviour is "fanning the flames" of the problem and causing order to breakdown on housing estates, a solicitor who specialises in neighbour disputes warned today.Ben Taylor, a partner with Manchester-based solicitors Glaisyers, now spends all of his working life on antisocial behaviour cases as a result of Manchester city council's increasingly litigious approach to the problem.He said as one of the government's 10 "trailblazer" areas for tackling antisocial behaviour, Manchester was encouraged to increase the number of antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) and court proceedings rather than dealing with the disputes themselves.As Home Office minister Hazel Blears chose Manchester to launch a new nationwide crackdown on nuisance neighbours today, Mr Taylor said the government's approach was also encouraging residents to make "malicious" complaints against their neighbours.He warned: "Estates in Manchester are imploding because of the council's failure to listen to both sides in neighbour disputes."Speaking to SocietyGuardian.co.uk, Mr Taylor said resorting to courts and Asbos was "fanning the flames of an already difficult situation".He argued that most disputes should be dealt with by mediation rather than the courts.But Ms Blears insisted that tough action was the answer. "It's clear to me that tough enforcement, the possibility of looking at eviction, actually does concentrate minds wonderfully."She launched new Home Office research into 100 of Britain's most difficult families, which found that 39 of them said their behaviour had improved as a result of enforcement action such as Asbos or the threat of eviction.The research also showed that a quarter of the families had previously been evicted from social housing.Ms Blears admitted: "There is no point in just moving families from one place to another, if you simply move the problem on to the next set of neighbours."She said intensive family support, including parenting classes, would be offered in another 50 areas. She said this support would provide nuisance neighbours with a "last chance" to turn around their behaviour.A spokesman for the homelessness charity Shelter said threatening eviction should only be used as a last resort.No one at Manchester council was available to respond to Mr Taylor's comments.
