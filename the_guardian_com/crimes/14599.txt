A reward of Â£1,000 has been offered by an animal rights charity for information about the killer of a number of common seals which were found after a suspected shooting in Shetland.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said it would pay the reward after the arrest and conviction of the "person or persons responsible for this horrific crime".Animal welfare officials launched an investigation last week after three of the common seals, which have limited protection under conservation legislation, were found with gunshot wounds to the head. Two were females carrying large pups.Peta argues that research by psychologists and criminologists suggests those who persecute animals are often violent towards humans. Suzanne Barnard, a spokeswoman for the charity, said: "Animal abusers are cowards. They take their issues out on the most defenceless beings available to them."There are strong suspicions that all six were deliberately and illegally killed in the Bridge of Walls area on the west coast of Shetland's main island.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA), which has legal powers to investigate wildlife crimes and reports to Scottish prosecutors, has appealed for witnesses.This is the latest in a series of seal persecution cases in Scotland.In March last year, a trawlerman from Shetland was jailed for 80 days, one of the longest recent prison terms for a wildlife offence, after he admitted beating 21 baby seals to death on a remote island in 2008.Conservationists believe some salmon farms and fishermen are guilty of deliberately and persistently persecuting seals because they can damage fish farm cages and compete with inshore fisheries. The charge is rejected by the industry.The number of common seals, also known as harbour seals, has fallen sharply in many areas of the UK.The fall has been particularly steep in the northern isles of Orkney and Shetland, where they fell by 42% from 2001 to 2006.The SSPCA was alerted to the latest discovery after Scottish Natural Heritage staff found the bodies on the shore.Three of the six had clear exit wounds, while the other three were too decomposed to establish cause of death. The charity fears other seals may also have been shot.Senior Inspector Ron Patterson, based on Shetland, said this was a serious wildlife crime and has started a joint investigation with Northern constabulary."Common seal numbers are decreasing and the illegal shooting of seals is a contributing factor," he said."In fact, it's almost wrong to call these animals common seals because they are gradually becoming a rare sight in the waters around Shetland."Shooting a seal at any time of year is a very cruel and callous act, but June is the time when common seals are actively breeding and having their pups."
