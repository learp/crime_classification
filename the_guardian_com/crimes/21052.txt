The husband whose bride was murdered in a carjacking on their South African honeymoon is receiving medical assistance to help him deal with the trauma, his brother said tonight.Shrien Dewani has told how he was dragged screaming away from wife Anni, 28, after being attacked by gunmen on 13 November as they visited a township in Cape Town. She was found shot dead in the vehicle the next day.Dewani has also rejected speculation that he was somehow involved in the incident earlier this month, saying: "People who suggest this could not have seen us together."Tonight his brother Preyen Dewani issued a statement through publicists Max Clifford Associates dismissing "totally false accusations blaming him for what happened to his wife from people seeking to divert this matter away from security in South Africa for ordinary people". He said: "Shrien is having to deal with the tragic loss of his chosen life partner on their honeymoon as well as the horrific ordeal of being held up and terrorised at gunpoint before his wife was brutally murdered."He added: "At this stage I would like to make it clear that Shrien has not been asked to go back to South Africa."As you can imagine he has been severely traumatised by what happened to Anni and himself ... he is currently receiving medical assistance and help to deal with the awful trauma that he is experiencing."His family are in constant contact with the police in South Africa and are fully co-operating with their investigation."Clifford said: "He is in a dreadful state, like anybody who has been through what he has been through, being on top of the world and then everything destroyed."Shrien Dewani, from Westbury-on-Trym in Bristol, has described how he saw a man hammering on the windscreen of their VW Sharan taxi before gunmen broke into the vehicle."I tried to cover Anni with my body. She started to scream and cry out hysterically," the 30-year-old businessman has said.After shoving their driver in the back, the carjackers drove around at speed and almost lost control, also holding a gun to his head and threatening to kill his wife, he said."I was clinging to Anni for all I was worth - begging them to let us both get out of the car together. But they wouldn't listen."They couldn't get me out because the child locks were activated - so they ended up dragging me struggling and screaming out of the window."The couple's driver on the night, Zola Tonga, appeared in court on Monday charged with murder.He and another man, Mzwamadoda Qwabe, 26, from Khayelitsha, appeared at the Wynberg regional court in Cape Town to face charges of murder and hijacking, the South African Police Service (SAPS) said.The case was adjourned to next Monday while further investigations are carried out.The Dewanis were driving through Gugulethu township in Cape Town when the raiders struck. Dewani and Tonga were forced from the car and flagged down a motorist for help. Anni Dewani's body was discovered the next day inside the abandoned car. A post-mortem examination showed she had been shot.A third person, 26-year-old Xolile Mmgeni from Khayelitsha, is due back in court tomorrow to face charges of murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances.
