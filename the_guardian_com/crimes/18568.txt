Police believe they have identified the man whose body was found burnt beyond recognition in a north London park two weeks ago.He was an 18-year-old of Sri Lankan origin who lived in the Wembley area. He had been battered around the head with a blunt instrument, doused in petrol, and set alight. The man's Sri Lankan uncle came forward after seeing a forensic artist's impression resembling his nephew, who went missing since shortly before February 19, when the corpse was discovered in Roe Green Park, Kingsbury. Police are travelling to collect DNA samples from the suspected victim's parents, who are not in the country. In a further development, a member of the public has claimed to have seen three young men loading what could have been a body into the back of a white five-door Nissan Micra, registration H767 HEW, outside the Palm Beach, a Sri Lankan restaurant and community centre in Wembley, on the night before the corpse was discovered. Detective Superintendent Nigel Mawer, leading the murder investigation, said: "The pathologist's view is that the victim was alive when he arrived in the park. If the person bundled into the car at the Palm Beach was alive, then there is a good chance it is the victim. We have interviewed all the staff at the restaurant and there is no indication they are involved." A staff member, who did not want to be named, said the victim was a customer: "He used to come in with his uncle once every couple of months. We don't know their names." Police are awaiting results of tests on a yellow grit bin, near to where the body was found, which had "burn lol" scrawled on it. "Lol" is a text message abbreviation for "laugh out loud". They are also studying CCTV from near the restaurant and from local petrol stations that might have sold a can of petrol. Three teenagers have been arrested and bailed to return to a north London police station later this month.
