Burglars are so good at robbing people's houses they deserve to be regarded as experts in their field on a par with pilots, academics have concluded.They go about their business with such speed and efficiency they should be classed along with those who perform complicated tasks automatically, such as musicians and chess players, according to Claire Nee and Amy Meenaghan, psychologists at Portsmouth University.In-depth interviews with 50 serial burglars about how they carry out break-ins showed that getting into someone's home and stealing their valuables, while being able to simultaneously listen for noise, is a classic example of 'expertise'.A typical burglary takes just 20 minutes and yields around Â£800 worth of stolen items such as cash, cameras and credit cards.The research, 'Expert decision-making in burglars', is published in the British Journal of Criminology.
