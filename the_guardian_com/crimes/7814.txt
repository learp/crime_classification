Two more men were today arrested in connection with the drive-by shooting of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan in Nottingham.The men, from Nottingham, were arrested in the city early this morning. Detectives were questioning them about the youngster's murder.The development came as officers continued to question a man arrested in London on Monday night. Four others detained with him were yesterday released without charge. Danielle was shot dead yards from her home in the St Ann's area of Nottingham on Saturday. She had been returning from the city's annual Goose Fair with a group of friends when she was hit by one of several shots fired from a passing gold-coloured car. Nottingham detectives said they were unable to explain why Danielle or her friends might have been targeted by gunmen, and fear she was the victim of a random attack. Families living close to the scene of the shooting claim the area is a haven for drug dealers and users, and two weeks ago began a petition calling for CCTV cameras to be installed. Danielle's mother, Paula Platt, yesterday spoke for the first time about how she had cradled her dying daughter after the apparently motiveless attack. Mrs Platt said her last words to Danielle were: "I love you. Come back to us, I will be waiting for you." Her daughter's reply - and her last words before she lost consciousness - were: "I love you too, mum."Mrs Platt, 32, said she had been left feeling "numb" by the death of her daughter. "I am crying inside. My heart is in two, three, four pieces. It's in bits," she said. "There are no words that can describe how I feel. If you take the worst you could feel and multiply it by a million, it would not even come close."
