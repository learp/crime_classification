Choudary, Izzadeen and Benares all attended.Police arrested Benares at the three-bedroom terraced house where he lives with his wife in March 2012. His laptop, mobile and three hard drives were seized and later checked.Benares claimed he was not an extremist, that his interest in the material found by police was just curiosity and that he wanted to understand both moderate and extreme Islam so that he could use the information to counter arguments about extremism.He said the 11 September 2011 demonstration was the only one he attended, the court heard. He noted it was a lawful demonstration and the reason he went was to support and highlight the plight of innocent Muslims being killed in Afghanistan. He did not support the actions of a minority, the jury heard.
