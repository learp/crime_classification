The uncle of a five-year-old girl who was mauled to death by his pit bull terrier was today jailed for eight weeks.Kiel Simpson was sentenced at Liverpool magistrates court after pleading guilty to owning the dangerous dog, called Reuben, which killed Ellie Lawrenson.The child died when the animal attacked her at her grandmother's home in St Helens, Merseyside, during the early hours of New Year's Day.Last month, the court was told that the dog had been banished from the house after biting Simpson's 19-year-old sister, Kelsey, on November 21.Simpson was jailed after District Judge Alan Jones said he did not accept he had been given official advice that he could keep the animal.The judge added that the 23-year-old's claim to have asked his family to leave the one-year-old American pitbull outside the house was not enough to absolve him of responsibility. "I don't accept that a police officer or any person giving advice would have said it was enough to keep the dog muzzled and on a lead in public if you properly told them what type of dog it was," he said. "Any court will have experience of dogs like these being used in connection with criminal offences such as drugs trafficking. You must have known this as well, since you have a serious conviction for drugs trafficking. "Of all people, you in particular should not have had this dog."Judge Jones said the dog was "of a type nobody has been allowed to possess for the last 15 years, and for good reason ... they are capable of inflicting serious injuries to any able-bodied person".He added that the dog's "tragic" attack on Ellie was "something which was foreseeable" because it had already behaved aggressively towards another member of the family.Earlier, Paul Blasbery, prosecuting, had told the court that Simpson bought the dog from a man in a pub shortly before Christmas 2005. It was shot dead by a Merseyside police marksman shortly after Ellie was mauled and its body examined by a police expert, who said it was one of the most powerful pit bull terriers he had ever seen."The dog was devoid of any fat and was fantastically well conditioned, according to the officer," Mr Blasbery said."The fact that it was only 23in square, weighed 33.9kg and was in such fine physical condition, with exceptionally well-defined muscle, would have made it an incredibly powerful dog with immeasurable strength to bite and shake."Simpson, who showed no emotion as the sentence was passed, was led into the cells handcuffed to a guard.
