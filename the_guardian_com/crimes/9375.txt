Detectives began questioning the murder suspect Mark Hobson yesterday after he was escorted from hospital in handcuffs by five police officers.The former pub bouncer and binman was discharged at 7.15am from Harrogate district hospital, where he had been treated for two days for dehydration and minor cuts. He was kept under armed guard in the hospital after his arrest in a makeshift hiding place behind a filling station near York where he was recognised on Sunday. He had been on the run for a week after the killings of twin sisters Claire and Diane Sanderson, 27, and Jim and Joan Britton, who were 80 and 82. Police forensic teams continued searching three taped-off areas in Shipton-by- Beningbrough, where Mr Hobson, 34, finally broke cover seven miles from the Brittons' home in Strensall village. He bought matches and bottled water from 79-year-old Derrick North, a garage owner, who recognised him from police photographs. Forensic work was focused on a narrow gap between a hedge and the garage's septic tank, where Mr Hobson gave himself up, an area of flattened wheat in a nearby field and a garden and rubbish bin store behind Shipton community centre. Hundreds of North Yorkshire police officers had scoured villages round York after profiling and Mr Hobson's lack of money, passport and survival skills convinced the inquiry team that he would be holed up nearby. He will be questioned about the beating of his partner, Claire Sanderson, whose naked body was found nine days ago in binliners at the flat they shared in Camblesforth village, south of Selby. Claire is thought to have been dead for some days when her twin, Diane, answered a telephone call on Saturday July 17 from the flat, where she was strangled. Mr Hobson, a divorced father of one, will also be questioned about the murder of the Brittons, who were stabbed with their own kitchen knife in their Â£400,000 detached home. He left the hospital with a blanket over his head as he was led to an armoured police van.
