Police investigating the murder of Jill Dando, the BBC television presenter, are said to be examining new evidence that she may have been killed by a Serbian hitman in revenge for a Nato air strike on Belgrade in 1999.The Sunday Times reported yesterday that several witnesses saw a man claim in a Belgrade bar in 2001 that the 1999 killing was a revenge attack before he took a bow and applause for the killing.The tip-off about the alleged confession during a drinking session in the Portobello Bar came from a call to the Crimestoppers hotline, the paper said.It reopens a line of inquiry about a Serbian link to the point-blank shooting of the 37-year old on the doorstep of her Fulham home that was ruled out by the time Barry George was arrested. George was convicted of murder in 2001 but the verdict was overturned last August at a retrial."We will look at any new lines of inquiry as it remains an open case and nobody is in prison for the murder," a spokesman for the Met said.The paper quoted a British businessman who apparently witnessed the man's boast. He said: "During the conversation with his friends it turned to what had happened in the UK with Jill Dando. The friends of his actually said, 'Well, this was the man that was involved in that.' He took a bow over that because he claimed he had something to do with it. He stood up and his friends applauded him strenuously."
