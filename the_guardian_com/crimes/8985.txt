Cameron said he had been "picking up a few bits of salad" when the theft occurred at about 6.30 last night.Onlooker Gary Yankee, 38, told the Mirror: "He must have been looking around for about five minutes as if he couldn't believe it had gone."He just kept on saying... 'But I locked it'."Today Cameron appealed for the bike to be returned. "If anyone has seen it I would very much like it back. To me it was absolutely priceless," he told the Evening Standard. He added: "I was cycling home and stopped to pick up some things for supper. I chained the bike through the wheel then put it around one of those bollard things. I have reported it using the police's new online facility but I'm not expecting to get it back any time soon."A shop worker told the paper: "He was embarrassed and a bit annoyed. He was going round talking to people asking them if they had seen it - most people didn't recognise him."The theft happened outside the Portobello Road branch of Tesco at about 6.30pm yesterday. A Conservative spokesman said today: "Obviously David is pretty hacked off."A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "A member of the public reported the theft of a bike on our website. The incident happened between 6.30 and 6.45."Asked if there was CCTV in the area, he said: "That's not something we would discuss on the theft of a bike."
