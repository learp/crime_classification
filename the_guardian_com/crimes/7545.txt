A climate change protester was arrested yesterday for breaching his bail conditions by attending the climate camp at the Kingsnorth power station in Kent.Paul Morrozzo, 41, was identified and arrested by police at the camp gates. Another protester who was not breaching bail but who refused to identify herself was also removed. After a long standoff four more protesters on bail were let into the camp amid cheers and chants of "break your bail" from the crowds.Before his arrest, Morrozzo said: "It just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world."The five protesters were part of a group of 29 activists arrested in June when they tried to stop a train outside the Drax power plant near Selby, North Yorkshire. Bail conditions included a ban on them approaching any power station and attending this year's climate camp, where up to 2,000 people are expected this week.There was a heavy police presence at Kingsnorth yesterday, with helicopters flying overhead and tense scenes as officers searched protesters and checked identities. Protesters inside the camp booed about 25 police officers blocking the path of new arrivals and the supply of deliveries.Activists are at the week-long event near Kingsnorth village to protest against the construction of a Â£1bn coal-fired power station by the energy provider E.ON.
