Two members of a gang jailed for their roles in stealing Â£53m in Britain's biggest cash raid have failed in attempts to overturn their convictions.Judges at the court of appeal dismissed applications by Lea Rusha, 37, and Jetmir Bucpapa, 28, who were convicted at the Old Bailey in January 2008 for their parts in the raid on a Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent, in February 2006.The pair, both jailed for a minimum of 15 years, had their applications for permission to appeal against conviction rejected by Lord Justice Moses, sitting with two other judges, who said, "The offence for which they were convicted was notorious."When the pair and others were sentenced by Mr Justice Penry-Davey in 2008 he said they had taken part in "organised banditry".
