I would like to express my sympathy to Mr and Mrs Heaton on their tragic loss."After considering the evidence, I am satisfied there is sufficient to charge Andrew Partington with manslaughter and criminal damage. The decision was taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors."A 32-year-old man, a gas fitter who is believed to have examined the boiler at Partington's home days before the explosion, remains on police bail pending further inquiries.
