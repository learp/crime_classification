The home secretary, David Blunkett, was today accused of gross policy and financial mismanagement of the prison service after it emerged that governors have been ordered to make emergency spending cuts.Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for penal reform, blamed the cash crisis on the huge rise in the prison population during the home secretary's time in office, which she said threatened jail safety and rehabilitation programmes.Ms Crook said the government policy of jailing increasing numbers of petty criminals, who could be more appropriately dealt with in the community, was stretching jails to breaking point.Her comments came as it emerged that the director general of the Prison Service, Phil Wheatley, has ordered governors to avoid all "discretionary spending" over the next four months to try to head off a Â£31m deficit. There will be an immediate freeze on staff numbers and repairs, according to an official memo seen by the Independent. According to the paper, Mr Wheatley admits that prison activity could be scaled down and that some jail wings might have to be shut.Ms Crook accused the home secretary of letting his strategic management of the prison system become "emotional". "There is no strategy at either a financial or policy level. More offenders are being sent to prison regardless of whether that is the best place to deal with them. NHS hospitals don't take every patient referred to them by GPs, we need that sort of strategic approach in the Prison Service."She warned that the cuts would put both prisoners and jail staff at risk, predictin g rising levels of self-harm and violence if prisons cut back on education and training courses.She said: "The chaos will be suffered by staff and prisoners. If inmates can't go to a workshop or a rehabilitation programme and have to be locked in their cells due to staff shortages, they are only going to become even more angry. There's more risk of riots and a greater likelihood they come out and steal my handbag and mug my mother or daughter."Juliet Lyons, director of the Prison Reform Trust, added: "If it is to stand any chance of reducing re-offending rates, rather than cutting already overstretched prison budgets, government should concentrate on cutting numbers by reserving prison for serious and violent offenders, diverting the mentally ill and drug addicts into healthcare, avoiding any needless use of remand and promoting confidence in some impressive alternatives to custody for petty criminals."
