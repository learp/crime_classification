A man who went on the run from his trial over an armed robbery at Heathrow airport handed himself into police today.Peter Blake, 57, of Notting Hill, London, surrendered to officers at the royal courts of justice in the centre of the capital.He is one of four men facing the first major criminal trial in England and Wales without a jury in more than 400 years, over the £1.75m robbery at Heathrow in 2004.Blake walked unnoticed from the royal courts of justice last Wednesday and failed to return, prompting a nationwide search.Blake, who was last seen at the start of the Wednesday afternoon session, is understood to have been granted leave to speak to his lawyers about a relative who wanted to withdraw a large amount of her share of the £260,000 surety, according to the Times. Having been on bail, Blake was likely to have been remanded in custody had the funds been withdrawn.A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "Peter Blake, 57, has been arrested after he handed himself in at the royal courts of justice today. He is currently in custody and will appear before the judge in due course."He was led into court 35 in handcuffs after the judge Mr Justice Treacy was told he had surrendered himself to the court.Wearing a blue anorak and black trousers he was led into the jury box to sit in front of his co-defendants, none of whom acknowledged him.His counsel told the judge that Blake had never intended to stay away from court so long."He would like to apologise to your lordship for the inconvenience. He had things to sort out. He anticipated his surety would be withdrawn and he would be remanded in custody and therefore would not be able to sort out these things which related to his sister."The court heard that Blake walked into the high court unchallenged by police or security staff."No one recognised him," said his barrister, repeating Blake's apology to the court.Blake admitted a charge of breaching his bail and the judge said he would be sentenced for it at the conclusion of the trial.When asked if Blake's handcuffs could be removed, the judge agreed but said Blake would now be remanded in custody and would be handcuffed in transit between the court and cells.In February 2004 six men wearing masks, black hats and fluorescent jackets arrived at a Heathrow warehouse in the back of a security van. They had been tipped off by an insider to the arrival of a significant haul of foreign currency from Austria.The men tied up 16 members of staff, threatening them with guns. The crown alleges that Blake fired at one of the warehouse workers, David Westwood, and then struggled with him, discharging his handgun.Three previous trials had collapsed because of fears of jury tampering, costing the taxpayer £22m. The court of appeal ruled last year that the case should be heard by a judge alone because of the risk of further tampering.
