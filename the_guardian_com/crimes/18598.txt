Criminals who fail to pay fines will have to work off their debt with community service under plans to boost confidence in Britain's courts.Up to 40 per cent of fines handed down by magistrates, for offences such as anti-social behaviour or minor public disorder are never collected. Experts argue there is no point loading yet more fines on to petty criminals who often cannot pay anyway - and may only commit more crimes to get the money. Yet there are now no other sanctions. Under plans to be announced next week by Yvette Cooper, Junior Minister in the Lord Chancellor's Department, magistrates will be able to order community work to the value of a fine for offenders who they believe cannot pay.
