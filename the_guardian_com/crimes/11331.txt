Doctors today called on the government to change the law and reduce the legal drink-driving limit to bring the UK in line with most other European countries.The British Medical Association (BMA) wants to cut the present limit of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50ml, which it claims would save around 50 drink driving-related deaths a year.The proposed road safety bill, unveiled in the latest Queen's speech and due to get its second reading in the new year, provides the government with the perfect opportunity to introduce the proposed reduction, the BMA claims.Doctors, who admit they would prefer drivers not to drink at all, also want the bill to give police the power to carry out random roadside breath tests to deter drivers from drinking and driving. Launching the campaign, the BMA's head of science and ethics, Dr Vivienne Nathanson, said: "Over the past few years, deaths and serious injuries from drink-driving have increased. We need a new impetus to reduce the toll of death and injury."Doctors pulled back from recommending a zero limit because some people, including diabetics and others who use mouth washes, can test positive for alcohol in the blood without having had a drink.The current blood-alcohol limit was introduced 37 years ago as part of the legislation which created breathalysers.The BMA campaign was supported by the Campaign Against Drink Driving which also wants to see the same reduction in blood-alcohol levels and random roadside breath-testing.Retired Wiltshire teacher John Sparrow, whose 16-year-old son was killed in a road accident involving a car driver who was over the legal blood-alcohol limit, said: "This campaign is an excellent idea. We would like to see the current drink-driving limit reduced to 50 but in an ideal world would want it to be zero."He said: "We don't know why the government hasn't reduced the current drink-driving limits. It seems to be for political reasons."The BMA's campaign however is unlikely to persuade the government that a change in the law is needed.A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said that ministers considered the issue two years ago and decided to keep the status quo.She said: "We have some of the toughest enforcement of drink-driving laws in Europe and all our advertising campaigns recommend not to drink at all when you drive."We didn't want to give the signal that by lowering the limit we would make it appear that this was a safe limit - we would be sending out mixed messages."
