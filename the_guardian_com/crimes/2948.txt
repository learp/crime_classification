Police investigating an alleged child-trafficking ring today rescued 15 children during raids on three homes in Manchester.Officers searched the houses in Gorton and Longsight after receiving intelligence that children were being shipped from a Romanian village into the UK.Officers are questioning four women and two men, aged between 23 and 32 in connection with the suspected child trafficking ring.Police intelligence suggested the children were being trafficked out of the small Romanian village of Tandarei into the Greater Manchester area by Roma organised crime groups, said a greater Manchester police spokesman. Detectives have been working closely with the Romanian police, the Metropolitan police and the UK Borders Agency, he added.The children, who police believe have been forced into committing low-level crimes, have been taken into temporary care. Police and local authorities are trying to identify the children and where they come from, he added."The intelligence indicated the trafficked children are at risk of being subject to cruelty by neglect and being forced to commit low-level crimes such as cashpoint distraction burglaries, pick- pocketing and begging," he said.Superintendent Paul Savill, who led the operation, stressed that the majority of Roma families in the Manchester area were "integrating … positively" but said the police had a duty to protect children they believed may have been trafficked and forced into a life of petty crime."This operation was necessary to uncover the extent of the problem and see if there is any evidence of organised crime groups operating here," he said."The welfare of the children is paramount and we cannot allow anyone to exploit these vulnerable people and force crime rates up."Gorton and Longsight have a large Roma community, estimated to be around 1,000 people. Savill said the police had been working with Roma families to help them adjust to living with the settled community in Gorton."I want to stress that this operation was not intended to stigmatise the Roma who are settled in our community. They have an absolute right to live here and we welcome them into our diverse community," Savill said."The majority of families are integrating themselves in our community positively, and again I would stress this is not about taking people's children off them. It is about determining which, if any, children have been trafficked and ensuring they are given the appropriate support."
