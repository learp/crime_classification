A rocket launcher capable of penetrating 60cm of reinforced concrete has been handed in as part of the police knife amnesty.The M72 lightweight anti-tank weapon was handed to police at the old stone-walled police station in Wadebridge, an idyllic Cornish town on the Camel estuary on the northern fringes of Bodmin Moor.Officers at the front desk of the station "went pale" when the shoulder-mounted weapon was handed in, wrapped in black plastic, by a former soldier."A chap just came in and said he'd read about the knife amnesty, and would we accept any weapon?" said Sally Harris, inquiry officer at Wadebridge police station."We said 'yes' so he said he'd be back in half an hour, and came along with the thing in a black bin bag and handed it over."The man, who wished to remain anonymous, had got hold of the weapon while stationed in Germany and driving a truck carrying American troops returning from the Vietnam war. "One of them had fired this thing and left it behind," said Ms Harris."He was a nice chap. Now he's retired and respectable, and his wife had said 'you've got to get rid of that thing'."The 2.5kg, 66mm weapon can shoot armour-piercing shells up to 1km away. Once the rocket has been fired the launchers can no longer be used, but they are popular as collectors' items.Wadebridge police have only had eight items handed in since the amnesty began earlier this month, including the rocket launcher and a first world war bayonet.The launcher was the most surprising of the 17,715 weapons handed in nationwide since the start of the month-long amnesty, the Home Office said today."That is 17,715 fewer weapons that can be used in a crime against ordinary, law-abiding citizens," said the home office minister Vernon Coaker."If you carry a knife out of self-defence, you run the risk of having it turned on you. Carrying a knife is illegal and will not be tolerated. It could land you four years in prison."A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: "The amnesty is for all weapons and if someone wants to get rid of a rocket launcher, that's fine by us."
