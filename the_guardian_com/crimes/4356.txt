The manager of a coalmine in south Wales where four men died after it flooded has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter, the Crown Prosecution Service has announced.Malcolm Fyfield, 57, is accused over the deaths at the Gleision mine, in the Swansea valley, in September 2011. MNS Mining Limited, which owned the mine, has been summonsed to face four charges of corporate manslaughter.Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of special crime at the CPS, said: "The deaths of four miners at the Gleision coalmine in September 2011 devastated the local Welsh mining community. Charles Breslin, Philip Hill, Garry Jenkins and David Powell all tragically lost their lives in Cilybebyll, in the Swansea valley, when the mine in which they were working was engulfed by an enormous inrush of water."It is estimated that in around three minutes more than half a million gallons of water entered the section of the mine in which the men were working."The CPS said: "We have concluded there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest to charge mine manager Malcolm Fyfield with four counts of gross negligence manslaughter. Fyfield was employed as mine manager by MNS Mining Ltd and it is alleged that he caused the deaths of four miners by mining into old, flooded mine workings in breach of health and safety regulations. In doing so the prosecution alleges he was grossly negligent."MNS Mining Limited has also been summonsed for four counts of corporate manslaughter. The prosecution allege that because of the way in which its activities were managed or organised by its senior management, namely Malcolm Fyfield, the company caused the deaths of the miners by failing to ensure a safe system of working was in place. It is alleged that this failure amounted to a gross breach of duty of care owed by the company to each of the four mine workers."Fyfield and a representative of MNS Mining Ltd will appear at Neath magistrates court on 1 February.
