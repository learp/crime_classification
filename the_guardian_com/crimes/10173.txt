Two teenage boys and a girl who turned on a friend during a moorland camping weekend and butchered him with scythes were remanded in custody and local authority care yesterday after admitting their part in the killing.The three will be sentenced later.Detectives said they were still baffled by the savagery of the attack and the motives which drove the trio to steal the scythes from a churchyard, where they were used to mow the grass, and slash more than 60 cuts in 17-year-old Terry Lee Hurst.No details of the murder were given during a two-day hearing in Sheffield, which was held under rules brought in after the murder of James Bulger by two boys in Liverpool.Lawyers including the judge, Mr Justice Smith, who described the hearing as "a desperately sad case," dispensed with robes and wigs and the three defendants sat with their lawyers in the well of Sheffield crown court rather than the dock.Two 17-year-old boys and a 16-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted murdering Terry. One of the boys was unemployed, the other on a vocational course, and the girl was 15 and at school at the time of the killing last July.Mr Justice Smith ordered pre-sentence reports to be prepared and adjourned the case to a date to be fixed. After the last of the three pleaded guilty yesterday he left the court in tears.Outside the court, Detective Inspector Tom Whiteley of South Yorkshire police said the four teenagers were friends who had gone camping near Broomhead reservoir, north of Sheffield.At some stage, one of them had indicated during questioning, there had been a disagreement but not over anything likely to provoke a violent response.But the three killers had left the woodland campsite without Terry and gone to the village of Bolsterstone, where they stole the scythes. On their return to the camp, the attack had involved three separate phases in which Terry tried to get away but they caught up with him.Mr Whiteley said he did not want to give any further details of the attack itself for the sake of the victim's family.He said all three defendants were known to police over minor matters, but there had been nothing to suggest they were capable of such violence.Terry was born in Shiregreen, Sheffield, where he lived with his foster family and studied at Sheffield College, before moving to nearby Penistone.Mr Whiteley said: "He was a good lad. He's certainly not been in trouble with the police."
