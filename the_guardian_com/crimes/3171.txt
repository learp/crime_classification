Your article (Revealed: Why bookies are safe bet for money launderers, 9 November) gives a misleading impression of the betting industry, a licensed, regulated and responsible industry that serves over 8 million people each year, employs over 40,000 people and generates £1bn in taxes for the exchequer.Like many businesses operating in communities in the UK we can be targeted by criminals but by devoting significant resources (in Ladbrokes' case over 100 full-time security staff), developing sophisticated systems and processes, training staff and working closely with police and organisations like Crimestoppers (with whom we are a corporate partner), we are helping to tackle crime, providing evidence to the police to prosecute criminals. The fact is we are part of the solution, not part of the problem.Suspicious activity such as that described in the article is investigated and where appropriate will always be reported to police. The Guardian's quoted drug dealer and any like-minded individuals who may follow the methods of money-laundering described in the article should be aware that they are on CCTV, our systems are regularly updated and improved so no method is beyond detection, and this can and will form the basis of evidence for the police.Ciaran O'BrienCorporate affairs director, Ladbrokes• The most common form of commercial outlet on Tottenham High Road is a bookmaker. The area has the highest unemployment in London, and the number of bookies is neither commercially justifiable or wanted by the community. I note that while planning minister Nick Boles has professed concern at such situations, he is actually making it easier for bookmakers to evade local authority efforts to control the situation (Planning changes 'will help betting shops', 11 November).Keith FlettSecretary, Haringey Trades Union Council
