Suicides in prisons have risen to two a week, with 43 so far this year as overcrowding as a result of record jail numbers in England and Wales bites more deeply, the chief inspector of prisons told MPs last night.Anne Owers said the rise in prison deaths was all the more disappointing because it followed a significant fall in recent years as the Prison Service improved its support services for prisoners during their first days behind bars.Her warning comes as a record 550 new inmates were "locked out" of prisons in England and Wales on Monday night after a weekend "surge" beyond the officially declared figure of 80,778 forced jails to declare they had run out of space.More than 400 prisoners were held in cells at police stations around England and Wales and a further 120 were in cells at six separate crown and magistrates courts.Ms Owers also described the "Birmingham to Liverpool shuttle" as jails in the two cities shuffled prisoners backwards and forwards to any spare cell available.One young offender held on remand in Feltham youth jail in west London went to court and found himself moved between Ashfield in Derbyshire and Huntercombe in Oxfordshire before a space could be found for him again in Feltham, she said.The chief inspector of prisons said the growing practice of holding inmates in police cells - which have only the barest of facilities - was increasing the vulnerability of prisoners as none of the prison support services, including detoxification facilities, were available in police stations.The first 22 weeks of this year have seen 43 self-inflicted deaths in custody compared with 67 for the whole of last year.The chief inspector also told MPs on the Commons constitutional affairs committee that the refurbishment or replacement of unfit prison wings around the country was being cancelled because there was nowhere to move the prisoners to while the work was undertaken.She said "slopping out" - night sanitation using buckets - which had been abolished in the 1990s had been reintroduced for young offenders at Portland, Dorset, because building work on repairs had been cancelled.An inspection report into Elmley prison in Kent, published today, said the use of police cells, known as Operation Safeguard, is leading to inmates spending more than three days in police stations. The emergency arrangements are supposed to restrict each inmate to only one night in a police or court cell.Ms Owers said inmates when they finally do get to prison arrive as late as 10pm at night because of the difficulties of finding a spare prison cell. Inmates interviewed by the prison inspectors were all extremely negative about their experiences in police custody."They reported poor access to phones, showers and complaint forms, and were negative about the quality of food. One prisoner commented that it was his worst experience of custody."A prisoner told the inspectors: "I was forced to sleep on a one-inch-thick mattress on the floor, with one sheet, one blanket and no pillow. It was so cold I did not undress, so ended up wearing the same clothes for 48 hours."Another said: "I was not allowed to shower, brush my teeth or anything like that."And another claimed: "I was not fed until two in the afternoon the next day." One said there were no facilities other than a bed. Despite the facilities one said he had been well treated by the police: "I requested a cup of tea that was promptly given to me and I was offered a microwave meal." But others said they had not been fed at all.
