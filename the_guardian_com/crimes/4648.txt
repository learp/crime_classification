Open the fucking door!'"I saw somebody come round the front. He was dressed as a post office man. I heard two shots fired and heard lots more shouting."A spokesman for the prison service said: "The driver was threatened by a man with a shotgun who proceeded to shoot the driver in the knee through the door of the van.
