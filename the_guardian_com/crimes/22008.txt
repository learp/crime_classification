A new inquiry into the murder of British tourist Julie Ward while she was on safari in Kenya 21 years ago has been agreed by John Yates, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorism squad.Yates persuaded police chiefs in Nairobi that the case could yet be solved by advances in forensic science.Two other senior Metropolitan police detectives and John Ward, Julie's father, are understood to have joined Yates on a recent visit to Kenya.Ward, 75, has spent nearly £2m and made more than 100 visits to Africa in pursuit of his daughter's killers. The retired hotelier from Brockley, Suffolk, said yesterday: "This case is solvable because we haven't run out of leads yet. Armed with the new DNA evidence, what we need now is the full co-operation of the Kenyan authorities."Miss Ward was last seen alive on 6 September 1988 after travelling to the Masai Mara park with an Australian friend, Glen Burns. The publishing assistant's remains were found by her father on 13 September but the Kenyan authorities, keen to protect the country's tourism industry, initially said that she had been killed by wild animals.
