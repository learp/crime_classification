The jurors in the trial of Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr were told today that the court would accept a majority verdict of 10 on all charges against the two accused.The 12-member jury was recalled to court number one of the Old Bailey this morning, after they had been deliberating for just half an hour on their fourth day in the jury room. As he had done when sending them out for the first time on Friday, Mr Justice Moses urged them to try to reach unanimous decisions but conceded that he would accept verdicts based on a 10-2 majority. The seven women and five men have been considering the case for around 16 hours since first retiring.Mr Huntley, 29, a former caretaker at Soham Village college, denies murdering Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman on Sunday August 4 last year, but has admitted a single charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Ms Carr, 26, his former girlfriend and a former classroom assistant in the 10-year-old girls' class, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two counts of assisting an offender. The jury has heard that Mr Huntley admits Holly died accidentally in his bath and that he killed Jessica as he tried to silence her screams. He insists he did not mean to kill her. He has admitted, however, that he bundled their bodies into his car, dumped them in the remote ditch where they were found 13 days later, cut off their clothes and torched their corpses. Ms Carr has told the jury that she lied to protect her then-fiance and gave him a false alibi, but she insisted she never suspected he could be involved in the girls' disappearance.
