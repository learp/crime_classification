A unique clinic that provides intensive and secure treatment for child sex offenders, and has been hailed by ministers as the most effective in Britain, is set to close in six weeks. The Wolvercote clinic has to leave Horton hospital in Epsom, Surrey, because the land has been sold to a developer. Unless a new site can be found before July, the 12 men currently undergoing treatment will complete their rehabilitation programmes in the community. The 25-bed clinic, set up in 1995 by child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, treats sex offenders in secure accommodation for up to 12 months at a time and is the only facility of its kind in Europe. Clinicians teach the men to acknowledge their sexual responses to children and take control of their behaviour. Ray Wyre, a founder member of the foundation and an expert on the treatment of sex offenders, is warning that the current patients will not get the same treatment in the community. "It's not at all the same experience," he says. "The judges sentenced them to go [to the clinic] to be under 24-hour supervision. I suspect they would have received a custodial sentence otherwise. "We've had seven years of looking for other premises. We knew from day one that we'd have to move from the site - Horton hospital had already been sold off." The government planned to relocate the clinic to the Silverlands hospital in Chertsey, Surrey. But this was strongly opposed by Runnymede council and by local people, who organised a protest vigil. Other locations are said to be under consideration, but time is running out. More than 280 men have passed through Wolvercote since it opened and only 14% are known to have re-offended. Tink Palmer, policy officer at children's charity Barnardo's and a leading expert on the sexual exploitation of children, says the clinic's closure questions the political will to tackle child abuse.
