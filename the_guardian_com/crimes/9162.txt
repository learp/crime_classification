The ex-director of public prosecutions, Sir David Calvert-Smith QC, has been appointed a high court judge, in an unprecedented move by the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer.Sir David, 59, who was Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from 1998 until he retired last year and was succeeded by Ken Macdonald QC, is the first former holder of his office to go to the high court. In the past, a period as public prosecutor was thought to be a disqualification for the post. But a recent policy decision has paved a path to judicial office for Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyers and other civil service lawyers. Joining Sir David at the high court is another senior barrister who has built up a high profile in a different role - Christopher Clarke QC, 57, who recently finished a five-year stint as counsel to the Saville inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday. Before that role, he was a commercial barrister with a £1 million-a-year practice in international trade. A high court judge earns a salary of £150,878. Sir David made strenuous efforts to stamp out racism in the CPS and headed an inquiry into racism in the police for the Commission for Racial Equality. While DPP, he defended his decision to prosecute in high-profile cases which failed or collapsed, such as the Damilola Taylor murder case. "It is not our job to second-guess the court," he said.
