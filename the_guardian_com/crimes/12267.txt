Imran Hussain. Photograph: Greater Manchester police/PAHussain was given a life sentence at Manchester crown court on Friday and told by the judge, Mr Justice Baker, he will serve 23 years before he is considered for release.The attack on 16 January took place 12 days after Hussain had targeted another stranger in a similar manner when he drove to Nottingham and punched a man outside his workplace before running off to his vehicle. The judge described this as a "trial run".An investigation is under way into Nottinghamshire police's response to that attack.The judge told Hussain: "I'm satisfied that having escaped detection for that attack [in Nottingham] you were emboldened to undertake another one, this time with deadly intent."The court heard how the victim in Nottingham, a Probation Service worker, made a note of his assailant's vehicle registration number and spoke to police soon after on 4 January, but Hussain remained undetected when he travelled to Manchester.An inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into Nottinghamshire police's response was launched earlier this year is continuing.Hussain admitted killing Crump Raiswell but claimed it was manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility after saying he was responding to voices in his head.This was rejected by the jury which found him guilty of murder on Thursday. The judge acknowledged then that the defendant was impaired, but not to a significant degree.Crump Raiswell had been accepted to study history at Sheffield Hallam University later this year and had just returned from the United States where he had been coaching football for three months.He was heading into Manchester city centre to find a job when he was attacked in Upper Chorlton Road in broad daylight in front of stunned witnesses.Hussain, of Bracknell, Berkshire, had been driving around Whalley Range and Chorlton in the early afternoon for around an hour as he looked for a "suitable victim", the jury heard.He parked and then attacked the teenager as he walked near a bus stop.The jury was told how Hussain was seen by witnesses laughing and sniggering as he ran back to his car after the attack.The defendant was studying engineering at the University of Coventry and lived in rented accommodation in the city.Crump Raiswell, a Manchester City fan, lived in Chorlton with his family.
