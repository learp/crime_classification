Police officers and staff who circulated an email showing how a black man was decapitated after a police chase have been disciplined following a "robust" investigation.Hertfordshire police said yesterday that a five-month inquiry resulted in 100 employees being disciplined for distributing the message. Of these, eight police sergeants were formally reprimanded and seven civilian supervisors received final written warnings. Another 85 people were disciplined with either a formal warning or management advice.The email originated in the US and showed a police chase that took place in Atlanta in February 2003. At the end of the pursuit the suspected drug dealer was decapitated as he tried to jump off a highway and onto the roof of a building.Deputy Chief Constable Simon Ash, who oversaw the investigation, said: "I am disappointed by the conduct of officers and staff who distributed this inappropriate image that some people may have perceived as being racist."A total of 400 officers and staff at the force received the email and 300 deleted it. The remaining 100 passed it on to others. The investigation was carried out under the supervision of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Keith Jarrett, the president of the Black Police Association, said disciplinary action should have gone further. "I don't think a robust enough sanction has been taken against the officers concerned, especially the supervisory ones," he said.A 2004 Commission for Racial Equality inquiry chaired by David Calvert-Smith, a former director of public prosecutions, found little had been achieved by race equality training introduced after the Metropolitan police were branded "institutionally racist" for their failings during the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry. Of 15 forces picked at random, 14 failed to meet a legal requirement to have written plans for taking basic steps to combat racism within the ranks.The report suggested that some forces did not understand the steps they needed to take after the Lawrence report.The report also found that tests designed to detect racist officers were more likely to catch black and Asian recruits than whites. Ethnic minority officers were also more likely than whites to be targeted for disciplinary action by their forces.
