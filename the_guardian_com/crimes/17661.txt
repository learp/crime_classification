The Liberal Democrats' leading candidate for the London mayoral race today criticised the political and police response to gun crime as the party backed measures intended to counter firearms offences.Brian Paddick, the former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, told the Lib Dems' conference in Brighton: "The police have got to be far more effective in taking guns off the streets. They must use stop and search more intelligently."He added: "We are the only party committed to taking direct action to narrow the gap between rich and poor."Unless youngsters believe that they are going to get a good education and have an opportunity to succeed they will resort to dealing drugs and carrying guns."Mr Paddick was speaking in favour of the motion to:· create a border force to stop guns entering the UK· call a summit of city, police and community leaders to find "national solutions" to the problem· grant anonymity to witnesses who are afraid to testify· and use the money raised by axing the government's identity card scheme to provide additional resources to areas with severe problems with violent crime.Colin Eldridge, the party's parliamentary candidate in Liverpool Wavertree, introduced the motion with a reference to Rhys Jones, the 11-year-old shot dead in the city last month."Let us say quite clearly: the death of Rhys Jones is the moment we say: 'Enough is enough.'"He questioned whether the gun crime task force, headed by Deputy Chief Constable Jon Murphy of Merseyside police, that the government had set up in response to the killing, had a large enough budget."There's an issue over whether he [Mr Murphy] can actually make a difference" on a budget of a £1m, Mr Eldridge said.He added: "What we need is police on the streets that can take the community and grasp it, saying clearly to the gangs: 'You can't operate,' and to the communities: 'You are safe.'"He said the proposals would give councils the power to "close down" houses from which gangs were operating.But not all delegates backed the call to give anonymity to witnesses.Geoff Payne of Camden, London, said that "the quality of the accusation depends on the accuser. Where anonymity has been used in the past, injustice follows."He mentioned the controversy surrounding the Damilola Taylor trial.But Warren Bradley, the leader of Liverpool council, said that anonymity was "so important"."When you see a crime committed in Liverpool, Birmingham or Manchester, for people to come forward from these communities they need anonymity to give evidence. They need to have protection," he said.John Hemming said that the government had "undermined the rule of law in the big cities. Labour have failed to maintain discipline in our schools or prioritise violent crime, making people chase cream-bun throwers."Mr Paddick was Britain's most senior openly gay police officer until he stepped down earlier this year after giving evidence about Sir Ian Blair, the Met commissioner, concerning the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in Stockwell tube station in 2005.He is one of three hopefuls competing to be the Lib Dems' candidate for next year's London mayoral elections. One of the other candidates, Fiyaz Mughal, today claimed that the party was trying to ensure that Mr Paddick was chosen.Mr Paddick also called identity cards "absolutely useless" in helping solve the problem of gun crime in the debate today."We need people, not pieces of plastic," he said. "A former police chief against ID cards? You better believe it."
