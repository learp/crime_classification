Police arrested two 18-year-old men today on suspicion of murdering a teenager in a city park.Jonathan Matondo, 16, was found shot dead in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on Wednesday night.The youngster, who dreamed of becoming a preacher, was killed in what local residents have described as an increasingly vicious "postcode war" between rival gangs.His body was found in a small recreation area behind a basketball court in the Burngreave area of the city.South Yorkshire police today said the first suspect had been detained at his home in Burngreave and was being held in custody. The second man was detained in the centre of Sheffield. "This weekend there will be armed and unarmed officers patrolling the Burngreave area to show how seriously we are taking this and to assure the community that we will not tolerate gun crime in our city," said the Sheffield police commander, Chief Superintendent Jon House.Yesterday, Jonathan's uncle, Armand Vibila, broke down in tears as he said his nephew had been "too young to die".A postmortem examination found the teenager had died from a single gunshot wound to the head."He was such a good boy, so funny, this should not happen to our community," Mr Vibila said.Residents of Burngreave, have revealed there had been a running gun battle between two gangs in the hours leading up to the killing, with one group chasing the other into a nearby park and firing shots.Robert Smith, writing on the website of the Burngreave Messenger, said one group of youngsters barricaded themselves in a house in nearby Melrose Road as a rival gang opened fire.However, it appeared that police were not called to the area at this stage."We have reached a new level in an inner city internal warfare that is seeing young people firing guns as though playing a video amusement game with life. Killing the innocent and involving those never before involved in their issues or disputes," Mr Smith wrote.He said the death had left the community "shocked and very angry".The Rev Jacques Kinsiona, a preacher at the Light of Christ Church, said Jonathan had been a regular churchgoer."Jonathan was a great person - he had been to our church and one day he asked and said, 'Reverend Jacques, I want to be a preacher', and I said yes."
