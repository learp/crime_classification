The freed property tycoon Nicholas van Hoogstraten revealed yesterday that he had lodged a complaint with the Metropolitan police about the investigation that led to his imprisonment.In his first statement since being released from Belmarsh prison, London, on Monday, he said he had been prosecuted despite the real killer's identity being known. Mr Van Hoogstraten, 58, from Uckfield, East Sussex, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of hiring two hitmen who killed a business rival, Mohammed Raja, in 1999, but the conviction was subsequently overturned. "Immediately following my conviction last year," Mr Van Hoogstraten told reporters outside the Old Bailey yesterday where he was formally cleared of manslaughter, "I made a detailed complaint based on substantial evidence which came to light during the trial. I hope it will be diligently pursued." The Metropolitan police said it had received a complaint about an officer involved in the case more than a year ago, but had been unable to investigate while the matter was subjudice.It said: "As is routine, it will now be investigated by the Met's directorate of professional standards."
