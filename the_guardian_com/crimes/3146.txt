Henry Porter is a fine, public-spirited man. But he has misrepresented my contribution to the Hansard Society debate on Civil Liberties last Tuesday night.I went along as a searcher after truth and insight. So I thought it was reasonable to test Henry's pro-liberty arguments, not accept them blindly.In particular I challenged him over his fervent opposition to a national DNA database. I have been wondering about DNA ever since a lorry driver drew up outside my house several months ago asking the way to the law courts. We gave him directions, then asked why he was going there.The driver, who was black, said that he had recently suffered racial abuse. Eventually he wound down his window to complain, at which point the white thug who was abusing him spat in his face. Thanks to DNA, this thug had been traced through his saliva and was now facing charges, and my new friend was on his way to give evidence in court.Ian Blair cited the even more potent example of Rachel Nickell's killer Robert Napper, also brought to justice thanks to DNA. So I asked Porter whether he accepted that his opposition to DNA, however principled, came at a price â€“ that without it, criminals would be able to carry on killing, raping and so forth. In some cases (such as Colin Stagg) innocent men and women might be convicted and spend years in jail without DNA to show who the real culprit is.I am not dogmatic about this. I can see that there might be a powerful answer to my questions. But even though I asked him twice, Henry did not try to provide one. Instead he blustered that I must be a supporter of national DNA database, as if that somehow disqualified me from asking questions. Actually I'm not sure that I am. Indeed, thanks partly to eloquent and powerful advocates like him, it does worry me that the state should have access to all our DNA. But it also worries me that, if we don't make use of DNA testing, we allow killers and rapists to kill and rape again.
