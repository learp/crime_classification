A sex attacker has been jailed after the kickboxer he tried to assault caught him in a headlock with her legs before raising the alarm.Mark Willis, 40, pounced on the 25-year-old woman, punching her in the face several times during the nighttime assault.Willis tried to remove the woman’s clothes, but she fought back, grabbing his arm and pinning him in a headlock. She held him there until he went limp, and then escaped to call for help in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.The defendant, of Churchdown, Gloucester, was convicted of sexual assault for the attack on 31 August last year. He had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of causing actual bodily harm.He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, with an additional four years on licence by the judge, William Hart, at Bristol crown court on Monday. He was also ordered to sign the sex offender register.The woman said: “I’m extremely pleased that this traumatic ordeal is finally over and that I can move forward with life. I wish to thank the police and the officer in the case for their hard work in identifying and apprehending the offender and the support I’ve received.“I hope the case will encourage others to come forward and speak to police if they are the victim of a sexual assault.”DC Faye Satchwell-Bennett, who led the investigation, said: “The victim has continued to demonstrate huge courage and bravery throughout this investigation. The judge rightly commended her and described her as being of ‘great spirit and courage’.“We are pleased with the lengthy custodial sentence passed upon Mr Willis, who clearly poses significant risk to the public, also having a previous conviction for a similar kidnapping offence against a female.“There’s little doubt in anybody’s mind that without her martial arts skills the attack could have been far worse.”
