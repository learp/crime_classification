The Attorney General has intervened to consider whether a five-year jail sentence given to a paedophile who repeatedly raped a girl is too lenient.Kevin Hazelwood, 40, was jailed indefinitely on Thursday, but was told he must serve a minimum of just five years and seven months.Lord Goldsmith has asked to see papers on the case, and will now have 28 days to decide whether to send the case to the Appeal Court, where the sentence could be increased.Hazelwood, from Brighton, abused the girl over three years from when she was aged about six until two weeks before his arrest last November. At Lewes Crown Court, he admitted six rapes, two attempted rapes, three sexual assaults and two indecent assaults.At the time of the attacks, he was on probation, under community supervision, and on a sex offenders' treatment programme.
