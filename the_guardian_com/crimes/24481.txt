Paul Salmon described to a jury yesterday the moment his wife told him that she had shot dead Lorna Stewart, the woman with whom he had been having a two-year affair.He told the Old Bailey he was in a business meeting when his wife, Rena, sent him a text message: "I have just shot Lorna. This is not a joke." He rang back. "I said 'What have you done?'" His wife replied: "I have shot Lorna ... She is lying on the floor. The gun is on the floor at the side. I am waiting for the police," Mr Salmon told the court. He said he asked his wife whether Stewart was dead and she replied that she did not know. She was very calm and collected, he said. Mr Salmon said he then rang the police and told an officer: "She's going to come out." He was told to make sure that she had her hands up. The shooting, done with Mr Salmon's shotgun, was at a beauty salon run by Stewart in Chiswick in west London. Mr Salmon said he rushed to the scene after receiving his wife's message, but on the way there the battery on his mobile phone ran out. Rena Salmon, 43, from Great Shefford in Berkshire, denies murdering Stewart on September 10 last year. Mr Salmon told the court he had spoken to Stewart about 30 minutes earlier, having had breakfast with her. After his wife's chilling message he sent a text to Stewart asking her if she was OK. "Then my phone rang. It was a woman who worked with Lorna.'Can you come down? Rena has shot Lorna'. "I said to my boss 'I have got to go. My wife has just shot my girlfriend'," he told the court. Judge Neil Denison asked Mr Salmon whether he was now divorced. He replied: "Unfortunately not. The absolute is scheduled on 28 May." The trial continues.
