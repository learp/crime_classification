Tim, an assistant manager at a convenience store in Manchester, had already been held up in a previous job when he was attacked by a man with a pistol."I was doing the cashing up at about 9.30 in the morning. I'd just started when a girl called through to the back asking if there were any vacancies. "While I was talking to her- I found out later she was part of the group - her accomplice came into the shop. "He came behind me and held a gun to my head. He told me to go into the back room and I did. We went into the back and he saw all the money there." The gunman took the cash and other goods. He then forced Tim to stand in the meat freezer. "I was only wearing a shirt and I was freezing. Eventually I heard the back door slam and I knew he had left." The attack left Tim in a state of shock. "I was really shook up. I'd left my previous job as the manager of an off-licence after I got held up with a knife. When it happened the second time it just tipped me over the edge. "I didn't know that victim counselling or anything like that existed at the time. My manager told me to buy a bottle of whisky and take a couple of days off. But it doesn't work like that. I took some time off and then they moved me to another shop but it didn't feel the same as it had so I left." It was then that Tim got some counselling. "The only thing I could see of my attacker were the man's hands and I could see that they were black. I even had a fear then of black people in general. My counsellor helped me to deal with all that though, he guided me through it." Gun crime isn't common in Tim's neighbourhood. "I don't know anyone else who's been involved in crimes like this. I'm probably just unfortunate that it happened to me twice in a short space of time, but it took my job away from me and tipped me over the edge."
