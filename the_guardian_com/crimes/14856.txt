The campaign against the infiltration of undercover police officers into political groups is gathering pace.The campaign is to be launched at a public meeting on Thursday February 27 in central London.Among the speakers will be Doreen Lawrence and Harriet Wistrich, the lawyer representing women who are taking legal action against the police.The Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance was set up by groups or individuals who say they "know - or have reason to suspect that they have been targets of undercover policing."The campaign - known as COPS for short - is calling for an independent inquiry into allegations that undercover police officers have been sent to spy on lawful political protesters. A statement about the aims of their campaign can be read here, while their website can be found here. Their Facebook page is here.The speakers at the launch meeting are also scheduled to be :* Imran Khan, Doreen Lawrence's solicitor for many years;* Lois Austin, from the Youth Against Racism in Europe, one of the groups that was infiltrated;* Dave Smith, from the group supporting blacklisted workers;* Robbie Gillett, one of the 29 environmental campaigners whose convictions over a protest at the Drax power station was overturned last month.The campaign has been established following a series of allegations, including that :* the undercover officers routinely formed sexual relationships with campaigners they were sent to infiltrate;* the undercover spies were asked to find information to discredit the campaign for a proper police investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence;* intelligence gathered by the police was passed to a secret agency that blacklisted workers;* the undercover police officers stole the identities of dead children.The meeting starts at 6.30 pm at the Diskus Conference centre, Unite House, 128 Theobald's Road, Holborn, WC1X 8TN.
