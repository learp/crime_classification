The handbag and mobile phone of the murdered teenager, Hannah Foster, have been found in a recycling tip in Portsmouth, 17 miles from the place where her strangled body was found.The A-level student's khaki canvas satchel and Nokia phone were fished from a container on Monday afternoon by an employee at the Onyx recycling plant in the Hilsea area of Portsmouth. Police believed the items had been dumped in a bottle bank. The bag's contents appeared to be complete.Detective Inspector Tony Adams, of Hampshire police, said: "We believe the bag had been deposited in a bottle bank somewhere in the Portsmouth or Southsea area and may have been picked up by contractors on their weekly collection [on Monday] morning. We need to find out when it was put there and who by." Hannah, 17, was abducted on Friday a short distance from her home in Southampton. She was last seen at 10.50pm, waving goodbye to a friend before beginning a five-minute walk home down a quiet, residential street. Her fully-clothed body was found on Sunday in undergrowth about five miles from her house. Police believe Hannah was the victim of a random and apparently motiveless attack. There was no evidence of a sexual assault. Detectives were attempting to trace any phone calls and text messages made from Hannah's phone - a Nokia 3310. Forensic officers conducted a fingertip search of the recycling plant. The 100-strong investigation team had been examining links with Portsmouth before Hannah's bag was found there. More than 200 calls from the public have provided a number of leads. Hannah's parents, Trevor and Hilary, and her 14-year-old sister, spoke of a "numbing emptiness" and appealed for witnesses. "If there is anyone out there who knows or suspects who was responsible we beg you to listen to your conscience," they said.
