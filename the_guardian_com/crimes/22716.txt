A pathologist has been unable to establish exactly how Kate Prout, who was murdered by her husband and buried in woodland on the farm they shared, died.The inquest into the death of Kate Prout, 55, was opened and adjourned at Gloucestershire coroner's court on Monday.Adrian Prout, 49, was convicted of his wife's murder in February last year despite her body never having been found.After finally confessing to the murder in prison, Prout led police to the woodland spot in Redmarley, Gloucestershire, where he hid his wife's body after killing her in 2007.Her remains were found last month following a five-day search and identified from dental records.Coroner's officer Terry Onions said: "The cause of death is unascertained, but initial results do not negate Mr Prout's account of her death." He did not spell out how Prout said that he had killed his wife but did say that part of her larynx had been retained for further examination.Coroner David Dooley said he would release the body in 28 days for burial or cremation, giving time for any parties involved in the case to request a second postmortem examination.Prout admitted his guilt after he failed a lie detector test that had been arranged by campaigners convinced of his innocence. He first admitted his crime to his fiancee, Debbie Garlick, and later took detectives to the location where he had buried her.Police used specialist forensic experts and dogs trained to locate decomposed bodies in the search for the former teacher. The last time anyone heard from Kate Prout was on the afternoon of 5 November 2007, when she called her bank.During the trial at Bristol crown court last year, jurors heard that she had confronted her husband with an increased divorce demand the day before she went missing. A jury found him guilty of murder and he was jailed for life.Speaking after Kate Prout's remains were found, her older brother, Richard Wakefield, said the years since she went missing had been like a "prison sentence". The inquest was adjourned and Dooley said a full inquest may not be necessary because Prout had been convicted of the crime.
