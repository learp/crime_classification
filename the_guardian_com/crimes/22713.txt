The government promised yesterday to hunt down Britain's 5,000 most prolific criminals and offer them the choice between getting help to change their ways - and a long jail term.The latest public order initiative by the home secretary, David Blunkett, is based on police data suggesting that a relatively small number of repeat offenders is responsible for much "routine" crime. But the project was criticised as "crude guesswork" by crime researchers, who said the police would end up going after minnows rather than the big fish. And the probation officers' union Napo accused Mr Blunkett of repackaging work "which all justice agencies have been carrying out for 30 years". Mr Blunkett launched the prolific and priority offenders programme in Leeds, where police have pioneered a drive against repeat criminals. He said a combination of good detective work and rapid legal action would give the project a distinctive edge. The emphasis was on stopping convicted "priority cons" returning to crime. Drug treatment and other closely monitored rehabilitation would be part of the deal, with prison waiting for participants who did not comply. He said no government had succeeded in getting all the law and social service agencies to work together. "We have to give these people a way out. We have to ensure that when they come out of prison someone meets them, their immediate housing and employment needs are looked after and there is someone they can call on," he said. Richard Garside, director of the Crime and Society Foundation, said the list of 5,000 "targets" was largely made up of those most vulnerable to capture, not necessarily those who caused the most harm.
