A senior police officer who took charge of evacuating passengers from Aldgate station on 7 July spoke of his frustration as he tried to persuade firefighters to enter the tunnel after the explosion, even standing on the tracks to show that they were not live.Inspector Robert Munn of British Transport Police went on to describe a catalogue of problems at the scene, including a shortage of emergency services staff and equipment, messages not being relayed in his control room and radios not working â€“ making things "very difficult", he said.He said that the delay in the firefighters' response had not lasted long but was "very frustrating" as he struggled to deal with the immediate aftermath of the attack.Munn, 46, who arrived from Stratford with three probationary officers who had finished training three weeks earlier, described the "chaotic pandemonium" after he entered the tunnel with two of the officers. He said while more senior staff were needed, they were not available.Because his radio was not working, Munn was forced to move between the platform and the tunnel to communicate with his control room. He made several emergency calls requesting help. At 9.11am, in a call that was read out in court, he asked for ambulances, saying: "There are people on the train who will die if they do not get immediate care."At around 9.17am, 27 minutes after the bomb exploded, he went back to the platform and found a group of firefighters standing waiting in full kit.Munn told the inquest: "I said, 'It's this way, boys, do you want to come and join us?' One of them told me they weren't allowed on the tracks until the current was confirmed as being discharged."At that point, I stood on the third rail and said to them, 'The power's off,' and they said, 'We have to have it confirmed by London Underground staff.'"He said he spotted a member of London Underground staff on the platform and shouted to ask him whether the current was off. The staff member confirmed it."This seemed to take for ever. In reality, it was probably a matter of seconds," he added.Munn later praised the actions of firefighters at Aldgate in general that day.He agreed it had been the "correct protocol" for emergency services to check the power was off and that he had done it himself, despite seeing people on the track.The inquest heard that up to four other firefighters were already working in the bombed carriage by this time.Munn also described how he had become angry and snatched the camera from a female passenger who was holding up the evacuation process by "rummaging around" in her bag and trying to take photographs of the carriage.He said she was causing "agitation", adding that other passengers had shouted abuse at her.Earlier, the inquests heard from Detective Constable Antonio Silvestro, the first person to enter the tunnel, who was later awarded an MBE for his actions. He said he had run down the tunnel after seeing passengers emerging covered in soot looking like something out of "Michael Jackson's Thriller video".Silvestro, from British Transport Police, said: "They were just covered in soot, their hair was all over the place, you just basically saw the whites of their eyes."Describing the difficulty of finding out what had happened, he said: "I can best describe it as when a volcano erupts and you can see that really thick smoke."Passengers were unable to get out of the carriages because, at that early stage, there were no doors open, he said."They were like sardines in there basically. There was a lot of smoke in there and they were panicking and screaming."Coroner Lady Justice Hallett told Munn that what he had done that day had gone "way beyond the call of duty."
