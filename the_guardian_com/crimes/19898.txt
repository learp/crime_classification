The terrifying world of two brothers who headed one of Britain's most notorious criminal networks - and the hugely complicated police investigation that captured them - was laid bare yesterday.Colin and David Gunn considered themselves kings of the Bestwood estate in Nottingham, from which they ran their drugs and extortion rackets. They boasted they had made millions from drug deals and drove around in powerful cars, jewellery dripping from their necks and wrists.But police finally dismantled their empire from the bottom up, taking out their foot soldiers and making life ever more difficult for the brothers, until they made mistakes and could be brought in.The activities of the Gunns can finally be reported after Colin Gunn, 40, was convicted at Birmingham crown court yesterday of stealing information from two corrupt police officers to stay a step ahead of the law. Restrictions had meant that a series of court cases involving the brothers could not be reported.Birmingham crown court was told how Gunn used corrupt officers Charles Fletcher and Philip Parr to access secret files on the police national computer to find out how close the net was to him.One investigation Gunn sought information on was the 2004 double murder of Joan and John Stirland. They were slaughtered in their bungalow in the seaside village of Trusthorpe, Lincolnshire, because Mrs Stirland's son, Michael O'Brien, killed a friend of the Gunns. Colin Gunn was jailed for life last year for plotting their murder and was ordered to serve at least 35 years.Gunn used Fletcher, a trainee detective, by way of an intermediary - Jason Grocock, the manager of a Nottingham clothing store. Grocock would approach the officer for information about his "big mate", taking care not to name Gunn."It is almost as if there is a hallowed air around Colin Gunn," Graham Wood QC, prosecuting, told the court.Both police officers admitted the conspiracy, which ran between 2002 and 2005, last year and were jailed.David Gunn is also in prison. Weeks after being cleared of killing the Stirlands, he was jailed for eight and a half years for conspiracy to supply amphetamines. The investigation to bring down the Gunn empire was the biggest undertaken by Nottinghamshire police, involving 81 separate operations, covert and overt, and more than 100 arrests.Former Nottinghamshire Assistant Chief Constable Peter Ditchett, one of the heads of the investigation, described the Gunns as "criminals who kill those they regard as competitors; criminals who kidnap and torture someone for a small, unpaid debt, or just to make a point; criminals who gun down people because of disrespect; criminals who beat, torture and maim for revenge".Colin Gunn was jailed for nine years yesterday, a sentence that will run concurrent to the 35 years he is serving.
