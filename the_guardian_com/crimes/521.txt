Tayside police said today they are investigating a further suspected attack on birds of prey in the Angus glens near Dundee, after a sea eagle was found poisoned by an illegal chemical last year.The sea eagle was killed with carbofuran, a banned pesticidenotorious for its fatal effects on wildlife, just over a year after it had been released in Fife as part of a government-backed sea eagle reintroduction programme.The bird was one of 15 that had been donated by the Norwegian government and were welcomed to Scotland in person by the then environment minister Mike Russell.It was found in August on the Glenogil estate near Forfar. Glenogil has been involved in a series of police raids and investigations into suspected persecution of birds of prey after the discovery of several dead birds and a number of baits contaminated with toxic chemicals on the estate.No estate employee has been charged or prosecuted, and its owner, John Dodd, an Edinburgh-based investment banker, insists his staff are innocent of any wildlife offences.Birds of prey are typically poisoned to preserve stocks of animals for hunting and shooting purposes.Dodd is currently contesting a decision in 2008 by the Scottish government to dock £107,000 – the highest penalty of its type ever imposed – from his agricultural subsidies for allegedly failing to properly protect wildlife on his estate.The bird, which had been radio tagged and was known as A989, was part of a group of 100 sea eagles which have been released or are due to be released in Scotland as part of a five-year introduction programme. Naturalists say the bird was persecuted to extinction in Scotland about 150 years ago.Tayside police say many of the 100 sea eagles so far released in Scotland had thrived, but added that "there have been several serious incidences of wildlife crime involving this species in Tayside. The poisoned bird is likely to have ingested bait laced with banned agricultural pesticides that were deliberately set out."Detective inspector Ally Waghorn, who is leading the investigation, said: "It is an absolute disgrace that the use of pesticides to kill what are seen by some as pest species continues in Scotland. There is also a real risk to any hill walker who might encounter and handle poisoned bait. I'd appeal to anyone who has any information about the incident, or any other illegal use of pesticides against wildlife, to contact the police."Dodd's legal representatives have been approached for comment, but had not responded in time for this article.
