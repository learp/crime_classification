Britain's most convicted motorist was jailed yesterday for driving while banned for a 48th time.Jamie Manderson, 33, a bouncer from Swindon, Wiltshire, has been disqualified from driving every year since 1988, when he was 15. But the constant bans have not stopped him getting behind the wheel.Manderson's solicitor, Rob Ross, said that, in addition to his being hooked on drugs, the reason for his client's repeat offending was that he had a "very serious addiction to cars".Manderson was jailed for five months by magistrates in Swindon yesterday after admitting driving while disqualified and without insurance in June, shortly after a spell in prison for the same offences.He has nearly 200 previous convictions, mainly for motoring matters. About eight years ago he ran over a 12-year-old cyclist as he drove a robbery getaway car.At yesterday's hearing the court heard how on June 27 Manderson was spotted by a police officer, who instantly recognised his bulky frame at the wheel of a BMW. He was arrested by the officer outside his home after parking.He admitted the fresh offences at the local police station and was remanded in custody.His lawyer told the court: "He has a problem with cars, that's quite obvious. Many people say 'well, why does he not just stop driving?'. It's because he has an obsession with cars."Mamie Beasant, the chief magistrate, refused to impose community service on Manderson in accordance with his lawyer's recommendations.Jailing him, she told Manderson: "Everybody in this court is aware of how many previous times you have been before us for driving while you were not allowed to." She also imposed an additional two-year driving ban on Manderson before sending him down.
