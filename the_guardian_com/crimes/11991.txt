British convicts in Australia are to be sent home, 215 years after Britain founded the modern country as a penal colony.The decision by the high court of Australia means that up to 500,000 Britons resident in Australia could face deportation if they do not meet visa requirements. British and Irish residents in Australia previously had a special status which meant they had no need to take out citizenship. The judgment overturns that status, and declares that any non-citizen who arrived in the country after January 26 1949 is a foreign alien who could face the revocation of their visa. Brian Havard, of the British Australian Pensioners' Association, said that the ruling could affect thousands of Britons who have lived in Australia for decades. "I'm astonished and dismayed," he said. "Thousands of Britons have come to Australia at a time when there were no regulations requiring them to take out citizenship, and this is going to cause an enormous problem. I'm staggered." The ruling was prompted by the case of Jason Shaw, a Briton who has lived in Australia since 1974. In 2001 the immigration department decided to revoke his visa because of a criminal record dating back to the age of 14, leading to a series of legal challenges. By a majority of 4-3, the court decided that the cut-off point for the status of Britons came in 1949, at the point when legislation first defined the nature of Australian citizenship. "The applicant entered Australia as an alien... he did not lose that status by reason of his subsequent personal history in this country," the judgment stated.
