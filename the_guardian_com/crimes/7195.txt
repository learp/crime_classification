Thirty-three men, including a firefighter commended for heroism in the 7/7 London bombings, have been jailed for a total of 200 years after police smashed a £100m cocaine gang in one of the biggest operations of its kind.Simon Ford, who received a London fire brigade gold award after risking his life to rescue victims on the No 30 bus in Tavistock Square in the 2005 terrorist attacks, was a key player in a sprawling network of underworld criminal gangs who flooded south-east England with drugs.He will now serve 14 years in prison.Details of the 41-year-old's case can be reported for the first time after the final member of the drugs and money laundering gang faced sentencing at Southwark crown court and legal restrictions were lifted.As part of Operation Eaglewood, 520 officers carried out simultaneous dawn raids at 30 addresses in the capital and the home counties in February 2008, leading to 16 linked trials spanning two years.A run-down but heavily fortified taxi garage, Royal Oak Taxis, under the Westway in Paddington, west London, was at the hub of the drugs operation.Huge consignments of cocaine, ready for repackaging and distribution, passed through its doors, with the offices also acting as a one-stop money laundering shop, where bags of sterling were swapped for €500 notes.Ford was one of 22 people arrested during the dawn raids, led by Scotland Yard's special intelligence section (SIS) after 10 months of surveillance, with officers employing a mechanical digger to ram through the wall of one address in Uxbridge, Greater London.The Soho-based firefighter was caught by officers at his flat in Chertsey, Surrey, as he divided more than 100kg of cocaine worth around £5.5m, for delivery to a ring of couriers waiting at service stations around the M25.Ford's medal for bravery was displayed on a table near where police caught him sorting through the parcels.The waterproof packages had been picked up the previous night on a beach in Hythe, Kent, after being delivered from Europe by men on an inflatable boat. They were still wet with sea water, police said.Ford, who admitted laundering several million pounds and conspiracy to supply cocaine, had become a trusted member of the network after taking cocaine as he struggled to cope with the aftermath of the 2005 bombings.Cage-fighter Aman Salhan, of Harlington, west London, also found in the flat, was jailed for 17 years after being convicted of conspiracy to supply.As police searched the property, dozens of phone calls were made to three pay-as-you-go mobile phones as worried criminal contacts tried to discover why the two men were late.Detective Superintendent Steve Richardson, the head of SIS, said the operation had dealt "a huge blow" to the British class A drugs industry.The money laundering and drug distribution network was linked to up to 10 criminal gangs with interests in Colombia, Spain, Israel, India, Dubai, Morocco and other north African states.The investigation began after undercover police followed two known drug smugglers as they met a mystery accomplice.They learned that the accomplice was 47-year-old Eyad Iktilat, who operated Royal Oak Taxis, which masqueraded as a taxi repair and loan company but was in fact a front for a vast criminal empire.Millions in cash and drugs passed through its doors, earning Iktilat a fleet of prestige cars including a Bentley Continental, a Ferrari with personalised plates, and several homes.Iktilat, of Euston, central London, was jailed for 30 years after being convicted of money laundering, conspiracy to supply cocaine and cannabis and possession of cocaine.Money mules brought bags of up to £500,000 in cash to the taxi company to be converted into €500 notes via Euro Foreign Exchange (EFX), a corrupt currency exchange company in Paddington, where the manager, 56-year-old Jean-Claude Frigieri, bought hundreds of thousands of pounds-worth of €500 notes from a banknote wholesaler known as Interchange.Frigieri, of West Molesey, Surrey, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of money laundering.Others linked to the gang included a convicted murderer, bodybuilders and Cambridgeshire drug dealer Russell Tate, 49, whose brother, Patrick, who was shot dead in a Range Rover in Rettendon, Essex, in 1995.The gang's main banker, Iraq-born Maythen al-Ansari, 42, was jailed for three years for money laundering after police used a digger to smash down a wall at his Uxbridge home."These criminals had been living the lives of wealthy businessmen through their criminal activity. The lives they are now leading could not be more different," DS Richardson said."The link between drugs and violence has been well made and can ultimately be traced to violence and harm in London's boroughs. Operation Eaglewood has prevented these men contributing to that."
