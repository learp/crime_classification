A man has admitted abducting a nurse, tying her up and leaving her trapped in the freezing boot of a car for 10 days.Justice Ngema, 35, appeared at the high court in Edinburgh today where he pleaded guilty to abducting 38-year-old Magdeline Makola in December last year.The nurse, from Livingston, West Lothian, spent more than a week locked in the boot of the car before being found by police on Boxing Day last year.She had not been seen since leaving work at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 15 December.The South African-born nurse failed to turn up for her shift three days later and was reported missing.An investigation was launched and Makola was discovered by police in the red Vauxhall Astra in the town of Airdrie, Lanarkshire.The court heard that Ngema – also known as Sifiso Praise God Ngema – entered the country using his brother's passport. He had been deported in 2002 after a failed claim for asylum.Advocate-depute Alex Prentice said Ngema made numerous appearances at his victim's flat before finally subjecting her to the ordeal.The court was told that Ngema invited himself into her home and asked for a drink.He then grabbed her with both hands around her neck and said: "I'm a professional in this job, I kill people, you shut up right now."He threatened her with a knife and forced her to lie down in her hallway before punching her in the head, tying her up and demanding her bank details.The court heard that Makola – who sat in court today – believed she was going to be raped.Ngema carried the nurse over his shoulder to her car and put her in the boot. She never saw where she was but guessed she was taken to an airport, railway station and along the M8 motorway.Makola lay in the boot for days, drifting in and out of consciousness as the temperature plunged to below zero.When police found her on 26 December she was in severe pain."She was screaming from the pain," said Prentice. "She was trying to drink from a straw but the water was too cold."While his victim lay in the dark, Ngema used her bank card to go on a shopping spree, visiting designer shops and buying champagne.The court was told that Makola made a good recovery but when found was severely dehydrated and her fingers and toes had begun to turn white. She had renal failure because of muscle damage and dehydration, and medics were at first unable to get a needle into her arm or take her blood pressure.Prentice said: "She would not have survived a further two days in the boot of the car."Ngema sat with his head bowed in the dock as the court heard how he attended a Christmas mass with the family of his then girlfriend while Makola languished in the boot of her own car.He pleaded guilty to 14 charges, including assault causing severe injury, abduction, robbery and a series of thefts.He was remanded in custody to be sentenced in July at the high court in Glasgow.In a statement after the conviction, Makola said she had thought she was going to die."The experience of being trapped is one that will stay with me for the rest of my life."While I was in the boot of the car it was difficult for me to work out how long I had been there, but one of my strongest memories is realising that it was Christmas Day because it was so quiet outside."She said she spent much of her time praying that she would be found."Praying gave me a lot of strength and when the policeman opened the door I was so happy that my prayers had been answered," she said.Morag McLaughlin, the area procurator fiscal for Lothian and Borders, said she was glad Makola had been spared the ordeal of a trial."We hope that she will now go on to rebuild her life."
