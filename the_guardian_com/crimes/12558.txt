Three people were jailed yesterday for torturing a child they accused of being a witch with powers to change from human to animal form.The child, who was eight at the time of the offences, was cut with a knife on her chest, beaten, kicked, starved, whipped with a belt and had chilli peppers rubbed in her eyes. An aunt and another female relative wept as they were jailed for 10 years at the Old Bailey. A male relative was jailed for four years for aiding and abetting child cruelty. Judge Christopher Moss told them they had mounted a campaign of cruelty that amounted to a campaign of torture. "It is the very pinnacle of cruelty to a child that demands the maximum sentence," the judge said. The 40-year-old aunt brought the orphaned girl to England from Angola in 2002. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of four charges of cruelty at an earlier trial. The woman's cousin, Sita Kisanga, 35, of Hackney, east London, was found guilty of three charges of aiding and abetting child cruelty. Both women were cleared of conspiracy to murder the girl. Kisanga's brother, Sebastian Pinto, 33, of Stoke Newington, north London, was found guilty of one charge of aiding and abetting. The court had heard the girl is still traumatised by the experience. The abuse only came to light after she was founded barefoot and shivering on the steps of the council flat where she lived with her aunt and Kisanga in November 2003. She told them she was hungry and later told police she had been surviving on bread and tea. During the trial the girl, who is now 10 and in foster care, said Kisanga had cornered her in the kitchen and told her: "Today you will die." She then pulled out a small knife and cut her. Then the adults gathered in a circle round her. "One kicked me, one slapped me and one pushed me," she said. "I asked myself, 'What have I done?'" The three accused were failed asylum seekers who were unemployed.
