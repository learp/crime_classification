Police forces have been told to drop an "absurd" assumption in criminal vetting that women who chose the prefix Ms may have a marital history, after an MP's complaints on behalf of a nun.The member of a York religious order was questioned on a project helping vulnerable adults when the criminal records bureau returned her form implying an undisclosed husband, or a string of husbands, might lurk in her past. "It was very upsetting for her," said Hugh Bayley, the city's Labour MP, "but it was perhaps more upsetting to discover that it was all down to the fact that she used the title of Ms." The chief executive of the bureau, Bernard Herdan, confirmed in a letter to Mr Bayley that police used the phrase "appears to have a marital history" in Ms cases "as a safeguard against individuals who are trying to conceal previous identities". Mr Herdan apologised for the muddle with the nun. But he said: "It is thought that to err on the side of caution is preferable to the alternative, which may allow applicants to conceal previous identities and gain employment in positions which would put children and vulnerable adults at risk." The guideline has now been countermanded. The junior Home Office minister Lady Scotland said fresh guidance stressed that "in no case must police suggest an applicant has, or appears to have, a marital history, unless there is information to indicate this".
