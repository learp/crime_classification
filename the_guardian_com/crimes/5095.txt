Drugs charities have called for more treatment programmes in jails and the community after the head of the Prison Service admitted that up to 80% of new prisoners were hard drug users.The director-general of the Prison Service, Phil Wheatley, said 55% of people entering prison were classified as "problematic" users of illegal drugs, including cannabis, with another 25% reporting some drug misuse.He told the Independent newspaper that the problem was even more acute in some urban jails, where 80% of new arrivals were found to have taken class A drugs, such as heroin, in the past 48 hours."The number of prisoners who come in who have got substantial drug habits has increased over the years," said Mr Wheatley. "Making sure we can detox people successfully is important."Enver Solomon, policy officer of the Prison Reform Trust, said the Prison Service could barely cope with the spiralling problem of drug misuse.He said it was often worse to detox prisoners without providing them with treatment than to offer them no help with their drug problem at all. This was because detox programmes failed to tackle the root causes of a prisoner's drug habit, so after leaving prison they were even more desperate for a fix.Mr Solomon said: "The prison service cannot begin to cope with problematic drug misuse. "The danger is that prisoners detox but get no treatment. It's one thing to control a drug habit in the controlled environment of a prison, quite another to manage it in the community."Sebastien Saville, the director of the drugs charity Release, blamed the growing problem on the long waiting times for drug treatment in the community.He said: "We need to provide people with treatment as soon as they ask for it. "At present people are waiting at best a few weeks and at worst months for treatment in the community. These long waits contribute to their offending."Rosie Brocklehurst, of Addaction, which runs community-based drug treatment and testing orders and prison drug programmes, also called for more aftercare for drug abusing ex-prisoners. She said: "We need more drug treatment programmes in prison and more aftercare. "There's not enough aftercare in the community, and it needs to form part of a package of care that also deals with employment and housing, to tackle the causes of their drug misuse and offending."
