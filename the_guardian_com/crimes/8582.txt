The mechanic accused of murdering the British backpacker Peter Falconio in the Australian outback carried guns and cable ties like those used to handcuff the tourist's girlfriend, a court heard today.Bradley John Murdoch, 45, also had a habit of removing the SIM card from his mobile phone to avoid being tracked as he made outback journeys, a former housemate told Darwin magistrates court. Mr Murdoch, from the west coast town of Broome, is facing a preliminary hearing charged with murdering 28-year-old Falconio, from west Yorkshire, beside a remote highway in the central Australian desert in July 2001. He is also charged with the deprivation of liberty and unlawful assault of 27-year-old Joanne Lees, of Brighton, who was allegedly bound with handcuffs fashioned from cable ties and tape before she escaped. The prosecution alleges the couple had been travelling in a camper van when Mr Murdoch pulled alongside in his pickup truck and flagged them down on the pretence of a mechanical problem. Brian Johnston, who once shared a house with defendant, told the court that Mr Murdoch owned two handguns - a .357 magnum and a .38 revolver - which he sometimes carried inside the driver's door of his truck. Mr Johnston was shown a replica of the cable tie handcuffs allegedly used to restrain Lees. He told the court they were similar to the ties and tape Murdoch kept in his truck. He also said that Mr Murdoch had two or three SIM cards for his mobile which he removed so his journey could not be tracked. "He reckons that you could track the mobile if it had a SIM card in it," he said. Forensic biologist Carmen Eckhoff told the court that blood found on rocks near the site of the murder matched Falconio's DNA profile. His body was never found. The hearing will determine whether there is enough evidence to try Mr Murdoch, who faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted of murder. He has not been required to enter a plea. The case continues.
