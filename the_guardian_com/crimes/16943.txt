Gowthaman Jeyabalasingam, 23, of Ilford, east London, phoned the police from an all-night party at 7am on 18 July, claiming there would be an attack on the tourist attraction.

He pleaded guilty at Redbridge magistrates court on 1 August and was sentenced at Snaresbrook crown court, east London, today.
