A man who spent 11 years in jail for a murder he did not commit has defeated an attempt to stop him citing other incidents of alleged misconduct by officers involved in his civil suit against South Wales police.Michael O'Brien, 38, was convicted along with Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood, of the murder of Philip Saunders, a Cardiff newsagent, in October 1987.All three had their convictions quashed in January 2000, and Mr O'Brien claims the police acted with "deliberate and flagrant impropriety" in framing them.He has been awarded Â£670,000 as a victim of a miscarriage of justice. But he has launched a high court action against South Wales police for aggravated and exemplary damages, alleging misfeasance in public office and malicious prosecution.Mr O'Brien's lawyers told the appeal court in 2000 that Detective Inspector Stuart Lewis, since retired, had bullied Mr O'Brien and Mr Hall, a vulnerable individual, during interviews; that he had fabricated an account of an allegedly overheard cell conversation between Mr O'Brien and Mr Sherwood, and that DI Lewis's superior, Detective Superintendent Don Carsley, also now retired, had given express or tacit approval to this.Mr O'Brien wants to use alleged examples of similar behaviour by the two former officers in other murder cases as evidence in his action.South Wales police challenged this, arguing "similar fact" evidence was admissible only if it had high relevance in establishing the facts of the case under consideration.Five law lords ruled unanimously yesterday that this "similar fact" evidence was admissible in the civil case.Nogah Ofer, Mr O'Brien's solicitor, said: "Mr O'Brien wants the whole truth to come out and his innocence to be established beyond question." She hoped the case would be listed early next year.
