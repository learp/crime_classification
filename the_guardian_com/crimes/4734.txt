Three men who wore Saddam Hussein masks to carry out armed raids across southern England and Wales were convicted yesterday of robbery offences.The gunmen bought the rubber faces of the deposed Iraqi dictator for £10 each from a joke shop in Blackpool, then embarked on a campaign of violent attacks on isolated shops and public houses. In less than two months last winter they carried out 21 robberies using firearms, knives and baseball bats. Altogether they stole an estimated £32,000. The three - Jamie Miell, 25, from Farnborough, Hampshire; Mark Davies, 27, of Neath, south Wales; and Garri Collins, 22, of Aldershot, Hampshire - now face jail. They are due to be sentenced next week, Judge Zoe Smith told Reading crown court yesterday. Miell, who denied being involved, was found guilty at the end of a two-week trial of one count of conspiracy to rob and 18 of possessing a firearm while committing or attempting to commit a robbery. Davies and Collins pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiracy to rob and to 21 firearms offences. Police became aware of links between five of the earlier raids, most of which were recorded on CCTV, after the films all showed three offenders wearing identical Saddam masks. Six police forces were involved in tracking down the gang.
