A football coach who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years today after being found guilty of killing his girlfriend has a history of attacking young women, it can be disclosed.Ricardo Morrison, 22, used a 15cm (6in) kitchen knife to attack Amy Leigh Barnes, a 19-year-old model, leaving her dying in a pool of blood at their home in Farnworth, near Bolton, Lancashire.  Ricardo Morrison. Photograph: Greater Manchester police/PAMorrison repeatedly attacked a previous girlfriend who was too scared to give evidence against him in his murder trial. He twice bit her on the face and after one assault sent her a text saying: "I hope you die of cancer, just like your dad."Less than a month before he killed Barnes, he attacked five women, headbutting and punching victims in the face in a London nightclub.Described in court as a "bully", Morrison has four previous convictions for assault and one for harassment of the ex-girlfriend. He was never sentenced to custody and broke a restraining order.The jury in his trial at Manchester crown court was not told of his violent past or that he faced five charges of grievous bodily harm for the nightclub attack. Mr Justice MacDuff ruled that the details would prejudice a fair trial and that Morrison faced overwhelming evidence of his guilt anyway.Morrison's mother, Melda Wilks, 50, was cleared of assisting an offender. She collapsed to the floor after her son was found guilty. When the jury returned to court to clear her, Morrison was not in the dock. Wilks, a policewoman, left the dock weeping and was helped from court by one of her legal team.With the families of both Barnes and Morrison in the public gallery, the judge warned there would be "high feeling" in the courtroom when he passed sentence.
