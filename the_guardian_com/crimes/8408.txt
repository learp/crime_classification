The conman Peter Foster, who was at the heart of the so-called Cheriegate scandal, was today jailed for four-and-a-half years in Australia after admitting fraud.Foster, 45, pleaded guilty in the supreme sourt in Brisbane to a charge of fraudulently obtaining just over A$300,000 (£129,000) from the Bank of the Federated States of Micronesia, local media reported from the court.The prosecutor told the court that Foster, who has previous convictions for fraud, took out a A$580,000 loan to develop a tourist resort on an island 80 nautical miles from Suva in Fiji. In 2006 he made nine transfers totalling A$306,772.Foster was at the centre of a media storm in 2002 for his role in helping Tony Blair's wife, Cherie, buy two flats in Bristol, including one for her son, who was studying at the city's university. Already a convicted fraudster, he was the lover of Mrs Blair's close friend and lifestyle guru, Carole Caplin.The scandal revolved around revelations that the conman negotiated nearly £70,000 off the price of the flats and that Mrs Blair, a leading lawyer, had offered advice on how to fight his pending deportation.In the latest court case, Foster said the money was for the tourism project, but the prosecutor said he had provided false documents and false photographs so he could use the money for other purposes.The prosecutor said Foster used the money to pay outstanding rent on a girlfriend's house in Australia and to repay his own credit card debt and family debts, according to Reuters and the Australian Associated Press."Mr Foster went to some lengths to perpetrate the fraud," prosecutor Liz Wilson told the court.Foster is Australia's most high-profile conman, who has been jailed on three continents for peddling bogus slimming products and using false documents.He was arrested by Australian police in February as he arrived in Brisbane on a flight from Vanuatu, where he talked his way out of prison.Foster led south Pacific police on an island-hopping chase early in 2007, fleeing Fiji, where he was wanted on fraud charges, to neighbouring Vanuatu. He left Fiji on an old Australian naval minesweeper, wading ashore on a remote Vanuatu beach.Captured by Vanuatu police, he was convicted of illegally entering the country but, according to Foster, won an early release from prison after a long lunch with his jailers.During the Cheriegate row, Downing Street initially denied that Foster had negotiated the purchase price of the Blair's Bristol flats until the Daily Mail published a detailed email exchange between Foster and Mrs Blair proving otherwise. The wife of the then prime minister accepted the full blame for "any misunderstanding".She later used a teatime engagement at a charity event to make a tearful 10-minute televised statement, explaining that she was a busy wife and mother and admitting she made the phone call to the solicitors handling Foster's deportation case.
