Two Manchester United football stewards appeared in court today accused of breaking the legs of a Manchester City fan. Mark Roberts, 46, of Oldham, and Paul Stringer, 45, of Runcorn, are charged with causing grievous bodily harm. The fan was caught smoking in the ground during the derby match between the two teams at Old Trafford on 20 September. He was allegedly pushed down a flight of stairs, breaking both his legs, while being ejected. Roberts and Stringer appeared at Trafford magistrates court for the hearing. The case was adjourned for a committal hearing on 11 January.
