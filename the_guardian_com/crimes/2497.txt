Police have arrested the chairman of a red squirrel protection society after he deliberately drowned a grey squirrel to provoke the RSPCA into taking him to court.Norris Atthey, head of anti-grey activists Morpeth Red Squirrels, boasted publicly of killing the animal following the animal charity's prosecution of another man, Raymond Elliot, who was found guilty last month of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal after he drowned a squirrel in a water butt.Atthey, a former military policeman from Ulgham, Northumbria, was furious about the prosecution and last week spoke out in the media about his own squirrel cull."I submerged this grey squirrel for a few seconds in the water and it was dead within 30 seconds," he told reporters, adding, "Of approximately 250 greys that I have killed, that has been the quickest method. Normally it can take one to three minutes."Following publicity of his claims, an RSPCA inspector visited the grandfather-of-four's home earlier this week and when Atthey refused to co-operate, two police officers arrived to arrest him.When they searched his house they found five dead grey squirrels in the freezer. Autopsies will be carried out on the animals in due course, but Atthey claims they were to be sold to a Northumberland game supplier for Â£1 each.He was handcuffed at 11am on Wednesday and held at Bedlington police station for ten hours after being questioned on suspicion of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal."I am incensed about the whole affair," he said."People cannot believe what's going on. My solicitor was gobsmacked."Atthey traps grey squirrels to protect native reds, and claims to humanely dispatch them. He normally shoots them with a powerful air rifle but decided to drown one a fortnight ago to challenge the RSPCA.If the charity decides to go ahead and prosecute, Atthey will be summonsed to appear before South East Northumberland magistrates."I'm trying to prove we have to stand up to the RSPCA otherwise we won't be able to trap grey squirrels and reds will die," he said.An RSPCA official said: "Our inspector visited yesterday morning but the man refused to talk with our inspector and just closed the door on him, advising him to get the police in to arrest him in order to facilitate an interview."This was duly done and he was interviewed yesterday at the police station. Investigations are ongoing and we are unable to make any further comment at this stage."
