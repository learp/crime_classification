The lover of a woman whose body was found at the bottom of a lake more than 20 years after she vanished described yesterday a scene of "chaos" at the home she shared with her husband.David Brearley said he visited Carol Park after a telephone call from her husband, Gordon, in which he said she had "gone absolutely berserk". Mr Brearley told the jury at Manchester crown court that he called at Mrs Park's home to pick her up following a failed reconciliation attempt and found broken glass and compost strewn about the house. Park, 60, from Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, denies murdering his wife by bludgeoning her to death before dumping her body in Coniston Water in July 1976. The court heard that Mrs Park moved out from Bluestones, the home she had shared with her husband, and into a house with Mr Brearley in Middlesbrough. But following the split, Park won custody of the couple's three children. Mr Brearley told the court: "The thing she missed so desperately was the children. She was absolutely shattered when she lost the custody battle." He added that she decided to go back home for the children and not to be with Gordon. But days after her return he received a call from Park who said she did not want to be with her husband. Mr Brearley went to collect Mrs Park and though they tried to live together again, he told the court she wanted to be with her children and she went back to Park in July 1976. Under cross-examination by Andrew Edis QC, Mr Brearley said the atmosphere in the house had been tense during the days before Mrs Park returned to her husband. When she left, she gave Mr Brearley no notice and simply asked Park for a lift to Cumbria when he came to pick up the children after a visit. Mrs Park never contacted Mr Brearley again even though the pair lived together for around a year. The hearing continues.
