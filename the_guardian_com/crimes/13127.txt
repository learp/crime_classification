Two men who tried to stop a mobile phone theft were carried about 200 metres on the bonnet of a speeding getaway car.Motorway patrol officers detained a Romanian man, who lives in Manchester, near Birmingham's Spaghetti Junction on Wednesday night.The 24-year-old man was taken into custody on suspicion of attempting to wound the two men, who had intervened after a woman's phone was stolen from a pub in the Harborne area of Birmingham and tried to stop the suspect driving away.Witnesses phoned police at about 7.45pm after seeing the victims clinging to the windscreen wipers of a car travelling at up to 40mph. The men were thrown from the vehicle as it braked at nearby traffic lights.A police spokesman said the men, aged 28 and 38, suffered only minor injuries.The car drove away from the scene, but was tracked on to the M6 and eventually halted in the Erdington area.Detective Sergeant Charlotte Trimbee said: "The men ran to the aid of a woman whose phone had been taken and confronted the suspect but they soon found themselves clinging on to the car's bonnet."They undoubtedly acted very bravely but we would never encourage members of the public to put themselves in situations where their safety is jeopardised."Details of the getaway car were phoned through to police and meant we were quickly able to pick up the suspect's vehicle and make an arrest."
