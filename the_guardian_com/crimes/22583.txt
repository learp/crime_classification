Gangsters and individuals or businesses that help them could be hit by a new kind of "super-Asbo" under proposals announced today.The Home Office hopes that Serious Crime Prevention Orders (SCPO) will help lead its crackdown on organised crime bosses who currently consider themselves "untouchable".It is hoped the order - which has similarities to some anti-terror measures - might make people on the fringes of gangs think twice about committing an offence.As with Antisocial Behaviour Orders (Asbos), anyone who receives a civil injunction through an SCPO would be banned from certain activities or face a possible maximum of five years in jail.Under the proposals, known criminals could face travel limitations or be restricted to calling certain approved numbers on their telephones.The orders could also impose certain credit cards or bank accounts to be used and place limits put on the amount of money an individual could. Organised crime costs the UK more than Â£20bn annually.The SCPOs aim to thwart and frustrate people involved in crimes such as drug trafficking, organised immigration crime, credit card and identity fraud and money laundering.They are part of a raft of Home Office proposals contained in the consultation paper New Powers For Organised and Financial Crime. The consultation period ends on October 17.Other measures include improved data sharing between the public and private sector on suspected fraudsters.The Home Office also wants a new offence of encouraging or assisting a criminal act to help strengthen the current law and make it easier to bring to justice those involved in the margins of organised crime.The home secretary, John Reid, said: "Organised crime is an insidious scourge on our society and we want to ensure that the UK is tackling it at every level."The proposals we are putting forward are designed to prevent these criminals from operating on UK soil, to disrupt their activities, target them more effectively and make it harder for them to evade detection."We also know that financial criminals are experts at exploiting and using information held by agencies, which is why we are focusing on improved data sharing."The measures may help bolster the strength of the criminal justice system, which often finds itself having a choice between prosecuting or taking no action at all.The SCPO would be a high court civil order that could be challenged in the court of appeal. Prosecutions would be brought by the Crown Prosecution Service, the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office or the Serious Fraud Office.The courts would impose an order if they believe on the balance of probability that the suspect had acted in a way that facilitated or was likely to facilitate a serious crime. They would also impose an order if they felt it was necessary and proportionate to prevent such criminal harm in the future.The Home Office could not estimate how many people would be targeted by the proposed order, but suggested more than 1,000 people were already on its radar.It is possible the orders may be vulnerable to challenges using the Human Rights Act.However, the Home Office believes these orders would be a useful additional tool in preventing crime, while reflecting the need for a "conscious and careful choice" between prosecuting or imposing civil measures. It also argues that this response is "proportionate" in the way it would affect the rights of those affected.Instances where the order might be useful include if there is evidence of crimes committed overseas that cannot be prosecuted in the UK or if the subject has been released after conviction overseas and might be subject to strict licence conditions in the UK.
