Ms Wails, wearing a red jumper with her hair tied back in a ponytail, listened intently to proceedings at Newcastle crown court via a prison video link. A packed public gallery watched on a large screen as Ms Wails spoke only to confirm her name and plead not guilty to the murder of her son. Alexander died of a combination of carbon monoxide poisoning and burns, suffered in the fire that swept through the lounge of their home. Judge David Hodson remanded Ms Wails in custody and ordered her to reappear again via video link for a further hearing on November 15.
