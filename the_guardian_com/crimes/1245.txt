Jails do not allow visits on Christmas Day. So for the 77,000 people that were incarcerated on December 25, a phone call was the only way of keeping in touch with their families.Shame, then, that BT charges prisoners more than five times the standard payphone rate: a 15-minute call from prison costs £1.65, compared to 30p from a public phone. As many inmates earn only about £4 a week, it's a fair bet that many of the 90,000 children who were separated from a parent over the festive period didn't get to speak to mum or dad.BT is cagey, confirming only that there is a difference between prison and public charges and that, as the prison phone system was designed for the service, comparisons should not be made.It's true that BT was asked to design and supply a new pin-phone system for prisoners - inmates have to submit telephone numbers for approval, and a computer checks whether they are allowed to call a particular number and if they have the means to pay - but the contract is highly lucrative and running costs are low. Either way, these charges run counter to the prison service's commitment to encouraging prisoners to maintain family ties.Lucy Gampbell, director of the campaign group, Action for Prisoners' Families, says the system is cutting off inmates from their relatives. "Phone calls are a lifeline for families of prisoners, especially the children," she says.
