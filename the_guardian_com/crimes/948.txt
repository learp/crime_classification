Detectives have released CCTV footage of a man stealing a case of Lucozade from a supermarket in south London while riding a hoverboard.The man, wearing a grey tracksuit, is seen entering the Co-op in Streatham Road, Mitcham, on one of the vehicles and travelling around the store before nonchalantly leaving with a crate of the energy drink in his arms.The Metropolitan police released footage of the incident, which took place on 6 September, as part of an appeal for help to identify the man.The fad for hoverboards – also known as self-balancing scooters – is growing, and they are proving popular with footballers and rap stars.However, Crown Prosecution Service guidance released in October states that the vehicles are too unsafe to ride on public roads. The guidance, which was initially released for Segway scooters, points out that as self-balancing scooters are powered vehicles they are also illegal to ride on the pavement under section 72 of the Highway Act 1835. They are only legal to use on land that is private property and only with the landowner’s permission, the CPS said.This article was amended on 11 December 2015 to remove images and video footage of the incident for legal reasons.
