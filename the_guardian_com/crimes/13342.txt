"Don't make a point of asking what anyone else is in for, don't seem to be nosey, try to avoid giving out too many personal details to your cellmates, and certainly do not proclaim your innocence. No one likes to hear someone else continually complaining about being hard done to."These words of advice on how to survive prison are available on a new website, created by Andy Evans, who spent 16 months inside after he was convicted of causing death by careless driving.Evans, 32, admits he was not prepared. "All I knew about prison was from TV programmes such as Bad Girls," he says. "I expected violence to be a major factor and for the screws to be evil. So you can understand why I was bricking it."In reality, Evans saw only the odd fight in HMPs Bullingdon and Springhill - category C and D prisons - and says he found most of the prison officers surprisingly supportive. But he adds that it was still a disorientating experience.While serving his sentence, he had the idea for the website to help others in trouble. It offers help on anything from being arrested to how the prison system works and coping with life back outside.The site also brings together details of some 900 support agencies and contacts, from local solicitors to taxi firms that charge families reasonable rates for prison visits, and recruitment agencies that offer work to ex-offenders."A website like this would have made me and my family much more prepared for prison," Evans says. "And from other prisoners I spoke to, it became clear there was a real need for this service."Evans learned desktop publishing and web design in prison. His tutor at Springhill, David Wilderspin, says Evans has "worked tirelessly to make his idea a reality" since his release in October. He hopes to raise money from sponsorship and advertising.The one drawback is that prisoners are not able to access the internet. Free fact sheets will be available.Â· Details: www.sentdown.co.uk.
