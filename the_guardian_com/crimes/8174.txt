Two detectives who investigated a knife attack on a young father who pleaded for police protection eight months before he was shot dead will face a disciplinary hearing.Family members claim police failed to protect Peter Woodhams, 22, of east London, from youths who harassed and intimidated him in the months before his murder.The two officers, a detective sergeant and a detective constable, could be forced to resign if they are found guilty of misconduct, the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced today.Bradley Tucker, the teenager who shot Mr Woodhams, was jailed for life earlier this month.Eight months before his death, Mr Woodhams was stabbed in the neck and had his face slashed by a group of youths because he confronted them about stones being thrown at his new car.Seven other police, including three officers, two sergeants and a detective sergeant, would receive written warnings for their failings in the first investigation, the IPCC said.The nine were a mixture of officers who attended the scene on the night of the stabbing and those involved in the investigation.One detective constable would also be given "words of advice". Three more officers were cleared of wrongdoing but would be given guidance.One of the two detectives facing a misconduct hearing has since been transferred to Derbyshire police.An IPCC report on the investigation will be published after the misconduct tribunal ends. It is expected to take place in the autumn.In the meantime, the report and its recommendation have been sent to the Metropolitan police.The IPCC commissioner Deborah Glass said: "The Metropolitan police service has assured me that these recommendations will be progressed immediately.""Mr Woodhams' family has suffered a terrible loss in his death. Despite this, they have acted with the utmost dignity throughout this sad time and I hope that the IPCC investigation and misconduct proceedings, at which members of the family will be expected to give evidence, will be able to answer some of the questions they may have about the way the police investigated the stabbing."Scotland Yard apologised to Mr Woodhams' family for "any hurt" caused by the way police investigated the knife attack.Last year the deputy commissioner, Paul Stephenson, told a committee meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority that the response to the initial attack appeared to be "unacceptable".
