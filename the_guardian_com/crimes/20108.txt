Disgraced former MSP Bill Walker has been jailed for 12 months for a string of attacks against his three former wives and a stepdaughter that spanned decades.Walker, of Alloa in Clackmannanshire, was convicted of 23 charges of domestic abuse and one breach of the peace last month after a two-week trial.The 71-year-old, who clung to his Dunfermline seat for 16 days after the verdict, returned to Edinburgh sheriff court on Friday, where he was sentenced by Sheriff Kathrine Mackie.Walker was found guilty of assaulting his first wife, Maureen Traquair, on three separate occasions in the 1960s and 1980s. On one occasion he punched her in the face, giving her a black eye two weeks before they married in January 1967.Traquair told the court she had to buy concealer to hide the bruise on the couple's wedding day.Walker was convicted of assaulting his second wife, Anne Gruber, 15 times between 1978 and 1984.On various occasions Gruber was punched, slapped, kicked and pushed to the ground. Walker spat on her face, threw household items at her, threatened to pour hot coffee over her and pulled her hair.He also breached the peace by leaping into Gruber's home brandishing an air rifle after she went out for a birthday meal with another man.Walker was also found guilty of assaulting and injuring Gruber's 16-year-old daughter, Anne Louise Paterson, by repeatedly striking her on the head with a saucepan in 1978.Gruber told the court: "He turned on her and whacked her repeatedly over the head with a yellow saucepan that was so badly broken up it was put in the bin. He battered her so hard she was down on the floor. Her head was bleeding and she was bruised."The disgraced politician was found guilty of four assaults on his third wife, Diana Walker, three of which involved slapping or punching her on the face. The attacks happened between June 1988 and January 1995.She told the court her husband also recorded her phone calls and made her sign an agreement to do all household chores in their home.Walker's crimes were committed at addresses in Edinburgh, Stirling, Midlothian and Alloa between 1967 and 1995.Diana Walker told the court she spoke to journalists about her ex-husband after hearing him supporting a women's aid project for victims of domestic abuse.The former SNP MSP, who was suspended and later expelled from the party after the allegations surfaced in the Sunday Herald newspaper in March last year, denied all the charges. He said he had acted in self-defence in relation to three of them.Giving evidence, Walker claimed he was the victim of "smearing" and that his ex-wives colluded to accuse him of domestic violence. But Mackie said Walker was not a credible witness and the evidence shows he was "controlling, domineering, demeaning and belittling" towards his former wives.The sheriff said she preferred the evidence of the crown witnesses, particularly Walker's ex-wives, whom she found credible and reliable.Walker initially refused to vacate his Holyrood seat after the verdict, despite pressure from campaigners and MSPs, the vast majority of whom signed a motion calling for him to step down.He faced having his salary cut by 90% if jailed, after the parliament's corporate body recommended the move for MSPs who go to prison.The politician finally resigned on 7 September, blaming a "media onslaught" that made it impossible for him to continue.Walker was elected to the Scottish parliament in a surprise victory for the SNP two years ago.On a night of success for the party, he beat the previous Lib Dem winner into third place and finished 590 votes above Labour. The byelection to fill his Dunfermline seat will be held on 24 October.Making reference to sentencing reports prepared for the hearing, Mackie told Walker: "Your incredulity at being convicted of these offences and your perceived victimisation are further indications of your abdication of responsibility for your behaviour."You have shown what can only be described as contempt for your former wives and your stepdaughter in the derogatory manner in which you refer to them."I formed the opinion that you have no understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on victims or children."I have been unable to detect, either during the trial or in the reports, any evidence of remorse for anything or anyone except yourself."The sheriff said that given his "extreme denial" of his behaviour, it was unrealistic to expect Walker to engage fully with any non-custodial domestic abuse programme.Mackie said: "I formed the impression that in the few incidents where you acknowledged the use of physical force, you believed you were entitled to or justified in its use, and certainly have made no apology for it."Your denial appears to me to be absolute. There is no acknowledgement of any unacceptable behaviour, there is no indication of any motivation to change."
