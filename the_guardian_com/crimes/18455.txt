More than 120 mourners gathered for the funeral today of Raoul Moat, the former nightclub bouncer who shot his ex-girlfriend and murdered her new partner before going on to shoot and blind a police officer.Family, neighbours and a number of people who had never met him, filed into the service at the West Road crematorium in Newcastle to the sound of Behind Blue Eyes by The Who, which opens with the lines: "No one knows what it's like to be the bad man".Moat, who took his own life on 10 July following a six-hour standoff with police, was cremated because his family wants to avoid members of the public paying homage at a grave, but mourners included a mother of eight who travelled hundreds of miles to the crematorium.Theresa Bystram, who journeyed from Weybridge, Surrey, with three of her teenage sons, admitted that she did not know Moat. "I just think he is a hero and I wanted to pay my respects," said the 45-year-old. "He kept them coppers on the run all that time."But a former neighbour, Brian Johnson, 27, of South Shields, South Tyneside, said Moat was "no hero"."I came to pay my last respects. What he did was wrong but he was still liked by a lot of people," he said.Moat's brother, Angus, who was one of the pallbearers, and his uncle, Charlie Alexander, made a statement to the media following the service, in which they appealed for privacy."We understand there is an element of public interest and from now on we view this as an investigation into the procedures surrounding the events of recent weeks," they said.Apostmortem carried out the day after Moat died found the cause of death to be a gunshot wound consistent with the sawn-off shotgun he had been carrying.But after seeing his body and hearing that police marksmen had fired Tasers at around the same time as he died, his family paid for a second postmortem, the results of which may be released next week.Northumbria police have so far arrested 21 people in connection with their inquiry into the events of earlier this month.
