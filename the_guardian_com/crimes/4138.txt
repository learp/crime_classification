A breastfeeding mother and a businessman who were detained during a May Day protest for more than seven hours without food, drink, or toilet facilities launched a high court compensation claim for false imprisonment yesterday.The case is being brought by Lois Austin and Geoffrey Saxby - with 150 other claims pending. The two were among about 3,000 people who were corralled in Oxford Circus, central London, from 2pm until 9.30pm by riot police during the anti-globalisation demonstration in 2001. Ms Austin, 35, from Southwark, south London, and Mr Saxby, 48, from Hastings, East Sussex, who works for a company selling data recording equipment, both claim damages including aggravated and exemplary damages for false imprisonment and a breach of their right to liberty under the European convention on human rights. They claim the police action left them humiliated and intimidated. The Metropolitan police argue that the containment was the lawful exercise of their common law powers to deal with an actual or apprehended breach of the peace. The hearing continues.
