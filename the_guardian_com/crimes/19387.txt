Jack Straw yesterday moved to reassure Labour MPs and trade unions that he actively supports government plans to strengthen the law on corporate manslaughter, but is determined that change must be effective.The foreign secretary acted after yesterday's Guardian reported him as trying to block the proposed draft bill because of "serious problems" which might make it better to maintain the status quo, despite concern that culpable corporate negligence has rarely been punished severely. Yesterday Mr Straw telephoned Tony Dubbins, the TUC's point man on the issue, to assure him that he was "committed". The discussion was cordial, officials said. It emerged yesterday that Mr Straw, a barrister who wrote a paper in favour of reform when home secretary in 2000, is concerned in his current role that diplomats could become liable, under badly drafted legislation, for claims from overseas about foreign office advice that went wrong. Though officials offered no specific example, Mr Straw may have drawn lessons from the heavy criticism of the Foreign Office website's travel advisory note on Bali shortly before the 2002 nightclub bombings by Islamist terrorists. No 10 refused all comment but there was no attempt in Whitehall to deny that, as reported, Mr Straw had written to John Prescott, voicing practical doubts on behalf of his department. Suggestions that Mr Straw was acting in tandem with Gordon Brown were sharply rejected by both departments yesterday. Labour promised reform on the concept of corporate manslaughter in two manifestos and in its July deal with the unions at Warwick. The plan is for a draft bill to be produced for wider examination after the November 23 Queen's Speech. One idea being floated to protect public officials from legal attack is to distinguish between policy advice and factual advice - only faulty factual advice would leave them liable.
