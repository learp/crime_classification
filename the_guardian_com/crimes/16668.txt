A nine-year-old girl was strangled in a lorry by her stepfather who then hanged himself in woodland near the site at a Little Chef cafe in Northamptonshire, police said today.The girl's body was discovered yesterday afternoon in the cab of the Spar delivery vehicle, which was parked near the cafe on the busy A605 near Warmington.Northamptonshire police said the 40-year-old, who was found hanged from a tree, and the girl were taken to Leicester royal infirmary on Saturday night for postmortem examinations.Police said the girl, who along with the man, is from the West Midlands, thought she was accompanying her stepfather as a "treat", and that her mother had had no concerns before her tragic death.Detective Chief Inspector Tricia Kirk said today: "Any death is distressing for police officers, but when it's a child and in such violent circumstances, it's even worse. I cannot begin to imagine what the family are going through. We have family liaison officers with them trying to answer any questions that they may have. We believe the little girl was murdered and the man then committed suicide."The names of the girl or the man were not released as not all family members had been informed.A phone call was received by police at 2pm on Saturday from an HGV company concerned that one of its delivery lorries had not returned to base. The vehicle was tracked to the A605 and discovered parked near the Little Chef. Officers found the body of the girl in its unlocked cab.After discovering the girl, a wider search was launched and police found the body of her mother's boyfriend hanging from a tree close to the lorry park.Northamptonshire police are appealing for information from anyone who saw the Spar lorry – registration number BV57 FMC – in the Midlands area at any time between 3am on Friday and 2pm on Saturday.The man and girl began their journey at about 3am on Friday and the vehicle was due to return to base later that day. Police believe that the vehicle was parked in the lorry park in the afternoon or evening on Friday. "We believe it's all taken place in the vicinity of that layby," said Kirk.
