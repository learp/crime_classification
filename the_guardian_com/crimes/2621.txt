The home secretary is legally entitled to set minimum jail terms for killers serving mandatory life sentences, the high court ruled today.The court rejected accusations that Jack Straw's powers to fix tariffs for retribution and deterrence were unlawful because they were "incompatible" and inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights and in breach of the new Humans Rights Act. The ruling will come as a relief to the government. A decision against the home secretary could have paved the way for many of the country's most notorious criminals, including Moors murderer Myra Hindley, to gain their freedom. Hindley's QC Edward Fitzgerald had applied for a test case declaration on behalf of two other lifers that judges - not politicians - should set the minimum terms for mandatory lifers. Anthony Anderson and John Taylor both had their tariffs for murder increased by the home secretary. Dismissing their application for judicial review, Lord Justice Rose, sitting with Mr Justice Sullivan and Mr Justice Penry-Davey, said: "I conclude that parliament by primary legislation has conferred on the home secretary the power to fix the tariff for mandatory lifers." A Home Office spokeswoman had earlier indicated that most of the tariffs for the country's estimated 3,000 mandatory lifers had been set in line with the recommendations of judges - but there were still hundreds of cases where the home secretary had raised the tariffs. Had today's ruling gone against the government, those tariffs could have come become liable for review.Mr Fitzgerald was granted leave to appeal.Related articles 21.02.2001: Test case on jail tariff could set Hindley free 14.02.2001: Act helps brutal killer avoid justiceUseful links Human Rights Act 1998 Home Office human rights unit European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights
