An alcoholic caretaker who was convicted of causing the deaths of two young jockeys by killing them in a fire attack was given an indeterminate jail sentence today.Peter Brown, 37, was told he must serve at least seven and a half years in prison before he is eligible for parole. He was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection at Leeds crown court after previously being convicted of manslaughter.Passing sentence, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told him: "The offences of which you have been convicted are extremely serious. As a result of your actions, two young people, aged 18 and 19, both of whom had embarked on promising careers in the field of horse racing, lost their lives."She said Jamie Kyne's family had lost a much loved son, grandson and brother. Jan Wilson's family had lost a much loved daughter and granddaughter. "For them, life will never again be the same," she added.The judge said independent assessments had concluded that Brown still posed a significant risk to the public. In particular, his lack of control when faced by rejection was demonstrated by his actions on the night of the fire.During a three-week trial earlier this year, the court heard how he lit a heap of rubbish at the flats in Norton, North Yorkshire, and the blaze ripped through the block, killing talented jockey Kyne, 18, from Kiltrogue, Co Galway and Wilson, 19, from Forfar, Scotland.But a jury concluded that he was not guilty of murder after they deliberated for two days, because he did not intend to kill the pair. The three-week trial had heard harrowing accounts of the tragedy in September 2009, where scores of people were asleep in the flats.Brown, a father of one whose marriage collapsed due to his drinking, was an inept hanger-on at social events. On the night of the fire, he was turned away from a party and spent the evening brooding in local pubs, taking cocaine and drinking an estimated six double whiskies, two singles and three beers.Witnesses described him as angry on the night, rather than simply frustrated by the rebuff, which was one of a series of rejections at the hands of young people.Lizzie Murphy, 18, a stablehand who was rescued from the smoke-filled building, told the jury of six women and six men how she had closed the door on Brown, while another friend of the jockeys complained of him sending her "creepy texts" calling her a "whore with a queer boyfriend".The trial heard fire brigade tapes of Murphy screaming for help alongside Jan Wilson, who was seen shouting out of the window of the flat before it was engulfed in flames. She described how she managed to shin down a drainpipe with another friend while two other trainee jockeys jumped from the fifth floor window.Dean Pratt, a jockey who escaped, said he found it difficult to breathe as the place was full of thick smoke.He was knocked unconscious in the fall and broke his hand, landing at the feet of another tenant in the block, 45-year-old Martin Brown, no relation, who described running from the blazing building as people jumped for their lives. The court heard that white spirit had probably been used to accelerate the spread of the fire, while the flats' stairwell had acted like a chimney.Police were immediately concerned about Peter Brown, who was at the scene as emergency services arrived, and according to witnesses began "acting like a madman". He shoved a police officer, made futile attempts to get into the blazing building and talked about the fire possibly being a mafia-style "hit".Brown, originally from Aberdeen, exercised his right not to give evidence, but his counsel, Paul Watson, told the jury that they had heard plenty of supposition about motive, but "little or nothing in the way of good old-fashioned evidence".The court heard that Brown had previously been convicted of criminal damage and sending obscene or menacing texts to his wife, just before their marriage collapsed four years ago. The victims were well known in the neighbouring horseracing towns of Norton and Malton, where an annual Bright Young Star award has been set up in their memory.At the time of his death, Kyne was third in the apprentice jockey championship, riding for John Quinn's yard at Malton. A fellow trainer, Adrian McGuinness, said: "He had the makings to go the whole way as a jockey. They called him the jewel of the north."Wilson was described as "very good, very capable and with tremendous potential" by trainer David Barron, who employed her as a rider at his yard in Thirsk, also in North Yorkshire.
