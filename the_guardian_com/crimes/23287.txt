How many times have I been stopped and searched? How many times do you go to the cupboard and get cranberry juice out? It happens so often.It is only since I've been studying law that I've been asking why I've been stopped. I was 14 when I was first stopped by the police. I was asked to do an ID parade and I was picked out four times and then asked questions about my whereabouts. I become defensive when I am stopped because I am weary of being pulled up and it makes you feel stigmatised. It can happen any time and I try to stay off the streets as much as possible. It is inconvenient - especially when I have not done anything wrong and it makes you feel like a criminal. My worst experience was when I got my shoulder busted and went unconscious for a short while after I was stopped and searched. I was 26. It is no wonder they have problems with youth culture when the police have criminalised two generations of black people. The last time I was stopped was in a bar with friends - I was wearing a suit. They just walked up to me. No matter how you look, they are still going to stop you. Wesley Walters-Stephenson, 31, is a race relations trainer for the police
