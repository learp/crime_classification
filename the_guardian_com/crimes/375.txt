An innovative scheme to teach journalism skills to people in prison is to be extended across the country after being piloted at Wandsworth prison.The Pathways to Journalism course, devised by the National Union for Journalists and writers and educationalists in prisons, is to be made available to penal institutions all over England and Wales after it was granted approval by the National Open College Network.The general secretary of the NUJ, Jeremy Dear, who came up with the scheme with Anne Redmon, then writer in residence at HMP Wandsworth, said the scheme helped prisoners gain new confidence."What we both had was the belief that in every prison there were those who could tell a brilliant story, write, edit, design and illustrate with flair and imagination and that, given a chance, could improve their skills, their self-esteem and gain a new confidence."The pilot took place at Wandsworth. Alongside the inmates many others, from prison officers to educators and journalists themselves, helped shape and promote our idea."Pathways to Journalism has been piloted in eight prisons since 2001 and is approved by the Offenders' Learning and Skills Unit.It includes six levels, ranging from a basic introduction to journalism to graduate level work.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
