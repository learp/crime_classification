David Cameron demanded a return to "common sense" policing today after criticising the "ridiculous" treatment of the TV presenter Myleene Klass, who says she was warned by officers after waving a kitchen knife at intruders who had entered the garden of her home.In an interview on ITV's This Morning, the Tory leader also said there was not going to be a lot of money for extra police under a Conservative government because of the party's commitment to cutting the deficit.Referring to the warning received by Klass, Cameron said he did not know the full facts of the case but said the police "do seem to do things that slightly fly in the face of common sense".Klass says she was warned by officers about waving a knife to scare off intruders at her home near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire on Friday.Cameron said: "If that is the case I think it is ridiculous to complain about someone who is obviously worried about what people were threatening her with."He went on: "I don't know the facts of the case and sometimes when you look at these cases and you find a bit more detail, you find it is not quite â€¦ what it appears. But we want some common sense in policing."One of the things that has gone wrong with all this red tape and form filling is that we are taking away discretion from the nurse, the teacher, the doctor, the police officer. We have got to give them back that discretion."Klass, who was at home with her daughter at the time of the incident, said yesterday she had no regrets at doing "what any other mother would do".But she said she had been told by Hertfordshire police officers that she should not have used a knife to scare the intruders off.Hertfordshire police said in a statement that "the story, based on quotes from Ms Klass's publicist and interpreted by some national newspapers, does not reflect the events of that night in an accurate way".It added: "Ms Klass was treated with respect and sympathy by the police officers who came to her home, spending around 40 minutes with her and members of her family. They checked that the young men who had been seen in her garden were no longer anywhere near her home and established that no property had been stolen or damaged and that no crime had been committed."
