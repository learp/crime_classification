A 15-year-old boy appeared in court on Saturday accused of attempted murder after two other teenage boys were stabbed at a London school. The youngster, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is also accused of grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article. He was remanded in youth detention accommodation by district judge Timothy Stone at Camberwell Green magistrates court in south London and will appear next at Woolwich crown court on 18 December. One teenager was left in a critical condition and another taken to hospital with minor injuries after they were stabbed at Kingsdale foundation school in Alleyn Park, Dulwich, south-east London on Thursday. The incident happened shortly before 3.30pm, and pupils were kept inside buildings as emergency services dealt with the situation. The school reopened on Friday. An application for bail was refused.
