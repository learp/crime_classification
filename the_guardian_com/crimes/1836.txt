A woman who falsely accused a man of rape and turned his life into the "stuff of nightmares" was jailed today for 18 months. Samantha Merry, 21, of Chelmsford, Essex, admitted perverting the course of justice during a hearing at Chelmsford crown court.Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC said Merry's "wickedness" had "discredited the administration of justice" and wasted police time. Prosecutors said Merry had made a 13-page statement, the rape inquiry occupied more than 200 hours of police time, and £3,700 of public money had been spent on forensic examinations alone. The judge was told that Merry's victim had been arrested after eight police officers woke him and his family in the middle of the night. He spent 23 hours in police custody and 16 weeks on bail.Inconsistent forensic evidence and CCTV footage caused police to question the allegation and Merry had admitted lying, prosecutors said. Merry said a crack cocaine dealer had told her to make the allegation and she had hoped to clear a £3,000 drug debt."Your motivation was entirely for your financial benefit in exchange for the victim's imprisonment. As a result of your allegation your victim's life became the stuff of which nightmares are made," said the judge.Paul Donegan, for Merry, said the "use of cocaine had troubled" his client for some years and she was receiving treatment. She suffered from depression and panic attacks and that there had been little "pre-planning". Donegan said Merry had suffered as a result of her offence being reported in the media. "She has suffered a significant amount of abuse," he said. "She has also lost a number of friends."
