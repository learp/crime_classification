Five children have been rescued from paedophiles who abused them and broadcast their ordeals on the internet, it emerged today.The boys and girls, aged between seven and 13, were rescued in three police raids in Scotland and two in England.Scotland's National Sex Crimes Unit, set up earlier this year, has begun legal proceedings against a number of suspects."This was one of our most harrowing and disturbing cases, but it clearly demonstrated the value of, and real need for, the unit," Derek Ogg QC, who heads the unit, told Scotland's Daily Record newspaper."Until the police investigation revealed these results, we were unaware of the full extent of child exploitation going on in our own backyard."The children had suffered daily abuse which was filmed for broadcasting to other paedophiles, either live or recorded, on the internet.The operation began in Scotland after a man was arrested for other alleged sex offences. The children were identified, and raids to free them were launched immediately.Scottish police passed on information to English counterparts, who carried out further raids.Ogg said "incredibly dedicated officers â€¦ worked night and day to put an end to these children's daily ordeal".
