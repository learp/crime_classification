A paedophile who carried out sex attacks on girls as young as three, committing 89 known offences in the process, was today jailed for life.Anthony Barron, who kept a video record of his offences, had earlier today been found guilty of the rape and attempted rape of a 12-year-old.The 54-year-old grandfather, of Grove, Wantage, had admitted 87 other offences against 11 children in a catalogue of abuse that spanned nine years. Judge Julian Hall, sentencing Barron at Oxford crown court, said that the attacks were "as serious as I think I have ever come across. I see no reason not to jail you for life." He said Barron had not demonstrated "a hint of sympathy" for his victims, whom he had treated "as if they were toys".Barron's campaign of sexual offences included 27 indecent assaults, 11 sexual assaults, five charges of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, two counts of indecency with a child, three attempted rapes and one assault by penetration.He was also found guilty of 37 counts of making indecent photographs of children and one count of possessing an indecent photograph - charges relating to the comprehensive video record he kept of his activities.He lured the girls, who were between three and 12 years old, to play at his home with toys and games and bribed them with sweets and lollies to keep what happened to them a secret.Police raided his home after one of the children, aged five, told her mother she had seen Barron's penis. They found a stash of toys for children aged two and upwards.The court heard that the computer engineer would befriend the parents by taking up roles at primary schools, youth clubs and cub groups and persuade them to allow their children to stay at his house.Once the children were there, he would groom them into allowing him to abuse them in front of a video camera. The offences reflected a "pattern of behaviour", said Judge Hall, that showed the defendant as a "predatory and plausible paedophile who totally abused the trust" of the families he befriended. Barron even formed a sexual relationship with the mother of one of his victims.The offences of attempted rape took place in 2003, 2004 and 2006, and involved children as young as four as well as the offences relating to the 12-year-old girl.Officers were able to make a comprehensive list of his attacks by identifying the children in the videos.Judge Hall said: "The filming you indulged in, collecting souvenirs as you chillingly put it, I can't imagine anything worse than a parent knowing that their child has not only been abused but also knowing that film exists of that abuse."Speaking outside court, senior prosecution lawyer Jenny Jonckheer called it "undoubtedly the worst case of child abuse that I have seen in my 30 years' experience of prosecuting criminal cases"."Anthony Barron subjected his victims to the most brutal and horrific abuse imaginable, sometimes whilst they were asleep."
