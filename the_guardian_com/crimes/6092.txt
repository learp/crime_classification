An alleged IRA member has been granted the right to appeal against a terrorist conviction in Northern Ireland.Martin McCauley, arrested in Colombia in 2001 on suspicion of selling bombmaking technology to a Marxist guerilla group, has learned that the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) in Northern Ireland will not stand in the way of his appeal against a conviction for possessing weapons in 1982.His appeal case hinges on revelations years later that security services had secretly recorded a police raid on an IRA arms dump in north Armagh, during which he was seriously wounded and teenager Michael Tighe was shot dead.The covert recording had not been disclosed during McCauley's trial in 1985. He had insisted that he and Tighe were unarmed when Royal Ulster constabulary officers opened fire on them, which during the trial the RUC said was untrue.It emerged many years later that MI5 had in fact placed a bugging device in the arms dump around the time of the shooting and may have even recorded the incident.During his investigation into alleged shoot-to-kill policies involving police and troops against republican suspects, the former deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester police, John Stalker, uncovered the existence of the recording device.Gerald Simpson QC told the court of appeal in Belfast that he had been instructed to read a statement on behalf of the PPS. It said material relevant to the decision to prosecute McCauley was withheld from the director of public prosecutions at the time, from the court and from the defence in the trial.The statement said this served only to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and bring it into disrepute.The lawyer told the three appeal court judges that the PPS would not be making any submissions to uphold the conviction and invited them to exercise their discretion to quash it. The judges will sit next week to decide whether to do so.If McCauley turns up in Belfast for the hearing, he could technically be arrested and face extradition to Colombia. The 52-year-old, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was arrested along with Sinn Féin members Niall Connolly and James Monaghan in Colombia in 2001 and accused of IRA training of rebel Farc guerrilla forces, particularly in bomb and mortar bombmaking.The three men were initially cleared of the charge, only to be convicted on appeal and sentenced to 17 years in jail. But they avoided imprisonment by fleeing Colombia via Venezuela in 2004, eventually appearing in the Republic of Ireland a year later.The Colombian authorities claim that they were part of a deal where Farc would pay the IRA millions of dollars from the profits of cocaine production and dealing for mortar and bombmaking technology and expertise.In a separate case, some of the families of those killed in an Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) double bomb attack in the Irish Republic 40 years ago are planning to sue the British government.The relatives of the 33 people, including a pregnant woman who died in two UVF bomb blasts – the biggest death toll during any single day of the Troubles – in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974, are taking action against the British state. They allege that the British security forces colluded with the UVF in planting the bombs in the centre of the Irish capital and the County Monaghan border town during the same month as the Ulster workers' strike in Northern Ireland. The families are taking civil action in the high court in Belfast.
