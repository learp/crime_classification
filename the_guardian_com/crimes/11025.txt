The inquests into the deaths of 12 people who were shot by Derrick Bird in Cumbria last summer are due to begin.Eleven other people were injured last June when Bird went on a shooting rampage, often firing at people's faces.The jury inquests at Lillyhall, Workington, begin on Tuesday and are expected to continue for more than a month. They will examine the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Darren Rewcastle, 43; Bird's 52-year-old twin brother, David; former soldier Kenneth Fishburn, 71; Susan Hughes, 56; Bird's solicitor, Kevin Commons, 60; Jennifer Jackson, 68; her husband, James, 67; Isaac Dixon, 65; rugby player Garry Purdham, 31; Michael Pike, 64; Jane Robinson, 66, and James Clark, 23.At a pre-hearing in February, the north and west Cumbria coroner, David Roberts, ruled that he would hear Derrick Bird's inquest alongside those of the 12 people he killed. The inquests will be dealt with in the order that the victims died, with Derrick Bird's heard last."While each individual's story is their own, the evidence will show Derrick Bird is inextricably linked in a chain of events which started before the death of David Bird and continues to his own death," Roberts said. "It would be almost artificial to separate Derrick Bird from all the other people."Bird drove around Cumbria on 2 June shooting at people, before turning a gun on himself.His son Graeme and brother Brian will be among the first witnesses to give evidence at the inquest.A statement will also be read from his former partner Linda Ann Mills, who will not be called to give evidence before the jury.One issue likely to be considered is the will of Bird's father, who left Derrick and David Â£25,000 in 1998.Derrick, from Rowrah, Cumbria, apparently received nothing. He also owed a large debt to the Inland Revenue.The inquest jury will consider evidence from hundreds of people, although it will hear many statements.At the time of the killings, police said there were 30 separate crime scenes around 25 miles of the west coast of Cumbria. It was described as the most horrific and complex such incident in the UK.A key part of the police investigation was to establish whether the killings were the result of a grudge, or simply a random series of shootings.Bird had a previous conviction for theft, dating back to 1990, but had not served a prison sentence. A number of firearms seized by police were lawfully in his possession. The hearing is likely to conclude in April.
