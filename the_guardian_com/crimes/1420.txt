Police will conduct doorstep checks to ensure that defendants who have been bailed under curfew are at home, under new official guidance announced yesterday.Home Office ministers said there had been confusion in the courts over whether magistrates had the power to insist that defendants came to the door when the police called to check they were abiding by the curfew. "Courts and the public need to know that if bail is granted with a condition to be at home on curfew, that the police can check the person is at home when they are supposed to be," said Home Office minister Bob Ainsworth yesterday. The move reflects a reluctance among the courts to impose curfews as a condition of bail and fears among some police officers that doorstep visits could leave them open to legal action under the Human Rights Act for breaching the right to a family life. The new guidance to the police and the courts is couched in terms which urge them to make greater use of curfews as a condition of bail, particularly for those charged with street crime offences. It was announced as penal reform groups called on the government to postpone its plans to allow all employers access to the criminal records of job applicants. Paul Cavadino, of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, said: "There is already widespread discrimination against ex-offenders in the job market. "Surveys of adult ex-offenders on Nacro projects show that 60% have been explicitly refused jobs because of their criminal records. "In most cases the convictions had no obvious relevance to the job for which the person was applying." From August any employer will be able to demand from all job applicants a certificate from the newly established criminal records bureau showing whether they have any criminal convictions.
