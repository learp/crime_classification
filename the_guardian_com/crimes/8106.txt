The senior police officer whose brief covers prostitution and sexual exploitation has dared to think the unthinkable in policing terms on the issue. Simon Byrne, currently deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and soon to be incoming assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, believes other approaches are necessary.In his Association of Chief police officers blog Byrne says it is vital that the police understand the need for alternative approaches to dealing with prostitution and sexual exploitation, for the benefit of the women involved and the neighbourhoods which suffer. Radically he says: "There is a great amount of academic research available, much of which supports the view that an alternative approach is needed. "An example would be the decriminalisation and regulation of brothels in Australia and New Zealand, not an answer to all of the related issues but certainly a solution to some..."An approach like this would help to bridge the gap between tackling neighbourhood nuisance and the exploitation of sex workers by organised criminals and gangs."Sounds very enlightened, let's hope someone in Government takes note.
