Police launched a murder investigation yesterday after a man was beaten to death, dumped by a motorway and set alight. The burning body of the man, thought to be aged between 45 and 75, was spotted by a motorist on the M45 near Rugby, Warwickshire on Tuesday afternoon.Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee of Warwickshire police said the victim was probably dead when his body was dumped. "It is my firm belief that he died from substantial head injuries and was abandoned at this spot before being set alight," he said. "We would be very surprised if he was brought here any other way than by vehicle. A member of the public driving on the opposite carriageway noticed the fire and alerted Highways Agency staff nearby. They began putting out the fire but called out the fire service, who in turn called us when they discovered that a body was on fire."He added: "Specialist officers are continuing with a meticulous search at the scene of this incident and on a stretch of motorway either side of the scene."The M45 was closed for 24 hours between its junction with the A45 and its link to the M1. Police have been examining CCTV footage and have spoken to a number of witnesses. "Our investigation now centres on two things, to identify this man and to identify who is responsible for his murder," said McGee, who appealed for further witnesses. He added: "Someone, possibly a relative, must be missing this man, and we urge them to come forward as well."
