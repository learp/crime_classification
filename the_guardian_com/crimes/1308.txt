More than four out of 10 fines for litter, dog fouling and graffiti are not paid, despite government promises to crack down on antisocial behaviour.The new figures, from the environment department, cast doubt over plans to get tough on other offences. Last year it officially became an offence to drop chewing gum and cigarette butts; in April abandoning vehicles and leaving out rubbish on non-collection days will be added to the list, and fines will rise.Tomorrow, at a conference in Sheffield, Environment Minister Ben Bradshaw will attack local authorities for not doing more to tackle the problems - ranked third in voters' concerns behind health and crime in a MORI survey on what makes somewhere a good place to live. 'People will only take these fines seriously if local authorities take them seriously,' he said. 'In the short term, targeting resources at cleaning up might seem like the best idea, but it just isn't efficient. We need to look at changing behaviour.'The Local Government Association said many councils, particularly larger ones, had an 'excellent track record' of finding non-payers, but smaller councils needed more resources. 'The costs to councils of taking a fine-dodger to court often will exceed the cost of the original fine,' said David Sparks, chairman of the LGA's environment board.The association said councils would get tougher when fines rise in April, giving them more money to pay for the extra work.The figures from Defra cover just over 250 of the more than 350 councils with powers to issue on-the-spot fines. They show that, of nearly 20,000 such fines last year, 8,700 were not paid.
