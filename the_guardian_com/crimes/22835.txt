A Norfolk farmer accused of murdering a 16-year-old suspected burglar during a late-night incident at his isolated farm was back in custody last night after a judge revoked his bail.Tony Martin, 54, was released from Norwich prison on conditional bail two days ago by Judge David Mellor. The bachelor's lawyers mounted a successful appeal at Norwich crown court to overturn a decision by magistrates in King's Lynn after he had spent 17 days in custody. But police announced last night that, after a further hearing behind closed doors, the judge had reviewed the decision and remanded Mr Martin back into custody. Mr Martin is accused of shooting Fred Barras, a market trader from Newark, Nottinghamshire, during a suspected burglary of his farm, Bleak House, in Emneth on August 20. There had been fears for the farmer's safety after threats against him were received by police, but officers would not confirm whether he had been threatened since his release or put in danger in any way. He is understood to have spent the last 48 hours under police guard at an address outside Norfolk. The conditions of his bail said he must stay at a secret address and must not return to Norfolk for any other reason than for attending court or assisting the police. Mr Martin's barrister, John Stobart, refused to comment after the hearing. The publicity agent Max Clifford, who is representing Mr Martin, said he was trying to contact his solicitors to discover details of the developments. The news came as hundreds of mourners gathered at St Mary Magdalene church in the centre of Newark for Barris's funeral. Mr Martin is also charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent to a second man, Brendon Fearon, 29, who was treated for shotguns wounds to the legs. Fearon and another man who has not been named by police were arrested on suspicion of burglary after the incident and released without charge on police bail until later this month.
