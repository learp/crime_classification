Police and Kurdish community representatives in Manchester are to hold further talks after a largely successful bridge-building exercise at the weekend.Participants in the closed meeting, after the arrest and release of 10 Kurds in a huge anti-terrorist operation, said that progress had been made and impetus given to plans for a Kurdish community centre in Manchester.Police expressed regret for the effect of the pre-dawn raids on the wider community and agreed a joint statement praising Kurds' help with day-to-day policing and social issues. The Greater Manchester force is understood to be interested in promoting the community centre idea for a group largely made up of exiles from northern Iraq. The meeting also focused on the way reports of police finding Manchester United ticket stubs had been linked to speculation about terrorists targeting the club's Old Trafford ground. Police have denied any leaking or link to the reports but accepted that journalists had been given details about the eight men, one woman and the 16-year-old boy who were held. "We discussed the negative community implications of media coverage of the background of those detained being of Iraqi Kurdish origin, including the fact that Greater Manchester police confirmed those details," said a joint statement. "The police regret the impact this has had on the wider community. We are keen to emphasise that the Kurdish community works together with the police to tackle crime and improve community cohesion and safety." The police emphasised that anti-terrorism operations were based on intelligence about individuals and should not be seen as targeted at any community. Feelings were also soothed on Saturday by complimentary tickets to Old Trafford's Chelsea fixture given to two of the released men, Rebaz Ali and Shadman Sophi, by the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association.
