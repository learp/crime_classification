Detectives investigating the murder of a girl 27 years ago are to make a fresh appeal to the public after a DNA breakthrough in the case.Lesley Molseed, aged 11, from Rochdale, was stabbed 12 times and sexually assaulted after leaving home in October 1975 on a shopping errand. Three days later her body was discovered on moorland in Ripponden, West Yorkshire. Tonight detectives will make a fresh appeal on the BBC Crimewatch UK programme. Detective Chief Superintendent Max McLean said yesterday: "It may be that someone has harboured a suspicion for 27 years that a friend, relative or acquaintance could have killed this little girl. "We now have the ability, through the development of scientific methods, to eliminate these people once and for all." Stefan Kizsko, a tax clerk from Rochdale, was convicted of Lesley's murder but after an appeal he was released in 1992. He died shortly afterwards. In 1999 West Yorkshire police approached the forensic science service to review any material left from the original inquiry. Scientists were able to generate a DNA profile from semen found on Lesley's body. Press Association
