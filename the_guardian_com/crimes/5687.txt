One of the killers of the financier John Monckton was today cleared by an Old Bailey jury of attempting to murder his wife, Homeyra.However, Elliot White, 24, of Shepherd's Bush, west London, was found guilty of wounding Mrs Monckton with intent.The jurors reached their verdict on their fifth day of deliberations. Last week, they cleared White of murdering Mr Monckton but found him guilty of manslaughter.White pleaded guilty to robbing the family's house in Chelsea, west London, in November last year.His co-defendant, Damien Hanson, also 24, was convicted on Thursday of murdering the 49-year-old millionaire, attempting to kill Mrs Monckton, and robbery.White sat impassively in the dock and showed little reaction as today's verdicts were read out. The judge, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, said he would sentence both White and Hanson on February 3.Immediately after the hearing, a statement was released by Mrs Monckton's solicitor, Roy Campbell."Last year, Mrs Monckton, her daughters and her family lost a husband, a father, a brother and, in short, lost John Monckton, an exemplary family man who was brutally murdered in his own house a little under a month before Christmas," it said."This year, Mrs Monckton and her family had to relive their very personal tragedy through the harrowing details reported both in court and in the press."While wishing to thank all of those who have supported her and her family through this very difficult period, this is another chapter that closes on this very personal grief."Mrs Monckton now wishes to be given some peace and tranquillity to reconstruct her and her daughters' lives as best they can."The prosecution alleged White and Hanson had chosen to rob the Moncktons because they were wealthy.Richard Horwell, prosecuting, told jurors that Mr Monckton had been confronted with "every householder's nightmare" when White and Hanson forced open the front door of his house.White, in a "Postman Pat" uniform, claimed he had a package for delivery, but when Mr Monckton removed the security chain, White and Hanson burst into the home, the court was told.Mr Monckton, a senior bonds director with Legal & General, was stabbed to death. His wife suffered two stab wounds to her back and was saved by the emergency services. She now walks with a stick as a result of her injuries.Their nine-year-old daughter, Isobel, who was upstairs, witnessed part of the attack.In a statement after the conclusion of the case today, Detective Superintendent Mark Jackson - one of the officers who led the investigation - said: "John Monckton was a loving and devoted husband and father. He died trying to defend his family in their own home, where they should have been safe."Damien Hanson and Elliot White targeted the family, meticulously planning the robbery, taking John's life and inflicting life-threatening injuries on Homeyra during the attack."Both Hanson and White showed a callous disregard for the Moncktons in their grief. Their convictions today should be a strong message to others who break into people's homes and attach the occupier."Earlier today, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, announced that he had asked for an urgent investigation into the events surrounding Mr Monckton's murder.The move came after it emerged that Hanson - a career criminal who the court heard was obsessed by the rich - carried out the attack three months after being released seven years into a 12-year sentence for attempted murder.
