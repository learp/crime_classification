A 15-year-old boy has appeared in court charged with the murder of a foreign student killed in a row over conkers.Steven Grisales, 21, whose parents are understood to be Colombian, was killed after pleading with north London youths to stop throwing conkers at him as he walked to a railway station.Grisales, a scholarship student who was due to study architecture, arrived in London in July and was returning home from visiting his grandmother, who lives nearby, when he was stabbed.He was taken to the Royal London hospital where he died the next day.The teenage male charged in connection with the murder was remanded in custody after appearing at Edmonton magistrates court. He is due to appear before the Old Bailey on Thursday.Three other people have been arrested in connection with the killing, including a 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl. They have been bailed until next month.Police believe that the attack on 31 August was not gang related."Officers now believe the incident began after conkers were thrown at the victim as he made his way towards Silver Street railway station," a Scotland Yard spokesman said.Detective Inspector Richard Beadle, of Scotland Yard's murder command, called for witnesses to come forward."I desperately need those people that saw what happened to come and speak to us because Steven has lost his life totally unnecessarily.""It is really, really upsetting for everybody that something so trivial can result in a young man losing his life.
