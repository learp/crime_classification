The Macpherson report into the handling of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry made 70 recommendations as to how the legal system can shed its reputation of appearing soft on racism. But a Government minister has already warned that 'we could end up doing the wrong things for the right reasons.' So what are the chances of Lord Macpherson's recommendations being implemented?Proposal to criminalise racist remarks made in private as well as public. A Cabinet meeting on 25 February agreed that any such law would infringe civil liberties upholding the right to freedom of speech. Several newspapers described the necessary monitoring and recording of private conversations as "Orwellian" and, although it would allow the five suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder to be prosecuted, it will almost certainly be shelved.Proposal to reconsider the principle of "double jeopardy" that prevents defendants from being tried twice for the same offence.This would mean changing a basic tenet of English law, and is likely to be rejected by the Law Commission - even though it would allow fresh proceedings against the Lawrence suspects, three of whom have already been tried and acquitted.Proposal that the victim should decide whether a crime is racist.At the moment the police make this judgment. Ministers are "not too enthusiastic" about the proposed change.Proposal that the police should be subject to a Freedom of Information Act.Again, ministers may find this suggestion hard to accept. The nature of police work means that publicising their activities can be problematic.Proposed school league tables of racist incidents.Racial awareness classes (also recommended in the Macpherson Report) may be a more effective way of influencing racist attitudes in young people than "naming and shaming" particular schools.Proposal to increase HM Inspector of Constabulary's powers to inspect the police.Some ministers were surprised by this recommendation, pointing out that HMIC already has substantial powers.Proposed targets for ethnic minority representation in the police and other public services.Home Secretary Jack Straw supports this proposal, although he will have to be careful to avoid accusations of excessive "positive discrimination". He may do this by introducing targets rather than set quotas.Proposal to broaden the Race Relations Act to include the police, NHS, local government and immigration officials.This recommendation stands a good chance of success and the Commission for Racial Equality will press for its implementation.Some campaigners have proposed an annual Stephen Lawrence Day to commemorate the murdered teenager, but this was not one of the report's recommendations and looks unlikely to be formally adopted.
