The power of great classical music to move audiences has reached unexpected new levels thanks to an unusual anti-vandal scheme.Recordings of Handel, Bach and Vivaldi have driven teenage troublemakers out of the central bus station in Beverley, east Yorkshire, where youths had been daubing graffiti and intimidating evening travellers.Bought for £15 in a local charity shop, the selection of Golden Greats has been piped into the collection of shelters for the past month."It's a very simple idea but very effective," said David Boden, passenger services manager for the East Riding of Yorkshire district council. "The troublemakers can't stand the music and it just irritates them so much they end up leaving."It's cost us about £200 to get the licences to play the music as well as buying the CDs, but it's saved us thousands. When I first came up with the idea, I think people thought I was stark raving mad, but it's cleared up the problems by about 80%."We're now adding carols during the day, which they won't like but everyone else does."I think the classical music also helps calm them down, even if they don't realise it, and the carols get our passengers in a good mood."The ploy has been so effective that some of the teenagers tried to silence the speakers by cutting wires.But all their efforts failed and some have now opted for a "can't beat them so join them" approach."The music we've used has worked and I think we'll stick with the tried and tested," said Mr Boden. "But some of the kids have now asked me if they could have Britney Spears for a day if they behave. We'll have to see."
