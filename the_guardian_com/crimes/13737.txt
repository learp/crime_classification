The tabloids have got their way. Myra Hindley, the Moors murderer who wanted freedom, died yesterday still in custody 36 years after her conviction. Ian Brady, her murderous partner, who wants to die, is forced to live on. Prison policy would have allowed him to starve himself to death, but the maximum security hospital to which he was transferred over 20 years ago, does not follow the same rules. Hindley should have been given her freedom; Brady his right to die. Instead, both child killers became victims of a tabloid-inspired revenge justice by a succession of home secretaries. The lord chief justice, at the time of her trial, recommended 25 years. But for the last 10 years she has remained imprisoned on the say so of four successive home secretaries too scared to order her release. The parole board signalled its readiness to allow release, by recommending a transfer to an open prison, a pre-step to release, but the final decision still rested with the home secretaries.Ironically, it is not a power they will keep for much longer. A case brought before the law lords last month, should finally remove their sentencing powers. Not before time. Sentencing is a judicial process, not a political exercise. It should be set openly, publicly and fairly, not secretly by politicians, permanently under pressure from public opinion. No one can ignore the gravity of Hindley's crimes, but locking her away did not shut her away. Her release should have been left to the parole board. It had rightly ruled there was no risk of her repeating her offence. It had observed how a tongue-tied school-leaver of 44 years ago had become an Open university graduate in humanities and an articulate advocate of her own cause. They had the independence to ignore the label tied round her neck by the tabloids - the most evil woman in Britain. Crime has enough difficult causes already without adding the supernatural. Her overlong imprisonment demeaned our society.
