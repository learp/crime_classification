The home secretary, Charles Clarke, today promised police he would cut red tape, but warned them they must face up to public concern over their occasionally "awful" services.Addressing the Police Federation annual conference for the first time, Mr Clarke promised a much more consensual approach to police reform than his predecessor David Blunkett.Speaking in Blackpool, Mr Clarke conceded to his audience of rank of file police officers that a lot of bureaucracy came from the Home Office and pledged to ease the burden.He said: "I accept the arguments of those who say there is too much bureaucracy in the police service."It exists for a variety of reasons, very little of it coming from the police officers in the Police Federation, a lot of it coming from the Home Office and management in different ways."Mr Clarke said he saw police constables as being "at the heart of the police family" alongside community support officers, special and community wardens, but also paid tribute to the part played in crime prevention by neighbourhood watch schemes and faith groups.But he told officers that the public expects a certain amount of response from the police service, and that "when it's good, it's great, but when it's bad, it can be awful".Mr Clarke said the "central challenge" of this parliament was to address neighbourhood policing and crack down on the antisocial behaviour which blighted many communities.He added: "That is a massive challenge [...] because we cannot go into another general election campaign in three, four, five years time from now with people feeling as they are - uncertain, unsafe in certain respects, worried about antisocial behaviour. We have to solve this problem."Before Mr Clarke's speech, the Police Federation chairwoman Jan Berry challenged the government to clarify when officers are allowed to use handcuffs during arrests, to prevent a repeat of the murder of Detective Constable Stephen Oake.DC Oake was stabbed to death by terror suspect Kamel Bourgass during a raid on a flat in Manchester in January 2003.Three terrorist suspects, including Bourgass, were allowed to remain without handcuffs for an hour and a half after police entered the flat.Current laws do not allow officers to handcuff suspects without justifiable cause - for example if they are violent, attempting to escape detention, or if there is any intelligence to suggest they will resist arrest.Ms Berry urged the Home Secretary to clarify the law. She said: "In January 2003 one of our own, Stephen Oake, a Special Branch Officer, was brutally murdered following a counter-terrorist operation in Manchester."No one but Kamel Bourgass is to blame for Stephen's death. But had the officers involved felt the law allowed them to handcuff him - with or without a risk assessment - Stephen might be alive today."Home secretary, please make the law explicit - your violent crime bill presents the perfect opportunity to do so."The chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, Michael Todd, supported Ms Berry's stance.Mr Clarke replied he wasn't "complacent" about the issue, but said "I also talk to police officers from forces up and down the country who don't feel that there is an inhibition on the use of handcuffs in the way that people did feel in Greater Manchester."I am a sceptic in the view ... that changing the law is what solves all these matters. I do think we need to get to an agreed position very quickly."After his speech Mr Clarke answered questions from the audience of officers, in an atmosphere one aide described as "chilly".The conference is also holding a debate on officer safety, which is likely to focus on whether frontline police should carry Taser stun guns. A poll last week found 80% of officers would be in favour.The Association of Chief Police Officers is also holding its annual conference today, in Birmingham, and will be addressed by the community safety and security minister, Hazel Blears. Mr Clarke will speak to the conference tomorrow. They are due to discuss the establishment of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca). Dubbed the "British FBI", the organisation is expected to take over investigations into top-level crime from next April.The Liberal Democrats today criticised the government for a "missed opportunity" in yesterday's Queen's speech to give the police better technology.The party's home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: "The government has missed an opportunity in the Queen's speech to scrap targets and form-filling for the police, and to introduce a technological revolution so the police have 21st century equipment for a 21st century job."
