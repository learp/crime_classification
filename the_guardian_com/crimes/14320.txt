The government yesterday renewed its determination to crack down on anti-social behaviour by unveiling 40 "Respect" zones where councils will be given extra help to deal with families and individuals who make life miserable for others.The zones, ranging from Exeter to Newcastle upon Tyne, were selected using indices such as deprivation, high levels of anti-social behaviour, truancy and school exclusion levels. All of the areas, according to ministers, have a strong track record of achievement in tackling anti-social behaviour and its causes.Announcing the initiative, Tony Blair said several factors led to anti-social behaviour. "I think it's to do with drugs and the drugs culture and, it's a difficult thing to say, but there are a small number of very dysfunctional families where the kids are not being properly brought up."Speaking in Brighton, one of the new zones, he added: "What happens outside someone's front door ... where it is intimidating, threatening and unpleasant and where the quality of life has diminished - that's why this is vitally important."Councillors and officials in Bolton, Greater Manchester, welcomed the town's new status as a Respect zone and at least Â£105,000 in funding to help problem families get their lives in order. The council launched a family intervention project, run by the charity NCH, in 2003 and has so far worked with 73 families and 142 children, with promising results."The Respect agenda is not just about tackling unacceptable or anti-social behaviour but is about taking this further and reaching more people and communities," said Cliff Morris, Labour leader of Bolton council. "It aims to create a modern culture of respect by working on the underlying causes of bad behaviour, whether in the school, community or elsewhere."Bolton and other councils will be expected to use a range of measures including family intervention projects, parenting classes, Asbos and "face the people" sessions in which police, councilors and others are held to account by the public.The home secretary, John Reid, said ministers wanted to support good work already being done. "However much we can talk about the great issues of the world, people open the door in the morning and walk into what is their world, which can be disrupted by anti-social neighbours, by drug dealers or by young offenders. Their life becomes a misery."The extra funding would strengthen the contract between local authorities, police and the local communities, he said.In Bolton, the council uses Asbos - 83 are in force - but also has a policy to tackle the root causes of anti-social behaviour. It has so far drawn up 447 voluntary acceptable behaviour contracts and claims a 72% success rate. Up to 16 hours a week intensive support is given to families at risk of losing their homes because of anti-social behaviour. The council insists they are not offering "tea and sympathy" but challenges parents to put their lives in order, making sure children go to school and that the family's finances, shopping and meals are under control.At Withins school, a comprehensive in one of Bolton's areas of highest deprivation, headteacher Phillip Mather said: "Most parents are keen to work with us. If they find it hard to get their children to toe the line at home, we may have more success by working together. We try to tell our students that living on a council estate does not mean you have had a lobotomy, that you have a chance to succeed."A local chip shop owner, Paddy Williams, was not convinced. "Only a minority of kids cause trouble," he said. "They get to about 20 and calm down - and then the next generation starts."The 40 Respect areas are:  Birmingham city council Blackburn with Darwen borough council Blackpool council Bolton metropolitan borough council Bournemouth borough council Brighton and Hove city council Bristol city council Burnley borough council Bradford metropolitan district council Coventry city council Derby city council Doncaster metropolitan borough council Exeter city council Gloucester city council Harlow district council Hastings borough council Ipswich borough council Kingston upon Hull city council Kirklees metropolitan council Knowsley metropolitan borough council Leeds city council Leicester city council Liverpool city council Manchester city council Middlesbrough council Newcastle city council Norwich city council Nottingham city council Oldham metropolitan borough council Plymouth city council Portsmouth city council Salford city council Sandwell metropolitan borough council Sheffield city council South Tyneside council Southampton city council Southend-on-Sea borough council Sunderland city council Wirral metropolitan borough council
