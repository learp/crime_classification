Eleven days ago, when George Entwistle was explicitly confronted over an apparent error in an account given by Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, about what was contained in the axed film about Jimmy Savile, the director general had a simple answer. Wait patiently. The inquiry he had just announced would explain all.Except it turned out that Entwistle himself could no longer wait. If the BBC felt it could brush off questions from the print media, it could not ignore its current affairs programme Panorama, which was about to detail exactly what happened to the Savile investigation so suddenly aborted in December last year.The director general and colleagues had initially been very reluctant to blame Rippon for his decision to axe the film, however bad the editorial judgment looked in retrospect. Entwistle had told BBC Radio 4's Today early in October that he would not criticise the man who was his successor but one at the helm of Newsnight. It was a view repeated at BBC News as recently as last week: that whatever misjudgment Rippon made it was not "a hanging offence".Yet by Friday, it was clear that defence of the beleaguered Newsnight editor was failing. When taking their position, BBC bosses had not banked on the actions of producer Meirion Jones and journalist Liz MacKean, who both decided to co-operate with Panorama's investigation.By the end of last week the BBC was buzzing with the gossip that they had shared a cache of Newsnight emails with their rival programme.It need not have played out like this. Jones and MacKean had emailed Entwistle directly two weeks earlier to voice their concerns about Rippon's account of events, but the director general, who was once their colleague on the programme, felt he could not meet them – not least because, those close to the BBC chief said, they wanted to have an "off the record" conversation with him, a risky situation for a leader who needs to have all his sensitive dealings minuted to avoid any appearance of secrecy.Journalists inquiring had, again and again, been told that Newsnight journalists were of the view that Rippon's blogpost of 3 October was not completely accurate. Nevertheless, it had been published on trust by the corporation, which believes that programme editors do not need their accounts to be checked with colleagues.Rippon's assertion that all the information in Newsnight's possession was known to the police was disputed by those who knew the contents of the aborted investigation. It was that question that was put to Entwistle by the Guardian at his press conference on 12 October, and one he chose to brush off – urging people to wait for the pending inquiry to appoint a leader and start its work.Instead, the task of speaking to the disaffected Newsnight journalists, by now concerned at how the Savile story was developing, was handed to Peter Horrocks, the head of the BBC World Service, last week. But it was not enough to stymie the flow of reports in a range of newspaper articles, or to stop Panorama taking an interest: the goal of that programme's reporters was to establish if the story that had been emerging for the past month was correct.By this time, Entwistle and other senior BBC bosses had received a long list of questions from Panorama, giving a flavour of the direction the programme was heading in. Neither the director general or his senior colleagues felt it was appropriate to be interviewed, but it was clear that Newsnight was the main focus of the show, and therefore the decisions taken and statements made by Rippon, its editor.At the same time, BBC sources say that Rippon himself became less sure about what he had written. By Sunday, it became clear to both Entwistle and, when he was informed, Lord Patten – chairman of the BBC Trust – that Rippon's account was not accurate.Then a delicate negotiation began with the Newsnight editor and his lawyers at David Price over how to proceed. The plan was to make some sort of correction – although it was not immediately agreed by whom – and to somehow sideline Rippon.However, deadline after deadline was missed to make an announcement on Sunday because no deal had been done. Meanwhile, at 6.30pm a press release further detailing Panorama's account of what happened at Newsnight was circulating and the corporate team at the BBC felt it was impossible to proceed until the next day. Panorama, too, had concluded that Rippon was not correct to say that Newsnight had only collected evidence that was known to the police.On Sunday evening, speculation swirled that Rippon had been suspended, and the Daily Mail wrote that Rippon had "quit his role" – a remark interpreted as meaning he had resigned. Rippon, who has always maintained that he axed the Newsnight film for "editorial reasons", issued a denial through the BBC that he had chosen to quit. The BBC was not able to brief what was about to happen to him because no agreement with Rippon had been reached.With the dispute at Newsnight all over the front pages, it was becoming necessary to act quickly on Monday. The BBC had thought that Entwistle might be able to go to Tuesday's meeting of the culture, media and sport select committee before detailing the corrections needed to Rippon's blog – but the director general realised he would have to make an announcement on Monday morning, once someone at the BBC had spoken to Rippon directly.Entwistle had concluded that the corrections required, and the turmoil at Newsnight was such, that Rippon had no choice but to "step aside" – although he remains on full pay and is to help the forthcoming inquiry into the Newsnight affair led by Nick Pollard, the former head of Sky News,.The original thinking, that the BBC could wait until Pollard could finish his work, had not banked on two angry Newsnight journalists determined to demonstrate that their editor had made major mistakes in halting work on their investigation into sexual abuse by Savile – and how he chose to defend his own actions earlier this month.Questions for the BBC director generalQuestions that George Entwistle must answer when he appears before MPs on the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday:1 What happened between 25 November and 30 November last year to change Newsnight editor Peter Rippon's mind about the programme's planned Jimmy Savile story, which was subsequently dropped?2 How much did Entwistle know of the content of Newsnight's Savile report?3 When Entwistle found out that Newsnight was investigating Savile at the same time as he was planning a Christmas tribute programme to the late television and radio presenter, why did his conversation with the BBC director of news, Helen Boaden, not last more than 10 seconds?4 If he had still been editor of Newsnight, would Entwistle have run the Savile report?5 How did Peter Rippon's original 2 October explanation as to why he killed off the Newsnight report into the Savile allegations, which formed the basis of the BBC's response to the scandal, come to be inaccurate and incomplete?6 Why did Entwistle initially rule out an internal inquiry into the Savile affair?7 The BBC has said there were no complaints at the time about Savile's behaviour at the BBC and no evidence to suggest that any wrongdoing was ignored by management at the corporation. How can it be so sure?8 What sort of signal does the Savile affair send to future whistleblowers wanting to approach the BBC?9 What is the BBC doing about allegations that have been made by other radio and TV presenters that they were sexually assaulted on corporation premises?10 The job description for the new director general role said the BBC DG must be able to "admit quickly when in the wrong … but stand up to huge pressure without bending when s/he believes that it is right to do so". How does Entwistle think he has fulfilled that brief?
