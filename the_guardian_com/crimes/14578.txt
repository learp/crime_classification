New on-the-spot fines for careless driving will be misused by police officers entrusted with applying them, magistrates have warned.The Magistrates' Association spoke out in response to a Department of Transport consultation on proposed road safety measures, including powers to impose Â£60 fixed penalties and three points on the licences of motorists who admit careless driving."Regrettably, recent experience with out-of-court disposals shows that the police cannot be relied on to use them appropriately or as intended," said Chris Hunt Cooke, chairman of the association's road traffic committee."Once they have been given these powers, the police will misuse them, that is a certainty, and careless driving will be generally treated as a minor offence, unless serious injury is involved. This is a proposal that places the convenience of the police above what is right in principle, may coerce innocent drivers into accepting a fixed penalty, and is certain generally to downgrade careless driving in terms of offence seriousness."Hunt Cooke said officers would inevitably opt for the "simplicity" of issuing a fixed penalty over the "heavy burden" of taking the matter to court, whatever the degree of careless driving involved.Alun Michael, a Labour member of the Commons justice committee and a former policing minister, accused the Magistrates' Association of "grandstanding" over the issue."It is an issue but it is not a cataclysmic case for a major division between the magistrates and the police," he told the Daily Telegraph.A Department for Transport spokesman said: "Making careless driving a fixed penalty offence would help the police to enforce against bad drivers who admit fault with a minimum of bureaucracy, freeing up police resources. But all drivers would always have the option to contest their case in court and we would work with the police and the courts to develop guidance to ensure that cases are handled correctly."Police chiefs claim on-the-spot punishments free up officers to tackle more serious offences by reducing paperwork and time spent in court.In 2004, powers to issue fixed penalties were introduced for low-level offences, including being drunk and disorderly and shoplifting. The British Retail Consortium has said on-the-spot fines encourage persistent shoplifters who know they will face "no serious sanction" if caught.
