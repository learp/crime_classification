The terrible death of Trevor Morse was much the worst incident in the truculent standoff that has existed between hunt supporters and opponents since the chasing of foxes for sport was supposedly outlawed in 2004.Sliced through the head by a rotor blade whirling at 200mph, the self-employed gardener was a victim of claims and counter-claims which have surrounded the sport and the continuing meets held by dozens of hunts.Bryan Griffiths and his gyrocopter were used regularly by anti-hunting monitors to follow packs of hounds in the Midlands, and had been watching the Warwickshire hunt's last outing of the season when the incident happened in early March last year.The light aircraft's constant presence had grown to irk the hunt members, and the trial at Birmingham crown court, where Griffiths was today cleared of manslaughter, heard that the Warwickshire's organisers had agreed a plan to confront its pilot and the anti-hunt campaigners who took turns to fly as passengers, filming loopholes and possible breaches in the law.This swung into action when 55-year-old Griffiths, who lives on the hunt's territory at Bedworth, was seen altering course for Long Marston airfield near Stratford-upon-Avon. As arranged, Morse and Julie Sargeant, a fellow hunt supporter, headed off at speed in their Land Rover, to box in the gyrocopter as it refuelled and find out who was behind the flights.Longstanding and often bitter differences between the two sides underlay the confrontation, but hunt master Anthony Spencer told the jury that "buzzing" by the aircraft had frightened the hounds and was a safety hazard. The hunt's complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority on these grounds had prompted an investigation, which began the day before 48-year-old Morse was killed.Witness accounts of the death suggested intransigence on both sides, with Morse standing obdurately in front of the moving gyrocopter after his colleague had taken refuge in the Land Rover. Video and detailed descriptions left the jury to decide whether Griffiths was aiming carefully for a gap to avoid danger, as he told police, or whether mutual anger saw things spiral out of control.The case was downgraded some months before the three-week trial, when the original charge of murder was withdrawn. But prosecutor Gareth Evans QC still accused Griffiths of deliberately driving the gyrocopter at Morse, justifying a verdict of manslaughter by gross negligence.He told the jury: "Griffiths's actions were reckless in the extreme because the manoeuvre carried with it a very, very real risk that Mr Morse would come into contact with the revolving, unguarded rear propeller blades of the gyrocopter."In a graphic video taken by a fuel handler at the airfield, a voice is heard shouting to Morse: "You are obstructing him taking off, you have no right to do that, you have no right to do that."After a pause – the footage was cut before the instantaneous death of Morse – the jury then saw a clip of his body lying on the ground, as a voice said: "Oh dear, the twat didn't stand clear of it."Sargeant broke down in tears as she told the jury: "He just stood there. He just stood there." She described Morse as "Mr Nice Guy" but confirmed that he had acted uncompromisingly, driving the Land Rover right up to the nose of the gyrocopter.The court heard that Griffiths, an anti-hunting sympathiser, had been scared of violence from hunt supporters. Chatting just before the incident with a plane spotter at Long Marston, he said that he had been shot at three times from the ground while following hunts.The neutral evidence from Michael Tipping, an aircraft enthusiast without strong views on hunting, also underlined the tensions before the incident. He told the jury that Morse's "intrusive and aggressive" attitude when he tore up in the Land Rover had convinced him that the whole affair involved a drugs gang and possible revenge for a deal that had gone wrong.Since the tragedy Morse, who was a lifelong follower of the Warwickshire and helped to look after birds of prey which allowed it to use a loophole in the Hunting Act, has become something of a martyr on hunting websites. Opponents of the sport have been confirmed in their view that hunts are determined to continue to find any way to stay in action.
