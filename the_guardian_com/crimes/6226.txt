An 11-year-old boy has been banned from a branch of Toys R Us for five years after he caused chaos while riding his scooter up and down the shop's aisles.Darren Parkinson, who is just 4ft tall, also used racist language. He has been banned from parts of Manchester for bad behaviour and is now the subject of a five-year anti-social behaviour order. Manchester magistrates were told he had ridden up and down the aisles of Toys R Us on his scooter with staff and security guards in pursuit. He had also caused trouble in the neighbouring Argos store, where staff had already banned him. His family have been moved from the Cardroom estate in the Ancoats area of the city to a rented house in Moston. The court was told he had threatened a neighbourhood warden with a bottle, broken into a car, and thrown stones at police. The order bans Darren from most of Miles Platting unless he is with his parents.
