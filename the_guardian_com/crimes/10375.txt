Public and press demands over the supervision of criminals cannot be met because the probation service is facing a tightening "squeeze", a government inspector warned today.Andrew Bridges, the chief inspector of probation, said in his annual report there was a danger that offenders would no longer be properly managed because of a series of added demands on probation officers.Problems cited in his annual report included rising case loads per officer, constant organisational change, less money, and delays in the introduction of a vital new computer system.At the same time, Mr Bridges suggested that the public and the media were expecting the impossible from the probation service."Our overall point here is not a proposal to pour extra resources unthinkingly into the problem but to highlight the contrast ... between rising expectations and a squeezed capacity to meet them."The report comes at a time of growing concern over dangerous convicted criminals who reoffend after being released.Mr Bridges said: "There appears to be a growing assumption that an offender committing a further offence always constitutes a public service failure."Yet ... supervision in the community is not prison in the community, and so an offender who is not locked up does have the opportunity to commit a further offence."The report, however, does accept the failures made in the management of Frank Park, a child killer released after 38 years in prison without a proper assessment of his risk to the public.Mr Bridges said the problems facing the probation service were partly the result of spiralling prison numbers."The idea was that the use of prison sentences was to achieve an overall levelling off, and potentially a decline and this would enable money to be spent on making management of offenders in the community both more widespread and more effective."But this honourable intention has not been achieved in practice: the prison population has continued to increase (even though the overall level of crime is decreasing and NOMS [National Offender Management System] is having to accommodate this increased 'demand' from finite resources."The report accepts that probation budgets have increased above inflation, but says: "It is clear to us that when the costs of new work, new requirements and new infrastructure have been taken into account, resources have in practice still not kept pace with the increasing demands."It says this makes "offender management" potentially "undeliverable".A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said the department would take Mr Bridges' observations "seriously" and that a review of the system was under way.
