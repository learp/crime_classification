New video footage of the tube trains ripped apart in the 7/7 bombings is likely to be released at the inquests for those killed, a hearing was told today.But the Metropolitan police raised concerns that the previously unseen footage could be used by jihadists in terrorist propaganda.The material is intended to be shown next week at the start of the inquests into the deaths of the 52 victims of the 7 July 2005 attacks on London. It includes CCTV of the four suicide bombers travelling to the capital, photographs and video of the wrecked tube carriages and number 30 bus after the devices were detonated, and extracts from calls to London Underground's control centre.Counsel to the inquests, Hugo Keith QC, told the pre-inquest hearing that the material had been carefully edited so as not to show the victims or any particularly distressing scenes. But Max Hill QC, representing the Metropolitan police, voiced fears that the footage could be used on extremist websites for "cynical purposes".He said: "There is a sad but true fact of life which is that material, often distressing, showing the moments of immediate impact of events such as those of July 7 is abused by others entirely beyond these proceedings for – for want of a better phrase – propaganda for their own purposes."The coroner, Lady Justice Hallett, provisionally ruled that the footage would be published on the website of the 7/7 inquests and made available to the media. But she agreed to consider any further police objectionsonce it has seen all the material.The inquests at the royal courts of justice in London will begin next Monday with a two-day opening statement from Keith. Hallett, who is sitting without a jury, will then hear details of the bombers' journey to London. After this, evidence will be called relating to the scenes of the four attacks, first Aldgate, followed by Edgware Road, King's Cross and Tavistock Square.The inquests, which are expected to last up to five months, will then cover the backgrounds of the bombers and issues such as forensics and the command of the emergency services. They will finish by looking at the question of whether security agencies could have been prevented the attacks.
