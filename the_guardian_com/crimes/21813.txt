A 35-year-old woman has been arrested by police investigating a dissident republican bomb attack on a prison officer in Belfast.The suspect was detained in the city on Thursday and is being held at Musgrave serious crime suite, according to a Police Service of Northern Ireland spokesman.Officers have also been granted an extra 24 hours to continue to question three men aged 34, 39 and 45 who were arrested on Sunday evening.The prison officer, a 52-year-old married father of three, required surgery after an explosive device detonated under the van he was driving on 4 March. It is understood he is now out of hospital.A group calling itself the New IRA claimed to have carried out the attack. In a statement to the BBC, the terror group said the officer had been targeted because he was involved in training other guards at Maghaberry high security prison, near Lisburn in County Antrim.The New IRA said he was one of a number on a list of potential targets and the attack arose from a dispute over the treatment of dissident republican prisoners.They also claimed to have used the plastic explosive semtex and a commercial detonator.After the blast, police commanders expressed fears that dissidents planned to step up the number of attacks to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising.
