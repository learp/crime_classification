An 18-month-old child who was taken from a police station by a woman claiming to be friend of the toddler's mother has been found safe and well in north London.Police arrested a woman aged in her 30s who was with the girl, Audrey Nyanor, when she was found today in Harlesden.Audrey's mother, Cynthia Boakye, 36, had been arrested on Thursday in Southwark, south London, over alleged immigration offences and had been taken to Walworth police station along with her daughter.A woman claiming to be a friend later turned up at the station and took the toddler, who is of Ghanaian heritage.The Metropolitan police said yesterday that it had voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.A police spokesman said that the woman who came to the police station gave details that corresponded with the name of a woman Audrey's mother had told police would pick up her daughter."Subsequently it became apparent that the woman was not the same person who had been organised to pick up the child. As a result a police investigation began to find Audrey, and to identify and trace the woman who took her," the spokesman added.Audrey's mother was later released on bail. Five other people who had been arrested in connection with the investigation have also been bailed.Audrey's grandmother Agatha Owsuah, 54, of Peckham, south-east London, said that the police had made a "great mistake".She said Audrey's mother should have been asked to confirm the woman's identity before the toddler was handed over."They should have asked for ID before handing over a human being to someone," she said."All the time in this country they check your identity. They ask for my ID when I take money from the bank, they ask for ID before you can get a job."
