If fraud is usually an inside job, most of it is perpetrated by the bosses of companies involved, according to research by accountants KPMG.Fraud committed from within organisations by management or employees made up 61% of the value of all cases in the accountancy firm's latest fraud barometer, covering the first six months of 2012.Finance directors, chief executives and other senior managers were responsible for 55%, by value, of all the cases KPMG analysed. The level of fraud by management has remained stubbornly stable, at £206m.According to the report, losses from UK fraud dropped sharply to £374m between January and June, from £1.1bn in the same period last year as fewer "super fraud" cases, including large VAT carousel frauds, were finalised.The number of cases being prosecuted rose to 136 from 131 in 2011.Hitesh Patel, UK forensic partner at KPMG, said: "The extent and impact of fraud perpetrated from within businesses has historically been masked by a handful of exceptionally large cases coming to court, but the fall in such 'super' cases now shines a spotlight on the chronic and pernicious threat to businesses in these austere times."One case involved a former head of counter-fraud operations at a bank, who committed procurement fraud worth £2.4m for personal benefit. The tough economic climate drives some fraud – cost-cutting offers opportunities to commit fraud if oversight and controls are reduced – but recent cases have also been driven by a desire to maintain and even extend lavish lifestyles.Hitesh added: "The value lost through management fraud shows graphically that businesses need to ensure controls are more than simply trust where senior members of staff are concerned; an effective anti-fraud regime applies to all, not just to more junior staff."The value of fraud perpetrated by staff is also on the rise, up 10% from last year to £21m, covering 31 cases.Cyberspace offers new opportunities for fraudsters. While people have had good IT security practice drummed into them over the last few years in relation to PC usage, there is less awareness of the potential dangers posed by mobile phone apps. This has led to a huge increase in the amount of personal data posted by users. A recent case involved the use of a mobile phone payments app to skim credit cards of unsuspecting customers and defraud them of more than £1m. Small businesses had used the app, which appeared to be perfectly legitimate, to accept payments from their customers. The fraud was only detected after customers started to notice unauthorised payments on their cards.
