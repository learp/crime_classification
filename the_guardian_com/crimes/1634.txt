Fresh scientific evidence about the blood spots found on Sion Jenkins' clothing was crucial to securing his freedom.The 158 spots of Billie-Jo's blood, which had sprayed in a fine mist not visible to the naked eye, on to his shoes, trousers and jacket, were the only forensic evidence linking him to the murder scene. The window of opportunity in which Mr Jenkins could have killed the girl was small, a matter of minutes; the rest of the evidence against him was circumstantial.Mr Jenkins maintained that he had returned from a trip to a DIY store with his two oldest daughters to find Billie-Jo lying on the patio. He had knelt to tend to her and said he had seen a bubble of blood in her nostril and heard a "squelching sound". His legal team have always maintained the spots of blood, which also contained specks of skin, were sprayed on him when Billie-Jo exhaled blood through her nose. But until 2004 and his second court of appeal hearing, they were not able to present conclusive evidence to support the theory.For the past nine years, the prosecution has maintained that the blood splattered over Mr Jenkins as he smashed the teenager's skull with the metal tent peg. By the second appeal court hearing, however, the defence presented fresh expert evidence not available at the time of the trial or the first appeal in 1999. Professor Robert Schroter, a bioengineer, and other experts were able to show Billie-Jo had had a blockage in her airway, known as pulmonary interstitial emphysema, after air was forced under pressure into the membranes separating the lobes of the lungs.They said blockage could have been caused by a spasm of the larynx when a trickle of blood went down the dying girl's throat as she fought for breath in the initial stages of the attack.Billie-Jo survived for several minutes after the attack and experts suggested that the high pressure in the girl's lungs meant that any movement of her body could have released the blockage, sending a spray of blood over whoever was near her and explaining the fine mist found on Mr Jenkins' clothes.The appeal court found that the source of the spatter of Billie-Jo's blood on Mr Jenkins' clothing was crucial to the case but no jury had been allowed to hear the new evidence. As a result they quashed the conviction and ordered the retrial.Experts said last night, however, that it was unlikely the case would lead to a rush of appeals from other people convicted of murder or serious assault on blood splatter evidence."This was a very, very specific case of a fine mist of blood and I really don't believe it will have an impact on other appeals," a legal source said. "In other cases the blood splatter is larger spots of blood, and very different to this specific situation where you have a blockage in the lungs, high pressure and the sudden release of that blockage."
