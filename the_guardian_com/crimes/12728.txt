The parents of missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann are on their way to Rome to meet the Pope and pray for the safe return of their daughter.Gerry and Kate McCann will have a private meeting with Benedict XVI after attending a general audience in St Peter's Square, during which the pontiff is expect to refer "prominently" to Madeleine during prayers.The trip to the Vatican will be the McCanns' second pilgrimage since they visited the Catholic shrine of Fatima in Portugal.It will also be the first time Mr and Mrs McCann have left Portugal together since their eldest daughter disappeared from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz. They left their two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie in the care of relatives for their 24-hour trip.The couple are making the two-and-a-half hour flight to Italy on a 12-seater Gulfstream private jet owned by the businessman Sir Philip Green, who has pledged to do all he can in the search for Madeleine, who disappeared on May 3.The visit to the Vatican, where they will be met by the British ambassador to the Holy See, Francis Campbell, is particularly significant for the couple because they have drawn strength from their faith during the ordeal and attended church regularly.Tomorrow morning they will attend a general audience in St Peter's Square and will be introduced to the Pope afterwards.Mrs McCann will give the Pope a photograph of her daughter and, after the meeting, they will hold a news conference for the international media before returning to Portugal.The visit will be the first of a number the couple are planning to make to countries including Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Morocco to raise awareness about their daughter. So far the Find Madeleine website has received more than 135 million hits worldwide.The McCann family spokesman said: "This is essentially a spiritual visit, although it has come from the most appalling circumstances."They want the tone of the trip to be "private, serious and sombre".Their next planned visit is Madrid on Friday and contact has been made with the British embassy there.
