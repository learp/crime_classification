The remaining defendants in the Damilola Taylor murder trial, two 16-year-old brothers from Peckham, south London, were today cleared of all charges, as criticism was directed at police handling of the case.Ten-year-old Damilola was found on a stairwell in a block of flats in Blakes Road, Peckham, bleeding to death from a thigh wound caused by a broken beer bottle.The prosecution said it had been caused by deliberate stabbing during an attempted robbery by a bullying local gang.But the defence argued that there was nothing to show that Damilola had been attacked and that his injuries were probably accidental.An accident and emergency surgeon was called by the defence to demonstrate how he could have fallen on the bottle's neck.After four days of deliberations, the jury of four women and seven men returned unanimous verdicts that the brothers were not guilty of murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob.Two of the women jurors wept as the foreman gave the verdicts.The brothers were the last of the original four defendants at the Old Bailey to be acquitted of killing Damilola.A 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old male were cleared of the charges earlier in the three-month trial on the direction of the judge, Mr Justice Hooper.The evidence of a 14-year-old girl who claimed to have seen the murder was thrown out by the judge, leaving the prosecution without its star witness.The Metropolitan police was heavily criticised during the trial for its methods.Though not directly criticised by the judge, police officers were accused of offering "inducements" to the girl leading to a danger she was persuaded to tell untruths, Mr Hooper said.Sergeant Carolyn Crooks, who interviewed the girl, today said she had done her best with a difficult witness.Officers were also accused of bowing to pressure to bring charges following criticism of the way the force dealt with the Stephen Lawrence murder, for which no one has ever been convicted.Defence lawyers argued that detectives assumed Damilola had been attacked when he was found and the police pathologist, Dr Vesna Djurovic, was accused of not recognising that Damilola had been injured accidentally.An accident and emergency consultant surgeon, Alistair Wilson, was called by the defence to demonstrate how the unusual S-shaped wound could have occurred with Damilola falling on the bottle neck with a spiked shard.Mobile phone records showed calls were made from the brothers' phones in Bermondsey, more than one and a half miles away, starting at 4.47pm when a 999 call was made when Damilola was discovered.The judge ruled that - in the light of the "very limited evidence" presented by the prosecution - the youths could not have attacked Damilola if they were using the mobile phones themselves.The boys' solicitor, Christopher Hartnell, said outside court that the jury had reached "the only verdicts truth and logic would allow".Police say there are no new leads but the murder case remains open.The crown prosecution service said in a statement after the verdicts that it had carefully considered all the evidence before going ahead with the case."We realised that it would be a difficult case to prosecute because of the lack of eyewitnesses who came forward," it said."However we considered that there was enough evidence to put before the court."The brothers were supported throughout the hearing by their mother. She insisted they were not guilty.She said: "My boys are no angels but they never killed a little boy."The police investigation and trial are estimated to have cost up to Â£10m. The brothers were driven from the court in the local authority secure centre vehicles that had brought them there this morning. Their mother went with them.
