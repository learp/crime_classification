High-earning professionals aged 26-45 who own their own home are most at risk of falling victim to identity fraud, according to a survey published today. The credit information firm Experian identified company directors, well-off couples and families in their thirties and forties, and young people in rented accommodation as key groups at risk. People earning more than Â£50,000 are almost three times more likely than average to become a victim, while directors of companies employing more than 50 people are five and a half times more at risk.Those renting accommodation are also exposed because they tend to share mailboxes and move house more frequently, providing more opportunity for their credit histories to be abused.Experian, which built profiles using the experiences of 10,000 victims, said the risk of being defrauded was double the average for young professionals renting.The company said forwarding address fraud, where the criminal redirects the victim's post to a drop address that he or she then visits to collect mail, was the most common method, accounting for 36% of identity fraud.It also identified areas where it believed residents were most likely to be targeted, based on the proportion of people living there who fell into "at risk" groups.A postcode enclave centred on College Gardens in Tooting, south London, topped the list, with a risk almost five times the national average. Outside London, areas on the list included Great Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, which was fourth, and the Northampton suburb of Far Cotton, at number nine.Helen Lord, director of fraud and compliance at Experian, said: "The rate of identity fraud growth is worrying. Although some people are statistically more likely than others to become a victim, we should all be concerned. We are all potential victims."
