The home secretary, Charles Clarke, has hit back at allegations that the prime minister saw him as "too tame" on antisocial behaviour, with an interview declaring "I am not soft".At the weekend Tony Blair's biographer, Anthony Selsdon, claimed the PM believed his home secretary was too liberal, and was even planning to sack him in a pre-Christmas reshuffle.That led to a Downing Street rebuttal on Wednesday, with the prime minister's spokesman declaring he "fully supported" the home secretary.Today Mr Clarke gave an interview to the Daily Mirror emphasising his personal experience of violent crime, and declared bluntly: "I don't like liberals."He told the paper: "I am not soft. I am neither woolly or liberal or a woolly liberal."I have never been liberal in my life. I don't like liberal with a capital L or a small l."The prime minister, back from holiday this week, is today reigniting his "respect" agenda, with a speech pledging more parental classes and programmes for the those with misbehaving children.Mr Clarke told the paper a London neighbour of his had been stabbed to death a year ago, and said a confrontation with a bunch of yobs in his Norwich constituency had left him "intimidated and fearful".The home secretary was strongly supportive of the PM's line on antisocial behaviour, saying that "terrible crimes" were no more prevalent than 10 years ago, but that what had changed was "the amount of abuse and disrespect".He added: "I don't want people to be frightened in their own homes and, of course, it is the elderly who are the people most frightened to go out."I might not make a lot of noise about it but we are making steady progress in communities where local authorities are using antisocial behaviour orders and parenting orders, we are starting to turn the tide."Individuals who were terrorising estates are no longer terrorising."Although Mr Clarke's first move as home secretary, on replacing David Blunkett last December, was to impose home arrest orders on foreign terror suspects, he has been seen as less hardline than his predecessor.Mr Selsdon said in the Sunday Times he had been granted "unrivalled access" to Downing Street to compile a piece about the first 100 days of Mr Blair's third term.He claimed that Mr Blair was keen that more people responsible for antisocial behaviour be jailed, but that the home secretary was sceptical about the value of prisons.At Wednesday's lobby briefing the prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Selsdon had not been given any "special access" for his article, and added: "The prime minister believes the home secretary has one of the most difficult jobs in government."He believes it's particularly difficult at a time when you are dealing with terrorist problems as we are at the moment, and it's particularly acute when you are dealing with the problems at the time we are at the moment."Therefore the prime minister fully supports Charles Clarke."
