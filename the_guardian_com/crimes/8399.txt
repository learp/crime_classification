The government today unveiled its biggest single investment in CCTV cameras, aimed at providing hundreds of schemes to fight crime in town centres, housing estates and hospitals across the country.Bristol, Merseyside and the Derby Royal infirmary are among the areas that will benefit from the £79m plan, which will set up or expand nearly 250 CCTV schemes across England and Wales.A Home Office spokesman said today's boost would lead to thousands of cameras being installed to target residential crime hotspots and keep a watchful eye on shopping centres, public transport and car parks.The Home Office minister, John Denham, said: "CCTV has repeatedly proved its effectiveness in the fight against crime and the fear of crime."Knowing that there is an extra set of eyes watching over their communities helps to reassure people that they will be safe."It also acts as an important set of eyes for the police, providing valuable evidence where incidents occur. Today's announcement of the largest single allocation of CCTV money ever made will make a real contribution to continuing the national trend in falling crime figures."One unusual scheme will also see cameras installed at a rural beauty spot. The £975,000 project in the New Forest will bring cameras to Lymington, Totton and Ringwood town centres as well as in the car parks blighted by car crime that are used by 1m tourists a year.According to Home Office figures, areas that received cash under the first phase of the CCTV scheme have already seen crime fall and increasing numbers of arrests. At Firthmoor in Darlington, where 11 cameras were installed on a large housing estate, a reduction of 46% in reported crime was recorded while a new control room and extra cameras in Sunderland has helped lead to 225 arrests. Graeme Gerrard, the association of chief police officers spokesman on CCTV issues and assistant chief constable of Cheshire police, also welcomed the investment. "When cameras are properly targeted, they can deter offenders, reduce the level of crime and increase the feeling of safety for those using our public spaces," he said. "If crimes do occur, CCTV can often provide invaluable evidence that leads to the identification of offenders and in turn can save the police valuable time during the investigative process." Areas that will benefit from today's awards include: Bristol, one of the few major city centres largely unprotected by CCTV, gets £928,000 for 47 cameras. The city also receives £1.3m for schemes on two housing estates.Yorkshire and Humberside has been awarded £6.7m for 19 schemes, including £823,000 for 92 new cameras on Bradford housing estates, £800,000 for Doncaster Royal infirmary and £1.2m for Hull community CCTV project.Enfield in north London, receives £2.1m for a new integrated 24-hour control centre and 20 new cameras to add to its network of 184.Derby Royal infirmary benefits from £918,000 for 49 new cameras.East London's Docklands Light Railway receives £2.7m for 210 new and replacement cameras and an upgraded control room.Tyne and Wear Metro is the recipient of an initial £750,000 towards a £7.2m bid for CCTV coverage at all 58 stations on the rapid transit system.Merseyside benefits from £6.3m for 10 different schemes.Greater Manchester receives £6.2m for 18 schemes, including £687,000 for 31 extra cameras in the new east Manchester community CCTV project, the area linking Manchester city centre to the main Commonwealth Games area.
