A man has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a Hell's Angel on a motorway as he returned from a festival last year.At Birmingham crown court yesterday, Sean Creighton, a 44 year old from Coventry, admitted murdering Gerry Tobin. For legal reasons, his plea could not be reported until today.Creighton had previously denied killing the 35-year-old biker but changed his plea ahead of the trial of six other men accused of killing Tobin near junction 12 of the M40 in August last year.Tobin, who lived in Mottingham, south-east London, worked as a mechanic at a Harley Davidson garage.A post-mortem examination found he died from single gunshot wound to the back of his head on the Warwickshire stretch of the motorway, as a he returned from the Bulldog Bash bikers' festival.Creighton, who also admitted two firearms charges, was remanded in custody yesterday and will be sentenced at the end of the trial, which is expected to last for up to six weeks.A jury was sworn in today and is expected to begin hearing evidence in the case next week.Mr Justice Treacy, who lifted a restriction prohibiting the media from reporting Creighton's pleas, warned jurors not to conduct their own investigations into the killing of Tobin.Karl Garside, 45, pleaded not guilty to murder during a previous hearing in February, while Simon Turner, 41, Dane Garside, 42, Malcolm Bull, 53, Dean Taylor, 47, and 46-year-old Ian Cameron entered their not guilty pleas last December.All six men also face a charge of possessing a shotgun, while Turner and Dane Garside are further charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.
