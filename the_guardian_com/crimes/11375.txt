The government's forced marriage unit has rescued an 11-year-old British girl whose parents married her to a Bangladeshi man in Dhaka, it has emerged.The girl - who cannot be named - is the youngest helped by the unit. She was repatriated last month and is living with foster parents.The girl moved to Bangladesh at the age of six, where she cared for her two younger siblings and her disabled mother. She was rescued after her aunt, who lives in Britain, learnt that her parents had forced her to marry.A Home Office spokeswoman said: "Sadly, 30% of cases of forced marriage encountered involve children. Cases involving 11-year-olds are rare, but this isn't the first one. Cases involving 13- and 14-year-olds are regularly dealt with."The case emerged as the unit - run jointly by the Foreign and Home Offices - launched a handbook to help those forced into marriage. The guide offers advice on every step, from contacting the authorities and refusing to sponsor a spouse's visa to changing your name, finding housing and returning to education. The government has given Â£30,000 to the Karma Nirvana charity to create a support network for survivors.Baroness Scotland, the Home Office minister, said: "Forced marriage is a species of domestic violence ... it is not a respected religious or cultural tradition."Last month the government confirmed it would back new measures to protect potential victims. The Lib Dem peer Lord Lester's forced marriages (civil protection) bill would allow young people at risk to apply for court orders preventing them being forced into marriage, while those who had become victims could sue for damages.
