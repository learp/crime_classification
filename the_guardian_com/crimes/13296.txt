The government's plans for "gangster Asbos" cannot be justified in their current form, peers warned today.The House of Lords' Constitution Committee raised concerns about the proposals to impose tough restrictions on criminals suspected of involvement in organised crime, even if they have not been convicted. The home secretary, John Reid, said that up to 30 suspected serious criminals a year would be handed beefed-up Asbos known as Serious Crime Prevention Orders (SCPOs).Today's report from the Lords committee said: "A broad question for the house is whether the use of civil orders in an attempt to prevent serious criminal activity is a step too far in the development of preventative orders. "Whether or not the trend towards greater use of preventative civil orders is constitutionally legitimate (a matter on which we express doubt), we take the view that SCPOs represent an incursion into the liberty of the subject and constitute a form of punishment that cannot be justified in the absence of a criminal conviction." The serious crime bill will allow SCPOs - which are similar to control orders for terrorism suspects - to be imposed by the high court on a much lower standard of proof than is required in the criminal courts. Lord Holme of Cheltenham, the committee's chairman, said: "We have some serious concerns about the constitutional impact of the serious crime bill. "It is not our role to pass judgment on the bill itself but we have sought to bring to the attention of the house clauses in the bill which will significantly affect traditional constitutional rights and potentially have a damaging effect on an individual's legal protections." The committee, which examines the constitutional impact of all public legislation introduced in parliament, argued that the bill did not give a satisfactory definition of the types of restrictions that may be imposed on suspects. Previous civil orders such as Asbos have dealt with generally "small-scale" problems, it added.The new measures will also have a "much wider reach" than previous similar laws because they will apply to people suspected of helping someone else commit a serious offence, it went on.Although the bill sets out a number of limits on the use of SCPOs, the Lords said: "The house will wish to consider whether these limits and protections are sufficient, given the potential for SCPOs gravely to curtail personal liberty." Under the measures, people suspected of being involved in organised crime would face a wide range of restrictions on their movement, contacts and activities, and could be jailed for five years if they failed to go straight.Vernon Coaker, the Home Office minister, said that SCPOs, which will be imposed on companies as well as individuals, would be a major new tool to combat alleged criminals who currently believed they were "untouchable".
