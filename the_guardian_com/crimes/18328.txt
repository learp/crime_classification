A man of 84 who fooled the art world by selling fake antiques that his son made in his garden shed was given a two-year suspended jail term today.George Greenhalgh, nicknamed the "Artful Codger", would turn up in his wheelchair at art houses and museums claiming he found or inherited the objects.His son, Shaun, 47, "knocked up" the artworks at the family's terraced home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, using art and history books for inspiration.Judge William Morris adjourned the case at Bolton crown court this month to ask if any jails could "humanely" imprison a wheelchair-bound pensioner suffering from poor health. Today the judge told the court that the prison service could not look after Greenhalgh humanely because of his age and infirmity - otherwise he would be going to prison."You and your son and wife, over a period of 17 years, conspired together to deceive the art world and the world of antiquities, galleries, museums, auction houses, experts and collectors, both private and public," Judge Morris said."Yours was a subordinate but very important role in this conspiracy."The family made at least £850,000 through their counterfeits that hoodwinked experts for almost 18 years.The family were ordered to pay back more than £400,000 in compensation.Greenhalgh admitted conspiring to defraud art institutions and money-laundering from June 1989 to March 2007.His 83-year-old wife, Olive, was handed a suspended jail term of 12 months in November after pleading guilty to the same offences.Shaun was jailed for four years and eight months. However, his artistic talents are such that he might expect lucrative bona fide commissions when he is freed.The younger Greenhalgh forged an extraordinary range of masterpieces that his father would ferry to museums and galleries claiming to have found them in the attic or "inherited in a recent will" and asking if they were of any value.Arguably, one of the most beautiful works crafted was the Princess Amarna statuette.The family managed to convince the council-owned Bolton Museum to part with £439,767 for the 20-inch piece said to be 3,300 years old and a figurine of the daughter of Pharaoh Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti, the mother of King Tutankhamun.Greenhalgh said he bought it at a sale of the Earl of Egremont's chattels and provided paperwork to "prove" it.Both Christie's and the British Museum authenticated the piece, with the latter saying it was better than its counterpart in the Louvre. Bolton Museum thought it had got a bargain with the statuette worth closer to £1m.In fact it had taken Shaun just three weeks to make the piece in the shed, using clay and tea as a coating.Another of Shaun's forgeries was the "Gaugin" pottery faun, bought by the Chicago Institute of Art, which featured in an international touring exhibition.Visitors were told in papers accompany the exhibit to note the object's "phallic tail ... and iconography linked to Gauguin's failing relationship with his wife".But while Shaun's craftsmanship may have had the expert's fooled, failures in attention to detail prompted the family's downfall.Three Assyrian marble reliefs were valued at £250,000 but British Museum staff noticed a spelling mistake, then that the horses portrayed were wearing 20th-century harnesses and then that the stone hailed from Wiltshire.Scotland Yard experts then unearthed a trail of forgeries, dubbing the deception "The Antiques Rogue Show".
