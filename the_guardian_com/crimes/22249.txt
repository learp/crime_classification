A judge warned of the dangers of underage drinking today as he jailed two teenagers for killing a student whose head was "kicked like a football" in a "few seconds of drink-fuelled madness".Joe Dymond-Williams, 17, was floored by one punch from Jack Sanderson-Hunt as he tried to intervene in an argument on the street in Bristol.While Dymond-Williams lay motionless on the floor, Thomas Swift ran up to him and kicked him in the head as if he was taking a football penalty.Dymond-Williams, a talented student from Whitchurch, Bristol, suffered a fractured skull and massive brain damage. He fell into a coma and died on 8 July last year, two weeks after the brawl outside a bar. The teenager had just finished his first year of A-levels in psychology, business studies, sports studies and maths at St Brendan's sixth form college.The two defendants, both from Bristol and aged 17 at the time of the incident but now 18, had never met the victim before the night of the attack, and had been drinking heavily before the fight.Swift admitted manslaughter but was found guilty of murder by a jury. Sanderson-Hunt pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Sanderson-Hunt was sentenced to three and a half years in a young offenders' institute at Bristol crown court today. Swift was given a life sentence and ordered to serve a minimum of nine years.Mr Justice Foskett said: "One thing is absolutely plain: no sentencing can undo the tragedy that occurred in June 2008 when one life was lost in a few seconds of drink-fuelled madness."The judge said the tragedy showed that bar owners and workers needed to take "particular care" in discerning the legal age of customers."If ever there was a case where the dangers of underage drinking are demonstrated, this must seriously be it," he said."They were all out that night intent on having a good time. I have no doubt that their inability to cope with the large quantities of alcohol they consumed played a significant part in what took place."The judge said alcohol and violence were a "fact of contemporary life".He added: "Every one of us will read in the newspapers on a daily basis someone dying or being seriously injured in an incident like this. It is easy to move on to the next page and say 'How sad' and easily forget the consequences."
