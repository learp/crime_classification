Stand-up comic Lee Hurst yesterday denied smashing an audience member's mobile phone. The performer is alleged to have grabbed the device during a performance at the Stoke pub in Guildford, Surrey, and thrown it to the floor.Prosecutor Liz Highams said Hurst believed the owner of the £80 phone, Gareth Hughes, had been filming him. The comedian, who starred on TV's They Think It's All Over, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage at Guildford magistrates court, telling the bench: "I wasn't there."He is accused of destroying the Motorola K1 handset either intentionally or recklessly on 4 September last year, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of three months in prison and/or a fine. Edwina Dunne, chair of the bench, granted the 46-year-old comic, of Limehouse, London, unconditional bail until his trial at the same court on 16 February. Hurst, who wore jeans and a grey top for the brief hearing, indicated he would be representing himself.Asked outside the court what he thought of the charge, he said: "I think it is all a bit comical."Hurst did not consider comedy as a career until he was 27, but quickly established a reputation on the London circuit. He wrote for radio programmes including Weekending and Loose Ends and was in demand as a warm-up man for TV shows such as Have I Got News For You. He was asked to take part in the pilots for They Think It's All Over, becoming a household name as a regular panellist and going on to front ITV's prime-time weekend show Saturday Live in 1996.In 1998 he opened his Backyard Comedy Club in Bethnal Green, east London. It is now called The FymFygBar.com, with Hurst the compère on Saturday evenings.
