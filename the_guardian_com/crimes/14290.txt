According to today's Sun, the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, could one day be released from Broadmoor and sent to a medium security facility.The paper says doctors at Broadmoor have apparently decided he is no longer a danger to others – provided he keeps taking his medication.Sutcliffe, now 62, was jailed in 1981 for the murder of 13 women and the attempted murder of seven others in the 1970s and 80s. He was given 20 life sentences and told he would serve a minimum of 30 years.Last year, his lawyer, Saimo Chahal, claimed the Home Office had disregarded his human rights because it had failed to formally fix a tariff for his sentence.Chahal, who specialises in civil liberties and social welfare as a partner at the London-based Bindmans & Partners, also aimed to get Sutcliffe back into the prison system and has requested a reassessment of his psychiatric condition.However, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, has already said she could not see under what circumstances Sutcliffe could be freed.Although he was allowed out four years ago to visit the place where his father's ashes were scattered, any attempts to have him released – or even moved to a less secure prison – will prove hugely controversial.As well as the public outcry that such a move would provoke, the home secretary would have to weigh up how safe Sutcliffe would be from other prisoners, who have attacked him several times.The Sun's report coincides with the news that the Great Train robber Ronnie Biggs is likely to be released this summer, in time for his 80th birthday.Biggs, who is said to be very frail and unable to speak properly or walk after a series of strokes, was jailed for 30 years in 1964 for his part in the £2.5m robbery.His friends and family argue that he has long since paid for his crime and say a 79-year-old man can hardly be considered a menace to society.If Biggs has finally been judged to have atoned for his crimes, can an argument be made for Sutcliffe's rehabilitation? Or does the enormity of his crimes make that impossible?
