The British police helmet, considered one of the most desirable trophies for student digs, is set to be redesigned and replaced after senior officers decided that it was "too wobbly and prone to fall off" during the everyday hustle and bustle of police work.The assistant chief constable of Dyfed Powys police, Barry Taylor, head of the police's national uniform and equipment group, said the traditional helmet was outdated for modern police work. The standard 12in version will be reduced to add 6in to 8in to the height of police officers. The woman officer's bowler hat and the reinforced baseball cap, worn by specialist police units such as dog handlers, will also be remodelled and these should all undergo tests this summer. Mr Taylor said: "The traditional helmet falls off, gets in the way, and is a damn nuisance. It wobbles unless you keep your head still. The new helmet will have a lower centre of gravity. It is basically the same shape but will be shorter by 2in or 3in and provide more protection for officers." The traditional helmet will be retained for ceremonial occasions and for the officers outside No 10 Downing Street. The national police scientific and development branch put out a tender to design schools last year and received 12 designs. Three have been selected and developed into prototypes. If the pilots for the three styles are successful they should be rolled out in the spring.
