A nationwide manhunt is continuing for two men after a gunman helped a prisoner to escape by threatening two guards accompanying the inmate to hospital.Police believe Andrew Farndon, serving an indeterminate sentence for a hammer attack, injured himself in order to create an opportunity to flee.The 26-year-old was handcuffed to a female officer who removed the restraint at gunpoint at West Suffolk hospital in Bury St Edmunds on Wednesday. Members of the public are being warned not to approach the two men, who are believed to have left the county."Along with other forces, we are pursuing various lines of inquiry, including contacting his friends and associates in the West Midlands," said Detective Chief Inspector Nick Bennett from Suffolk police."We are also studying CCTV and number-plate recognition records to try to identify the car which was used in the escape."The prison officers are still shaken and it was obviously a terrifying ordeal."No one was hurt in the incident. Police said they received a number of calls overnight from people with potentially useful information but continue to appeal for sightings.Farndon is the second prisoner to abscond in less than a week, after John Anslow, the first category A prisoner to escape in more than 17 years, was sprung from a van after it left Hewell prison in Worcestershire on Monday.The justice minister, Crispin Blunt, said there was no suggestion of any link between the two incidents.Farndon was a category C prisoner, meaning he was considered a low risk and unlikely to escape, despite previous form. In 2007, he leapt from the dock at Coventry crown court.In his absence, before later being found and jailed, he was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection of at least two years before being considered for parole for the attack, which left his victim with a fractured skull.Bennett said: "He [Farndon] was convicted of GBH, which, barring murder, makes him as dangerous as you can get."He said it was "highly likely" that the injury, described as being so deep the muscle tissue on his back was visible, was self-inflicted, although he later raised another possibility, that it was the work of an associate within the prison.Farndon had been taken to hospital in a saloon from a local taxi firm, said Bennett. He said he understood it was standard practice to transport prisoners to hospital by taxi unless there is a "specific risk".Farndon is described as white with a shaved head and was wearing a dark blue baseball cap and light coloured jumper that was padded on the right side because of the injury to his shoulder.The man with the gun is described as white, in his mid 40s, around 5ft 8in tall, of stocky build, possibly with a Scottish accent and was wearing a white top and blue jeans. It is thought they may have escaped in a dark coloured car.An international manhunt has been launched for Anslow with police liaising with other UK forces, the UK Border Agency and foreign authorities. The search extends to all airports and railway stations.The justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, has ordered an inquiry into how he escaped. Three masked men ambushed the van taking him from the prison near Redditch to Stafford crown court, smashing its windows with sledgehammers and punching the driver.As a category A prisoner, Anslow was classified as a security risk. But instead of being transferred in a high-security prison service van with a police escort, he was with other inmates in a van run by a private contractor.A 44-year-old Tipton man arrested on Monday night on suspicion of helping Anslow to escape was released on bail pending further inquiries on Wednesday, police said.
