The number of violent and sexual offenders under monitoring in England and Wales has risen by almost 13% to just over 14,300 in the past year, Home Office statistics revealed today.The annual report on multi-agency public protection arrangements (Mappa), showed that the number of registered sex offenders had increased by more than 3% to just under 30,000. Mappa involves staff from the police, probation and prison services, plus other government agencies, monitoring offenders when they are released from prison.While the total number of offenders under Mappa rose by 7% to just under 48,000 over the past year, the Home Office said the majority of those offenders did "not pose a significant risk of serious harm to the public".Of the 48,000, 12,505 were classified as posing a high or very high risk, an increase of almost 11%.There was a 30% rise in the number of people charged or cautioned for committing new crimes - up to nearly 1,300 from 990 last year - but the Home Office said the jump was related to a crackdown on register requirements.The Home Office minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, said crimes committed by offenders covered by Mappa created "intense suffering for victims and great concern for us all"."Whilst we can never eliminate risk entirely, we are all entitled to expect that everything that can be done is being done to prevent these offenders from reoffending," he said.In the past, Mappa has faced criticism for failing to effectively monitor violent offenders, some of whom ended up committing crimes including murder.Last April, Naomi Bryant was strangled and stabbed at her home in Winchester by 48-year-old Anthony Rice, who had been released from prison despite a history of attacking women.In May this year, Andrew Bridges, the chief inspector of probation, found that "substantial mistakes and misjudgements" had been made by the probation, parole and prison services in Rice's supervision after his release, and said he should never have been released in the first place.In February, Mr Bridges also said there had been a "collective failure" in the handling of the cases of Damien Hanson and Elliott White, who were convicted of the murder of John Monckton and the attempted murder of his wife, Homeyra, during an attempted robbery at their Chelsea home in 2004.He found that Hanson - who was assessed as being a high risk of serious harm - should have been referred to Mappa.The annual report included a breakdown of 42 areas responsible for Mappa in England and Wales. The different areas have provided numerous case studies of successful liaison between government departments in managing some dangerous offenders.The London area - in which the borough of Lambeth has the highest number of registered sex offenders, 184 - cited the example of Tom, a convicted paedophile who was released from jail with a number of prevention orders, including not being allowed to talk to children.He was assessed as being at "very high" risk of re-offending, and Mappa agencies undertook the decision to place him under surveillance. Over a four-day period, he did not commit any offences but broke a prevention order and was sent back to prison.
