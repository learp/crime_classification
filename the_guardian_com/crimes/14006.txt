Police investigating the death of a baby girl found entombed in a block of concrete say they are close to solving the mystery of her identity, after releasing a couple who were arrested in connection with the killing.The baby, given the name Lara by detectives, was discovered 18 months ago in a block of concrete in a derelict lock-up garage near Workington in Cumbria. Philip Chadwick, 42, and his wife Anne, 41, were arrested in connection with the murder in January. But yesterday they were released without charge, and they have now been eliminated from police inquiries. Cumbria police say they are close to identifying the baby, and are focusing investigations on her relatives. The force has conducted a major investigation to try to discover the infant's identity, involving nearly 4,000 baby girls born in west Cumbria between March 1989 and January 1993. They have eliminated all but five of these, and believe they are close to identifying her. Police have also traced more than 1,400 former residents of Barepot, the tiny village where Lara's remains were found. DNA samples have been taken from around 300 residents in an effort to find her relatives. Lara was discovered by a workman. Forensic experts say the girl, aged between four and six months, had been neglected before her death and would have been suffering extreme pain from a gum abscess. Mr and Mrs Chadwick lived in Barepot for seven years until moving to the Midlands about five years ago. They have categorically denied any involvement in the murder.
