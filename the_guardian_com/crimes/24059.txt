Police and coastguards today feared a repeat of the chaotic scenes of scavenging when the container ship Napoli ran aground in 2007, after "a massive amount of timber" lost from a Russian ship started to wash up on the Kent coast.The ship, the Sinegorsk, issued an alert in rough seas on Monday after it lost up to 1,500 tonnes of its sawn timber load, around 14 miles off the coast of New­haven, East Sussex.A spokesman for the maritime and coastguard agency said 6ft-long (1.8m) planks of untreated pine were piling up in various places along the Kent coast, including Broadstairs, Margate, and Rams­gate."It's like badly stacked B&Q shelving washed up on the beach," he said.The majority of the wood is still strewn in a seven-mile timber slick in the Channel. Some may eventually be washed up as far north as the Essex coast, the agency said.Earlier, Dover coastguard said it had been alerted about timber coming ashore on the Kent coast by alarmed fishermen."We have just received a report from a fisherman a mile east of Broadstairs to say there's a massive amount [of wood] there. He said he'd never seen so much wood in his life," a spokesman said.Insurers for the ship have appointed contractors to recover the wood. They are working alongside teams from Thanet council to remove the washed-up wood. It has been gathered into piles and is guarded by police.The coastguard spokesman said: "Our concern is that people may try to take the wood. If they wade in to recover it they are putting themselves in real danger as the sea is so rough.""They must realise it is someone else's property."The Dover coastguard watch manager, Gordon Wise, urged beachcombers to stay away."It's been immersed in salt water for three days and it's untreated timber. It's not going to be good for anything, other than burning," he told Kent Online.Kent police also warned people against trying to take the wood. Chief superintendent John Molloy said: "This cargo remains the property of the original owner and to steal it is not only foolhardy, but also a criminal offence."While I appreciate that this sight is not commonplace and people may wish to take a look, we ask that they do this from a safe distance and leave the timber alone. The shoreline can be a dangerous place, particularly with the current poor weather, and people could be putting themselves at unnecessary risk by venturing into the sea to salvage the timber."Where appropriate, we will also take action against those who create a nuisance, park dangerously or trespass."Anyone who does venture to the shore to look should park their car considerately so that emergency vehicles are able to gain access to the area if necessary."We are not trying to ruin people's fun but the winter coastline is not a place to take risks."On Tuesday, an inquiry into the grounding of Napoli blamed lack of leadership for the chaotic scavenging on Branscombe beach, Dorset, in January 2007.The inquiry chairman, Ian Mercer, warned similar scenes could happen again.Kent county council has set up a timber reporting hotline: 08458 247247.
