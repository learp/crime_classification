A cabinet row over fears that Tony Blair's final criminal justice bill will fuel a further 3,000-strong surge in the already record prison population is jeopardising its launch.Both Mr Blair and the departing home secretary, John Reid, are keen to publish the criminal justice bill - the 54th law and order measure since Labour came to power in 1997 - before they leave office at the end of June.But as prison numbers reached an all-time high in England and Wales yesterday some ministers were questioning whether the timing was appropriate for another "get tough" law and order bill that would only encourage the incarceration instincts of the courts. "The question is whether this is the right time to introduce a criminal justice bill that would signal a 3,000 rise in the prison population," said a Whitehall source.The dispute is the first indication of tension between the slimmed down hardline Home Office and the newly formed Ministry of Justice, struggling to keep the lid on the prison crisis. The promised legislation was showcased in the Queen's speech in November but has yet to make an appearance.Prison numbers in England and Wales yesterday hit 80,812, including 362 in emergency police cells, and governors fear that with fewer than 300 spare places the crunch could come as early as Monday when the "full up" signs will have to be posted. Justice ministers are believed to be debating whether to launch an immediate emergency package of measures to relieve overcrowding pressures and risk repeating the exercise in six months.Although the justice secretary, Lord Falconer, announced two measures to relieve the pressure on prisons - capping the extra time served by recalled prisoners to 28 days and restricting suspended sentences to more serious offenders - their impact will not be felt until later in the year.These measures will also be far outweighed by the impact of announcing more law and order legislation and the practical effect of its main measures.Mr Reid has made clear he wants to see the introduction of both violent and prolific offender orders - similar to sex offender orders - which will mean their supervision will continue for years after leaving jail with the threat of being sent back if they fail to comply with its terms.On top of this the outgoing home secretary intends to end the automatic one-third discounts on sentences given for guilty pleas in the wake of the case of paedophile Craig Sweeney - whose sentencing mistakenly left the impression he could be released after only five years despite being given a life sentence - and allow parole panels to release prisoners only by a unanimous, rather than majority, verdict. These measures will drive up the prison population further.The official analysis of the prison figures, rising by 150 a week, is that the courts have started sending fewer people to prison for shorter fixed sentences in recent months. But the rate at which they are being released is falling because of an explosion in the number of indeterminate public protection sentences - which have no fixed release dates - and a sharp rise in the numbers being sent back for breaching the terms of their release licences.In the short term ministers are keen to reintroduce "trebling" - three men in a cell built for one - which was abolished nearly a decade ago.The Conservatives raised the government's failure to publish the criminal justice bill on Thursday, asking if it had been dropped by the prime minister in waiting, Gordon Brown. All the leader of the Commons, Jack Straw, could say to them was that the matter was "in hand".
