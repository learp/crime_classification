An 11-year-old refugee collapsed and died yesterday after a breaktime scuffle in a Glasgow school dining hall.The Somali boy was involved in what is thought to have been a relatively minor clash with a fellow pupil, who is also believed to be from a family of refugees or asylum seekers. The boy suffered a reaction and was taken to Stobhill hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving. A postmortem was being held last night to establish cause of death. The boy arrived in the UK three and half years ago and was a pupil at All Saints secondary school. Shortly after 11am, he and another boy were in the crowded dining room of the Catholic school, where they got into a scuffle. No weapon was involved. Thomas McDonald, the headteacher, has written to parents informing them of the tragedy. Police officers spent much of yesterday speaking to the boy's schoolmates. Strathclyde police said last night they had arrested a 12-year-old boy and a report had been sent to the procurator fiscal.
