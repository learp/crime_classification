The NHS trust that manages Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital has denied reports that Metropolitan police officers visited the hospital on Monday to examine claims that Jimmy Savile raped and sexually assaulted patients while working there as a volunteer for more than four decades.The late DJ, who had living quarters at the hospital and a set of keys to the wards, has been accused of assaulting a number of former patients. According to Sky News and a number of newspapers, officers were visiting the hospital to look into the allegations.But a spokeswoman for West London Mental Health NHS Trust said the reports were untrue. "We can confirm that we are assisting the police with their enquiries." Officers from the Met are now pursuing 340 separate lines of inquiry based on evidence from 14 police forces across the UK.The Department of Health has launched an internal investigation into Savile's role at the Berkshire hospital for which it had direct managerial responsibility until 2001, when it was transferred to the control of West London Mental Health NHS Trust. It will examine why the TV presenter was appointed in 1988 to lead a taskforce overseeing the hospital after the management board was dismissed by the then health secretary, Kenneth Clarke. A spokesman for Clarke told the BBC he had no recollection of the appointment.A DoH spokesman said: "Although the framework for child protection and safeguarding for Broadmoor and other Special Hospital patients changed radically in 1999, we of course want to establish the circumstances and see if any lessons can be learned."At present we are trying to find out what happened and we will obviously need to consider all the circumstances."A lawyer acting for people who are planning to sue Stoke Mandeville hospital and the BBC over claims Savile abused them there said the government could also be sued directly given its responsibility for Broadmoor.Steven George, a former patient at the hospital who has since undergone a sex change operation, has claimed that Savile groped him while he was watching TV at Broadmoor in the early 1970s, when he was a 17-year-old girl called Alison Pink.A psychiatric nurse has also claimed that a former Broadmoor patient told her she had been repeatedly raped by Savile under the stage at the hospital in the early 1980s. The West London trust confirmed the hospital did have a stage area, although it had been renovated since that time.Savile called himself the "voluntary assistant entertainments officer" at Broadmoor, although it is understood he was never given the role formally.Scotland Yard said on Friday it was looking into 40 potential victims of Savile, and had formally recorded 12 allegations of sexual abuse, "but expect that number to grow".A 45-year-old man has made fresh allegations that Savile, whom police have described as a "predatory sex offender", abused him on the set of Jim'll Fix It when he was nine. Kevin Cook told the Sun Savile had separated him from his friends and taken him to a private dressing room, where he molested him.A spokesman for the Metropolitan police declined to comment.â€¢ This story was updated on 15 October to report the NHS trust's denial of earlier stories that Met police were visiting Broadmoor hospital.
