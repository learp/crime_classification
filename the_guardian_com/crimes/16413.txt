A man arrested on suspicion of murdering a six-year-old boy more than 20 years ago has been released on bail.Rikki Neave was last seen leaving his home on the Welland estate in Peterborough to go to school on 28 November 1994. His naked body was found in nearby woodland the following day. A postmortem examination found he had been strangled.Cold case detectives arrested a suspect, who is in his 30s, on Tuesday and he has now been bailed until 15 June.Rikki’s mother Ruth Neave, now 45, was charged with murder at the time but she was found not guilty by a jury. She pleaded guilty to child neglect and cruelty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.In recent years, she has campaigned for Cambridgeshire police to reinvestigate the case, saying Rikki’s killer remains at large. She called a press conference in 2014 to urge the force to reopen their investigation.“I loved Rikki, he was a wonderful child,” she said. “For the last 20 years, I have been going through living hell from the public opinion of me caused by all the lies.“I wasn’t a perfect mother but I never hurt my children and I should never have admitted to those offences. All I want now is justice and for his killers to be caught.“I know people out there think I’m a murderer but I’m determined to prove that somebody else did this to my boy.”Anyone with information about Rikki’s death should contact police on 01480 425882, email operation.mansellcambs.pnn.police.uk or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
