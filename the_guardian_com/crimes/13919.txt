The search for the missing British toddler Madeleine McCann is coming to an end, Portuguese police said tonight.The Policia Judiciaria (PJ) said tonight that the search had not yet been called off, but admitted it was being wound down.Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa said that a 125 square mile area had been searched, with each area covered more than once by search and rescue and dog teams, and by more than one search team."The area that they covered until now, and all the places that have been checked, the results are zero," he said.He also revealed that child's clothing recovered by officers did not belong to the missing three-year-old, who went missing, believed abducted, last Thursday.Chief Inspector Sousa confirmed that his force was continuing to examine CCTV images recovered in the search for Madeleine, but he gave no information about what the images showed.He refused to comment on newspaper reports that footage from a local petrol station showed a young girl in a distressed state accompanied by two or three adults.According to the reports the two or three adults were driving a car with British number plates, whose registration has been passed to police forces across Europe.Earlier reports suggested that a woman had been seen with a young girl matching Madeleine's description.The possible sighting was the strongest lead to emerge since the child vanished. According to local newspapers, a man and woman "of British appearance" were seen on April 30, three days before Madeleine vanished, photographing children in the nearby town of Sagres.When challenged by one of the children's parents, a German expatriate, the couple fled, but the man snatched a photograph on his mobile phone.The Correio da Manha newspaper said that the man had been shown the CCTV footage and told police he had "not the smallest doubt" that the woman and one of the men were the couple he had seen.The woman is described as blonde and in her 40s, and a local shopkeeper told the 24 Horas newspaper that she had seen a woman matching that description outside Madeleine's bedroom window on the night she vanished.Earlier in the day, the child's mother, Kate McCann, attended an ecumenical communion service in the town's small chapel.She was accompanied by a female friend and clasped a pink teddy bear belonging to her daughter that she has carried since the disappearance. Saturday is Madeleine's fourth birthday.More than 150 local people, expatriates and holidaymakers crammed into the small church for a service which Anglican priest Haynes Hubbard described as having "no precedent"."We are simply going to ask God's power and protection on Madeleine and her parents and her siblings, and on everyone who has been shocked and saddened and utterly desolate at what has happened," Fr Hubbard said.As he finished his meditation, the Roman Catholic priest Padre Ze Manuel leaned to Mrs McCann and said urgently: "Courage, courage, courage."Mr and Mrs McCann are devout Catholics and have attended a number of services at the chapel since Madeleine disappeared from their apartment as they ate in a tapas restaurant 100 metres away.One expatriate woman, who gave her name only as Alison, had come with her nine-year-old daughter Ashley. "As a mum I wanted to do something," she said."I don't know how on earth we can offer any comfort, but I wanted to make sure there were as many people here as possible to show our support."Crimestoppers has set up a special number for information from holidaymakers in the Algarve. Yesterday, a spokesman said a number of calls had been passed to police, four of them containing information that was potentially "very useful".Meanwhile, a third officer from the British Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) is understood to have joined the investigation in Portugal.
