The police watchdog has said it is to investigate the use of a spit hood during the arrest of a young black man who was allegedly pinned to the ground by four police officers.British Transport police (BTP) received a complaint about the conduct of its officers after IK Aihie, 20, was detained at London Bridge station on 21 July at 11.30pm.Footage filmed by a witness shows Aihie screaming as police officers hold him on the ground and later place the so-called spit guard over his head. The hood is a full face covering used by police to prevent a suspect from spitting at arresting officers.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it is investigating Aihie’s arrest and will consider whether the use of force, the arrest and the method of restraint, including the use of a spit guard, were proportionate.Aihie said: “I hope there will now be a thorough investigation and I would ask any witnesses to my arrest to please contact the IPCC.”Aihie’s solicitor, Shamik Dutta at Bhatt Murphy, said: “It is imperative that all relevant evidence in this case is preserved without delay to ensure a robust inquiry into the officers’ conduct.”In the footage, Aihie’s girlfriend, Jessica McConkey, can be seen in distress in the clip, claiming the couple were having an argument and the police arrested him. Aihie was held in a cell overnight in Islington and released the next day without charge but he did accept a caution for an offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act.BTP said Aihie became “aggressive” after police intervened in the argument, and threatened to spit at the officers. The commissioner of the IPCC, Cindy Butts, said: “This incident has generated a great deal of concern and debate among the public following footage released on social media and therefore it is important we conduct an independent investigation to thoroughly examine what happened.“This will include considering whether this arrest and the use of this type of restraint was necessary in the circumstances. We have met with the man involved and we will be keeping him and all interested parties updated throughout the investigation.”In June, Sussex police were strongly criticised by the IPCC after an 11-year-old disabled girl was placed in a spit hood, handcuffed and detained in custody for more than 60 hours.The girl, known as Child H, suffers from a rare neurological disorder similar to autism that can cause sudden outbursts of anger. She was placed in handcuffs, leg restraints and a spit hood after being detained on four separate occasions for minor offences between February and March 2012.Eleven officers and one police staff member were found to have cases to answer for misconduct after an IPCC investigation.
