A driver who moved a speed limit sign in an attempt to escape a fine was jailed for 56 days, to be served at weekends, by a judge at Manchester crown court yesterday.John Hopwood, 42, moved a 40mph sign from a road in Manchester to a 30mph zone in Rochdale after he was caught by a speed camera twice in two days. He then photographed it. But the scam was uncovered when an expert in reconstructing faces from skulls studied the two photographs taken by Hopwood.Hopwood, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice at a hearing last month. Yesterday he was given an intermittent 56-day weekend sentence, reporting to a custody centre on Fridays and remaining there until 5pm on Sundays.Sentencing Hopwood at Manchester crown court, Judge Anthony Ensor told him: "This was a stupid act bound to fail." Louise Kitchen QC, prosecuting, said suspicion arose when other motorists began querying the sign which suddenly appeared in Rochdale.Hopwood denied the offence until the first day of his trial, when he changed his plea. Mark Smith QC, defending, said his client had lost his job after Manchester city council read about his crime in the newspapers.He told the judge that a full custodial sentence would prevent Hopwood from caring for his ill fiancee, who is pregnant with his child.
