Police began a festive crackdown last night on drunken revellers found misbehaving in 188 areas across the country.From the Isles of Scilly to Cumbria, officers were dishing out on-the-spot fines of £80 to troublemakers as part of a government-driven campaign. Forces also targeted pubs and shops caught selling alcohol to under-18s in the drive, which will continue into the new year. In a separate initiative, "field hospitals" were set up in Cardiff and Swansea to help those who are the worse for drink and victims of violence. The crackdown was greeted with scepticism by the Conservatives, who dismissed it as a worthless initiative intended to grab headlines rather than make a real difference. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, claimed a similar effort in the summer had not worked. "Tony Blair's government has promised to get tough on binge drinking but it continues to spiral out of control. And, whilst the problem gets worse, they are planning to let pubs and clubs open 24 hours a day." The initiative, billed by the Home Office as a "Christmas blitz on binge drinking", will focus on city centres and towns which see an influx of revellers at weekends and over holiday periods. The summer campaign, over a longer period, resulted in 4,000 on-the-spot fines and more than 5,000 arrests. The government says the scheme reduced alcohol-fuelled violence. Since then, the police have been given more powers, including the introduction of instant fines for buying or selling alcohol to under-18s and the penalty for being drunk and disorderly rising to £80.
