The Tories today accused the government of failing in the fight against crime after the Metropolitan Police warned that a civilian staff shortfall is forcing officers off the beat to carry out desk jobs.Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe said that Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir John Stevens's warning demonstrated that new Labour had been "tough on crime fighters".Sir John said the Met would be short of 1,000 civilians by February, with the total number of uniformed officers down by 2,500 from six years ago.Officers were being pulled off the beat to answer emergency calls and carry out administrative tasks, he said."We have had to take 200 officers off the street to do office duties and deal with things like 999 calls to ensure we provide a proper service, and that really is not on," said Sir John.Sir John also touched on the recent row over Conservative leader William Hague's comments linking low police morale with the Macpherson inquiry into the investigation of the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, and police under-resourcing with the death of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor."In any organisation that's been the first in this country to be found guilty of institutionalised racism - whatever that means in the Macpherson test - of course people are going to be bruised," Sir John told the Independent."What happens is the visible patrolling on the street declines because of the priorities and increased demands."So you talk about three officers down to two on the estate where Damilola was murdered in Peckham."Ms Widdecombe said that Sir John's comments demonstrated that Mr Hague had been right in his recent remarks."This fully vindicates William Hague's position and it's a terrible indictment of this government's handling of law and order," she said in a statement."Labour came to power promising to be tough on crime and all they have been is tough on crime fighters.Ms Widdecombe said that the home secretary could not be satisfied with the government's record."Jack Straw has no reason to be complacent this Christmas," she said.Sir John also stated that, with the big rise in street crime in the capital, combined with falling police numbers, targeting soft drug use was not a priority."If you are talking about people's personal smoking of cannabis - if we enforced that law on every single occasion, we would have a cannabis problem at the moment, and where would we go in terms of drugs that are causing turf wars between gangs, drugs that are changing people's behaviour?" he said.Related special reportsPolicing crimeTories in oppositionNew Labour in power
