The family of Stephen Lawrence, killed in a racist attack in 1993, were joined by senior politicians of all parties at a memorial service at St Martin-in-the-Fields in central London yesterday - the 15th anniversary of the 18-year-old's death.Among the 300 people in the congregation for the private service were party leaders Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, home secretary Jacqui Smith and justice secretary Jack Straw, who gave an address, as did Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Earlier Doreen Lawrence, Stephen's mother, placed flowers at the site of his murder in Eltham, south-east London. She said that although her pain remained undiminished, policing and race relations in Britain had changed for the better as a result of the tragedy. No one has been convicted of Stephen's murder. His younger brother, Stuart, told the congregation: "Stephen was good at most things. I always wanted to be like him." In his address, Straw said the murder had shamed the nation : "It should not have taken the outrageous murder of a thoroughly innocent young man, killed for the sole reason that his skin was black not white, to be the catalyst for change which should have happened years and years before that."
