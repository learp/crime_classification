Tough measures to tackle drink-related crime, antisocial behaviour and illness – including a politically controversial minimum price for alcohol – will be recommended by government advisers this week.The message to ministers from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) will reopen the debate on alcohol policy.Nice will endorse minimum pricing as the best way to cut overall consumption, deter underage drinking and limit binge drinking.Much of the medical establishment, including the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Physicians, have been urging the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol.Gordon Brown rejected the idea when Labour were in power, while the Conservatives rejected it in opposition and the drinks industry claims it will not work.However, Nice's status as Whitehall's primary adviser on which policies are most likely to address health problems means its public backing for minimum pricing this week is significant.The institute is best-known for advising the NHS on which drugs and other forms of treatment will benefit patients and are worth spending money on.A group of experts convened by the organisation – its programme development group – has spent almost two years studying how best to reduce alcohol-related disorders, which between them cost an estimated £27bn a year.That figure covers the cost of healthcare, crime, disorder and lack of productivity attributable to alcohol, including the £2.7n the NHS spends treating the chronic and acute effects of drinking.Action is needed because one in four people drink dangerously high levels of alcohol that can damage physical and mental health, Nice believes.It initially announced support for minimum pricing in October, when it published draft guidance on alcohol policy.It pointed out then that alcohol – notably beer and wine – had become 75% more affordable between 1980 and 2008 and rejected the argument that minimum pricing would unfairly penalise those on lower incomes as "unlikely", saying they spent less per week on alcohol than the better-off.Nice decided to continue supporting a minimum price strategy even though industry bodies put in highly critical submissions to the draft guidance.Its final guidance – stretching to 196 pages – was due to come out just before the general election, but publication was delayed amid fears it was too contentious.When the guidance is published on Wednesday, it will not specify a price per unit. However, Professor Mike Kelly, the director of Nice's centre for public health excellence, is thought to back 50p per unit, as some doctors and medical organisations have already done.Nice will also recommend that availability of alcohol should be restricted by limiting the number of premises intending to sell alcohol allowed to open in areas where such outlets already exist.Its experts will also suggest that action is needed to protect children from exposure to drinks advertising, saying the potential cost benefits of a complete ban on advertising should be looked at as a way of protecting children and young people.The Con-Lib coalition government has identified alcohol problems as one of its priorities.Ministers have already announced their intention to stop alcohol being sold below cost price, overhaul the 24-hour licensing regime Labour introduced, crack down on those selling to underage drinkers and make it easier for police and local councils to remove the licence of places where violence flares.While health groups will welcome Nice's views, the drinks industry is likely to reject its conclusions.The Wine and Spirit Trade Association said minimum pricing "is probably illegal, would punish millions of innocent consumers and will not address the root causes of alcohol misuse".It said "education and rigorous enforcement of laws to address misuse and related antisocial behaviour" was needed.
