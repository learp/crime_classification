The chief executives of MTV UK, Dennis Publishing, The Mean Fiddler Group and various record company bosses are being personally threatened with legal action in the latest campaign to stop flyposting in London. Westminster council is following the example set by Camden by threatening to take entertainment company chiefs to court if they fail to sign an agreement stating that they will stop using flyposters. The council has issued the ultimatum to 12 companies it says have been caught flyposting in the central London borough over the past six months. Westminster has sent "commitment to good behaviour" cards to chief executives including Alastair Ramsay at Dennis Publishing, who is responsible for magazines such as Maxim and Viz, and MTV's president and chief executive, Brent Hansen, asking them to prevent flyposting on behalf of their company. The cards say that failure to comply could result in the executives being charged with criminal damage and, if found guilty, they could be disqualified from running a company. Other firms on Westminster's hit list include Warner Music, home to artists such as Madonna, REM and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers; BMG UK & Ireland, which promotes acts such as Pink, Avril Lavigne and Dido; and the Virgin off-shoot, V2, which has Moby and the Stereophonics on its roster. The companies targeted have been named on www.streetbling.co.uk which is a dedicated website. Westminster council said it spends Â£250,000 a year on cleaning up illegal posters.
