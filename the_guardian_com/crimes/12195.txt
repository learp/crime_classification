The head of the police watchdog has criticised Scotland Yard’s commissioner for claiming that an official policy to “believe the victim” had caused confusion among his detectives when investigating prominent people for alleged sexual abuse.On Wednesday Sir Tom Winsor said he had written to admonish Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe and “corrected a misapprehension which he may have”.Winsor, the chief inspector of constabulary, said the watchdog had ordered in 2014 that victims should be automatically believed only for the purposes of recording a crime in official statistics. But the watchdog had said nothing about how the claims should be investigated and it was wrong to mix up the two.During an interview on BBC Radio London on Tuesday, Hogan-Howe said a policy of “institutionalised belief” in victims’ allegations had caused confusion for detectives, giving the appearance that investigators were believing whatever they were told and thus biased against suspects. In a Guardian article last week, Hogan-Howe said a policy that “a victim should always be believed” was advocated by the government-backed police inspectorate in 2014.Hogan-Howe and the Met have also been criticised over Operation Midland, their 15-month-long investigation into claims that establishment figures were involved in a child sex abuse ring that killed three victims. Critics say the force has treated unfairly three prominent people who were subjected to raids and questioning, including former military chief Lord Bramall, former home secretary Lord Brittan and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.Operation Midland has not found enough evidence to charge any suspects Winsor said: “I have written to the commissioner and have corrected a misapprehension which he may have.”He added: “In our 2014 report we said that the belief of the complainer should be institutionalised for the purpose of the administrative act of recording a crime.“After that the investigation should proceed objectively, professionally, with an open mind.”Winsor, who was appointed by the home secretary, continued: “So there is a material distinction between recording the crime so as to start an investigation, and that’s when we talked about institutionalising belief, and the conduct of the investigation. And our report in 2014 said nothing about the conduct of the investigation. The two should not be conflated.”Winsor also said the commissioner may increase confusion among his detectives through his public comments. Winsor’s letter to the Met commissioner was released on Thursday by HMIC.It was dated 11 February, by which time Hogan-Howe’s Guardian article had appeared and he had expanded on his concerns in a radio interview.Winsor wrote: “I regret you may have increased the risk that officers and others may not understand the position. Rather than dispel uncertainty, I fear you may have intensified it.”In the letter Winsor stresses the policy of “institutionalising belief” was strictly about the recording of an allegation. He said the aim was to stop detectives disbelieving victims of crime, thus denying them an investigation into their claims. Winsor wrote that HMIC’s reports on child protection had found “a pervasive and discreditable culture or presumption of disbelief”, and that the 2014 report found that nationally, the under recording of sexual offences ran at 26%.The letter is sent to Hogan-Howe and with the home secretary copied in.Winsor was speaking at the launch of a report by Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary (HMIC) on all 43 police forces in England and Wales, which contained further bad news for the Met. HMIC rated the Met as requiring improvement, a blow to Hogan-Howe and to the London Mayor, Boris Johnson, who is in overall charge of ensuring the Met’s performance.The three biggest forces after the Met – those in the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire – were rated as “good”. Overall a third of forces were told they must improve, 24 were rated good, and one, Durham, was outstanding.Stephen Otter, lead inspector for London, said the Met was excellent at serious investigations such as murder and terrorism but needed to improve tackling everyday crime and protecting vulnerable people.Lynne Owens, the new National Crime Agency chief, in charge of leading the fight against serious and organised crime, was deemed to have failed in this task in her last job as chief constable of Surrey. The force, which covers an area bordering London, was ranked as requiring improvement in fighting serious and organised crime.Met police chief warns scale of cuts threatens safety of public The Met said it was disappointed with the findings. Deputy assistant commissioner Mark Simmons said: “The Met has been making huge strides in reducing crime and making London safer, but we clearly need to focus more on how well we are investigating crimes, protecting the vulnerable and making sure offenders are better managed.”The inspectorate warned that neighbourhood policing was being eroded, with officers being pulled off duties vital to gain intelligence in fighting terrorism and preventing crime. The watchdog said neighbourhood officers in some cases were spending half their time on other non-crime duties.Zoe Billingham, an inspector of constabulary, said police chiefs had the money to maintain neighbourhood officers. She said one force, Bedfordshire, had pulled police officers out of Luton, potentially meaning community intelligence about Islamist extremism and terrorism had been missed. “Forces’ good performance in preventing crimes is at risk if neighbourhood policing is further eroded,” Billingham said.Jack Dromey, Labour’s shadow policing minister, said: “The police are now spread so thinly that they are struggling to act as ‘eyes and ears’ on our streets – undermining, just when national security is at risk, efforts to counter the threat we face from terrorism. It is the worst possible time to slash bobbies on the beat.”Mark Castle, chief executive of Victim Support, an independent charity, said: “While it is encouraging that police forces are working well to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour, it’s extremely concerning that in so many areas the police are failing to identify, assess or support the most vulnerable victims of crime – in particular children.”
