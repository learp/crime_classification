The government today failed to extend a four-and-a-half-year jail sentence for a dentist from east London who plotted terrorist activities overseas.Lord Phillips, the lord chief justice, rejected attempts by the attorney general to increase the sentence.Baroness Scotland had argued that the sentence imposed on Sohail Qureshi was unduly lenient.But the judge ruled that Qureshi's jail term was "lenient, but not unduly lenient".Qureshi, a 30-year-old dentist, of Palmerston Road, Forest Gate, east London, was detained as he boarded an aeroplane to Pakistan in October 2006. He admitted that he was on his way to carry out a terrorist mission and told fellow extremists that he planned to "kill many", the Old Bailey heard during his trial.Qureshi is expected to be free in about a year, after serving half his sentence during 432 days spent on remand.Pakistani-born Qureshi, said to have had contacts with al-Qaida since the mid-1990s, arrived in the UK in 2004. When he was arrested at Heathrow airport on his way to Islamabad, he was carrying nearly Â£9,000 in cash, a night sight and military manuals on computer discs.Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey that Qureshi was planning to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Waziristan, a tribal region of Pakistan. In a message on an extremist website, he wrote: "Pray that I kill many, brother. Revenge, revenge revenge."Judge Brian Barker, the common serjeant of London, said Qureshi had admitted "grave charges" but what he did was at the "lower end" of the spectrum. Andrew Hall QC, for Qureshi, told the court he was "something of a Walter Mitty character" who may have been "living in a fantasy world, exaggerating what he was doing and playing a role to impress others". Qureshi pleaded guilty to preparing for terrorism under the 2006 Terrorism Act. This was the first time anyone had been convicted of the charge.He also pleaded guilty to possessing an article for a terrorist purpose and possessing a record likely to be useful in terrorism.
