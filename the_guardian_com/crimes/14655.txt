I'm heartened that Labour's election strategy will target "middle-class mainstream mums", although I hope they extend this to all women (Report, 11 March). Fawcett polling shows that 49% of women don't think politicians are considering their view on key issues such as the economy, though they are more likely to vote for a party with a women's equality plan. But tackling women's equality is still too often seen as a fringe issue, even while the gender gap in voting intention is likely to be key to the election result. On the big issues like the economy and crime, policies can have a significantly different impact on women. If there are to be drastic cuts to the public sector, women are more likely to lose their jobs, as they make up 65% of the workforce and also make greater use of public services. This is why we've launched our What About Women? campaign, calling on politicians to explain what their policies would mean for women.Ceri Goddard Chief executive, Fawcett Society
