The press watchdog has received 83 complaints about newspaper coverage of the Woolwich murder.Distressed readers contacted the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) about the stories and pictures used by newspapers, including tabloids and broadsheet titles, following the killing of British soldier Lee Rigby last Wednesday.Each of the national titles carried dramatic front pages the following day showing one of the murder suspects with bloodied hands, prompting criticism from some readers.The PCC declined to say which titles it had received complaints about, but said it may break down the figure at a later date.The Guardian's readers' editor, Chris Elliot, reported on Sunday that his office has received about 40 emails about the newspaper's front page last Thursday, which showed a large picture of Michael Adebolajo, one of the supects, with the strapline: "You people will never be safe".Almost all the other national titles – including the Sun, the Daily Mirror, the Independent, the Times and the Daily Telegraph – used a similar picture.The image was taken from graphic footage obtained by ITV News and first broadcast on Wednesday evening. The video prompted about 800 complaints in the following 24 hours.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
