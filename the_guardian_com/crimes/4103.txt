The jewels stolen in the Graff raid have not been recovered – the bag containing the 43 pieces was handed to a motorcyclist on Stafford Street minutes after the robbery.The bike failed to start, forcing the rider to push it to the end of the street, where he finally abandoned it before disappearing on foot into Green Park.Experts believe the pieces have probably been broken up so the stones can be laundered back into the diamond market after being recut."The most obvious identification is the weight and the physical dimensions of the stones," jeweller Harry Levy, the vice-president of the London Diamond Bourse, said."All these can be altered by recutting. They may have laser inscriptions on the outside of the diamond – this, too, could be polished out."As far as most stones go, once you change the weight and change the dimensions it would be very, very difficult for them to be re-identified."Levy believes those behind the robbery would have aimed to change the stones and sell them, albeit for less than their original value."The likelihood is they would not put them out on the well-known western markets," he said. "But they could go out in China, Hong Kong, India, Russia or the Middle East, where there are strong markets and plenty of money."And the people who buy them probably won't go the length of trying to identify them. It's not in their interest."
