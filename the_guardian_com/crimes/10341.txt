A reinvestigation into the mysterious death of a British tourist found hanging from a mango tree in India has been requested by the British government following fresh claims of police corruption.The Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch-Brown has agreed to press for the inquiry into Mr Bennett's murder to be taken over by the Central Bureau of Investigation, India's equivalent of the FBI, following a meeting last week with his family.The bureau has the power to arrest police officers on corruption claims as well as order fresh DNA tests to solve suspicious cases. Mr Bennett's sister Amanda said: 'This is such a breakthrough. My brother was murdered but the police seem unable to tell us how.'The government's intervention follows fresh evidence that Indian police know more than they have admitted in relation to Mr Bennett's death. He was found dangling from the tree by a sari in jungle near the town of Roha, 75 miles south of Mumbai, in December 2006.Initially, the police claimed he had committed suicide, but a dossier of evidence collated by his family reveals the investigation relied on contradictory witness statements and timings, and unsubstantiated claims. They claim that Mr Bennett, a 40-year-old father-of-two from Cheltenham, was beaten and already dead when hung from a mango branch. Court documents confirm police knew immediately from the ligature around his neck and unexplained head injuries that he had been murdered.The intrigue over Mr Bennett's death comes amid mounting concern over the number of unsolved crimes concerning tourists in Goa. Three weeks ago, the country's Tourism Ministry sent a memo to all states asking them to accelerate the process of creating a special tourist police force.
