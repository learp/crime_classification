More than five years after it was published, and more than a decade after the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence, whose death and investigation it chronicled, the Macpherson report still has the power to cause ructions - not least among Conservative party leaders.Michael Howard, who became home secretary just a month after the black teenager's murder in April 1993, returned to the landmark report of 1999, which famously declared the police "institutionally racist". It also called for the introduction of ethnic monitoring of all police stops. It did not, contrary to some misconceptions, call for an end to stop and search.Mr Howard's pledge to scrap plans for the issuing of ethnic "receipts" to all people stopped, not just searched, by the police is a direct rebuttal of one of the key findings of the report.And it is not the first by a Conservative leader.Four-and-a-half years ago, the then Tory chief, William Hague, used a speech to the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies to attack the Macpherson report. With just under six months to go before the general election of June 2001, Mr Hague came out with all guns blazing.He appeared to blame the Macpherson report for a "collapse of police morale and recruitment" - certainly, this was the way it was sold in a leak to the Sun and reported the next day.In fact, his words were slightly more carefully chosen to apportion blame away from Lord Macpherson. Mr Hague actually said: "The way in which the Macpherson report has been used to brand every officer and every branch of the force as racist, has contributed directly to a collapse of police morale and recruitment, and has led to a crisis on our streets." However, his clarity was not helped by getting his figures wrong, as he blamed a reduction in stop and search for a rise in street crime. He told his audience that the number of arrests following stop and searches had fallen by around 7,000 when in fact the fall was just 711. Conservative Central Office later apologised for the cock-up, but it didn't help lessen the sense that he was finding his statistics to fit his argument.At the time of his controversial speech, Mr Hague's party had collapsed in the polls, their brief lead over Labour three months earlier during the fuel protests having reversed into a six-point deficit.The Tories dubbed his speech "the most important on crime in a decade", although the Guardian dismissed it in a leader article as "a breathtaking collection of dishonest facts, misrepresentations and plain lies". Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville, accused Mr Hague of "playing the race card".Today in Middlesbrough, Mr Howard renewed his predecessor's attack on Macpherson's findings, pledging to ditch his recommendation to introduce ethnic monitoring of all police stops and other "politically correct nonsense". Among such "sociological mumbo-jumbo" the Tory leader included the phrase "anti-social behaviour", the government's favourite all encompassing term for low-level crime, currently the focus of a high-profile government crackdown.But it is not only his use of such populist language that echoes Mr Hague's controversial speech, it is also the comparably poor position of the Tory party.Despite a new sense of professionalism since Mr Howard took over from the hapless Iain Duncan Smith, the party still languishes five percentage points behind Labour according to the latest ICM/Guardian poll.It has also been knocked by its inability to mount a challenge to Labour in the two recent Leicester and Birmingham byelections; overtaken by the Liberal Democrats despite coming second in both seats at the last general election.Like Mr Hague, Mr Howard finds it hard to score points off a government that is so determined to seize the traditionally rightwing ground from under it. A recent example of this was the chancellor's decision to award the Home Office an addition Â£2.2bn to fight crime in the last spending review.Tony Blair's determination to retain the initiative on law and order - which he seized as shadow home secretary when he promised to be "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime" - has meant that the controversial issue of ethnic minority policing is one of the few where the Tories can strike a noticeably different position.Will it help Mr Howard turn his party's fortune around in the polls? Well it didn't work for William Hague. We should know very shortly whether Mr Howard, who has jetted in from holiday in Tuscany to deliver this keynote speech, has more success.
