Over the past few months it has gradually dawned on the 43 chief constables of England and Wales that they will not be spared the worst of current budget shrinkages. The cutbacks – begun rather half-heartedly under the last administration – have revealed themselves to be of a whole other magnitude to those expected.Despite a few ominous warnings regarding the foolhardiness of slashing police numbers simultaneous with wholesale attacks on welfare provisions and plans to reduce the prison population, most forces are resigned to getting on with the business of deciding where to trim back the wage bill. This currently accounts for more than 80% of the national police budget, so reductions in officer numbers have a certain inevitability about them, as do pay freezes.In some ways the coalition looks like rank amateurs at the "economic shock therapy" game. Margaret Thatcher understood very well that attacks on trade unions could never be anything other than idle threats without a strong and well-paid police force to back them up. However, although cuts to frontline services are never the stuff of successful election manifestos, there has been a growing feeling in recent years the police have become monstrously inefficient and reductions in crime have been in spite of the increase in police numbers and not because of it.Complementing this argument, Tom Wood, a former deputy chief constable of Lothian and Borders police, argues that officer numbers have only a minor effect on crime rates. He is one voice in a growing consensus of those sympathetic to the coalition's slash-and-burn policies that the police could do more with less. Perhaps it is only coincidence – as with Sir Ian Blair – that they only feel confident enough to speak out about inefficiencies when they are newly retired from high office.While there is no shortage of apologists for cuts in police numbers, there is an odd paucity of ideas about how to deliver a similar service with 30% fewer officers (if estimated reductions of 40,000 officers nationwide are to be believed). Blair suggests that "civilianisation" of back-office roles is the answer, while Wood advocates "two-tier forces" and sharing control rooms with other emergency services.These aren't new ideas, and where they have been tried they have delivered marginal savings at best, with expensive recruitment and restructuring costs and no guarantee of improved services. Rather, what need to be addressed are the political processes that have brought the service to its current state of Byzantine complexity and sprawling inefficiency. In other words, how can we roll back the worst excesses of New Labour control-freakery without returning to the bad old days of Tory laissez-faire?Two flagship Labour policies that have had a disproportionate hobbling effect on the ability of the police to perform their core function have been the national crime recording standard (NCRS) and the national intelligence model (Nim). The former was introduced in a flurry of good intentions in April 2002 as a device by which levels of reported crime could be more accurately gauged.It had the net effect of removing any residual discretion open to the police to resolve matters informally and ultimately led to an increase in the needless recording and investigation of trivial matters (snowballings as common assault being one notable example). Indeed, the spike in recorded crime caused great embarrassment to the Home Office when the standard was first introduced, resulting in them having to explain themselves to an alarmed electorate.Nim was introduced to control the flow of criminal intelligence both within the service and between agencies – suffice it to say that the "data compliance" capability of police forces had to expand enormously over successive years in response to the government's obsession with harvesting personal information from anyone and everyone that a police officer came into contact with during their working day.And yet despite this steep increase in data harvesting, the model actually served to restrict the flow of criminal intelligence to frontline officers with the intention of focusing their attention on a hardcore of persistent offenders. The unintended consequence of this policy was that officers became increasingly out of touch with the communities they served. Mugshots on briefing-room walls became a thing of the past and the majority of petty criminals became anonymous almost overnight.Rolling back inefficient processes that hamper the ability of the police to patrol local communities might be a relatively inexpensive way of freeing officers and vital funds, but it should never be forgotten that they were introduced for a purpose. NCRS was, at least partly, a response to public dissatisfaction with levels of customer service – many officers, when given the discretion to do nothing, did just that. Nim was introduced partly to deliver "intelligence-led policing", but also in response to cavalier attitudes towards informants and the dissemination of intelligence generally – nowhere was the need for better co-ordination more clear than following the Soham murders.However, it is arguable that we now have the necessary "positive culture" in relation to both crime recording and intelligence that means that police discretion can be exercised in a more responsible and informed manner, and that there is no longer quite the need for the cumbersome and expensive state apparatus that supports the enforcement of these policies. The challenge for the post-crunch police service is to learn how to use its common sense again.
