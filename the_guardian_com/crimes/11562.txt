A Chinese takeaway owner was murdered by a group of teenagers who chased him and subjected him to a ferocious attack with large wooden stakes, a court heard yesterday.Mi Gao Huang Chen, 41, who was known as Michael, was chased by up to eight teenagers in April near his shop, the Superb Hut in Scholes, Wigan. He was punched, kicked and had his head stamped on with considerable force by six of the youths. He died in hospital five days later. His partner, Ming Yan Jia, known as Eileen, and their chef, Wah, were also attacked by the youths, Liverpool crown court was told.Four of Mr Chen's alleged attackers, three boys aged between 15 and 17, and a 16-year-old girl, deny murder. They cannot be named for legal reasons. Two other 15-year-olds have admitted murder. One of them was seen to kick Mr Chen as he was "defenceless on the ground".The prosecutor, David Steer, said: "He [the youth] kicked him at least twice to the upper part of the body as if he was kicking a football." The attack was captured by CCTV cameras and the footage played to the jury yesterday.The attack followed a confrontation between Mr Chen and a large group of youths. A witness overheard one of the teenagers repeating: "I'll fucking kill you," as he confronted Mr Chen and Ms Ming with a piece of wood.In the lead-up to the attack Ms Wing held a wrench or a spanner as she chased the youths from outside the Superb Hut. They later returned in a large group and one of the teenagers was seen holding a garden spade. A postmortem examination found that Mr Chen had at least seven blunt traumas to the head and neck, and his skull and jaw were fractured. He died in the neuro-intensive care unit at Hope hospital, Salford.The trial continues.
