Conditions in Britain's only prison wing with dedicated facilities for older lifers have deteriorated to such an extent that the chief inspector of prisons has said they are now "unacceptable and degrading".In a report published yesterday the chief inspector, Anne Owers, said no other type of prisoner would tolerate the conditions inside E-wing at Kingston prison, Portsmouth. The wing was converted about eight years ago to hold up to 30 prisoners aged over 55 who are all serving life sentences. Stair lifts, specially adapted baths and alarm bells in each room were installed. But the chief inspector said work to increase the number of spaces had led to a deterioration in conditions. After a visit to the prison last November inspectors reported: "Some elderly residents were held in small rooms, which were effectively cubicles divided by wooden partitions. Movement was severely restricted, there was insufficient privacy and the rooms had too little natural light, poor ventilation and in some cases no power point." Some of the prisoners described themselves as "vegetating". Ms Owers said the special function of the wing appeared not to have been thought through. "The accommodation was unacceptable and degrading. For any other prison population, this type of accommodation would be considered unfit," she said.
