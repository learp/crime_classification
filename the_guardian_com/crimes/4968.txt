A teenager has been given an antisocial behaviour order that bans him from promoting his criminal behaviour online.Police discovered the 17-year-old from Norfolk was posting comments and photographs on the Bebo social networking site glorifying his exploits.At Norwich youth court today, district judge Philip Browning banned the youth from using the internet to publish material that is "threatening or abusive" and "promotes criminal activity".Asbos are usually placed on offenders to ban them from frequenting certain places or carrying out particular activities, but this is the first case to come to light in which someone has been given an Asbo to stop them using the world wide web.The court heard that a police investigation found the boy had posted offensive comments against officers and photographs of drug-taking.PC Tim Chapman, of Norfolk police, said: "The comments on the Bebo website demonstrated his attitude towards offending, the community and the police."The boy was given the two-year Asbo after admitting a series of offences, including stealing a vehicle and possession of cannabis.
