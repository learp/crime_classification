Several national newspapers have today republished the picture of the two 10-year-old girls murdered in 2002 in Soham, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.The iconic photo of them in Manchester United football shirts appears in the Daily Mail, The Sun (on its front page), the Daily Star and the Daily Telegraph, in their reports on the trial of Mark Bridger, who is accused of murdering five-year-old April Jones.The jury were shown images said to have been taken from Bridger's computer that included the picture of Holly and Jessica.Was it really necessary for the papers to publish them, given that the families find it so upsetting? The Wells family have previously asked for the pictures to be returned to them and requested that they not be used.In July last year, Holly's mother, Nicola Wells, gave an interview to the Mail on Sunday in which she talked of her hurt at seeing the picture published in newspapers.The photograph was taken by her an hour or so before the girls were abducted and killed by school caretaker Ian Huntley. His girlfriend, Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Huntley, was convicted of perverting the course of justice.Mrs Wells told the MoS: "The police asked for an up-to-date shot and here was one that was just hours old. Then it became the symbol of the Soham murders and it still accompanies stories about Huntley in prison and Maxine Carr having a child."It is our last picture of our daughter, yet it represents something evil â€“ that is exquisitely painful. We would love to reclaim that image for ourselves. Being unable to do so is, I think, the one last thing we have to deal with."Her statement led to a call by freelance journalist Rob McGibbon for papers to stop using the picture. He was supported by the editor of Press Gazette, Dominic Ponsford.McGibbon said at the time: "It struck me that, in these digital times, it is would be fairly simple for everyone to stop using that photo. It was only released in an effort to find the children."The Guardian agreed to his proposal and, according to an article about his initiative on the Society of Editors' website, other papers gave his request "their tacit approval."McGibbon argues that the use of the picture amounts to a breach of copyright but is more concerned about the wishes of the families being flouted.I can understand the justification the four offending newspapers would advance for publication because it formed part of the evidence in a trial.But most of the press covered the story without feeling the need to reproduce a picture that, in the words of Holly's mother, "represents something evil". I would hope that they take her heartbreak into account in future.
