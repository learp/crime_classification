Friends and family of Simon Hall, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of an elderly woman, gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice today to call on the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to reopen an investigation into what they claim is his wrongful conviction.On 25 July 2002 Hall, now 31, was arrested on suspicion of the murder of Joan Albert. The 79-year-old was stabbed to death in her home in Capel St Mary, Suffolk, in the early hours of 16 December 2001.In 2003 he was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in prison. His case is currently being reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).This morning, to mark his seventh year behind bars, Stephanie Hall, who married Simon at Kingston prison in Portsmouth last year, joined friends in handing out flyers to passersby protesting her husband's innocence."Simon's case has been with the CCRC for nearly four years now," Stephanie said. "We're calling on Jack Straw to put pressure on the commission. Why haven't they done anything for four years?"In a phone call from prison, Hall told the Guardian: "Hopefully [the demonstration] will raise awareness of what's going on. Maybe someone might come forward with information. It's worth a try. I'll always be hopeful."Craig Kebby, a friend of the Justice 4 Simon campaign, said: "It's a big day for her [Stephanie], and him."The CCRC has confirmed that it received an application regarding Hall's case in May 2005, and allocated a case manager to it in December 2006. A spokesperson said: "We are reviewing the case."
