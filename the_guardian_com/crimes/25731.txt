The Old Bailey jury trying a teenager accused of murdering the promising young footballer Kiyan Prince was discharged after an "incident" away from the court today.The jury had been considering its verdict for two days when a juror reported an incident to court officials.Defence lawyers made an application for the defendant to be retried, which Judge Peter Beaumont, the Recorder of London, granted."The jury was discharged as a result of an incident having taken place away from court and during an adjournment during the course of the jury's deliberations," he said. The incident "plainly was not the fault of the defendant", he added. A new trial - the third over the killing of 15-year-old Kiyan - will take place at a date to be fixed later. A first jury had been unable to reach agreement on a verdict when the 16-year-old defendant appeared in court charged with murder earlier this year, and a retrial was arranged.The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has admitted stabbing Kiyan on May 18 this year, but denies it was murder. Nicholas Hilliard, prosecuting told the latest trial that a playfight outside the gates of his school in Edgware, north London, had ended in his death. The teenager, who was in the Queens Park Rangers youth team, was stabbed in the heart after intervening in a fracas. A teacher at the London Academy school described him as a "gorgeous boy, very popular and well liked by all who knew him".
