Harold Shipman's family are locked in a legal battle with Greater Manchester police to stop the serial killer's belongings being destroyed. Sarah Shipman, the former GP's daughter, is demanding that his typewriter, which he used to produce a crude forgery of one of his victims' wills, and two medical bags in which he carried the morphine with which he killed his patients, are returned to her.Police want to destroy the items to stop them becoming "ghoulish trophies". They refused to record Ms Shipman's complaint, prompting the Independent Police Complaints Commission to investigate.
