Scotland Yard's commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, today risked the wrath of his own black officers by declaring for the first time that his force was no longer institutionally racist.At a conference to mark the 10th anniversary of the Macpherson report into the failed police investigation into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, Stephenson said his force had made so much progress the label was no longer useful.Stephenson's audience in central London included Stephen's mother, Doreen Lawrence.She watched as the head of the force found a decade ago to be institutionally racist said the Metropolitan police had been transformed.Stephenson said: "I have to say that, in all honesty, I no longer believe that label to be either appropriate or useful."I have set out the evidence that demonstrates we have moved from collective failure to a collective determination to ensure that our service does not discriminate and that we truly reflect the diversity of London in our ranks."I do not want the Met to be distracted by the debate about institutional racism. That label no longer drives or motivates change as it once so clearly and dramatically did."What matters to the people of London is that we continue to change. It is actions, not definitions, that solve problems."Within minutes, Stephenson was challenged from the audience by a leader of the Met's black officers' group.Alfred John, chairman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said: "Saying there are pockets of institutional racism is like saying there are pockets of cancer. The results are still the same."John said he had recently been at a recruitment fair for the Met that saw only five ethnic minority people turn up out of 2,000 who attended.John added: "As a black or minority officer or member of staff, we are more likely to be disciplined or asked to resign."Stephenson rejected the claim that the Met had failed to make progress over the past decade.He said: "I just fundamentally think that's wrong. But I immediately add there is much more left to be done."Stephenson announced that this year 25% of the Met's new recruits would be from the ethnic minorities, the same proportion as made up London's population.But the Met has missed a target set a decade ago for 25% of its total force to be from ethnic minorities. Nine per cent of its officers are Asian or black.Promotion for ethnic minority officers is still plagued by accusations of discrimination. Last year, the Met was hit by a race row after its then most senior ethnic minority officer, assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, sued, alleging racism.In her speech, Doreen Lawrence warned that the police's own actions were damaging the confidence ethnic minority people had in them.She cited as evidence of the Met's continued failure the fact that black people are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than whites, an increase on a decade ago.Lawrence said: "This can only lead to a further decrease in trust and confidence in the police service."She also warned against the dangers of government and top officers believing racism in Britain had been tackled. "We are in danger of becoming complacent by lingering over the successes and forgetting the obstacles that we still must overcome," she said.Stephen Lawrence was a promising student who was stabbed to death by a white racist gang at a south-east London bus stop in April 1993.Despite a welter of evidence, police bungled the inquiry into his murder. The Lawrence family battled the police and their denials anything had gone wrong for years, before forcing a public inquiry, chaired by Lord Macpherson.A decade ago today, his findings that incompetence and police prejudice helped the killers escape justice sent shockwaves through British society, triggering reform pledges from the police and government.The killers still walk free.Lawrence told the conference: "It has been 15 years, 10 months and two days since the devastating murder of my son, Stephen Lawrence."The sheer brutality of Stephen's wounds should have shocked the police into action to take down his killers. But he was black, and in their eyes his death did not warrant the same urgency as that of a white person."In the years that followed, our family had to fight all of the levels of the justice system, which has repeatedly denied us justice for his death."She added: "Would frontline officers react any differently today if faced with the same situation of that night, 22 April 1993?"Would Stephen be dealt with in a way that any injured man would be? Would they automatically see a guilty black man or would they see a black person bleeding on London's streets?"She told the conference that still today black families whose loved one had been murdered were "made to feel like the perpetrators and not the victims".
