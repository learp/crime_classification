A solicitor and a bank worker have been jailed for taking £1.5m from a City banker's account. Graham Leather, 59, and cashier Zhiwei Fan, 27, who were jailed for four and a half and five and a half years respectively, changed Mark Couling's contact details while a third suspect impersonated him to transfer a large sum into another account for a supposed property deal. After a failed request to then withdraw £230,000, a similar attempt was made for £12,000. Two bankers' drafts were also obtained, one for £198,000 and one for £32,000 to buy a car. The men were tried at Southwark crown court.
