It is still unclear whether the English language teacher had been sexually assaulted.Police launched a manhunt as soon as the body was found, but so far they been unable to track down their prime suspect.Mr Ichihashi first approached Ms Hawker about possible English lessons on March 21.Japanese police said she had allowed Mr Ichihashi into her flat after he followed her home from a railway station.She later agreed to give him an English lesson at his home. She was reported missing seven days ago by her employer, the Nova language school.In a statement read out yesterday by Graham Fry, the British ambassador, Ms Hawker's father, Bill, said his daughter's murder had "brought shame" on Japan.Mr Hawker said: "My daughter loved this country. She loved meeting Japanese people and thought of Japan as an honourable society."My daughter's killer has now brought shame on your country. He must be caught. He cannot be allowed to hide away."The Japanese police are making every possible effort to catch him. I still respect this country and its people."I know you place great importance on family and community links, so as a father I appeal to you: if anyone can help the police to find my daughter's killer, I beg you to come forward."Mr Fry added: "Lindsay's tragic death has saddened and shocked us all. We are grateful that the Japanese authorities are doing all they can, but they will need the help of the Japanese public to catch the criminal."So I echo the appeal of Lindsay's father: anyone who can help, please, please come forward."
