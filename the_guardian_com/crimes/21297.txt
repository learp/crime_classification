The Defence Secretary, Mr Fred Mulley, is to face a series of awkward questions about how the Great Train Robber, Mr Ronald Biggs, came to be invited for drinks on board a British naval frigate visiting Rio de Janeiro.The Navy confirmed yesterday that Mr Biggs, who successfully fought extradition from Brazil in 1974, had been drinking on board HMS Danae with a number of sailors. By the time the office of the watch had been alerted, Mr Biggs had returned to shore. The squadron is now at sea.The extraordinary incident is doubly embarrassing for the Minister of Defence and the Navy, which is making rapid and exhaustive inquiries into the circumstances.First, Mr Biggs was technically under British sovereignty for a brief spell, and felt able to come and go with impunity. Secondly, it would appear that sailors are able to invite anyone they please on board without their officers necessarily knowing.Mr Gwilym Roberts, the Labour MP, yesterday said he was tabling a Commons question seeking a statement from Mr Mulley and asking that the Ministry should send circulars instructing captains of naval vessels to scrutinise more carefully civilians invited on board in foreign ports.Mr Roberts said: "I have heard of Government hospitality, but this is ridiculous."Mr Biggs, who escaped from Wandsworth prison 10 years ago, said he had felt homesick when he saw the "old flag" of the 11-vessel British task force visiting Rio harbour, spoke to a group of sailors, and accepted their invitation aboard.After many cans of beer had been drunk one of the sailors told Mr Biggs that he was under arrest. Mr Biggs said it was not clear whether this was meant as a joke. But he said the other sailors shouted out, "Don't you touch our Biggsy," and "Over our dead bodies," and he was able to leave the frigate without hindrance.When he escaped from Wandsworth, Mr Biggs had served less than two years of a 30-year sentence for his part in the Â£2.6 million robbery of a mail train in 1963.The visit to HMS Danae was welcomed by some of the ratings for whom Mr Biggs gave a return party at the weekend in his house at Sepetiba, 25 miles south of Rio.Although under a deportation order for entering Brazil with a false passport after leaving Australia in 1969, Mr Biggs can only be deported, by court order, to a country which will not send him on to Britain, with whom Brazil has no extradition treaty.
