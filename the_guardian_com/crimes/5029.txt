4.36pm GMT16:36Afternoon summaryDavid Cameron has declared he will turn down any deal from the European Union that does not offer strong enough curbs on migration as he is in no hurry to hold the referendum.The murder of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was a “blatant and unacceptable” breach of international law, even though the probable involvement of the Putin government came as no surprise, Theresa May has said. Cameron has said that Britain does not rule out imposing further sanctions on Russia in retaliation.Nick Eardley (@nickeardleybbc)PM doesn't rule out further sanctions. Comes after inquiry report on killing of Alexander LitvinenkoJanuary 21, 2016Nick Eardley (@nickeardleybbc)David Cameron says UK's relationship with Russia will be with "clear eyes and a very cold heart"January 21, 2016Neale Coleman, a senior member of Jeremy Corbyn’s team, decided to stand down after a controversial proposal to ban some companies from paying out dividends was drawn up without his full knowledge, according to senior Labour party sources. An unnamed shadow cabinet source told the Press Association that MPs in the party were very concerned about Coleman’s departure. The source said: The feeling is total dread. It’s a cold shiver down the spine of every moderate because Neale was key in making it work, if it was ever going to. If he’s gone, and then [chief of staff Simon] Fletcher goes, the lunatics will have the keys to the asylum and I genuinely fear for our party’s future.George Osborne is using pension taxes as a “milch cow” to pay off the deficit, the head of the Institute of Fiscal Studies has said.The government has set out which public services face new thresholds on strike action, to be introduced in the trade union bill going through parliament. As Frances Perraudin reports, following a consultation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, ministers announced that strike action in the fire, health, education, transport, border security and nuclear decommissioning sectors would require the support of at least 40% of all those entitled to vote in the relevant ballot.The rules would apply to ongoing industrial disputes with junior doctors and London Underground workers, although the ballots for strike action in both cases would have easily passed the threshold.The TUC has said that unions will have to pay £11m upfront, and then £26m over the next five years, to comply with the laws in the trade union bill. The figures are set out in the bill’s impact assessment published today.The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, has dismissed Jeremy Corbyn’s proposed compromise on the Trident nuclear weapons programme in which submarines would be retained but go to sea without warheads as “pointless”, comparing it to going into a fight with an imitation gun.The investment bank JP Morgan has hinted it could quit the UK if Britain votes to leave the EU.The Ed Stone was broken up shortly after the general election, it has been revealed, putting an end to eight months of speculation about its whereabouts.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Updatedat 4.42pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.31pm GMT16:31It looks as if the Tories have finally got round to reading the John McDonnell speech (see 3.43pm) too. Greg Hands, the chief secretary to the Treasury, put out a statement about it saying: Now we know the truth: Labour is planning another debt-fuelled spending spree and a huge tax bombshell on the businesses that have helped to drive Britain’s recovery from the economic mess they left behind.Labour’s policy for at least £33.5bn of extra spending each year is also profoundly irresponsible and confirms that they are a threat to our economic security. It is clear that they have learned absolutely nothing.The Tories have got the £33.5bn figure by taking McDonnell’s statement in the speech saying Labour would “end the current programme of spending cuts” and interpreting that as a £33.5bn spending commitment.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.15pm GMT16:15And here’s Matthew Elliot, chief executive of Vote Leave, on David Cameron’s speech. The establishment is clearly lining up behind those who want to stay in the EU at all costs. Big banks and big corporates do well out of the status quo in the EU but it is the UK’s smaller businesses who get hit the hardest. 95% of UK businesses don’t even trade with the EU but all of them still have to deal with the damaging stream of rules and regulations from Brussels.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose4.04pm GMT16:04And this is from Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, on David Cameron’s speech.

The fact that the prime minister is begging for international corporations to stick their noses into our democratic process only shows how little he and the elite care for ordinary British citizens. This referendum is about our needs, not theirs.The prime minister’s only spoke of economic reasons for remaining, none of which which are dependent on our membership of the EU. His negotiation will do nothing to solve the migration crisis, the steel crisis, the flooding crisis or whatever the next inevitable EU crisis may be. Only through Britain regaining control of its laws, its borders and its taxes can we begin to avoid those EU crises and solve their problems we inherit.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.43pm GMT15:43John McDonnell's speech - SummaryJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, delivered a speech to the Co-operative conference in Manchester this morning. The full text is here. My colleague Rowena Mason wrote up the main news story in the speech - proposals to extend employee share ownership - overnight, but there was some other material in the speech worth flagging up. Here are the other key points.McDonnell said Labour was actively drawing up plans to save billions by limiting tax reliefs. This was an idea that Jeremy Corbyn floated during his leadership campaign. McDonnell said work on these plans was underway. We can’t pretend state spending is the answer to everything. There are clear limits on what can be achieved here. But we can make the system work far better, and distribute the burden more fairly. My colleague Seema Malhotra is currently looking at the current system of so-called “tax expenditures” – the different get-outs and reliefs provided by the tax system.A thicket of different schemes has grown up, costing the taxpayer £110bn a year. Some of this will be justified. But some of it will not be. We’ll look at whether we need to simplify the system so it is fairer to everyone and encourages the growth a fair and prosperous economy.McDonnell said that one of Labour’s problems at the election was that it did not talk enough about the future. The charity Nesta published a fascinating piece of research recently, showing how “future-focused” the different party manifestos were in last year’s election.The Tories talked relentlessly, overwhelmingly about the future. Labour, strikingly, did not.We cannot allow that to happen again. We cannot be small ‘c’ conservatives.McDonnell said Labour governments in the past (and not just New Labour) did not do enough to question the structure of capitalism. Capitalism, it was argued during the long boom after the Second World War, had been successfully tamed. It was no longer the brutal struggle depicted by its early critics.Government intervention and the welfare state had smoothed its rough edges. Private property in production was no longer sacrosanct and giant corporations effectively planned and managed large chunks of the economy.Government’s main task was to redistribute from a growing economy. Rising equality would follow.Deeper questions of ownership, control, and democracy were left to one side.Labour governments, Old and New, thought and worked like this.So the post-war boom saw rapid economic growth and falling inequality under Old Labour governments.New Labour, meanwhile, oversaw a decade of rapid growth, and restrained the growth of inequality.Both approaches involved a compromise with the reality of capitalism in their day.Their success, however, meant deeper questions about the economy were left unasked by the mainstream of Labour.And that, in turn, left Labour governments unprepared for system-wide crises.He said Labour should learn from the party’s tradition of localism and decentralisation. There is a long labour movement tradition of decentralisation and grass-roots organisation. But it has been somewhat hidden by the success of the alternative.This radical tradition has deep roots in our collective history. From RH Tawney, GDH Cole and the guild socialists, back to the Rochdale Pioneers, the Society of Weavers in Fenwick, Ayrshire, and even further back to the radicals of the English Civil War.With the stress on self-organisation and on-the-ground solutions to problems, this tradition stressed the need to organise not just to win the state.Even in the successes of the state, however, we can see this tradition at work. Take the NHS, the crowning achievement of Labour’s greatest government.But it was modelled on and inspired by the medical benefit fund in Tredegar – Aneurin Bevan’s home town. This was a fund set up by a local initiative to provide medical treatment to the local community. It was a hugely successful scheme.Bevan said, when asked about his plans as Health Minister, that what he was doing was “extending to the entire population of Britain the benefits we had in Tredegar for a generation or more. We are going to ‘Tredegarise’ you.”There is a thread within the labour and radical movement of self-organisation, running right back even before the Chartists to those early organisers for democracy against “Old Corruption”.He praised Labour councils for their innovative response to spending cuts.

The city deal provides a good opportunity to signal our respective governments’ support for the region.”George Osborne announced that he would be formally considering city deal investments (originally Nick Clegg’s notion to give English cities further powers, if you remember him) for Aberdeen and Inverness in his 2015 budget. But, as usual, choreography is all and with the Holyrood election campaign now underway, there’s stiff competition to be seen to be championing the beleaguered north-east.

He said that he would like to wrap up his EU renegotiation by the time of the EU summit in February, but that he would wait if he could not secure the right terms at that point. “If there isn’t [a good deal], I’m patient,” he said. I very much hope that we can, with the goodwill that is clearly there, reach an agreement at the February European Council. I would like that. I want to confront this issue, I want to deal with it, I want to put that question to the British people in a referendum and go out to keep Britain in a reformed European Union. If there’s a good deal on the table, I will take it and that’s what will happen.But I do want to be very clear. If there isn’t the right deal, I’m not in a hurry. I can hold my referendum at any time up until the end of 2017. And it’s much more important to get this right than to rush it. Does Cameron really mean this? In truth Cameron is in a hurry. He does want the renegotiation to be concluded soon because he wants to hold the referendum in June or September, and June would have the advantage of being before a possible summer migration crisis. But Cameron could perhaps stretch the process out a little bit beyond Friday 19 February (the final day of the EU summit scheduled for next month). There has been speculation that a second summit could be held later that month to finalise the deal. Cameron seems to be floating the idea of a delay in the hope of marginally increasing pressure on his EU counterparts to compromise. (They are fed up with this, and want it over soon too.) This is from my colleague Rafael Behr.Rafael Behr (@rafaelbehr)This is PM's effort at poker face. No10 *really* want deal soon. https://t.co/621Oanu9buJanuary 21, 2016Cameron said there would still be many “imperfect” things about the EU even if he got the reform package he wanted. Even if I’m successful in getting this reform package and holding this referendum, and Britain decides to stay in a reformed Europe, at no stage will you hear me say ‘That is perfection, this organisation is now fixed’. There are many things that are imperfect about the European Union today and there will be many things that will be imperfect about the European Union even after this negotiation ... The reform will not be finished.This seemed to be a pre-emptive strike against the Eurosceptics who will claim when his renegotiation is over that it has been worthless. It is also a statement of the obvious.He urged business to start campaigning now for Britain to stay in a reformed EU. I hope that business, and NGOs and other organisations won’t hold back. I would say don’t hold back right now, even though the question isn’t settled. I think that if business backs my reforms, if you want to see the competitive Europe, if you want to see the flexible Europe, if you want to see a Europe where you can be in the eurozone and win or out of the eurozone and win, I would argue get out there and support those things. I think it is important that with this, which is such a massively important generational question for Britain and for Europe, the sooner you can start to look at your own businesses and come up with examples and ideas about the benefits, and the problems, that there are with Europe, the more that you are able to help to explain and set the context for this vitally important question. This illustrates the extent to which Cameron is already focusing on the EU referendum campaign, as if the renegotiation is in practice concluded.He said Britain could have “the best of both worlds” in a reformed EU. To British people I would say there is the prospect of the best of both worlds. And let me explain what I mean by that. Britain’s membership of the European Union is already different from that of many other countries ...And by the best of both worlds I mean that we will be in the single market, and benefiting from that, but not in the single currency. That we will be benefiting from being able to travel and move around Europe, but we will maintain our own borders. This sounded like Cameron road-testing his main referendum campaign message.Updatedat 2.32pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.47pm GMT13:47Cameron says he 'not in a hurry' to get EU deal by FebruaryQ: If there is no deal on welfare curbs, will there be no deal?Cameron says he wants progress in all four areas he has identified. The welfare curbs are essential, he says.He says his call for EU migrants to have to wait four years to get full access to the welfare system was in the Conservative manifesto. If there are alternatives, he will look at them, he says. But this issue needs to be addressed.And that’s it. The speech and Q&A are over.The most interesting point was probably Cameron declaring that he is “not in a hurry” and that, if he does not get offered a good renegotiation deal in February, he is prepared to wait. If there’s a good deal on the table, I will take it.But if there isn’t the right deal, I’m not in a hurry. I can hold my referendum any time up until the end of 2017.Recently EU figures have been sounding increasingly certain about the prospect of a deal being done in February. Last week Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said he was “quite sure” of a deal in February.Today Cameron was modestly recalibrating expectations, perhaps in the hope of that this might put a little bit more pressure on his EU partners to grant concessions.I will post a full summary shortly.Updatedat 1.50pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.34pm GMT13:34Q: What do you say to people who think holding a referendum is dangerous?Cameron says he believes in democracy, and in putting this decision to the people.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.31pm GMT13:31Q: [From Roland Rudd, chair of Business for New Europe] People agree with your reform agenda. But don’t we need to stresss the common values European have too?Cameron agrees.Britain is a country with incredible connections and relations with other EU countries. We believe in democracy, tolerance and rights, and we are better able to promote those values together.At EU council meetings he remembers that it is an organisation of countries that used to fight each other.He says there are strong security arguments for the EU too. Look at Russia and Crimea, or Daesh; there is a strength and safety in numbers, working together against “these foes”.It is not just a matter of solidarity.
