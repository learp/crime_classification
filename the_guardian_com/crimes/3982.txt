A man was arrested today on suspicion of murdering a policeman after the vehicle they were travelling in crashed near Corbridge in Northumberland in the early hours of the morning.PC Joe Carroll, 46, died from his injuries after the marked police car he was driving left the road and overturned on the A69 at around 2.30am, Northumbria police said. The 40-year-old suspect had been arrested for a breach of the peace after a domestic dispute at a house in the Hexham area, and was being transferred by PC Carroll to a police station in Newcastle when the crash happened."We believe something happened in the car, but what it was and who was sitting where is all part of the investigation," a police spokeswoman said.Earlier, Northumbria's chief constable, Mike Craik, said: "At the moment all I can say is that a man who was already under arrest for an unrelated matter has been further arrested on suspicion of the murder of PC Joe Carroll and a full homicide investigation is now taking place."Because of that I am unable to provide any further details on the incident other than to say that Joe and another officer were involved in a road traffic collision in a marked police vehicle. No other vehicles were involved."Both the prisoner and the other officer were treated in hospital, although neither was badly injured.Mr Craik described PC Carroll, who was married and had served with the force for 24 years, as "the finest kind of local police officer"."He was a much loved and valued member of the community that he served in Bellingham and will be greatly missed by his colleagues who will remember him for his sense of community, his professional motivation and his genuine values," the chief constable said.The A69, the main route between Tyneside and Carlisle, was closed in both directions while an investigation took place.
