A newly married man was jailed for life today for murdering his wife after he cheated on her with two other women.Michael Roberts, 26, strangled his wife of five months, Victoria, last November. He was convicted of murder after a three-week trial at Liverpool crown court and told he would serve at least 17 years.Roberts denied murder and claimed his 25-year-old wife died when a sex game went wrong and he accidentally strangled her with a dressing gown cord. But the jurors rejected his version of events after deliberating for three hours.The court heard that Roberts, an assistant manager at a Phones4U store, cheated on his wife with two women he met at work. He killed her after she challenged him over text messages and Facebook posts to one woman, Karen Wilson.As the verdict was returned, Roberts sat down and shut his eyes. Members of his wife's family wept. Mr Justice Royce called Victoria "a talented, vibrant, caring, lively and lovely daughter".He said: "No words can adequately express the terrible effect her early death has had upon her family and friends. You cheated on her and deceived her during your relationship, before you married and throughout your short marriage. She deserved much better than you."He added: "What really happened only you know. But it is quite plain that her death was not caused simply by you using that bathrobe cord as a ligature."After strangling his wife, Roberts bound her body with duct tape and hid her under a duvet in their garage in Daresbury, Cheshire. When police found her he went on the run, but was later arrested.Roberts told friends and Victoria's family she had left him for another man. He sent bogus text messages from her phone. The judge said: "This was sickening hypocrisy. You went about it in a cold and heartless way to deceive her family and friends and induce sympathy for yourself."
