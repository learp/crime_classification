A victim of a rapist who won more than Â£7m on the lottery has failed to overturn a high court ruling barring her damages claim against him.Three high court judges have ruled that the 77-year-old former teacher, known as Mrs A, cannot not seek compensation from Iorworth Hoare because her claim was bought more than six years after the assault happened.Hoare attempted to rape Mrs A, then aged 59, in Roundhay Park, Leeds, in February 1988. She was his seventh victim. Sentencing him to life imprisonment in 1989, Mr Justice Rougier told Hoare: "For every moment you are at liberty some woman is at risk."Hoare was on day release from an open prison in Gloucestershire in 2004 when he bought the lottery ticket.At the appeal hearing, Mrs A's counsel, Alan Newman QC, said Hoare had no money or property before his windfall so Mrs A had decided it was "neither sensible nor proportionate" to take civil action against him. She issued a civil action in December 2004 after learning of Hoare's win and obtained medical reports on the psychiatric injuries she had suffered since the assault.But in October 2005 Mr Justice Jack upheld a decision by a senior high court official, Master Eyre, that her claim should be struck out as it was made more than six years after the assault.Mrs A was told that she could not rely on the Human Rights Act for help because the six-year period had ended before the act came into existence. She challenged the court's decision in February, claiming it was a denial of her human rights.The claim was one of three test cases to highlight the strict six-year time limit for launching compensation claims for deliberate assaults.The clock starts to run when the act happens, or at 18 if the victim is a child. It contrasts with a three-year limit for suing over negligent acts, which starts to run when the victim knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the claim.
