Scotland Yard insisted on Wednesday that there was "absolutely nowhere" in London that should be avoided after the United Arab Emirates advised its citizens against visiting certain "hazardous" and "less secure" parts of the city centre, including some of its most popular tourist destinations.Oxford Street and Piccadilly were among the areas identified as having high rates of pickpocketing, theft and fraud in maps published by the UAE foreign ministry.Emiratis said two high-profile attacks in London this year on visitors from the Gulf state had changed perceptions of London's safety.Using Google maps, areas identified as dangerous under the UAE guidance were Marble Arch tube station, running north to Edgware Road and beyond the Metropole Hotel, as well as an area including Piccadilly, Bond Street, Soho, Leicester Square, Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road.It describes the West End as an area of global trade, home to "the famous Selfridges" and frequently visited by Emiratis. Places identified as "less perilous" were the Shepherd's Bush market area and around Queensway tube station and Bayswater.Police made four arrests in April after three Emirati sisters were seriously injured in the middle of the night by a hammer-wielding attacker who sneaked into their room on the seventh floor of the four-star Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch. Three children, who were unharmed, were sleeping in two adjoining rooms. Two weeks later, an Emirati couple were robbed at gunpoint in a Paddington flat.Alia Al Mazroui, a businesswoman who was one of the founders of the UK's Just Falafel restaurant chain, also told the Guardian that the brutal killing in June of a 31-year-old Saudi student near an Essex nature reserve had had a "huge effect"."I had a couple of friends who were in London and their families were very scared, particularly after that incident," said Mazroui, who was travelling to London on Wednesday and added that she was comfortable about coming to the city.She also said that the UAE foreign ministry had recently sent messages and emails to Emiratis advising them to avoid certain areas of London for safety reasons and that citizens could update their contact address online."There have been a couple of attacks. They wanted to make sure that the Emiratis are safe while travelling," she added, while praising the UAE embassy in London.Mazroui said that she took care to travel light and dress down when she was in the capital. She said she had not experienced crime in London, although an aunt had a watch snatched from her wrist some years ago.Obaid Alzaabi, 20, an Emirati who studied in the UK and is now at home in Abu Dhabi, had more concerns about safety in London, saying the recent attacks and robberies had caused many of his friends and acquaintances to have second thoughts about coming to the UK on holiday."Since what has happened lately I have had friends who wanted to visit the UK but they have changed their mind. Nowadays, many people who would go to the UK are going to other places such as Switzerland and the US," he said.Alzaabi said he regarded other English cities such as Bristol and Southampton as safer than London, where he felt relatively safe during the daytime but became more nervous in the evening and at night, taking care to avoid groups of people on the street after dining out.Media coverage in the UAE quoted Emiratis who said that they would be taking their government's advice on London seriously and suggested that visitors from wealthy Gulf states were being singled out by criminals in the UK."I think maybe people from the Gulf are more targeted there because of their lifestyle. They might not be too discreet with their jewellery when they travel and they wear nice clothes," Dubai resident Mona Al Ali told the National newspaper.Text at the bottom of the advice published by the UAE authorities named the Metropolitan police as a source.However, Commander Makhdum Chishty of the Met said on Wednesday that there was "absolutely nowhere" in London that should be avoided."We understand the incidents involving Emirati nationals earlier this year was shocking, but it was also very, very rare," he added. "London is one of the safest major cities in the world and crime continues to fall and overall crime in Westminster is down byÂ 16.4%."Police presence is high and post-Ramadan, with the traditional influx of visitors from the UAE, we reviewed our policing plans so we have a strong presence from our policing teams and officers working in plain clothes."The force went on to list steps that visitors to London should follow to keep themselves and their belongings safe, including not carrying large sums of cash in public, using hotel safes, and always travelling by licensed taxi or minicab.It also said that visitors should consider carrying a personal safety alarm and urged them to "look confident and walk purposefully to your destination".
