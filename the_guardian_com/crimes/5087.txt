Martin Kettle's article (It's time to shout down the bobbies-on-the-beat mantra, 11 February) does not recognise the significant contribution of the increased numbers of police officers since 1997 on the overall reduction of crime and the increase in public confidence in policing.Overall crime, measured by the British Crime Survey, is down by 36%, violence by 41% and burglary by 54%. The latest statistics showed that for crimes recorded by the police there is an 8% reduction for burglary, 9% for robbery and 4% for violence against the person. And these falls have taken place during a recession.This has been made possible because of the investment this government has put into policing. We have over 16,000 more police officers than in 1997 and our investment in neighbourhood policing has delivered a further 16,000 police community support officers.We are committed to protecting these frontline numbers. The pre-budget report announced that sufficient funding will be provided to enable police authorities to maintain numbers of police officers and police community support officers in the years to 2012-13. The new policing white paper also identified opportunities to achieve efficiency savings of Â£545m per year by 2013-14. This reflects the priority that this government continues to give to the frontline and improving value for money.Our focus is not simply on officer numbers but on the outcomes for the public. Encouragingly, 50% of the public are now confident that the police and local council are dealing with issues in their area, while concerns on antisocial behaviour are at their lowest recorded level.David Hanson MPMinister for crime, policing and counterterrorism
