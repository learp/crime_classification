Detections using the national DNA database have fallen over the past two years despite the number of profiles increasing by 1m and its running costs doubling to £4.2m a year.A report on the database covering the years 2007-09, published today, shows that crimes cleared up as a result of a match on the DNA database fell from 41,148 to 31,915 over the period. At the same time the number of DNA profiles on the database – already the largest in the world – rose from 4.6m to 5.6m. Duplicates mean that the police database now holds details of 4.89 million individuals.Nevertheless, Peter Neyroud, the head of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which hosts the DNA database, says in the report that it continues to provide the police with the most effective tool for the prevention and detection of crime since the development of fingerprint analysis more than a century ago.The report shows that the total of DNA-related detections hit a peak of 41,148 in 2006-07 and then declined to 33,034 in 2007-08, and to 31,915 in 2008-09.A note in the report says that the cost of running the database rose from £2.1m in 2007-08 to £4.2m in 2008-09 because of the costs of transferring its operations from the Forensic Science Service to the NPIA and because of the increasing number of suppliers who needed to be accredited and monitored.The report shows that the number of individuals with DNA profiles on the database increased by 11% in the last year. Only 36,000 were given voluntarily. More than 80% relate to men, while 77% are white European, 5.2% Asian, and 7.3% black. One of the objectives of the DNA database is to cover the known criminal population in England and Wales. The report says that in April there were 3.6 million people on the database who had a conviction, caution or reprimand recorded on the police national computer.A further 986,000 who had been arrested but never convicted, who had been convicted but since had their records deleted from the PNC or against whom proceedings were continuing were on the database.This week Home Office ministers withdrew their current proposals to bring their policy retaining the DNA profiles of unconvicted people in line with a recent landmark European human rights ruling. Ministers said they would reintroduce a new plan to deal with the question in the next session of Parliament which starts on November 18.• The caption to the picture with this article was amended on Thursday 22 October 2009. It cited inaccurate and irrelevant statistics about Child Support Agency claims in which the identity of the father is contested. This has been corrected.
