A phoney barrister who hoodwinked judges, magistrates and a string of ­clients for six months was jailed for two years yesterday. Ian Clegg, a convicted fraudster with a record of credit card and fake employment scams, used a church congregation to pick up driving and debt cases to defend.Using robes and a wig bought on eBay, he presented a plausible manner to gullible victims, Durham crown court heard yesterday. David Brooke, prosecuting, described how the unemployed 32-year-old had boasted he would "run rings round" legal opponents and force them to pick up his clients' bills.Clegg, who lied about studying law at Teesside University, admitted specimen charges of impersonating a barrister at Langbaurgh East magistrates court and the county court in Middlesbrough. Passing sentence, Judge Esmond Faulks accepted that Clegg was more interested in status than cash. He said: "I am satisfied from the psychiatric reports that you are a compulsive liar and that you wanted to appear more important than you are."The court heard that Clegg, of Middlesbrough, had abused the trust of a parish priest to start his brief but initially successful impersonation.He also pursued debtors for other ­clients, writing such threatening letters that one victim "felt totally at Clegg's mercy", said Brooke. The trusting nature of the victims, who were almost all members of the congregation at St Hilda's church in Middlesbrough, made the betrayals worse. A prosecutor and court clerk became suspicious because of Clegg's muddles over procedure. Checks on his claim to be "just out of training in Manchester" and to have set up chambers in Middlesbrough called Yellow Apple proved to be nonsense.Paul Green, defending, said Clegg had apologised to police for "all the upset and aggravation" he had caused. The court heard that he had been given a community service order and a suspended 12-month sentence for previous frauds.One of Clegg's victims at St Hilda's, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "Something like this knocks your confidence, and the very nature of the Christian faith, of trusting others, has also taken a hit."
