The case against eight men accused of plotting to blow up aircraft flying from London to North America in 2006 is expected to start today.During yesterday's jury selection process, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith said the court would hear allegations that the defendants planned to create bombs which would be detonated on board planes en route to Canada and the USA, so that "all on board the aircraft would be killed".He said the trial would be long, complex and high-profile, with dozens of witnesses. The trial at Woolwich crown court is expected to last up to eight months.The men deny two charges linked to an alleged plot counter-terrorism police claimed to have foiled in August 2006. The exposing of the alleged plot led to the immediate introduction of tight security restrictions which brought chaos to UK airports and the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights.The men are charged with conspiracy to murder between January 1 and August 11 2006. They also face a second charge of conspiracy to commit an act of violence likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft during the same period.The eight accused are: Abdulla Ahmed Ali, aka Ahmed Ali Khan, 27, of Walthamstow, north London; Assad Sarwar, 27, of High Wycombe; Tanvir Hussain, 27, of no fixed address; Mohammed Gulzar, 26, of Barking, east London; Ibrahim Savant, 27, of Walthamstow; Arafat Waheed Khan, 26, of Walthamstow; Waheed Zaman, 23, of Walthamstow and Umar Islam, aka Brian Young, 29, of High Wycombe.
