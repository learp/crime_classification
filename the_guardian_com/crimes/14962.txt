Police have opened a murder investigation after a star pupil who was expected to receive outstanding exam grades in just over a week's time, was stabbed to death just metres from his home.Ajmol Alom, 16 who had been selected as a youth peace ambassador in Northern Ireland was knifed in the thigh late on Monday evening along with a second teenager after fighting broke out in an east London street in what is believed to have been a case of mistaken identity.Chris Dunne, headteacher at Langdon Park School, said Ajmol was a "hardworking, industrious, but also a very caring and thoughtful young man.""The exam results will come out next Thursday and he will have very good results," Dunne said.Metropolitan police said they had arrested a 19-year-old man on Tuesday morning on suspicion of murder. There are believed to have been a number of witnesses to the lethal incident.A second teenager, named locally as 16-year-old Azim Rob, was knifed across the face during the attack at 10pm.Rob's mother, Alaya Begum, said that her son had received nine stitches on the right side of his cheek but had been released from hospital to give a statement to authorities in Limehouse police station on Tuesday afternoon. She said that Rob had told her he did not know his attacker.Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said Ajmol was with friends when he was attacked.Speaking at the scene, he said: "Initial indications are that Ajmol was with four friends. They were peaceful, they were conducting conversations at the location [in] Spey Street.""They were then confronted by five to six other males who were wearing bandanas and were hooded."There appears to have been an unprovoked attack when the victim received his facial injuries and then Ajmol was stabbed."Both were taken to an east London hospital where Amol died.Police said they were keeping an open mind as to whether the incident was gang related but said that "initial indications" were that Amol was not linked to any gangs and had not provoked the incident.A male relation of Alom who declined to be named, described the dead boy as a "very good kid"."He was into sports, played football all the time and he was very good at his studies, he did his maths GCSE two years early and got an A*.""I know he would have gone on to do big things when he did his A levels," the relation said."Most of the kids that live around here are good, but a few of his friends that were with him are the kind that attract trouble."Headmaster Dunne explained that Amol had recently taken part in an exchange project with the St Ethelburga centre for reconcilation and peace and helped take "young Muslim pupils from Tower Hamlets over to Northern Ireland to meet with young people over there of Christian and Catholic faith."Former Tower Hamlets mayor, Doros Ullah, said: "I have children of my own and I know how difficult it is to bring up children in this area where there are limited resources."However, this young man stood out like a beacon and would have been a role model for all the young people who live around here."He was a straight A student. He prayed five times a day. And now his life has been cruelly taken. It is a very sad day for the community of Tower Hamlets."Ullah also criticised the government for not recoursing youth services well enough. "It's time the government started putting money into areas like these where there has been a lot of problems with anti-social behaviour."These kids hang around on their estates because they have nothing else to do. We need more youth clubs, more open spaces, places for them to play sport."Rukon Hassan a gang mediation project manager at Aasha confirmed that there had been "severe cuts" to youth services in the borough during the last couple of years.Hassan who has who has helped police facilitate their murder investigaion said, "because of the cuts [to services] young people are getting involved in gang related incidents."Hassan said that the mediation project would normally have a full programme of summer projects but currently they were extremely limited by what they could do adding that the project was "running on fumes at the moment."Witnesses to the murder can contact the police incident room on 020 8358 0100 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
