Greater Manchester police say they have so far been unable to find a letter from the Moors murderer, Ian Brady, addressed to Winnie Johnson and revealing the location of her son's body.Johnson died in a hospice last weekend, 48 years after her 12-year-old son, Keith Bennett, was murdered by Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley.In a statement issued on Friday, Greater Manchester police said the action taken on 16 August when Brady's mental health advocate was arrested formed "part of an ongoing criminal investigation"."Therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss any aspect of that investigation until it is concluded," the statement said. "While Greater Manchester police accepts there is significant media and public interest in both the investigation and the possible existence of the alleged letter, we would ask for patience and for the integrity of the investigation to remain unimpeded."The statement said once the investigation had been concluded, the force would be in a position to comment further.Just over a week ago, it emerged that police were investigating the possibility that Brady revealed the location of Bennett's grave in a letter he described to his mental health advocate, Jackie Powell. The search for the letter has, however, proved futile so far.Powell, whose role is to advise Brady of his rights under the Mental Health Act, was arrested on 16 August at her home in South Wales and released on bail for three months on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body.Her arrest was prompted after she told a Channel 4 documentary about the letter, which she says was addressed to Johnson. The police also searched Brady's cell at the high-security hospital at Ashworth in Merseyside.In the Cutting Edge documentary, broadcast on Monday, Powell held a letter from Brady to her, which she says refers to a second letter written by Brady to Johnson. The makers of the programme say they did not see the second letter and were not allowed to read the first, which Powell held while being interviewed.Martin Bottomley, the head of investigative review at Greater Manchester police's major and cold case crime unit, said last Friday that the Moors murders cast a long shadow over the region, but in 2009 they reluctantly concluded there was no longer any specific information to identify new search areas and the investigation to find Bennett's remains entered a dormant stage.He said: "We have been, and always will be, open to pursuing any new lines of inquiry that arise from significant scientific advances or credible and actionable information."Bottomley said he did not know if Brady knew the location of the grave or if he was manipulating the public, "but we clearly have a duty to investigate such information on behalf of Keith's family".Twelve-year-old Bennett was one of the pair's five victims. He disappeared after visiting his grandmother and was killed and buried somewhere on Saddleworth Moor.A quarter of a century ago, police took Brady and Hindley back to the moor, but theywere only able to identify where Pauline Reade was buried.Brady was jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of John Kilbride, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans. Hindley was convicted of killing Downey and Evans, and of protecting Brady. She was jailed for life. They finally admitted killing Bennett and Reade in 1987. Hindley died in 2002.Leading criminologist David Wilson and Lord Pendry, the former MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, have both expressed doubts about the existence of a letter.
