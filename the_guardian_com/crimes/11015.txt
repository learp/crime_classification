John and Anne Darwin, jailed this week for an elaborate fraud in which they pretended he had vanished while canoeing, are to receive legal aid to fight efforts to recover their illicit gains, officials said today.John, who was jailed for six years and three months, and Anne, who was handed a six-and-a-half year sentence, also received legal aid for their criminal hearings, the bulk of which went towards Anne's trial after she pleaded not guilty.The Darwins' assets were frozen in the first step towards paying back the £250,000 they conned out of insurance companies.A spokeswoman for the Legal Services Commission said asset-recovery proceedings had begun, and that the couple would be defended by legal aid barristers."John and Anne Darwin were both granted legal aid for the crown court case," she said."The Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings are now beginning and their defence will be covered by legal aid granted at the crown court trial."However, the commission could ask the judge to award some of any recovered assets to cover these legal costs.She declined to speculate how much the total legal aid bill for the Darwins could amount to, saying: "We would never know until the end of proceedings what the costs are."Two insurance companies, Unat Direct and Norwich Union, have started legal proceedings against the couple for the money they defrauded after John Darwin, 57, faked his death in 2002. His wife was complicit in the plot.A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said today the pair would be dealt with separately: "We have got to find out what each has done. They have both got to submit statements in their own name."The CPS wants the £455,000 raised by the couple from the sale of their two homes on Teesside to be included in any settlement.The Hartlepool couple were found to have claimed £250,820.75 in insurance and pension payouts over a five-and-a-half year period after hatching their elaborate plot when they faced financial troubles.Some of this money was used to pay off the mortgage on their main family home and rental properties. When the houses were sold, the Darwins laundered the money to start new lives in Panama.
