A teenager has been arrested in connection with the murder of 14-year-old Martin Dinnegan, police said today."A 15-year-old male youth was arrested last night in connection with the murder of Martin Dinnegen," Scotland Yard said in a statement. "He is being held in custody at a London police station."Martin was stabbed to death on Tuesday night in Islington, north London, after he and his friends became involved in an argument with a group of up to 20 youths.A post-mortem examination on Martin gave his cause of death as stab wounds to the chest, police said. Martin's mother, Lorraine Dinnegan, paid tribute to her "lovely son" yesterday. "He's a lovely boy, he doesn't deserve this, nobody deserves this, it's horrible," she said. "He was a very popular boy, he was well-known and did very well in school." Police said Martin, described as a bright child who was never in trouble, was murdered in a "vicious attack" in Holloway when he and his friends got into an altercation with a group of between 15 and 20 youths.One youth suggested Martin - who became at least the 13th youth to have died in London so far this year as a result of gun and knife violence - may have got caught up in a clash between rival gangs.Martin's neighbour, Sadik Turan, said friends had described how he had been chased down the road by a gang who then beat him to the ground and stabbed him.A family friend, Angela Fitzgerald, said Martin had been hit with a metal bar by a group of boys in the area a few months ago and his friend had been stabbed, and they had previously had their bikes and mobile phones stolen.She described how his friends had seen Martin fall to the ground during the row. "He was very white and then started to go blue and his eyes were just staring. He gasped and they tried to get him up, then they saw blood all over his back."
