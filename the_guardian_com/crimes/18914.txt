A man was arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday after arriving at a police station in the early hours of the morning and telling officers there was a woman's body in a van parked outside.The man, who is 53, handed himself in at Luton police station at 4am and told Bedfordshire police about the body in the van. Forty minutes later, police forced entry to a council flat in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to find a man's body.Neighbours said the dead woman and man were a mother and son. Police did not release their names yesterday, but the woman was identified by neighbours as Patricia Rozsavolgyi and her son as Tony Parsons. The man being questioned by police is thought to be the woman's former partner.Susan Warboys, 30, who lives opposite the flat, said: "She was a lovely lady. She would always stop and chat and say hello when she went past." Another neighbour, who would not give her name, said Mrs Rozsavolgyi was very "community-minded" and would always be involved in charity events. A woman believed to be the dead woman's daughter arrived at the police cordon around 11am, screaming: "That's my mother's house," before being escorted inside by an officer.A spokesman for Thames Valley police said: "A forensic investigation is now under way at the address and detectives from the Thames Valley police major crime unit will be managing the investigation."
