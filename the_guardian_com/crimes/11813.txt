The Conservative party is backing a bill to give householders greater rights to defend themselves against intruders and lessen their fear of prosecution.Patrick Mercer, MP for Newark and the party's security spokesman, will introduce a private member's bill within weeks to shift the legal balance in favour of occupants and against those breaking in.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said yesterday that all but "grossly disproportionate" force should be legitimate, adding: "When you are defending your wife and children in your own home, you should not be worrying about whether you are going to be prosecuted."He told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme that the party had been consulting lawyers for weeks, adding: "Unless the government actively oppose it, we will get it into law."Householders are allowed to use "reasonable force" to defend their families and property, but critics, including the outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner, have made increasingly vociferous calls for fresh legislation to clarify this.The issue has received more coverage due to the recent fatal stabbings of John Monckton, a City financier, and Robert Symons, a teacher, at their homes in London.On Saturday Sir John Stevens, who retires as head of the Metropolitan police in January, told the Daily Telegraph that, in all but extreme circumstances, the law should presume that a householder had acted lawfully, even if the intruder died.The Conservatives' decision to back Mr Mercer's bill puts the government in a difficult position. The measure is unlikely to be supported by the government, with the Home Office yesterday stressing that the issue would instead be looked at in the forthcoming murder and manslaughter review, expected to report back in 18 months.But refusing to back it could be tricky in the run-up to a general election campaign in which security is to be a key theme for Labour. "I think it would be an extraordinarily ill-judged move for the government to try to oppose this bill," Mr Mercer said. He said that while householders who injured intruders were often acquitted, they should not face the stress and stigma of a court case in the first place. Last month, Michael Howard told the Sunday Telegraph that he would not support an unqualified right for householders to use force in self-defence, as they have in parts of the United States. Mr Mercer's planned bill stresses that force should not be "grossly disproportionate".
