A new weapon has been unveiled in the fight against shoplifters: the 'thiefcam'. Researchers attached miniature concealed cameras to shoplifters who had volunteered to have their every move recorded as they went into shops.The thieves participating in the pilot programme did not take anything, but they did expose their tricks and tactics. 'We wanted to discover what it is about a particular situation that makes it attractive to shoplifters,' said Professor Martin Gill, director of the Scarman Centre at the University of Leicester, who led the pilot project. He found that shoplifters could find spots not covered by cameras and move into a safe position where they could steal within a minute of being in the store. 'We were able to see the areas that were not watched that closely,' Gill said. 'In one store, you could stand by the counter and CCTV can't see you. Another store had an office display area with a printer, desk and phone, and was exposed to a series of blind spots.' The security managers of the chain stores involved in the scheme were informed when the tests would take place but, to heighten authenticity, the shop's security guards were not. The former shoplifters were also questioned about the tricks they had employed in the past. Research released last week showed that Britain has become the shoplifting capital of Europe; the crime costs British retailers Â£2.9 billion a year. According to the Centre for Retail Research retailers lose 1.76 per cent of their turnover to shoplifting, fraud or administrative error. The European average is 1.42 per cent.nick.walsh@observer.co.uk
