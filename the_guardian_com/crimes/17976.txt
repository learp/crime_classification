An armed robber serving a life sentence is the latest criminal to go on the run from an open prison.David Blood, who police said may pose a threat to the public, absconded from Ford prison in West Sussex, between 8.30am and 1pm on Thursday.It is thought to be the second time he has absconded from an open prison after going missing from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire in April 2012. He was not found for almost three months.The 48-year-old was jailed for life at Stafford crown court in 2003 after he was convicted of robbing a post office in Sutton Coldfield, west Midlands, with a number of other men in December 2000."Because of Blood's record, we have to consider that he could pose a threat to the public," said PC Stephen Reed. "I would urge anyone that sees him to contact us on 999 rather than approaching him."Blood is described as 6ft 1in tall (1.85m), of small build with brown eyes and cropped black hair. He is known to have links to Staffordshire and Warwickshire.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "The justice secretary has been clear that keeping the public safe is our priority and has already ordered major changes to tighten up temporary release processes and open-prison eligibility."Absconds have reached record lows under this government – down 80% over the last 10 years – but each and every incident is taken seriously, with the police contacted as a matter of urgency."Open prisons and temporary licence are an important tool in rehabilitating long-term offenders but not at the expense of public safety."It is the latest in a spate of recent instances of inmates absconding from open prisons.In the most high-profile case, Michael Wheatley, a violent armed robber known as Skullcracker, carried out a raid on a building society when he disappeared after being let out of the Standford Hill prison in Kent last month.He was later jailed for life.
