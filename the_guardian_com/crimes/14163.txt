Almost 8,000 sex offenders have received a police caution rather than being charged in the past five years, it emerged today.The crimes include 230 rapes and almost 2,000 offences involving children, a survey of police forces in England found.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) insisted offenders were not being "let off", since the caution would still be noted on a criminal record and they would be entered on the sex offenders register.Other offences that attracted a caution involved child pornography, bigamy, exploitation of prostitution, indecent exposure, acts against animals, sexual grooming and incest.Much of the information in the BBC News survey was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Only one force, West Yorkshire police, failed to provide figures, saying it would be too expensive to search for the facts.Acpo said that, before deciding whether to charge or caution an offender, police would take into account the victim's views, age and welfare.Cautions would be given in circumstances where the victim of a rape did not turn up to give evidence in court or, for example, the case involved a 16-year-old boy having consensual sex with a 15-year-old."Every incident will be treated on its own merit, taking into account the circumstances of the incident and the people involved," said Terrence Grange, chief constable of Dyfed Powys police and Acpo's lead officer on sexual offences.A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said "very few" of the cautions were for raping children."The government is committed to securing more convictions in rape cases and has commissioned the child sex offender review to ensure children are better protected from paedophiles," she said. "There are very few circumstances indeed where a caution for rape or offences against children is the most appropriate sanction."Use of cautions is a matter for the police but in exceptional circumstances - for instance, where the victim does not want to proceed with a prosecution - a caution will still result in the offender having to comply with the notification provisions of the sex offenders register."A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police, where 138 cautions were issued for sex offences involving children in the past five years, said many of the offenders were juveniles themselves or people with behavioural or learning difficulties."You are not looking at 138 men in their 30s, 40s and 50s offending against young children. It will be a mixed bag," he said. "It's not that we are being lenient with offenders but each case has to be taken on its own merits. Decisions to caution are not taken lightly but, in some cases, it's the most appropriate action to take."David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said it was "outrageous" that offenders were "getting away with effectively no punishment"."This is a direct consequence of Labour pursuing a policy of getting detections by the easiest possible route, even if it means keeping thousands of serious offenders out of the justice system," he said.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on home affairs, said it was "part and parcel" of a wider trend by the government for the police to bypass traditional justice in favour of fixed penalty notices and other measures outside the courts. "There is also alarming evidence that these shortcuts to justice are being used in increasing numbers so that the police can meet the rigid and arbitrary targets imposed by this government," he said.The campaign group Women Against Rape said it was a "slap in the face" to victims that offenders were only being cautioned"Getting justice is essential to recovery after rape - cautions confirm that the authorities hardly count what happened to you as serious," a spokeswoman told the BBC.Jim Gamble, the head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, the UK agency set up to tackle online paedophiles, said it was important that all child sex offenders were dealt with properly."Everybody doesn't go to prison, but let's make sure the right people do because that's the best way to protect our children," he said."A caution in that regard is not getting off. It's admitting you're guilty. It's being put on the sex offenders register and thereafter being monitored."
