The home secretary, David Blunkett, yesterday faced all-party criticism for his plan to introduce a new criminal offence of incitement to religious hatred despite his insistence that it will not ban comics' jokes, criticism of religious beliefs or atheists who claim there is no God.As MPs on all sides questioned the need for the new offence of incitement to religious hatred, it became clear yesterday that this issue will prove to be the most controversial measure in the serious and organised crime and police bill during its passage through parliament. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the Conservatives would try to remove the new offence from the legislation because it would "sacrifice freedom of speech for little or no gain", while the Liberal Democrats said they had "serious doubts" about it. Mr Blunkett tried to allay those fears in a detailed ministerial statement which said the offence would be aimed at extreme political and racist individuals and organisations. He said: "It is not a new blasphemy law and will protect people rather than ideologies." Alan Travis
