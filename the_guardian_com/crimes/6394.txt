A 15-year-old boy appeared in court yesterday charged with the murder of Luke Walmsley, who was fatally stabbed at a rural Lincolnshire school.The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was remanded in custody into secure accommodation after a brief hearing at Skegness magistrates court. He spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. He was remanded until Wednesday next week, when he will reappear before a youth court. Luke, who was 14, died on Tuesday morning after he was knifed in the chest following an alleged row with another student at Birkbeck school in North Somercotes, near Louth. On Wednesday, more than 50 students and family members attended a service at Trinity Methodist church, where Luke was remembered. Luke was flown to a hospital in Grimsby by air ambulance, but was pronounced dead within an hour. A post-mortem examination revealed that he died from a single stab wound to the heart. Fellow pupils have left flowers on a grassy area inside the school gates in tribute to their classmate. The school's headteacher, Gary Loveridge, said that staff, pupils and parents were totally devastated. He described Luke as a "strong and positive boy" who was liked by all the staff. Classes are not expected to begin again at the school until Monday.
