The mother of one of five prostitutes found murdered in Suffolk over 10 days in 2006 had "no idea" her daughter was a sex worker, a jury heard today.Kerry Nicol told Ipswich crown court that she thought her 19-year-old daughter Tania had been working as a hairdresser or in a bar.Nicol was giving evidence at the trial of a forklift truck driver accused of killing the five women.Steve Wright, 49, of Ipswich, Suffolk, denies murdering Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29.The naked bodies of the five women, who all worked as prostitutes in Ipswich, were found at remote locations near the town in December 2006.Tania Nicol was the first to go missing on October 30.Her mother told the court her daughter had grown up in Ipswich and done well at a local school. But she had moved out of home at the age of 16 and lived at a hostel elsewhere in Ipswich, where she started using drugs."She used heroin a couple of times in the hostel," said Nicol.Tania had asked for help to get off the drugs, she told the court, adding: "I sent her away for a while."In 2004, her daughter moved to a flat in Ipswich.When Tania moved back home in December 2005, her appearance had changed, the jury was told."Bad skin," said Nicol. "Lost a bit more weight."She said syringes had been found in her daughter's bedroom in early 2006 but Tania had denied she was still taking drugs."She said she had a job and was managing all right," said Nicol."She told me a few different things. She was a hairdresser at one point. Another time behind a bar in a pub."Nicol told jurors she had "no idea" that Tania was a prostitute.But she said that, on one occasion, she had answered a call from a massage parlour called Cleopatra's, asking for a woman called "Chantelle".Nicol said she had found a letter in Tania's bedroom addressed to "Chantelle", and twice men she did not know had called the house.Giving evidence from behind a screen which hid her from the view of the public gallery and Wright, Nicol described the final time she had seen her daughter alive.She said Tania went out at about 10.45pm on October 30. Nicol said Tania had been wearing cut-off jeans when she left home."I was in the kitchen and I heard her go out of the front door. I heard the door slam," Nicol said.At 10.57pm she had called her daughter's mobile phone and Tania confirmed she was on a bus to Ipswich.She told the jury it had "become apparent" that Tania had not returned home at 7pm the following day, when Nicol looked in her bedroom.When she realised her daughter had not returned Nicol said she had checked the telephone numbers dialled by Tania before she vanished.Her daughter had called a man by the name of Tom Stephens before her disappearance, she told the jury.Tania's body was found in Belstead Brook, at Copdock Mill, near Ipswich on December 8.The trial was adjourned for the night.
