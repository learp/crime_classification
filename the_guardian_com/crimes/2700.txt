A casualty nurse who sought excitement by injecting patients with potentially fatal drug doses was today found guilty of murdering two people.Benjamin Geen, 25, preyed on patients shortly after they were admitted to the accident and emergency department of the Horton General Hospital in Banbury, Oxfordshire.A jury at Oxford Crown Court today found Geen, of Banbury, guilty of two charges of murder.He was also convicted of 15 counts of grievous bodily harm against patients.Geen injected his victims with potentially fatal doses to stop them breathing so that he could "enjoy the excitement" of helping to revive them.He used different substances, including insulin, muscle relaxants and sedatives, to send his victims close to death. All these drugs are commonly used in the hospital but "deadly in the wrong hands".Doctors were left bewildered by the unexplained respiratory failures - normally very rare events - which took place between December 2003 and February 2004Geen murdered David Onley, 75, from Deddington, who died on January 21 2004, and Anthony Bateman, 66, from Banbury, who died on January 6 2004.Both were very ill men when they were admitted to hospital.During the two-month trial, the jury of six men and six women heard how Geen had come "alive" and looked "elated" as his patients went into respiratory arrest.Geen even "boasted" about the regular action during his shifts, telling one doctor: "There is always a resuscitation when I'm on duty."Eventually, colleagues decided something was seriously wrong after an alcoholic was admitted with stomach pains and ended up in intensive care.Midazolam, a sedative, and vecuronium, a muscle relaxant, appeared in Timothy Stubbs' urine sample, even though doctors knew they had not prescribed them.Over the weekend of February 6-9, senior staff at the hospital sat down with the case notes of hundreds of patients whose outcomes they felt they could not explain.The pile was eventually whittled down to 18 cases, with Benjamin Geen the common factor in every one.Staff at the hospital called the police, and Geen was arrested as he arrived for work the next day, with a full syringe in his pocket.Since then, instances of respiratory failure have virtually disappeared at the hospital.Prosecutor Michael Austin Smith QC told the jury Geen must have known the potentially fatal consequences of what he was doing, but toying with patients' lives was a "price he was willing to pay in order to satisfy his perverse needs". . He said: "He must have known it, but it did not stop him. After Mr Bateman. Mr Onley died, too, and still it didn't stop him, because other people followed on from that, culminating, five people later, with Mr Stubbs, who very nearly died, as did so many other people."People were at death's door. Most were lucky; two were not."
