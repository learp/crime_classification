A German office worker was today found guilty of murdering a British student whose girlfriend he had become obsessed with after using a wargaming website.David Heiss, 21, stabbed Matthew Pyke 86 times after becoming infatuated with Joanna Witton.He forced his way in to the Nottingham flat Pyke shared with his 21-year-old girlfriend, and stabbed him as he lay cowering in the corner.In his last moments, Pyke, 20, wrote DAV, the first three letters of Heiss's Christian name, in his own blood on the side of his computer to alert police to his killer's identity.But the computer sciences student, of Stowmarket, Suffolk, did not survive the attack on 19 September last year, which was described by prosecutors at Nottingham crown court as "savage and sustained".Heiss became obsessed with Witton after meeting her through the wargaming website she ran with her boyfriend from their flat in Nottingham's city centre.Pyke's brother Adam hugged his mother, Kim, as the verdict was delivered.Mr Justice Keith said Heiss had remained in denial about the murder. Turning to the defendant, he said: "David Heiss, you have been convicted of the brutal and savage murder of Matthew Pyke."The law permits only one punishment for the crime of murder, and the sentence I pass on you is one of imprisonment for life."The judge told Heiss he would serve at least 18 years.He said: "The fact that your motive for murder was so bizarre doesn't make your killing of Matthew any the less serious."He said he was convinced the murder had been premeditated. "Your killing of him involved a substantial degree of both planning and premeditation, which is a significant aggravating factor."The judge added: "I have taken into account that you are 21 years old, and that you were driven by obsession with Joanna, and by what you thought were her and Matthew's betrayal of you by what they said about to you to their friends."The tragedy is that you are unable to cope with rejection.Witton was also in court to hear the verdict.
