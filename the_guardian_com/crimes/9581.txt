Manchester is among the most dangerous places in Britain, according to a report by HM Inspector of Constabulary. People are more likely to become a victim of crime there than nearly anywhere else in the country.The report criticises Greater Manchester police, one of Britain's largest forces, for poor performance and lack of leadership, and questions whether it even has a clear philosophy. Its ability to tackle crimes such as burglary is "a particular area of concern", the incidence being more than twice the national average at 40.8 for every 1,000 households. Fewer than eight in 100 burglaries lead to an arrest. Robbery and vehicle crime are another concern, only 15.3% and 6.5% respectively being solved. "If you lived in, worked in or visited Greater Manchester, you were more likely to have a crime committed against you than almost anywhere else in the country. Her Majesty's Inspector questions if the force knows what its policing philosophy is at the present time," says the report. There were 152.7 recorded crimes for every 1,000 people, against an average in England and Wales of 113.2 and GMP detected 20.2% of crimes, compared with the national average of 23.2%. The report noted that Mike Todd, who took over as chief constable last October, had said the force was short of 1,000 officers. It said Mr Todd, his management team and the police authority were "committed to positive change."
