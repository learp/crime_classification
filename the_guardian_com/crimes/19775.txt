A police officer, who was on duty when he picked up a prostitute, told her she could trust him but then failed to pay her the £20 agreed, admitted soliciting yesterday.Gary Hart, 34, a married father of two, picked up Jane Davies in Bolton's red light district while he was in a marked traffic car working for Greater Manchester police. He took her to Castle Street police station, where she performed a sex act on him, but he did not pay her. Hart pleaded guilty to soliciting a woman for prostitution. He was fined £100 and ordered to pay the £2,546 prosecution costs. He resigned from Greater Manchester police shortly before the case was heard by Oldham magistrates. District judge Bridid Knight said: "I cannot think of anything more designed to bring shame upon your uniform and the police force. Because of these circumstances, it makes your offence particularly serious, as an offence of kerb-crawling, because you took advantage of and abused your position as a police officer." Nick Clarke, prosecuting, said that between April and July last year, Hart operated a system where he approached working girls while in uniform and in his police vehicle. "He engaged in conversation, flirting, chatting them up and arranging to meet after work," said Mr Clarke. Zoe Nield, defending, said that Hart was a man of previously unblemished character who had worked hard to get into the police force."He loved his job and he is devastated to have lost something that was so important to him."
