Police have identified a murder victim who was assaulted, tied up and dumped down a well about two years ago. Scotland Yard named the man as 30-year-old Damian Chlywka, a Polish national who came to the UK in 2008. Workmen discovered his body in a well outside an address in Audley Drive, Warlingham, Surrey, on 15 November. A 41-year-old man and a 33-year-old man, who were arrested for murder on 29 November, are in custody at south London police stations, while seven others are on bail. A team of specialist officers including Metropolitan police divers retrieved Chlywka's body. Police said examinations showing injuries "consistent with an assault" before he was put in the well. He had been bound and was believed to have been there for around two years, Scotland Yard said. Further tests were being carried out as a post-mortem held on 17 November did not provide a cause of death. Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons, the officer leading the investigation, said: "Damian had lived at various addresses across London including two known to be in the Croydon area. At one point he had lived at 11A Audley Road. "Our focus now is to build up a fuller picture of Damian's life in the UK. "We have given the difficult and heartbreaking news to his family who are distraught that this has happened to their loved one. "I am appealing to anyone who knew or previously worked with him to contact the police and help us to piece together a picture of Damian's life and how it came to end in these distressing circumstances." Seven men, aged between 21 and 27, who were arrested on suspicion of murder, have been released on bail until a date in late December.
