Every council should offer women with violent partners a "safe room" in their home, under plans announced by the government today.Following a pilot scheme in London, which allowed women with abusive partners to live at home rather than be forced into hostels and secure accommodation, the communities secretary, Ruth Kelly, now wants the scheme rolled out nationwide.Today she told local authorities that every council in England should offer the facility.It is currently only available in 120 areas, about a third of the total."Sanctuary schemes have been proven to prevent homelessness by giving people the security and confidence to stay in their own home, where it's their choice and police experts agree it's a safe option," Ms Kelly said."It is not right that victims should have no other choice but to go into temporary accommodation or refuges, which can feel unsettling and cause family upheaval at the worst possible time."A safe room - made famous in the Jodie Foster film Panic Room - would usually be a bedroom, and comprise of strengthened doors with mortise locks, with an alarm connected to the local police station.According to the government, 90% of women who have been offered the facility believe it is a good idea.Women with violent partners would only be given the room by choice, if the partner did not live with them, and if the facility was arranged by agreement with an assessment with local social services and police.Ms Kelly is publishing new guidance explaining how they can be set up and writing to local authorities across the country.However, there is no new money available for the safe rooms.In Barnet, north London, where a scheme has already been introduced, it is claimed that the council saved £600,000 by providing safe rooms rather than putting families in temporary accommodation.A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said that local authorities would next year receive a £74m fund to tackle homelessness, however.Domestic violence is a factor in one in eight new cases of homelessness. It affects up to 30,000 people a year, including 14,000 children.The pilot schemes were originally set up under John Prescott's Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, before coming under the remit of the new DCLG, which was created in May.However, some critics have voiced disquiet that such schemes are a way of cutting official homelessness numbers.Davina James-Hanman, director of the Greater London Domestic Violence Projects, told the Guardian in February: "It should always be a woman's choice, not a mechanism for a local authority to reduce its households in temporary accommodation." Councils are under pressure to meet a government target to halve the number of families in temporary accommodation by 2010.Of 120,860 families accepted as homeless last year in England and Wales, 15,000 (13%) were fleeing violent partners.Campaigners last month called for a new strategy to combat violence against women, claiming little progress had been made in the last year.The End Violence Against Women coalition awarded the government a score of two out of 10, compared with one out of 10 last year.It criticised an approach of "mopping up the problem once it has occurred, rather than working to ensure that women no longer experience violence."
