A former driver for BBC personalities was found dead at his home on Monday after failing to appear in court, where he was due to stand trial for allegedly abusing a 12-year-old boy in 1984.David Smith was charged in April with five offences of sexual assault dating back to the 1980s, becoming the first suspect to face charges under the Operation Yewtree investigation into Jimmy Savile and others.A warrant was issued by a judge for the arrest of the 66-year-old after he failed to appear at Southwark crown court in London. Smith had faced two counts of indecent assault, two of indecency with a child, and one of buggery, all relating to a 12-year-old boy, between 1 June and 21 July 1984.The Metropolitan police said officers went to a private address in south London at 2.20pm after a man had failed to appear at court. The body of a man was found at the address in Lewisham."Whilst officers believe they know the identity of the deceased, they await confirmation of formal identification," the police said. "A postmortem will take place in due course."Smith's counsel, Sandy Canavan, had told the court her solicitor had been attempting to contact Smith without success.She said: "He has been regularly in contact. I am concerned at the lack of contact. He is the sole carer for his very aged and very unwell mother; that may have affected why he's not here today."
