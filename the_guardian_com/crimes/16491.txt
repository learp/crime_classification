Three Muslim men were jailed today for an arson attack on the home of the publisher of a novel about Aisha, the child bride of the prophet Muhammad.The trio poured diesel on the front door of the house in Islington, north London, and set it on fire. The attack in September last year took place days before Martin Rynja's company, Gibson Square, was scheduled to publish The Jewel of Medina, by the American author Sherry Jones.Ali Beheshti, 41, and Abrar Mirza, 23, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit arson, while 30-year-old Abbas Taj was convicted of the same offence at Croydon crown court in May. Today, Mrs Justice Rafferty, sitting at London's Royal Courts of Justice, sentenced each of them to four and a half years in jail.Andrew Hall QC, representing Beheshti, said in mitigation that it was "an act of protest born of the publication of a book felt by him and other Muslims to be disrespectful, provocative and offensive".The judge said: "If you chose to live in this country, you live by its rules. There is no such thing as a la carte citizenship and, in your case, there is no such thing as a la carte obedience to the law."The UK publication of the book was delayed after the attack. The novel, which received mixed reviews – the LA Times called it "a second-rate bodice ripper" – struggled to find release in the US due to fears of a backlash by Muslim militants. It is now on sale in both countries, as well as seven other European countries, including Germany, Italy and Denmark.The judge rejected arguments that Beheshti, from Ilford, east London, Mirza, from Walthamstow, north London, and Taj, from Forest Gate, east London, had intended only to set fire to the door, saying they had planned to "punish" Rynja."He, principled man that he is, had done two things: exercised critical judgement on a literary work, and stood up to be counted, knowing that publishing it put him at risk," she said. "As he said, in an open society there has to be open access to literary works, regardless of fear."
