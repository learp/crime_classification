A father broke down in tears as his teenage son was remanded in custody charged with one of the few incidents of trouble last week in north-east England.The man was comforted by his wife as the 17-year-old was led away after being accused of violent disorder in which a police station in Washington, near Sunderland, was attacked and a patrol car set on fire.The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, looked distraught when bail was denied. His solicitor had said the teenager was "desperate" to see his own toddler son after spending the weekend in jail.He will appear at Newcastle crown court on Friday alongside 18-year-old Jamie Joseph Henry Nolan, of Washington, who has been charged with violent disorder during the same incident.The boy's father and his wife were told by Joan Green, chair of the bench at Sunderland magistrates court: "We really do appreciate you are here to support your son. Thank you for coming."The teenager was one of 14 people arrested by Northumbria police after the incident early on Wednesday. Two petrol bombs did Â£12,000 worth of damage and an officer was injured by flying glass when he went to investigate.
