A waiter will appear in court today accused of killing a pensioner in an axe attack on a north London street.Joseph Sheehan, 37, of Camden, north London, will appear before Highbury Corner magistrates, charged with murdering Brian Messitt, 67. Mr Messitt had recently returned from India, to visit his son. His family expressed shock at his death. In a statement they said: "Brian was an average, peaceful and polite pensioner. He enjoyed long walks, reading, football and telling funny stories. "Our feelings for him are that of affection and respect. Our whole family is in disbelief and terrible shock." Mr Messitt was walking in Belsize Park at about 9.30am on Monday when he was attacked. Neighbours of Mr Messitt, who had a home in nearby Haverstock Hill, described him as being gentle and easygoing. He had been living in India on and off for the past 10 years and had only returned to the UK to visit his son, Sean, two weeks ago. Neighbour Philip O'Connor, 59, said: "I can't think why anyone would want to harm him. "I saw Sean this morning and I asked him 'How's Brian?' and he started crying and said 'He's been killed.'" Another neighbour, Yvonne Colb, 57, said: "He told me he had been living in Madras. He just liked to live cheaply." Results of a post mortem gave the cause of Mr Messitt's death as severe head injuries.
