Let's do the maths. Roughly 60% of prisoners reoffend within two years of release. The average cost to the taxpayer of a reoffender (in prison and court expenses alone) is £110,500, according to a new report by analysts New Philanthropy Capital (NPC).What prevents reoffending? Maintaining family ties helps, according to research, and yet 45% of prisoners lose contact with their family while inside. Of those, roughly 27% go on to reoffend.A solution? Invest in prison visitor centres, says NPC. They cost £40,000, so why not build one costing £80,000, massively increasing its capacity to enable prisoners to keep up with families.The NPC business plan assumes, conservatively, that doubling investment on this scale might ensure that one percentage point of the 27% who lose contact and reoffend keep up with family and stay straight once outside, an average success rate of six prisoners per jail.Such an outcome would save the taxpayer £617,342, says NPC, equivalent to a net return on investment of 1,443%.The government should commit more resources to helping prisoners maintain family ties, says NPC. Private benefactors might also take note: "There are rich pickings to be had from expanding visitors' centres and supporting charities whose work helps prisoners keep in touch with the outside world," says NPC's Martin Brookes.· Investing in Family Ties is at www.philanthropycapital.org
