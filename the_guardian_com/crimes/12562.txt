At least £25m has been stolen from a security depot in what could be Britain's biggest robbery, the Bank of England said tonight.There are unconfirmed reports that the final figure could be up to £40m.The governor of the Bank called for a review of security arrangements for the storage of banknotes following the raid on the Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge, Kent, in which 15 members of staff were threatened and tied up by armed robbers.The gang posed as police officers and abducted the depot manager and his family, Kent police said.Detective Superintendent Paul Gladstone of Kent Police's serious and organised crime unit said the raid was "clearly a robbery that was planned in detail over time".He described the figure stolen as "a very substantial sum of money running into millions of pounds".The manager of Securitas' main cash depot south of the Thames was pulled over while driving near Stockbury at 6.30pm on Tuesday by what he believed was an unmarked police car, police said.Thinking they were genuine police officers, the manager then got into their car, where they handcuffed him.Meanwhile, two more men claiming to be police officers visited the manager's wife and young son, told them the manager had been involved in an accident, and took them from their Herne Bay home.The manager was driven westbound along the M20 where the car met up with a white van in which the manager was put inside. He was driven to an unknown location, where he was threatened at gunpoint and told to "cooperate or his family would be at risk", a Kent Police spokesman said.At about 1am he was taken to the Vale Road security depot where at least six men, some armed with handguns, threatened and tied up around 15 members of staff. The gang loaded a substantial amount of cash into a white lorry before driving off at about 2.15am.Kent Police were alerted about an hour later when the shocked but physically unhurt staff activated an alarm. The manager, his wife and son were also uninjured."This was a traumatic ordeal for the manager of the security depot, his family and all of the staff who worked there," Mr Gladstone said."They have all coped extremely well in the circumstances, when faced with threats and a gang of armed men."It is vitally important that we hear from people who may have seen something suspicious or someone acting oddly either round the depot in Vale Road, or in any of the locations where this gang was operating in the time up to the robbery."The raid at the Northern Bank's Belfast headquarters in December 2004 netted £26.5m, making it the biggest cash theft in British and Irish history at the time.
