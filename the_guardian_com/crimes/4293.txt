A coroner announced yesterday that he has asked former doctor Harold Shipman, Britain's most prolific serial killer, to give evidence at the inquests into the deaths of three of his former patients.John Pollard, the south Manchester coroner, has written to Shipman at Frankland prison in Durham, asking him to say in public what he knows about the deaths of Sarah Ashworth, Alice Kitchen and Elizabeth Mellor. News of the letter emerged as Shipman, who was convicted in January of killing 15 women patients with lethal injections of diamorphine, was taken to hospital in Sunderland for an operation on a detached retina. The bodies of Mrs Ashworth, Mrs Kitchen and Mrs Mellor were exhumed in November and December 1998 but Shipman, who practised in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was never accused of killing them. Inquests on all three were opened and adjourned during the murder inquiry. Their names appear with those of 23 other patients on a list compiled by detectives of people who died in Shipman's care but were later cremated. The crown prosecution service decided against further charges because of difficulties in securing a fair trial. The inquests will be held in August and September.
