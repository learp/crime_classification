A seventh man has been jailed in connection with the murder of Banaz Mahmod, 20, who was strangled in January 2006 and her body stored in a suitcase before being driven out of London towards Birmingham, where she was intended to be hidden in a shallow grave. Dana Amin, 33, was convicted at Southwark crown court of perverting the course of justice and preventing the victim's lawful and decent burial, and was jailed for eight years.The court heard that Amin's car, a black Lexus, was used to transport Mahmod's body to the Midlands, where it was discovered in a 6ft grave seven years ago.Her killers, Mahmod Babakir Mahmod, 58, and Ari Mahmod, 57, who were her father and uncle, were jailed for life in July 2007.DCI Glen Lloyd, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: "This has been an incredibly complex and lengthy inquiry which has spanned over seven years. We have always been absolutely determined to bring everyone involved in Banaz Mahmod's murder to justice."Following the conviction of her father and uncle back in 2007 and the two cousins, Ali and Hussain, we knew that Dana Amin believed he had evaded capture."We were determined not to rest until each and every person responsible for this horrendous crime had been apprehended and held to account."There is no such thing as 'honour' in any killing and the men involved in Banaz's murder are no more than cowards." Banaz was a loving, caring, young woman whose life was brutally cut short by the very people who should have loved and protected her - in any terms the ultimate betrayal."
