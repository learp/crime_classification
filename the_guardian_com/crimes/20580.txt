 The killer whose crime led to one of Britain's longest miscarriage of justice cases was finally identified police confirmed that a petty thief whose body was exhumed last month was almost certainly the man who raped and strangled Teresa de Simone 30 years ago.David Lace was 17 when De Simone, 22, a part-time barworker in Southampton, was attacked in her car in December 1979; in 1983 he confessed to Hampshire police that he had committed the murder, before taking his own life in Brixham, Devon, in 1988.But another man, Sean Hodgson, was already serving life for the murder, having also confessed to the attack, along with hundreds of other crimes, some of which never took place.Hodgson, now 58, was released from prison in March after serving 27 years, having pleaded not guilty at his trial. He had insisted throughout his imprisonment that he was innocent.Today, Hampshire police revealed that DNA tests on Lace's remains, which were exhumed from a Portsmouth cemetery last month, showed that there was a "one in a billion" chance that Lace was not the killer."There is no indication, forensically or evidentially, of any third party additional to David Lace is connected to the rape and murder of Teresa de Simone," said Detective Chief Inspector Phil McTavish. "Additionally, his confession, which must now be considered reliable, made no reference to anyone other than himself being present and responsible."The evidence overwhelmingly bears out his involvement in the rape and murder of Teresa de Simone and we are not seeking anyone else in relation to this matter."Julian Young, Hodgson's lawyer, said his client had learned of Lace's confession only last month, adding that an appeal might have been launched "a great deal earlier" had information about the confession been passed on.It emerged during his appeal that DNA evidence which could have proved Hodgson was not the killer was "lost" for 11 years by the Forensics Science Service.He is seeking "very substantial damages", his lawyer said, adding: "If there is any sense of morality and compassion, I would hope that those who have made errors will act to ensure that Sean gets compensation earlier rather than later."An interim compensation payment is being held in court for Hodgson, who has cut a sad and vulnerable figure since his release and recently left hospital."His first thoughts were for the [victim's] family, and he hopes this may provide some closure for them. He also hopes it will totally clear his name, although you cannot undo what has already been done."Detectives who reopened the investigation following Hodgson's release discovered "unrelated documents" containing confessions from seven men, including both Lace and Hodgson. "We are not aware of ... the full rationale for the exclusion of these men from further consideration," McTavish said.Hampshire's deputy chief constable, Simon Cole, said: "It's hugely regrettable that a man spent 27 years in prison for a crime he did not commit." He added that the force was "focused" on "putting right this miscarriage of justice and finding the truth".He said it had not been possible to establish whether the other confessions had been referred to the director of public prosecutions, but "we have no reason to doubt that the inquiry 30 years ago was carried out in good faith".He said the force had voluntarily referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Lace, born David Andrew Williams, spent much of his childhood in care or in children's homes and was convicted of burglary at 15.In September 1983 he had been arrested in connection with a series of burglaries when, said McTavish, "he stated that he wished to tell them about a murder he had committed. He stated that he could no longer live with what he had done and he was better off in prison".The confession appeared to have been disregarded because of "numerous and significant inconsistencies".De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, 77, said the new evidence "does give closure and it is a relief to get it all done. Hopefully, we can all start to move on now."In a way it's hard knowing that [Lace] is not here to answer or explain. But then, at the same time, I think that what he did shows he must have had a conscience."He must have been very troubled. We will never know why he did it."
