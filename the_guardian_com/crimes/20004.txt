Fear of crime is driving Britons to move home, according to new research that found up to 180,000 people a year relocate after becoming victims.Burglaries were the most common reason for selling up, but other people had quit their neighbourhoods after car break-ins, muggings or more violent crimes.The report, from the Institute for Public Policy Research, also shows that the poor, already known to be more likely to suffer crime, are disproportionately more likely to be badly affected by it. After being burgled, people living in council houses were more likely to suffer depression and sleepless nights than owner-occupiers in the same situation.
