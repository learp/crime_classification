Detectives have arrested a third man in connection with allegations of abuse at a former children's home in Jersey.The 45-year-old was detained in the UK over offences alleged to have taken place at the Haut de la Garenne home in the 1970s and 1980s. He was flown back to the island on Thursday and was being questioned at Jersey police headquarters."The States of Jersey police can confirm that a third man has been arrested in connection with the ongoing historical abuse inquiry," a spokeswoman said.Haut de la Garenne became the centre of a major investigation in February and since then more than 100 people have claimed they were abused at the site.Forensic teams uncovered a network of four secret underground chambers where 10 teeth and at least 30 charred human bone fragments have been found.Yesterday's arrest came as detectives said new tests proved "beyond doubt" that these fragments belonged to more than one child. Experts say the teeth were put in the cellar after the 1940s but it is still unclear who they belonged to or how they got there. Tests to age the remains have also proved inconclusive, with estimates ranging from pre-second world war to as recent as the 1970s and 1980s. Police say they have identified around 70 suspects or "people of interest" who they want to question.Gordon Claude Wateridge, 76, originally from Croydon, south London, is charged with three offences of indecent assault on girls under 16, between 1969 and 1979.Another man has been arrested as part of the wider abuse inquiry. Claude Donnelly, 68, of St Brelade, is charged with raping and sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl in Jersey between 1971 and 1974. Neither man has entered a plea.
