The Crown Prosecution Service will announce today whether it will charge a double murderer in the killing of the schoolgirl Milly Dowler eight years ago.Levi Bellfield, a 41-year-old former wheel-clamper and bouncer, was identified as the prime suspect in her murder after being convicted two years ago of killing two women and brutally attacking a third.He was first interviewed over Milly's death several years ago after he was held by the Metropolitan police.The murder of 13-year-old Amanda Dowler, known to her family as Milly, is one of Britain's most high-profile unsolved crimes. She vanished while walking home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, on 21 March 2002.Six months later her remains were found 30 miles away by mushroom pickers in Yateley Heath, Hampshire.Officials at the CPS complex casework unit began considering a huge dossier of police evidence last August. The five files of material, drawn together by Surrey police's Operation Ruby team, include new evidence against Bellfield obtained in December 2008.Officers believe they have compelling circumstantial evidence which links him to the crime.Police continue to search for a red Daewoo Nexia car they believe was used to transport Milly's body. The car was captured on CCTV close to where Milly vanished.Detectives established that Bellfield's former partner Emma Mills owned such as car which she reported stolen four days after Milly's disappearance.
