The family of an off-duty policeman who died after he was attacked on his way home from a night out with friends has been described a "gorgeous son" who brought "love and laughter" into their lives.A murder investigation is under way after PC Gareth Francis was assaulted in Edgeley, Stockport, on Sunday. Three men are being questioned in connection with his death.Two men, aged 20 and 21, from the Stockport area, were arrested on Sunday. A third man, aged 20, handed himself into a police station on Sunday night and was arrested on suspicion of murder, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said.On Monday morning officers were granted further time to question the first two men and have until 5pm to charge them or request more time for questioning.Francis's family said: "Our gorgeous son brought love and laughter into not only our lives, but he was an amazing brother, boyfriend, grandson and nephew. We cannot imagine how we can face each day knowing that he is gone from our lives."Police and emergency services were called to a report of an assault in Castle Street, Edgeley at 1.20am on Sunday, where Francis was found with a serious head injury. He had been walking home after being dropped off by taxi from a night out in Manchester with friends when he was attacked, police said.Paramedics treated him at the scene and he was taken by ambulance to Stepping Hill hospital, where he died shortly afterwards.Detectives are appealing for witnesses to the attack, and a postmortem examination will take place to establish the cause of death.The motive for the attack is unclear but police confirmed they were not treating it as a robbery and did not believe a weapon was used.His colleagues paid tribute to a "dedicated officer" who had been serving with GMP for six years and was stationed at West Didsbury police station, in the south Manchester division.Stockport's divisional commander, Chief Superintendent Chris Sykes, said: "First and foremost, I would like to pass on my condolences to both Gareth's family and his colleagues in south Manchester. Gareth was a dedicated police officer with six years' experience and he will be greatly missed by his colleagues."However, the loss will be even greater for Gareth's family and I would like to reassure them that we have a team of detectives working round the clock now to establish exactly what happened this morning."Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said on Twitter: "My thoughts very much with the family and colleagues of @gmpolice PC Gareth Francis after the shocking news of his death."Ian Hanson, chairman of Greater Manchester police federation, said: "Gareth was a much-loved and well-respected member of the GMP family. We are all distraught at this news. Understandably, his team are devastated. Our immediate thoughts at this time are with his family, friends, colleagues and his partner."Sykes added: "We now have high-visibility patrols in Edgeley town centre, and I would urge anyone with concerns to approach officers there."Anyone with information is asked to call GMP's major incident team on 0161 856 9283, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
