A jealous man who stabbed his wife to death in their kitchen after she admitted an affair, was jailed for nine years today at Winchester crown court.Alisdair Sinclair, 48, who the court heard was a depressive and a controlling husband, stabbed his wife Sally, 40, a senior executive with the Vodafone mobile phone company, more than 40 times with several knives when he "exploded in a frenzy of brutality" after he was told of her infidelity.Sinclair, a former computer consultant, was found guilty of manslaughter through diminished responsibility and not guilty of murder at their rented home in Amport, Hampshire.Judge Guy Boney QC said Mrs Sinclair had done everything she could to support and help her husband who had suffered from depression for more than 10 years.Sinclair, who was obsessed with cleanliness and hoarding cars and clothes, suffered only minor injuries to his hands in the attack, which the prosecution claimed were self-inflicted. He said he was attacked and stabbed by his wife during a violent argument and he thought he was dying.Mrs Sinclair was head of business analysis with Vodafone, based in Newbury, Berkshire. She had told her husband she did not love him any more and wanted a divorce a few weeks before her death."Your wife did everything she could to support and help you and indulge your eccentricities, including spending £100,000 on three cars of the same model you hardly ever used," Boney said."She wanted to make the marriage work and save it from collapse. These efforts cost her her life. Sally Sinclair appears to have coped with, and tolerated, your behaviour over a long period. When she could not take any more of your behaviour you exploded in a frenzy of brutality in reaction to certain information you forced out of her."The judge said that Sinclair's only thought when the attack took place was not fear or hate but that he was dying and that showed he was egotistical and self-absorbed. "You slaughtered your wife – there is no other word appropriate, given the number and severity of the knife wounds received."The judge said he accepted Sinclair's moderate to severe depression played a part in the killing and lessened his criminality.But aggravating features were that the attack had been part-witnessed by children and in May 2006 Sinclair was advised to see his GP because a hospital visit had found him to be a "stressed and anxious man".Robert Fortune QC, defending, said Sinclair was responding to treatment for his mental illness. "He has to live with the knowledge that he killed the woman he undoubtedly loved."
