I'm all awash here. I've just got back, literally an hour ago."He then refused consent and was remanded in custody until next week.Griffin, who was appearing in court on his 40th birthday, was wearing a navy blue Abercrombie and Fitch T-shirt and jeans and repeatedly leaned forward in the dock during the hearing. Stephen Vullo, representing Griffin, told the court Griffin's understanding of the European arrest warrant and other documents relating to his case was "unsatisfactory at this time".Asked whether his client would be consenting today, Vullo said he had not been able either to advise on it or take prepared instructions on it and would therefore be advising Griffin to deny consent.Brian Horn, representing the French judicial authorities, said Griffin was initially arrested on Monday but was rearrested under the European arrest warrant shortly before 4.30pm yesterday . His passport was seized and his fingerprints taken to confirm his identity.Legg's body was found "battered and bruised" by a maid in the bathroom of their Â£1,000-a-night hotel suite last week.The 36-year-old Polish national died from internal bleeding as a result of her injuries, French police said.
