The chief City watchdog yesterday warned that criminals targeting banks and other financial institutions would become increasingly successful without a more determined crackdown.The Financial Services Authority said it had created a dedicated team, drawn from staff working across the organisation, to tackle organised financial crime.FSA boss, John Tiner, said it would become the focus for a more co-ordinated response. Mr Tiner - who announced he will be stepping down as chief executive in July - said a growth in fraud and money laundering had persuaded him of the need.For several years the FSA has come under fire from critics who believe it has neglected its role in tackling fraud. The growth of identity fraud, and allegations of money-laundering by gangs based in eastern Europe and Russia, have been largely pursued by the serious organised crime agency.John Tiner added: "All of us have to recognise that risks in this area inevitably evolve quickly, and our responses have to match them. This is a continuing challenge. As we react to the most recent attacks, so criminals move on. We have to keep raising our game."The government yesterday also signalled its own determination with a re-writing of existing rules to prevent criminals based abroad from laundering funds in the UK. Firms across the financial, accounting and legal sectors, as well as estate agents, insurance brokers and casinos, are already under an obligation to report suspicious transactions, but will now be more closely monitored, chief economic secretary, Ed Balls, said.The directives will require banks and others to investigate the finances of foreign politicians, public officials and their families to ensure their wealth has been legally obtained. Due diligence checks will have to be made on these "politically exposed persons" as part of the crackdown.
