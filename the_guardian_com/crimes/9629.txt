The bodies of a woman and two young children have been found dead at a house.Officers in north Wales were alerted by concerned relatives and forced entry to the property in Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, at around 8pm yesterday.A police spokeswoman said: "Inside the property police discovered the bodies of an adult and two young children. At this early stage it is not possible to state how the occupants died. The coroner and next of kin have been informed."The dead woman, understood to be the mother of the two children, had lived in Trawsfynydd for about 18 months, after moving from nearby Blaenau Ffestiniog.Neighbours said she lived with two boys, aged five and two.Police are at the house conducting forensic examinations, residents said.A woman, who did not want to be named, described the victims as a "happy and pleasant" young family. She said: "Obviously everybody in the village is shocked. But nobody knows yet what has happened. We can see the police going in and out of the house but nobody has said what happened to them."I didn't know her very well because she wasn't from the village and I don't think she had many family here," the neighbour said."But you would see her in the street and she would always say 'hello'. They were a very pleasant family and seemed very happy. It's a terribly sad thing."Gwynedd councillor Thomas Griffith Ellis said: "The death of a mother and young children is a terrible thing but at Christmas it is even more shocking."I didn't know the woman but she lived on the main street, next to the chapel, so I would see her coming and going to the shops. She always said 'hello' as she passed but never stopped to chat."I don't know what has happened, there's been no suggestion why such a terrible thing has happened to a family."
