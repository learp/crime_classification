The trainee teacher who accused the disgraced former Tory MP Neil Hamilton and his wife, Christine, of raping her was jailed for three years yesterday.Judge Simon Smith called Nadine Milroy-Sloan's false claims "a cynical attempt to get fame and money" and said that courts needed to deal firmly with such cases. "It's becoming all too easy for people to sell fake allegations about well-known people to the press," he said at Middlesex Guildhall crown court. As Milroy-Sloan, 29, was led away, she looked tearfully at her husband, who held his head in his hands. She complained to the police in May 2001 that the Hamiltons were part of a group that raped her at a flat in Ilford, Essex. A convicted criminal who later admitted that she had never met the Hamiltons, she was charged after they produced receipts to confirm their alibi for the night of the alleged attack. Last month a jury found her guilty of perverting the course of justice. During her six-week trial Milroy-Sloan apologised, saying it was a case of mistaken identity. Judge Smith said her apology came across as reluctant, pointing out she had made inquiries about the potential windfall from her story. The court heard that she manufactured the story after meeting Barry Lehaney, who told her he was the Hamiltons' chauffeur. He was in fact a disabled pensioner with a criminal record who met Milroy-Sloan in an internet chatroom. Two days before the fabricated attack Milroy-Sloan visited the publicist Max Clifford. She was told she could expect around £100,000 for her story. After the Hamiltons were arrested Milroy-Sloan was paid £50,000 by the News of the World to waive her anonymity. The Hamiltons said they were "pleased and relieved" at the sentence which they said would send the right message.
