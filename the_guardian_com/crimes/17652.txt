The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, today called on the government to help him recruit nearly 14,000 extra officers to bring the number of police in the capital up to New York levels.Mr Livingstone claimed that the decisive factor in former mayor Rudy Giuliani's achievements was a major increase in policing numbers.The London mayor told a summit meeting with Mr Giuliani: "I am calling on the home secretary to work with me to achieve the target of matching New York's police numbers over the next five years, so that by the end of the second term we would have around 41,000 police."He said that "genuine zero tolerance" meant putting more police on the street so that the city feels safer.The full extent of the policing gap between the two cities became clear today with the release of figures showing that the Metropolitan police force has 12,000 fewer officers than the New York police department, despite having a similar budget. The Met has nearly 27,000 officers and its next annual budget of £2.1bn will provide for a further 1,000. But the NYPD, also with a budget of just over £2bn, currently has 38,100 officers. Even that figure is slightly down from the peak of 41,300 under Mr Giuliani.Mr Livingstone said he was already raising the number of police officers and would meet his election promise to recruit an extra 2,000 police in his mayoral term one year early.Richard Barnes, crime spokesman for the Greater London Assembly Conservatives, said: "Londoners will quite rightly be appalled by these figures."New York, with a similar police budget, manages to put over 12,000 more police on its streets. London, with crime soaring, is used to seeing officer strength slashed by a government that simply doesn't care and a police service that excels in financial mismanagement - enough is enough." Mr Barnes also said police officers in New York were paid more.Senior police officers are keen to learn from the New York experience while Mr Giuliani visits London. In the eight years he was mayor of New York crime plunged.Murders fell from 1,927 in 1993 to 643 in 2001, a fall of 66%, with last year's figures the lowest since before President Kennedy's assassination. Rapes fell by 40%, from 3,225 in 1993 to 1,923 in 2001, robbery by 67.5%, assault by 44%, and burglaries by 68%. Muggings and street crime are split between robbery, assault, and grand larcenies - they were down 46% from 85,737 to 45,798 over the eight years. Car theft, including carjackings, fell 73%, from 111,622 in 1993 to 29,640 last year. Crime's fall during the Giuliani years meant that New York went from being rated America's most dangerous large city by the FBI to its safest.The success was credited to CompStat, the computerised system which keeps track of week-by-week crime figures for each precinct, the basic division of the city's police department. Each week's figures are available to the public within a week, meaning locals can track crime trends. While London is still safer than New York, the capital did see a total of 40,000 street robberies, more than 100 a day, last year. Less than one in eight of the offenders were caught and in Lambeth, the worst affected borough it was only one in 20. Some officers say there has been a reluctance to use stop and search powers since the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, for fear of being branded institutionally racist.But in the face of the recent wave of muggings and carjackings, the Met is adopting new tactics. These include the introduction of civilian auxiliaries, a tactic successfully employed in New York. A Met spokesman said it was difficult to compare the two cities: "There are differences in policing London and New York, but obviously we are keen to learn from Mr Giuliani's experience in tackling crime."
