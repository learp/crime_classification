A man has been jailed for 12 months for making a hoax bomb call in an attempt to avoid revealing to his fiancee he'd forgotten to finalise his wedding paperwork. Rather than tell his partner he hadn't filled out the forms required to make their marriage legal, Neil McArdle snuck off to a phone box on his wedding day and called Liverpool register office to tell them there was a bomb due to detonate inside. By the time his wedding party arrived at the venue, it had been evacuated.McArdle was rumbled when staff tried to help rearrange the ceremony but could find no booking. The defence lawyer remarked: "If it was not so serious, the facts of this case have all the markings of a comedy." His fiancee has confirmed she will stick by him.Have you got a story to rival McArdle's? What's the most ludicrous excuse you've come up with to avoid a sticky situation? Tell us in the thread below.
