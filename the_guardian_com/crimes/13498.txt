The British Phonographic Industry, which represents British music companies, is to create a fund of more than Â£100,000 for labels hit by the fire at the Sony DADC warehouse in Enfield, which destroyed more than 1m CDs.Many small companies have been financially crippled by the blaze, losing their entire CD stocks. The centre was the main distribution point for independent labels and stored recordings by leading companies such as XL and Domino, whose artists include Adele and Arctic Monkeys. The fund will enable emergency interest-free loans to replace CDs and vinyl lost in the fire.BPI deputy chairman Mike Batt said: "We want indie labels to get back to normal business as quickly as possible."Distribution company Pias and the Association of Independent Music, which represents small labels, announced a help fund earlier this week.Fans are also being encouraged to download albums from affected labels to help them financially.
