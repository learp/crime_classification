There are good reasons why a criminal trial is set up as the state against the alleged offender, with the victim's role only to tell the truth as a witness if required. Making the victim "pick a punishment" (Violent offenders and burglars in 'tough' justice secretary's sights, 10 October) is making the victim a target for intimidation. The bizarre policies being showcased in Birmingham this week show us that however unpleasant the coalition seems, a majority Conservative government would be far worse.Matthew HuntbachLondon• Chris Grayling says he's on the side of the victim. Not, it would appear, when it comes to compensating them for criminal injuries. Under the government's proposed changes to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, 18,000 people a year who would have received compensation will no longer do so, and a further 13,000 will receive substantially less than under the existing scheme. Gesture politics about burglars cost nothing and are likely to achieve less – small consolation to those who have suffered from violent crime.Jeremy BeechamOpposition justice spokesman, House of Lords• Will Grayling reduce potential inconvenience to his vocal supporters by making it easier to get a shotgun licence, currently a process beset with red tape? This would naturally complement Theresa May's initiative in allowing a victim of crime not merely to decide on the perp's punishment but to carry it out as well.Paul FarrowBirmingham• I've been burgled, but not when in occupation, so I don't know how I'd react. Probably panic and who knows what would ensue. However, I have fantasised that I would remain cool and calm and try to defuse the situation with something like: "Oh, hello. An unexpected guest. How nice! Would you like a cup of tea?" Has anyone ever tried such an approach?Frank JacksonHarlow, Essex
