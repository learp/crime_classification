Unemployed people convicted of crimes should receive tougher sentences than those with full-time jobs or caring responsibilities, a leading Labour MP will say today.John Denham, chair of the influential home affairs select committee, will call for an overhaul of community sentencing to enable courts to mete out tougher punishments for the jobless on the grounds that they have more time on their hands.The former Home Office minister will argue that varying sentences according to an offender's personal circumstances could help restore flagging public confidence in the criminal justice system and ensure more people were kept out of prison by a greater use of community punishments.Mr Denham will tell a conference organised by Policy Review magazine that beefing up community punishments for unemployed people is the equivalent of the courts imposing higher fines for those with higher incomes.A 100-hour community sentence will have far less impact on someone on the dole than their counterpart holding down a full-time job or looking after a family, he will say.Mr Denham's comments are likely to enrage civil liberties campaigners on the grounds that they amount to discrimination against the poor.Speaking to Guardian Unlimited ahead of his speech, Mr Denham defended his "tough agenda" as necessary if the public is to stop viewing community sentencing as a soft option compared with prison."One of the reasons we are sending people to jail is because there is no confidence in the system, but part of the issue is that somebody who has not got a job and is hanging around all day and getting 50-hours' community punishment prompts people to say, 'That's what they work each week,'" he said."If the courts have the ability to adjust the sentence according to the circumstances of the individual this will increase public confidence. This is a tough agenda which would help us divert people from prison."Mr Denham also wants to see offenders subject to community sentences forced to turn up at attendance centres and to wear visible uniform - such as reflective jackets - to identify them when serving their sentence in the community. The proposal to make such offenders wear distinctive uniforms was first mooted last year by the then-home affairs minister Hazel Blears, who is now Labour's chair. The proposal was roundly dismissed at the time by the probation officers' union and Liberty, the civil rights organisation, as a "cheap and nasty gimmick".
