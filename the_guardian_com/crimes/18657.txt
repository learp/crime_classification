History was made this morning by two empty benches in a room at the high court on the Strand in London as the first criminal trial to be held without a jury in England or Wales in over 400 years opened with Mr Justice Treacy acting as both judge and jury."We are breaking history," said Sam Stein, barrister for one of the four men accused of a bungled £1.75m robbery six years ago at Heathrow airport. "This is the first time that a court has started a jury-less trial."Mr Justice Treacy explained that although it was not strictly a legal requirement, he had decided to adopt the normal procedure by which juries are formally given responsibility for a case.Instead of reading out all 18 charges as she would have done for a jury, the court clerk merely asked him to confirm that he had seen the indictment, and then told him that all four defendants had pleaded not guilty, and it was in his charge to determine whether they were guilty or not.Simon Russell Flint QC, prosecuting, said the defendants – John Twomey, and Glen Cameron, both from New Milton, Hampshire; Barry Hibberd from Shepherd's Bush, London; and Peter Blake from Notting Hill, London – were among six masked men, all wearing high-visibility jackets and dark woollen hats, who entered the Menzies World Cargo warehouse at Heathrow on 6 February 2004.He described it as "a professionally planned and professionally executed armed robbery", with inside information from somebody who worked or had worked in and around the airport, in which firearms were used to threaten 16 employees, who were then tied up. One was shot at, allegedly by Blake, as he tried to escape before being overpowered.The gang expected to find £10m on the premises, but misread a delivery manifest and instead got only £1.75m, in various currencies.The police, Flint said, had been aware since the previous year that something was planned, and had kept watch on those they suspected of being involved.Last year the four accused lost the last in a series of legal challenges to stop the trial going ahead under powers introduced in the 2003 Criminal Justice Act. The appeal court ruled in June – after considering secret evidence – that the danger of jury tampering was "very significant".This is the fourth trial relating to the Heathrow case, which has already racked up more than 10 times the proceeds of the robbery in legal costs.During the first trial Twomey suffered a heart attack; in the second the jury was reduced from 12 to nine and was unable to reach a decision; the third trial was abandoned nearly halfway through, after the judge said information had been received which pointed to "a serious attempt a jury tampering". The prosecution then applied for a trial without jury.Trials without juries have been held in Northern Ireland since 1972, named "Diplock courts" after the law lord who recommended them as a way of avoiding jury intimidation at the height of the Troubles, and some Scottish trials are heard before a sheriff.
