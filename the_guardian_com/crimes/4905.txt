Three people have appeared in court accused of trying to blackmail Coleen Rooney after she lost her mobile phone.Lee Platt, 28, Jennifer Green, 25, and Steven Malcolm, 42, are charged with blackmail and handling stolen goods.All three appeared at Manchester magistrates court for a brief hearing where they were jointly charged with both offences. No pleas were entered.Rooney and her Manchester United and England footballer husband Wayne were subject to a demand of £5,000 with menaces.It is understood that Rooney accidentally left her camera at the Manchester Evening News Arena when the couple attended a concert by US band the Black Eyed Peas in May last year. Platt, from Blackley, Manchester, appeared in court from custody. Green, from the same address and Malcolm, also from Manchester, appeared on bail.Jenny Baines, prosecuting, told magistrates a charge of blackmail could only be dealt with by a crown court and asked the bench to send the case to the upper court.Green and Malcolm were given unconditional bail and Platt was remanded back into custody, with all three to appear at Manchester crown court on 4 July.A court list gave further details of the charges the three defendants face, though they were not read out in court. The written court papers said the alleged blackmail offence happened between 13 August 2010 and 11 September 2010.The papers added: "With a view to gain for yourself or another or with intent to cause loss to another made an unwarranted demand of £5,000 from Wayne and Coleen Rooney, with menaces."The papers indicated that blackmail was an indictable only offence. It could not be dealt with by JPs and had to go before a judge and jury at crown court. The second charge was listed as receiving stolen goods, rather than handling, between 23 May 2010 and 13 August 2010. It related to a Samsung digital camera phone of a value unknown, belonging to Rooney.
