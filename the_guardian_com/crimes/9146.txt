The daughters of a 96-year-old woman who died after her bed was set alight in a care home have appealed for information over her "horrific" death.Edith Stuart died in hospital after the blaze at Cleveleys Park rest home in Lancashire on 18 October last year. Lancashire police are treating the incident as murder.Stuart's daughters Jean Worgan and Shirley Fish have appealed for information to help find those responsible.Fish, from Poulton, Lancashire, said: "They set fire to mum's bed and walked away, leaving her there. It must have been so frightening. She must have been terrified. These are the thoughts that go through our minds. I would beg that person to give themselves up. It would help all of us."My mum would have been 97 in two weeks' time. She was really happy, really content. She was looking forward to being 100 years old. She wanted a telegram from the Queen."Two women aged 27 and 17 were held on suspicion of murder but released without charge days later.Worgan, of Northampton, said the family had taken a lot of thought over choosing a care home for Stuart when she moved out of her Burnley home at 92.Worgan described the care home as a "very homely place" where all her mother's needs were taken care of."It's been very hard," she added. "The fire, the burns and the smoke inhalation didn't kill her straight away. She lived for 30 hours." She said they couldn't hold her hand or hug her. All they could do was touch her cheek and let her know they were there for her."Whoever deliberately went in and murdered my mother needs help," Worgan said. "It isn't so much punishment, it's help they need. This person might get depressed or bored, they might think they can do it again and someone else's family might have to suffer like we are."
