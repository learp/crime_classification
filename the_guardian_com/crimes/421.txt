The court was told that early in the spring term of 2002 Maxine Carr took up a position as a voluntary support assistant at St Andrew's primary school, which was attended by Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.She then became a temporary part time assistant, working with year five pupils. When a full time position was advertised she applied. On July 23, two days before the end of term and a few weeks before Holly and Jessica disappeared, she was told her application had not been successful and at the final school assembly it was announced she would be leaving. She had got to know Holly and Jessica. The jury was told she had a "particular affinity" with Holly, who "really liked" her. She told the children to call her Maxine rather than Miss Carr. Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, told the jury that on the last day of term another teacher saw Holly approach Ms Carr and give her a card. The teacher noticed that Holly had called her Maxine and said: "See you around". It later emerged that Holly had also given Ms Carr a box of chocolates. Mr Latham said another teacher at the school, Joy Pederson, had noted that Ms Carr seemed unable to create "an appropriate distance" between her and the pupils, though the prosecution put this down to inexperience rather than "anything sinister". The jury was given details of what Ms Carr said she and Mr Huntley discussed during phone conversations during the weekend of the girls' disappearance when Ms Carr was 110 miles from Soham in Grimsby visiting her mother. During one conversation she told him she was "nipping round the corner to look at a band". His response was that she had not told him she was going out. She said she then sent him a text message saying: "Don't make me feel bad that I'm with my family". There was no reply. The jury was told Ms Carr lived with Mr Huntley at 5 College Close, the caretaker's house at Soham village college. They had a German shepherd dog called Sadie.
