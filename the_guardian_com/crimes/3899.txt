Police investigating the stabbing of a teenager at a Birmingham school were yesterday seeking three youths in connection with the attack, which comes three days after the launch of a nationwide knife amnesty to reduce knife crime.The 14-year-old boy, a pupil at Heartlands High in Birmingham, was attacked yesterday afternoon. He was treated at the scene for injuries and shock before being taken to City Hospital, where he was last night in a stable condition.Officers from West Midlands police carried out forensic examinations and inquiries at the school in Nechells, Birmingham.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Robinson, the senior investigating officer, said: "We currently are looking for three young lads. This is an isolated incident."He declined to comment on claims that the victim, who is said to speak poor English, was stabbed as a group of youths played football on parkland.Heartland High is in a neighbourhood with widespread social deprivation, according to the most recent Ofsted inspection. It has 622 pupils, aged between 11 and 16, and a large proportion are from ethnic minority communities.The stabbing comes days after a national knife amnesty was launched - a regional one in the West Midlands has seen 1,600 bladed weapons surrendered since March - and nine days after Kiyan Prince, 15, died after he was attacked outside the gates of his London school. A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder.Another teenager, Christopher Alaneme, 18, received fatal knife wounds in Sheerness, Kent, earlier this year, and the search is still underway for the men who killed Nisha Patel Nasri, 29, a volunteer police officer, outside her London home.The national amnesty, which started on Wednesday, runs until June 30.
