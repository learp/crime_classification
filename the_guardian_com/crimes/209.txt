A leading choirmaster and his ex-wife have been convicted of indecently assaulting a former music student more than 30 years ago.A jury at Manchester crown court found Michael Brewer, 68, guilty of sexually abusing the victim in his office at Chetham's school of music in Manchester when she was aged 14 and 15.His former wife, Kay Brewer, 68, was also convicted of indecently assaulting the same victim when she was an adult at their then family home.The jury of six men and five women is continuing to deliberate over an allegation that Brewer raped the victim when she was 18 and that his wife aided and abetted the rape.Brewer was cleared of indecently assaulting the victim as a child in his home.One of the defendants' four daughters audibly gasped from the public gallery when the jury returned its verdict on Kay Brewer.The sole complainant in the case said she was abused by Brewer when she visited his office. The jury was told she did not consider it sexual abuse at the time and did not make an official complaint.In a separate incident, Brewer quit Chetham's in 1994 after an inappropriate relationship with a 17-year-old girl. She regularly visited his office and recalled he would persuade her to take off her top and bra and he would fondle her, the court heard.Giving evidence, Brewer admitted to the 1994 affair. The full extent of the relationship was covered up because he resigned.Brewer went on to become the artistic director of the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain and has directed the World Youth Choir. He also served as an adjudicator in international competitions and in 2008 led BBC workshops for the programme Last Choir Standing.When interviewed by police, both defendants dismissed the charges against them as "completely untrue".Giving evidence, both Michael Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, and Kay Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, denied they had ever had any sexual contact with the complainant.
