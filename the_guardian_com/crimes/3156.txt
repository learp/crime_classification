More than 400 police officers raided homes across England today in a major operation to bust an international network of crack cocaine dealers.The network smuggles the drug into London from Jamaica before taking it by train to Middlesbrough, where it is then distributed across the north-east of England.The earliest raids took place in Ilford, Essex, and Hackney, east London, at 3am. They were followed by 6am swoops on addresses in Teesside, and the operation, led by Cleveland police, also involved raids in the West Midlands, North Yorkshire, County Durham and Northumbria.A woman in her late 20s was arrested after a quantity of crack cocaine was discovered at a flat in Essex Street, Middlesbrough.Officers said the raids, which followed up an operation aimed at taking out street level dealers last September, was aimed at the masterminds behind the crack cocaine network."Today's action strikes at the very heart of a lucrative drugs network," the Cleveland police chief constable, Sean Price, said. "The aim is to take out not just street level dealers, but the masterminds behind this evil trade. This sends out a clear message that those who try to bring drugs into our communities will be arrested - there is no hiding place." Det Insp Dave Lamplough, of Cleveland police's organised crime unit, said the "vast majority of people being targeted" in the raids were Jamaican. "Although the gang had their base in Teesside, the main co-ordinators of the operation were in London," he added. "We have hammered away at the bottom end in the past, but this time we have the information we need to target key people. We are taking out the whole network." He said the gang had imported drugs into the UK from Jamaica through a string of mainly female couriers.
