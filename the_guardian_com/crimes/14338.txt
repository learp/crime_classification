Harold Shipman was accused yesterday of being "quite wicked" in attributing a drug habit to an 81-year-old widow he is alleged to have murdered.Richard Henriques QC told the GP that he had referred to possible drug abuse in false computer records he had created for Kathleen Grundy to explain why morphine would be found in her exhumed body. Shipman is alleged to have killed Mrs Grundy with an injection of diamorphine in June last year and forged her Â£386,000 will to leave him as the sole beneficiary. Mrs Grundy was found dead in her home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, less than four hours after Shipman visited her to take a blood sample. Shipman, who certified death as due to old age, said that he now accepted her death was from morphine poisoning. "It follows she had it administered or took it herself some time between when I saw her and when she was found dead," he said. He said he had never prescribed diamorphine - the clinical name for heroin - for Mrs Grundy, a former mayoress of Hyde. When asked if it was possible that she had driven to some drug dealers, obtained diamorphine, driven home and administered it to herself, Shipman said: "I don't think it's my role to ascertain where the diamorphine came from." Asked if he had really suspected an 81-year-old woman of taking drugs, Shipman said he could not remember it in a woman of that age but medical magazines suggested "it was appearing on the scene". Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, denies killing 15 women patients and forging Mrs Grundy's will. The trial continues.
