At least 150 serious offenders were among the foreign criminals released by the Home Office without being considered for deportation, the new home secretary, John Reid, revealed today.This is almost twice as many as the 79 who were previously described as serious offenders by the Home Office, which is urgently trying to trace more than 1,000 foreign prisoners who should have faced possible deportation.Mr Reid, speaking on his first day in his new job, admitted that the final figure of serious offenders may increase to "several hundred" if armed robbers are included in the most serious criminals category.He was speaking as he visited Fratton police station in Portsmouth where the main incident room has been established in the operation to trace the foreigners involved in failures in deportation procedures between 1999 and March this year.Mr Reid said 75 in the most serious category of offender had now been found, detained or were under surveillance. His predecessor as home secretary, Charles Clarke, was sacked last week over the fiasco, which emerged just before last week's local elections. The elections brought disastrous results for the Labour government.Before his departure on Friday, Mr Clarke confirmed that five of the serious offenders had gone on to commit further crimes since their release. There were also two allegations of rape - one of which is still being investigated by the police - and a further allegation of serious sexual assault.
