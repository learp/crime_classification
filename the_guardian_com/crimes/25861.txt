For about an hour yesterday, the former IRA prisoner Colin Duffy was technically a free man after the lord chief justice of Northern Ireland ruled that his detention, and that of five other accused men, was unlawful.But before the prominent North Armagh republican had the chance to walk out of Antrim police station he was arrested once more and sent back to be questioned about the murder of two British soldiers in the town this month.Duffy, 41, remains a suspect in the inquiry into the killing of sappers Patrick Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, who were shot on 7 March by a Real IRA gang outside the Massereene army barracks. In a day of legal drama played out in two courthouses, Lord Justice Brian Kerr, freeing Duffy and the five other murder suspects, told Belfast high court that a judge who had granted an extension to their detention at the weekend should have examined the legality of their original arrests on 14 March. Meanwhile, in Lisburn, magistrates charged a second man with the murder of PC Stephen Carroll, the first member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be killed by terrorists, who was shot dead in Craigavon by a Continuity IRA sniper.The man charged, former Sinn FÃ©in councillor Brendan McConville, also faced charges of possessing an AKM assault rifle and 26 rounds of ammunition. He and a 17-year-old are the only suspects charged with the officer's murder. As the five others were released after Kerr's judgment, Duffy's solicitor, Pat Vernon, said his client was back in custody under anti-terrorism legislation.In a ruling that could have implications for UK anti-terror laws allowing 28-day detentions, the judge had overturned a court order granting the police further time to question the suspects over the murders of Azimkar, Quinsey and Carroll.Speaking outside Antrim police station, Vernon said yesterday: "We understand [Duffy] has been rearrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act." Last night Northern Ireland's security minister, Paul Goggins, said that Kerr's ruling would not undermine the security forces' power to hold terror suspects for up to 28 days, and the PSNI inquiry into the double murder was still active.
