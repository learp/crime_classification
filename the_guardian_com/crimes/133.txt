The number of sites contaminated in the public health alert linked to the death of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko has doubled to around 12, it was revealed today.The home secretary, John Reid, told the Commons the number was likely to rise again.Also today, a spokesman for the former Russian prime minister Yegor Gaidar, who fell badly ill after attending a conference in Ireland, said doctors believe he was deliberately poisoned."Doctors don't see a natural reason for the poisoning, and they have not been able to detect any natural substance known to them [in his body]," Valery Natarov said.Mr Gaidar fell ill at a conference on Friday and returned to Moscow earlier this week. Irish doctors initially suspected the 50-year-old's ailment was connected to his diabetes.Updating MPs about the inquiry into the death of Mr Litvinenko, who died of radiation poisoning last Thursday, Mr Reid stressed that the risks to public health were "very low indeed".He said the number of people who had contacted NHS Direct over radiation fears now stood at 1,325. In total, 68 people had been referred to the Health Protection Agency (HPA), with 24 going on to receive specialist assessment.However, there have been no reports of anyone linked with the inquiry, apart from Mr Litvinenko, becoming seriously ill because of radiation.Mr Reid also revealed that two more aircraft, both Russian, could be of interest to the investigation. Shortly after his statement, officials cleared one of them, a plane leased by the Russian airline Transaero, which flew from Moscow to Heathrow earlier today.Five planes have now been linked to the investigation, including, it emerged yesterday, three British Airways Boeing 767s. Very small traces of radiation were found in two of the BA aircraft, which are also at Heathrow.The third BA plane is currently at an airport in Moscow, and is expected to be examined for radiation soon. Mr Reid did not give any details about the fifth aircraft that he said could be of interest, other than to say it was Russian.Russia's transport ministry today announced increased radiation checks on international flights and at international airports across the country.Friends of Mr Litvinenko - who, on his deathbed, accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of being behind his death - said news of radiation being found on planes backed their claims that radioactive material had been brought from Moscow to London to kill him.Mr Putin and the Russian security services have denied involvement, and Mr Reid said Russian authorities "up to the highest levels" had given assurances of cooperation with the investigation.Up to 33,000 people have travelled on the three affected BA aircraft since late October, with most of those flights to Moscow.There has been no official explanation as to why the BA aircraft could have been affected by radiation, and it is not thought Mr Litvinenko had been a passenger on any of them.There has been speculation that someone or some people who came into contact with the Russian dissident either before or after he became unwell could have travelled by plane. Police are particularly interested in a flight from Moscow to London on October 25.It is known that Mr Litvinenko met two Russian contacts, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, at the Millennium hotel in London's West End on November 1, the day he fell ill. Mr Lugovi, a former KGB bodyguard, has said people have been trying to frame him as the poisoner.Police have described the death as suspicious, but have not launched a murder inquiry.Mr Reid did not give details of the new locations at which scientists had discovered traces of radiation.However, it has already been established that traces of the radioactive isotope that poisoned Mr Litvinenko were found at buildings including his home and the two hospitals at which he was treated."Police continue to trace possible witnesses and examine Mr Litvinenko's movements at relevant times," Mr Reid said. "It is probable that the investigation will continue to bring additional locations to our attention for screening."In other developments, the inquest into the death of the 43-year-old was formally opened and adjourned today to allow detectives to carry out further inquiries into his apparent poisoning.The London inner north coroner, Andrew Reid, said it appeared Mr Litvinenko had been "exposed to a radioactive substance or isotope known as polonium 210".Sitting at St Pancras coroner's court, he confirmed that the post-mortem examination on Mr Litvinenko would take place at the Royal London hospital in the presence of an independent pathologist tomorrow.
