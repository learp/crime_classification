A serial escaper who was stopped by a rugby-tackling judge has been jailed for life.Paul Reid, 34, changed his plea to guilty rather than face Judge Douglas Marks Moore in court.After being sentenced by Judge Jeremy Roberts at the Old Bailey on two counts of rape and two of escaping, Reid was led from the dock by prison officers.Roberts went on to praise his fellow judge's actions. He said it was usual for bravery to be rewarded with a cash payment â€“ but it would not do for one judge to financially reward another."I am equally sure that the public would wish me to express their appreciation of his extremely brave and public-spirited action, going well beyond the call of duty in preventing the escape of an extremely dangerous man."He revealed that Marks Moore, 60, hurt his shoulder after twice wrestling with Reid as he tried to flee the court where he was being tried for the rape offences."He hurt his shoulder during the struggle but later shrugged that off when asked about it," Roberts said.He set the minimum term at six years and three months, in line with sentencing guidelines, but stressed that he considered Reid to be extremely dangerous and unlikely to be released for some time.
