Racist attacks have risen slightly in the Huyton area during tensions after the London bombings, but prompt police action supported by local MP Eddie O'Hara and councillors appears to have kept trouble largely in check. Minor vandalism and some abuse has been targeted at the main ethnic minority community on the other side of the suburb from the park where Anthony Walker was killed.The outbreaks are part of a national trend which has seen a special police hotline set up in London after a long downward trend in attacks was abruptly reversed following July 7. Racist and religious hate incidents rose to 20 a day in the first week and a peak of 60 a day after a fortnight, with over 800 recorded in the capital by yesterday.The murder of Kamal Raza Butt, a 48-year-old visitor from Pakistan, in Nottingham on July 11 is being treated as racist, and in Hull police are being asked to investigate allegations that a rotting pig's head was placed on the bonnet of a Muslim man's car.In Portsmouth an 18-year-old Iraqi was slashed in the neck with a broken bottle on Saturday evening in what police described as an "extremely violent racist attack" by a black man in his 20s. A young Albanian man who was with the Iraqi was also injured but not seriously.Police in North Wales have recorded 64 racist incidents since the suicide bombings against 20 during the same period last year. Two workers at a restaurant in the Warwickshire village of Atherstone were injured in a racist attack. In Edinburgh, as in many other areas with sizeable ethnic minority communities, police have taken precautionary measures and toured mosques and other possible targets to check on security arrangements.There has been minor damage to mosques in Birkenhead, Telford and Bristol as well as London.
