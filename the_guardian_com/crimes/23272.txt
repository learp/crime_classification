The former union boss Sir Bill Morris yesterday emerged as the favourite to lead an investigation into the Metropolitan police and racism.Mr Morris, who retired last month as head of the Transport and General Workers Union, has been asked to lead the Metropolitan Police Authority inquiry set up after the Met's efforts to secure criminal convictions against a senior ethnic minority officer failed twice. Superintendent Ali Dizaei was cleared of corruption at the Old Bailey in September, sparking accusations from black officers that he had been the victim of a racist witch hunt by the force. Sir Bill has met various people to discuss the post, including the MPA chairman, Lord Toby Harris, along with the Police Federation and the Black Police Association. The MPA inquiry will focus on whether the Met is more likely to subject ethnic minority officers to disciplinary investigations than white officers. It will also examine grievance procedures. It is understood that Sir Bill has yet to decide whether to head the inquiry, which is seen as a crucial step to rebuilding confidence in the force. He is expected to meet prospective members of an advisory panel soon. The MPA hopes that public hearings will start before Christmas. "Any inquiry would have to have a credible chairperson," said Lee Jasper, adviser on race and policing to London's mayor.
