A former detective accused of shielding the murderers of Stephen Lawrence in return for bribes yesterday denied any wrongdoing.A BBC programme last week claimed that John Davidson, a senior detective on the first investigation into the 1993 racist killing, had had a corrupt relationship with Clifford Norris, the gangster father of one of the prime suspects for the murder. In a statement Mr Davidson said: " I am not corrupt. I did not hamper in any way the investigation into the death of Stephen Lawrence." He said he had found the allegations "extremely upsetting".
