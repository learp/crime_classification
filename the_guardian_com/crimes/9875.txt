The death of Damilola Taylor swiftly developed from a harrowing human interest story into a national debate about street crime and the policing of inner cities that reverberates to this day.A thread runs from the moment Damilola died in a stairwell on the North Peckham estate to the home secretary's announcement last week to grant courts new powers to lock up hundreds of persistent teenage offenders and to put child offenders into protective custody.Eighteen months ago, with law and order issues driving the news agenda in the run up to the 2001 general election, the case had enormous impact at Westminster.Two days after the murder, Tony Blair told the Commons that the attack was "appalling and brutal" and pledged to "do everything we possibly can to bring the killers to justice".Jack Straw, then home secretary, condemned the immoral "walk on by society" and said it was time everyone took a stand against crime and yobbish behaviour.The growing culture of thuggery, bullying and violence had to be confronted, the home secretary said. "I am not talking about 'having a go' or getting involved in a potentially dangerous situation. But people do have a responsibility to report crimes and help the police in their work to tackle crime."Within weeks, William Hague, then the Tory leader, was accused of "playing the race card" for writing an article - under the provocative headline "Where was Jack Straw when Damilola died?" - which linked Damilola's death with the shortage of beat constables. The article also tied the fallout from the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence, which haunted the Damilola trial, to Labour policies.The investigation was a wake up call for the police at a time when street crime was on the cusp of a huge surge. Their inquiries highlighted the virulent teenage gang culture that exists in some deprived areas and focused attention on the difficulty of getting some known offenders into court.Because of the public outcry, Damilola Taylor's death was a turning point for policymakers who have been under constant pressure in the last 18 months to provide solutions to soaring street crime.In London, the number of muggings has risen by almost 40% in the last year.Similar increases have been recorded in other regional forces.Police say that most of the crimes are committed by teenagers stealing mobile phones and small amounts of cash - the motives that probably drove a gang of teenagers to stop Damilola.The Met recently launched a Safer Streets Initiative in some of the capital's worst affected boroughs and is pushing ahead with a scheme to use hundreds of police "auxiliaries" to provide high visibility reassurance to communities.There have also been calls for action on urban regeneration to ensure that depressing estates like the North Peckham are never built again.
