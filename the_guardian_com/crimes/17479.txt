A 12-year-old girl yesterday admitted inflicting actual bodily harm on a five-year-old boy who disappeared from his back garden and was later found with red ligature-type marks around his neck.The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also admitted a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice when she appeared before Dewsbury youth court in West Yorkshire.The boy was found in a distraught state outside a fish and chip shop after a search by his family. He was alone and had bruising on his body as well as the marks around his neck following the attack in a wood in the town in May this year.The terrified boy told his cousin: "Someone tied a rope around my neck and tried to tie me to a tree."At an earlier hearing, the court heard that Home Office pathologist Christopher Milroy confirmed that "firm pressure" had been applied to the boy's neck and throat with a length of string.Mr Milroy said: "If applied for a few seconds longer, there is a strong likelihood that [the boy] would have died."The court heard that the girl had a previous caution for actual bodily harm in November last year. But prosecutor Mehran Nassiri said she was not regarded as a persistent offender.The girl admitted lying to police between May 31 and June 3 by claiming four other children were involved in the attack - leading to their arrest and detention. They later gave foolproof alibis that proved their innocence.In a police interview, the girl told officers: "[The boy] was behind me. I didn't ask him to come with me. I was angry with him. I put a rope around him and put it around a tree."At some point, a rope was wrapped around his neck, stomach and genitals, the court heard.Magistrates asked for pre-sentence reports and the girl will be sentenced in September.She was granted conditional bail on the understanding that she does not make contact with prosecution witnesses.
