A hunt intensified last night for four masked gunmen who burst into an Indian takeaway restaurant in Leeds and shot dead a customer.The 34-year-old victim was hit moments after he bought a curry in the Shah Jahan Indian Cuisine in the Harehills area on Friday night. He attempted to escape his killers by running back inside the building and hiding in the kitchen, but the gang followed him inside and shot him at least four times. Detectives said the offenders were all male, and dressed in dark sports clothing with hoods. Their faces concealed by balaclavas.The attack happened shortly after 11.30pm. Detective Superintendent Steve Payne, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Sometimes people find it difficult to come forward with information but this was a cold-blooded killing and we do need to catch the people who are responsible for this.'
