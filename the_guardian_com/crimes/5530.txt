A former US marine has been sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for abducting and sexually assaulting a 12-year-old British girl he contacted over the internet.Toby Studabaker, from Michigan, appeared before a federal judge in the city of Kalamazoo yesterday after pleading guilty last November to charges of possessing child pornography and transporting a child across international borders for the purpose of sexual exploitation.The girl's disappearance in July 2003 triggered alarm in the UK about the safety of the internet and prompted an international manhunt for Studabaker. He had flown into Manchester to meet the girl and then took her to Paris.The former serviceman, who had been decorated for a tour of duty in Afghanistan, was eventually arrested in Frankfurt, Germany, on his way to surrender at the US consulate, hours after the girl flew back to England from Stuttgart.The US attorney's office in Grand Rapids said yesterday that Studabaker was given a concurrent sentence of seven years and three months on the child pornography count and 11 years and four months for the assault. In 2004, he was jailed in Manchester for 4Â½ years after admitting charges of abduction and gross indecency in the same case. He was extradited to the United States on his release. His victim, from Greater Manchester, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, went missing in July 2003 after she told her parents she was going shopping with friends.She had, in fact, met Studabaker at Manchester airport and travelled on to London and Paris before going on to Strasbourg and Stuttgart. Studabaker had claimed that he believed the girl was aged 19. At the end of the trial in Manchester, the judge, Mr Justice Leveson, said that Studabaker had, through the internet, "groomed an impressionable child into a relationship with the result that she practised a deception on her family, she left her home and travelled with you to France, and then on to Germany".
