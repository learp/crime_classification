A mother-of-three was today jailed for two years for falsely claiming she had been harassed and raped by an unknown stalker, despite protests from her family and anti-rape campaigners that she had been telling the truth.More than 60 people had written to the judge at Bristol crown court insisting that Gail Sherwood, a former childminder and dog breeder, had not invented the story and that they believed there was a dangerous sex attacker free in Gloucestershire.Maureen Till, a friend, had told the hearing Sherwood had been the victim of a "despicable" miscarriage of justice.But sentencing, Judge Julian Lambert said Sherwood's "perverted mind" had invented a "malicious fantasy world". She was a "cunning and highly deceitful" woman responsible for a "huge waste" of police resources, he said.Sherwood, 52, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice after a six-week trial. She twice claimed she had been raped at beauty spots in Gloucestershire, prompting police investigations. She also told detectives she had received strange calls, had been followed home, and that flowers had been left at her door.But police began to doubt her and launched a covert surveillance operation that the prosecution said proved she was making the attacks up. Simon Morgan, prosecuting, told the court that "many hundreds" of police hours had been spent investigating Sherwood's claims and the trial had cost Â£100,000.In mitigation, Alan Kent QC said that even since her conviction the stalker had continued to plague Sherwood, who lives with two teenage daughters and a partner in Thrupp, near Stroud in Gloucestershire. On Wednesday someone had broken into the family home, set off a burglar alarm and disturbed ornaments, Kent said. A hooded figure in a nearby field had been captured on the family's CCTV cameras.Kent said that Sherwood "could have taken the easy option", told police she had lied and escaped with a caution or conditional discharge, but "she decided she would stand up and tell the truth".Outside court the campaign group Women Against Rape criticised the police and the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing the case. It claimed Gloucestershire police had made mistakes.The group said it was "alarmed" at the number of women being prosecuted for false allegations of rape, and that it intends to campaign to have Sherwood released.Detective Chief Inspector Paul Shorrock, the senior investigating officer, said the police and CPS had dedicated significant resources to the case before concluding the rapist did not exist.He said one reason why they prosecuted Sherwood was to reassure other people living nearby that there was no stalker on the loose.
