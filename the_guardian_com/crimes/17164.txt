Scotland is set to install the first woman lord advocate in its history after Elish Angiolini was yesterday nominated for the post by the first minister, Jack McConnell.Ms Angiolini, 46, who has served as solicitor general for five years, is to replace Colin Boyd, who unexpectedly quit as the head of the prosecution system after six years in the job. Her nomination must be approved by the Scottish parliament and the Queen.At a press conference in Edinburgh, Ms Angiolini said: "There is still a great deal to be done to ensure that, as Nelson Mandela says, prosecutors defend the rights of the weakest and the worst amongst us. That independence of approach to prosecution is something I hope I will be able to continue, and to ensure that the independence of the prosecution and the integrity of those processes is upheld consistently, as it has been done by my predecessors."Mr McConnell said he wanted her to continue reforming the courts and justice service so that "the rights and interests of victims and witnesses are considered at the heart of our justice service". He appointed Ms Angiolini to her previous position of solicitor general and said it had been "one of the best decisions I have made as first minister of Scotland".Lord Boyd resigned on Wednesday after a tenure that began with the trial of two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing. His exit was overshadowed by the fallout from the Shirley McKie fingerprint case, though he insisted the row had nothing to do with his resignation.
