The government today revived controversial plans to dock housing benefit for antisocial families, despite dropping the idea as unworkable only two years ago.Pressure groups reacted with alarm to a call for "financial penalties" for unruly neighbours, under the latest proposals in the prime minister's crusade for respect in society.Tony Blair's respect action plan called for tough measures against tenants who have been evicted but then refuse to take up offers of help to change their behaviour.It said: "Sanctions could include financial penalties or housing benefit measures. This would provide a very strong incentive to encourage these households to undertake rehabilitation when they have refused other offers of help."This refloats an idea first put forward by former welfare reform minister Frank Field to cut benefit to antisocial tenants. The government initially supported the measure but then dropped it in 2004 after being warned by the Local Government Association that it was the "worst kind of knee-jerk reaction to a complex problem".The homelessness charity Shelter said reviving the idea would undermine efforts to change antisocial behaviour.A spokesman said: "The purpose of housing benefit is to help low-income households with their housing costs, not as a tool in the fight against antisocial behaviour."The action plan also proposed extending powers to close crack houses to cover homes that are a constant focus of antisocial behaviour. These temporary closure orders would cover privately owned dwellings as well as council and housing association properties.Shami Chakrabarti, from the civil rights group Liberty, said the idea was counterproductive."When forcing people out of their homes is the latest gimmick, it's time to consider what 'Asbomania' is doing to this country," she said."The vulnerable are swept up with the guilty, and naming and shaming is rampant. The prime minister batters the values of British justice and calls it 'respect'."Elsewhere in the action plan the government backed less draconian measures aimed at tackling the causes of antisocial behaviour.It called for more schemes like the Dundee Families Project, which helps antisocial tenants to change their behaviour. It noted that the support provided had helped to avoid the eviction of several problem tenants.But speaking on the BBC's Today programme, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, said eviction should still be considered as a last resort."At the end of the day - and of course it is at the end of the day, after a lot of other process - I think eviction is an appropriate thing to be considered," he said.Shelter's director, Adam Sampson, said: "The government must focus on helping persistent offenders to change bad behaviour for good rather than simply moving the problem on to another set of neighbours, unresolved."
