A 20-year-old British mother accused of strangling her newborn son moments after giving birth in a hotel room in Crete appeared in court today. Leah Andrew, from Hither Green, south-east London, appeared before a magistrate in Heraklion, the island's capital, charged with infanticide. The prosecutor's office said the magistrate would decide later today whether she would be released on bail. Police found the dead baby, weighing 5lb 8oz, in a room in the Natali hotel, Malia, in the early hours of Monday morning. A coroner said the baby, which was discovered wrapped in sheets, showed signs of suffocation. Police took Andrew from Iraklion University Hospital to give evidence at today's hearing. She was being kept under police guard at the hospital, where she was taken after suffering extensive bleeding. Police denied she was put on suicide watch and said she was being guarded by two officers simply because she was under arrest. Andrew had been out on Sunday night with her 24-year-old sister, Lydia, and a friend. It is understood she had not told them she was pregnant, despite being just two weeks short of her due date. She returned to the hotel at around 3.30am, where she gave birth alone. Police said that when the sister and friend arrived at the room they saw a sheet with something inside. They did not open it but called the police. It is believed Andrew has two sons, aged three and 15 months, who are being looked after by her parents. Andrew's friends have all returned to the UK but her sister is still in Crete with her and it is thought her parents may fly out to be with her in the next few days.In Greece, infanticide does not carry a life sentence, unlike murder.
