A badly burnt body of a man dumped in a layby was missing its head and limbs, police have revealed.The torso is thought to have been contained in a suitcase discovered in a parking area off the A628, just east of Tintwistle, Derbyshire.A member of the public made the grim discovery off the busy transpennine route near the village on the edge of the Peak District national park at 12.30pm on Monday.Police believe the remains were left in the layby, which is popular with dog walkers and ramblers, between 9pm and midnight on the previous day.The man’s identity is still unknown as DNA recovered from the body has found no match on the national database.It has been established that the man was white or light-skinned and he is believed to have been under 50.Derbyshire Constabulary’s assistant chief constable, Bill McWilliam, said: “We are working with other forces to ascertain whether our victim may have been reported missing in a neighbouring county but we recognise that he might not have been reported missing at all.“We are therefore asking members of the public to come forward if they have not seen a neighbour, a friend, a colleague or indeed members of their family recently.”He added: “I recognise that this must be a very shocking incident for either people who live in the area or frequent the area for recreation.“I want to reassure members of the public that a full investigation team is looking into the inquiry and we have additional police resources in the area at this time to provide that reassurance.”
