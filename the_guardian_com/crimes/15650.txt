It appears, as we report today, that Ministers are preparing to amend their proposals to exclude the children of asylum-seekers from mainstream schools when the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill returns to the House of Commons this week. Their willingness to think again should be welcomed.The Government has - rightly - faced much criticism for being prepared to pander to popular prejudice about asylum-seekers. Rather than leading rational debate, it has been too willing to moot eye-catching proposals, such as using the RAF for 'fast-track' deportations, which it knows very well would not work in practice. The education proposals were more serious. They were central to David Blunkett's ill-judged remarks about schools and surgeries being 'swamped' by asylum-seekers. In contrast, head teachers with large numbers of refugee pupils argue that, with proper resourcing, integrated education has benefited all children, broadening horizons and knowledge of the wider world. In making concessions now, a Home Secretary often accused of stubbornness has wisely avoided long-term educational apartheid becoming emblematic of a punitive approach to those seeking refuge. The climbdown also shows that pressure from a wide range of MPs, backed by a coalition of respected children's charities such as Save the Children, has been effective. But there remain many other worrying aspects of this legislation, particularly the proposals to deport some asylum-seekers even before their appeals are heard. Conscientious Labour backbenchers have shown that they can make a difference: they should support further amendments to the Bill this week.
