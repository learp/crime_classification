The Centre for Crime and Justice Studies' claim that knife crime has doubled is based on selective use of Home Office statistics to give a misleading impression of overall trends (Letters, August 23). A closer reading of the British Crime Survey shows the use of knives in violent related crime has remained stable.The Home Office has good information on homicides in which a knife or other sharp instrument was the apparent method of killing. There is no evidence of a consistent rise over the last 10 years.Richard Garside asks for better information about knife crime. We agree we need more information about it and that is why we asked police, from April this year, to collect data about the use of knives and other sharp instruments in other offences. Over time this will present a fuller picture of knife crime and show trends.Collating information about knife crime helps to inform our strategy, which is based around police, powers and prevention. We have introduced tough laws to tackle knife crime, such as increasing the maximum sentence for carrying a knife in public without good reason from two to four years.This strategy has contributed to crime and violent crime falling by a third in the last 10 years. Nevertheless we fully recognise the seriousness of knife crime and will continue to tackle it through police, powers and prevention. Tony McNulty MPHome Office minister
