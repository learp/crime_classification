Photograph: Rui Vieira/PAA former Championship goalkeeper faces jail after he admitted today killing two young brothers while driving dangerously at twice the legal alcohol limit.Luke McCormick, who played for Plymouth Argyle, pleaded guilty at Stoke-on-Trent crown court to causing death by dangerous driving and drink driving.As he arrived at court, the 25-year-old was jeered by relatives of Arron Peak, 10, and his brother Ben, eight, who died after McCormick's Range Rover struck their family's car on the M6 on June 7.The judge, Paul Glenn, told McCormick, a former England youth international, that he would be jailed when sentence is passed later today, saying: "A custodial sentence is inevitable." Causing death by dangerous driving carries a maximum tariff of 14 years in jail.Arron and Ben, from Partington, Manchester, were killed when McCormick's vehicle struck the family's Toyota Previa near junction 16 of the southbound carriageway.The Toyota rolled down a small embankment and hit trees. The boys' father, Phil Peak, 37, who was driving his sons and three friends to an event at Silverstone racetrack, was seriously hurt. The other passengers, a 49-year-old man and his sons, aged eight and 15, had minor injuries.McCormick, who had previously helped police promote road safety, was unhurt. The court was told today that he was found to have 74 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.McCormick, whose contract Argyle said was cancelled by "mutual consent" a month after the crash, was twice voted its young player of the season.
