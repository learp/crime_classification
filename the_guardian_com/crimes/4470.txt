A judge's decision to order the arrest and detention of a child victim of sex abuse to compel her to give evidence against her attacker has been condemned as "utterly shameful" and "Dickensian".The 15-year-old girl, who had committed no crime, was held for 20 hours in police cells overnight on the orders of the judge Robert Bartfield, sitting at Bradford crown court. When she finally appeared, her evidence lasted just 22 minutes.The man who groomed her was more than twice her age and had made the girl pregnant at 14, but she did not want to give evidence because she still had strong feelings for him, the court was told.The judge's decision to order her to be detained, at the request of police and prosecutors, attracted severe criticism from victim and child welfare organisations, and has prompted an immediate review into proceedings at Bradford crown court.After her arrest and overnight detention last week, the girl was held in cells at the court for a further four and a half hours before giving evidence, the Times reported.A jury on Tuesday took less than two hours to return a unanimous guilty verdict against the girl's abuser for sexual activity with a child.On Wednesday, Abid Miskeen, 32, was sentenced to seven years in prison for sexual activity with a child. The judge said: "The suggestion she was in some way forced into the witness box by the prosecution to give evidence on their behalf is wholly misconceived."Charlotte Kenny, defending, confirmed that if prosecutors had not produced the complainant to give evidence, she would have made submissions that Miskeen could not have had a fair trial.Bartfield said: "For better or worse that's the way our system works."The judge had ordered the detention after the start of the case was delayed by more than five hours and the child had left the building, saying she did not want to give evidence.A spokesperson for the judiciary said on Wednesday: "It is a very unusual and exceptional step for young witnesses to be made subject to a witness warrant and held in custody in order to secure attendance at court. In this case, there was evidence called by the prosecution which the judge ruled justified the exceptional course of making such an order."While best practice dictates, and every effort is made to list cases involving vulnerable witnesses at the start of the day, in busy court centres the volume of these types of cases makes it impossible for all of them to start at 10am."While each case is different, following initial inquiries we intend to take some immediate steps to address the issues this case raises."Listing processes at Bradford crown court will be reviewed and amended to avoid the situation happening again where a vulnerable witness has to wait a long time at court prior to giving evidence."Processes will be revisited to ensure that where there is a genuine need to compel young witnesses to attend court, every effort is made to find a solution which ensures they are not detained in police cells overnight."For several years judges have been provided with training on the management of vulnerable witnesses, which is kept constantly under review and this year the Judicial College is launching a new course devoted to the subject."Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive of Victim Support, said: "It is utterly shameful that any vulnerable witness, let alone a child who has been the victim of sustained sexual exploitation, could be treated in such a grotesque and frankly degrading manner by those who are supposed to be protecting her."The spectacle of a child spending the hours before she gives evidence against her abuser locked up in cells at a police station and at court is nothing short of Dickensian and must never be allowed to happen again."This victim needed to be supported, not criminalised, and her treatment underlines how critical it is that the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts understand and prioritise the needs of vulnerable victims and witnesses."The child witness in the case, who cannot be named, arrived at court at 10am on Wednesday last week for the trial's scheduled opening but was said to have become bored and frustrated during a delay of more than five hours. There was initially no courtroom in which the trial could be heard, said the newspaper.The case was finally called at 2.30pm but by then the girl had left the building, stating that she did not want to give evidence. Gerald Hendron, for the prosecution, made a successful application to Bartfield for an arrest warrant against the child, who was detained and held overnight at Halifax police station. Arrest warrants were also issued for a further three witnesses.In a statement made in court at the end of evidence, Bartfield said he believed the "interests of justice" had been served.He said: "Some concern has been expressed about this but there needs to be a fuller understanding of what took place."He said the girl was an essential witness without whose evidence the trial would have collapsed.She absconded after being allowed to leave the building to have a cigarette, as did other witnesses, he said. The prosecution believed she was seeking to influence other witnesses and that the absconding was "orchestrated"."The police and CPS, both of whom are under a duty of care to their witnesses, felt that there was no alternative but to apply for warrants of arrest for all of them," the judge said.He said he had wished to avoid overnight detention of the girl, but police did not believe other ways of dealing with it would "procure" her attendance. He agreed to the warrants because there was "strong public interest in proceeding to trial in such a case and I was not prepared to have it subverted".He said he had explained to the girl the reason for her detention "and my regret that there had been no alternative".He added: "I believe that the interests of justice have been served despite the 'cost' to which I have referred."A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said remanding a child witness was "an exceptional step" but all other options had been explored and exhausted."We understand that this course of action was both unwelcome and extremely difficult for the victim in this case, but there was a strong public interest in proceeding, to protect not just this victim but other children in the future. The defendant in this case has now been convicted for a very serious sexual offence and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment."
