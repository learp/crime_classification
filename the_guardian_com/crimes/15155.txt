Two men are being questioned on suspicion of terrorism offences as investigations continue at a mosque evacuated amid fears of "a possible device activation". Police evacuated streets near the Wolverhampton Central mosque on Thursday night after receiving information about a possible explosive device.An area around the city's central mosque was sealed off at 8pm as a military bomb disposal team was deployed into the area.West Midlands police said they were acting on information that an unspecified device had been "activated" on 28 June.Detectives linked the evacuation to information received as part of an investigation into recent attacks near mosques elsewhere in the West Midlands. "This measure is in place to ensure the absolute safety and security of our communities," a spokesman said.Anti-terror police earlier on Thursday arrested two men in connection with bomb blasts on 21 June apparently targeting mosques in Walsall and Tipton. The men, described as eastern European and aged 22 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.The arrests were made shortly before 3pm in the Small Heath area of Birmingham where roads were subsequently sealed off and searched by bomb disposal teams.Assistant chief constable Marcus Beale thanked the public for their assistance. He said: "Investigations like this are complex and we need to ensure that we obtain every piece of information or forensic evidence possible."Last Friday, residents were evacuated after a blast near the Kanzul Iman Masjid mosque in Tipton left nails and debris scattered outside. No one was injured but some minor damage to property was reported.A small component part of the suspected nail bomb was found in a garden nearby and specialist army disposal officers were called to the scene to carry out a controlled explosion. It came after more than 100 residents were evacuated from their homes in the Caldmore area of Walsall last month after an explosion near the Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre. No-one was hurt in the blast, which caused minimal damage to a wall near the mosque on 21 June.
