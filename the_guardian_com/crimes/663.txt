A suspected teenage burglar had to be rescued by firemen from the roof of the house he had targeted, after two men thought to be his accomplices leapt to the ground.The teenager was found clinging to the ridge of the property in Heaton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, after the gang had been chased through the house by its owner, and scrambled out through a skylight.Damiano Rea, 31, said his wife and five-month-old baby were asleep when he returned from work and found his back door open, before surprising two men in his dining room. They fled upstairs and he watched as they slithered down the roof, jumped 30ft (9m) and ran off.Rea then checked CCTV and realised there were three intruders. While his wife Ksenia, called police, he searched the building but found no trace. "We checked every cupboard and everywhere else we could in case he was hiding," he said.After a further police check with dogs, the couple went back to bed. Then, Rea said: "I heard this strange noise. It was like there was something running across the roof â€“ and it was no pigeon."He and neighbours watched and videoed the scene as 10 police cars and a fire engine arrived while the Northumbria force helicopter hovered overhead. The hooded raider made a final escape attempt but lacked the nerve to jump and was eventually coaxed down a ladder.Acting Inspector Kev Benson said the initial alarm had been raised at 3.35am and officers returned at 5.30am to find a youth on the roof.A 14-year-old boy has been charged with burglary and will appear before magistrates next month.Rea described the gang as "crap" and said that sooty handprints left on his walls after they tried to wrench out lead fittings should help lead to other arrests.
