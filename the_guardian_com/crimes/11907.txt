The government's plan to introduce longer minimum jail terms has been branded "grotesque" by the new director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald.Mr Macdonald, who was appointed last month, also said that some lengthy jail terms for drug offenders were too tough and did not act as a deterrent. His remarks came during a speech at the annual general meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on penal affairs in July when he was being considered for the Â£145,000 a year post. The minutes of the meeting record Mr Macdonald criticising both Labour and Conservative ministers for following a tough US-style agenda, according to a report in today's Times. He said the effect of the proposed change in murder sentencing would be particularly grotesque. "This would have an extraordinary effect on the prison population, but particularly on the long term prison population, which may be difficult to manage." A three tier classification is planned, with sadistic child killers or terrorists dying in prison; a minimum 30 year starting point for killing a policeman, and a 15 year starting point for other murders.
