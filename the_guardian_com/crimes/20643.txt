After nearly 200 years the stigmatising legal term "common prostitute" which dates back to the 1824 Vagrancy Act is to be removed from the statute book, under a package of criminal justice reforms unveiled yesterday.The shake-up in the sex offences laws will also see women who are persistently involved in prostitution facing compulsory drug and alcohol rehabilitation courses on pain of 72 hours' detention if they fail to attend.The compulsory rehab courses will apply to those who are convicted of loitering or soliciting for the purpose of prostitution and will be imposed instead of a fine. Offenders will have to attend at least three meetings of the rehab course or face arrest and detention of up to 72 hours and being brought before a court.The decision to remove the term "common prostitute" from the statute book follows a consultation which showed the term was widely regarded as stigmatising and offensive.The new criminal justice and immigration bill - the 55th since Tony Blair took office in 1997 - will also introduce a new offence of causing a nuisance or disturbance on NHS premises. Those who cause trouble will in future face removal and fines of up to £1,000.Unusually, both the outgoing home secretary, John Reid, and the justice secretary, Lord Falconer, left their ministers to publish a bill which they said included measures which will help ease the jail overcrowding crisis by cutting the daily prison population by a further 1,400 when it is fully implemented.The bulk of that reduction will come from limiting the extra sentence served by non-dangerous offenders if they are recalled to prison to 28 days and from banning the courts from imposing suspended sentences for minor offences.But opposition MPs criticised the publication of the bill on the eve of Mr Blair's departure as it adds 19 new criminal offences to the 3,000 new crimes already created since he came to power in 1997.The legislation mostly puts into law initiatives unveiled by Mr Reid during his 15 months in the Home Office including the creation of "violent offender orders", giving magistrates' courts the power to hold trials in the absence of defendants, create a new offence of "extreme pornography", and give the police the power to close down and evict "neighbours from hell" from their homes.It also confirms Mr Reid's desire to clamp down on those who have been wrongly jailed in miscarriages of justice by capping their compensation at £500,000, increasing the deductions that can be taken from them, and introducing a two-year time limit on their claims.The law is also be changed so that the "plainly guilty" will no longer be able to have their convictions quashed on a technicality - a change that is likely to stir a row with judges and the legal profession.The government is also to use the bill to overcome the embarrassment they faced when the courts prevented ministers from deporting the Afghan hijackers after they claimed asylum.The bill will introduce a special immigration status for "terrorists and serious criminals" who cannot be removed from Britain for legal reasons.The Home Office minister, Baroness Scotland, said while the law itself would not be retrospective it could be applied in cases such as the hijackers. She said this was because it would also apply to those who committed offences abroad even though they had not been convicted of any criminal act - in this case hijacking.However, Paul Cavadino of Nacro, the crime reduction charity, said the bill was a "missed opportunity" to reduce the prison population. He warned that the abolition of "suspended sentences" for magistrates courts would have a "boomerang effect" and would boost the prison population.
