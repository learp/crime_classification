A 28-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a mother and her seven-month-old son, the Crown Prosecution Service has said.The West Midlands branch of the CPS said on Tuesday it had authorised police to charge Wesley Williams with two counts of murder following the killing of 25-year-old Yvonne Walsh and her son Harrison.Both victims, who died as a result of pressure to the neck, were found at their home in Billesley, Birmingham, on 2 June.Williams, who will appear at Birmingham magistrates court on Wednesday, is alleged to have murdered Walsh and her son between 31 May and 2 June, the CPS said.Hayley Firman, head of the West Midlands CPS public protection unit, said: "I have advised officers from West Midlands police that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to charge Wesley Williams with the murders of Yvonne Walsh and her seven-month-old son, Harrison Walsh."Wesley Williams now stands charged with a criminal offence and has the right to a fair trial. It is extremely important that nothing should be reported which could prejudice this trial."Williams, who was taken to a secure mental health unit after his initial arrest on 2 June, was re-arrested earlier on Tuesday after being deemed fit to be interviewed.
