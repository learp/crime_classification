England’s poorest areas are proof of a link between deprivation, litter and crime, according to a survey published on Thursday by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).It claims that poor levels of cleanliness are also associated with increases in low-level crime and social disorder.It reveals a discrepancy between levels of litter on the country’s streets: 28% of sites in the most deprived areas fall below an acceptable standard for litter – nine times worse than in the least deprived areas. It also found more crime in streets with rubbish, graffiti and fly-posting, and less in the cleanest streets. The Local Environmental Quality Survey for England is the 13th carried out by the environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy on behalf of Defra. For the first time this year, the way the data was collected for the survey was changed in order to link it with other national data sets.Overall litter levels in England are acceptable or better at 89% of sites. However, Keep Britain Tidy said the results showed that “this is not the whole story”. Dan Rogerson, the environment minister, said: “Litter has a huge impact on the quality of our streets and public spaces and we all have a responsibility to keep our communities tidy. While we have made great progress in recent years, this research shows there is still more to be done.”Keep Britain Tidy’s chief executive, Phil Barton, said: “Our earlier research pointed to what we have always instinctively known – that more deprived areas suffer from poorer environmental quality. This report confirms it clearly and irrefutably.“It is clear that social inequality extends to the quality of people’s surroundings and we know that if places are dirty and look ‘unloved’ this can adversely impact on health and wellbeing.”
