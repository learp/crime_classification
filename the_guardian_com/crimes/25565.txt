The senior policewoman in charge of the operation that led to Jean Charles de Menezes's death told officers to stop him "at all costs", an inquest was told today.Mark Lewindon, who was a detective chief inspector in Special Branch at the time in July 2005, overheard the order from Commander Cressida Dick, he said.Lewindon told the inquest into De Menezes's death that he heard Dick speaking in the operations room at New Scotland Yard on the morning of July 22, the day the Brazilian electrician was shot dead by anti-terrorism officers at Stockwell tube station."It was said he shouldn't be allowed to get on the train and I think the words she used were 'at all costs'," the now retired detective told jurors at The Oval cricket ground in south London, where the inquest is being held.When asked by Dick's QC, David Perry, whether he was certain about the words used, Lewindon replied: "I'm not sure if you are asking the question, 'What you are saying, you may be wrong about that?' and I could be wrong, yes."Perry said: "I'm going to suggest Cressida Dick didn't say 'at all costs'. She did say, so it's clear, that he was to be stopped, but she didn't use the words 'at all costs'."Lewindon told the inquest that Detective Chief Superintendent Jon Boutcher attempted to establish whether De Menezes, who was being followed by surveillance officers, was a suspect.He said: "There were questions around the identity of the person being followed and I remember Mr Boutcher asking for a percentage, to which the people following, the surveillance teams, were confident that the person being followed was a suspect."Lewindon said he did not remember whether there had been any response from the surveillance team to that question.De Menezes was shot seven times in the head, at point-blank range, on board a train at Stockwell station by police marksmen, who thought he was a terrorist. The incident happened a day after four would-be suicide bombers attempted to blow themselves up on London's transport system.Detective Inspector Andrew Whiddett, who was managing the surveillance teams at the time of the failed attack, also gave evidence.He told the inquest he was present at the briefing of the surveillance teams, who were sent to cover the address at Scotia Road in nearby Streatham, where De Menezes lived.Surveillance officers were shown a photograph of a named suspect, Hussain Osman, one of the July 21 bombers, but did not take a copy of the photograph with them to the address.He said photographs were not taken on operations because, if lost, they could prove a security breach. "Obviously, [police officers] get out of vehicles and move. Things get dropped," Whiddett explained.The inquest is expected to last 12 weeks. Dick, who has since been promoted to deputy assistant commissioner, will give evidence next week.
