Police investigating the death of a prisoner in the segregation unit of a privately run jail have referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service.Michael Bailey, 24, was found hanging in his cell at Rye Hill prison, near Rugby, in March. Prisoners at the jail told the Guardian at the time that he had been segregated after giving staff the name of an officer who had been supplying drugs. Following the death, six staff were suspended from the prison and two custody officers remain on police bail. Officers from the homicide and major crime unit of Northamptonshire police are investigating allegations of supplying controlled drugs to the prison. Rye Hill, operated by Global Solutions Ltd, holds 600 serious offenders. After an inspection in April, the chief inspector of prisons said the jail was "unsafe for staff and inmates alike". The report of the inspection, published last month, was described by the Prison Reform Trust as "one of the most damning we have ever seen". In April, another prisoner, 44-year-old Wayne Reid, died from stab wounds. Reid had been due to be released a few days after he died. Three men have been charged with his murder. Detective Chief Inspector Pete Windridge, of Northamptonshire police, said the force had investigated the death of Michael Bailey and had sent its preliminary findings to the CPS. He added that "an investigation into the supply of controlled drugs into the prison is ongoing. Two prison custody officers, a 21-year-old man from Bedworth [near Coventry] and a 42-year-old man from Warwickshire, remain on police bail pending further inquiries. "A further two men who are prison inmates and three women not connected with the prison have also been arrested and bailed in relation to this investigation."
