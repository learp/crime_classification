Ticket touts have been exploiting the confusion about empty seats by turning up outside the Olympic Park and other venues despite the threat of arrest by undercover police. Ten people have been charged with offences relating to Olympic and Paralympic tickets since the Games opened, Scotland Yard said.Eight people have been charged with ticket touting, one with theft and one with handling stolen goods. They have been charged by officers from Operation Podium, the Met's dedicated response to serious and organised crime at the Games. Three men have also been arrested for allegedly posing as police officers and planning to steal cash and credit cards from tourists visiting London. Another two men were arrested for the alleged theft of two Olympic ticket lane passes.The unauthorised selling of Olympic tickets is a crime under the Olympic Act punishable by a £20,000 fine, and police have warned they will take tough action against touts.The first full day of competition on Saturday exposed police fears that counterfeit tickets might be in circulation. In the runup to the opening of the Games, the specialist police team investigating illegal ticket sales said they had no evidence of fake tickets in production.On Saturday morning some members of the public were turned away from the first round of the archery tournament having bought fake tickets for the event, Locog said.The early rounds of the event are not open for spectators but Locog said a number of unofficial websites – including liveolympictickets.com – had been claiming to sell tickets. The website has now been shut down, organisers added.Outside the park, undercover police arrested five people on suspicion of ticket touting hours before the opening ceremony on Friday and a further 11 on Saturday, Scotland Yard said.Detective Superintendent Nick Downing, head of Operation Podium, warned touts to stay away."My team has been working tirelessly to clamp down on ticket touts," he said."We have been, and will continue to seek out and take robust action against anybody who tries to cash in on the 2012 Games in this way."Ticket touting is illegal and is a clear exploitation of those who genuinely wish to experience the Games first-hand."He also urged the public not to turn to ticket touts in their search for competition seats."I would also urge people to think twice about purchasing tickets from these criminals: if you do, you are likely to find yourself paying over the odds for them, while at the same time fuelling criminality."Downing added that anybody buying tickets from unofficial places could end up with their personal and credit card details being stolen for use in other crimes.A German man, Wolfgang Menzel, 57, and a Slovakian woman, Maria Bukranova, 30, were due to appear in court on Monday charged with ticket touting.Three men, aged 32, 35, and 27, were arrested on Saturday in central London for impersonating a police officer and conspiracy to steal.
