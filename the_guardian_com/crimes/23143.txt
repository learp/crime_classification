The lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, yesterday invited the public to take part in an interactive forum to decide whether cameras should be allowed into the English courts.The forum, on the website of the Department for Constitutional Affairs, www.dca.gov.uk, is the first interactive debate to be hosted by the department.It will feed into a consultation launched yesterday by Lord Falconer and the deputy chief justice, Lord Justice Judge, to determine the extent to which the ban on filming or sound recording in the courts of England and Wales should be lifted.The consultation kicks off with an experiment, starting today, which will see cameras allowed into an English courtroom for the first time since they were banned by law in 1925.The pilot scheme will film hearings over a six-week period in the court of appeal in London, four weeks in the court's criminal division and two weeks in the civil division. Five criminal appeals have already been earmarked but the rest have still to be chosen.Film footage from the pilot will not be broadcast but will be used to create mock-up news items suitable for TV news bulletins. If the pilot is deemed a success by ministers, judges and broadcasters, the law could be changed to allow filming in court. This would require an act of parliament, which means it would not happen before 2006.The pilot is confined to appeals because these rarely involve witnesses. Allowing cameras into criminal trials is more controversial, because of fears that this would deter witnesses from giving evidence.The consultation paper leaves the door open for cameras in trials and suggests a number of restrictions which could allow the evidence of witnesses and defendants to be transmitted.But Lord Falconer said he would not allow any changes which would adversely affect victims, witnesses or jurors. "We have to consider whether this would be trial by television," he said.The consultation paper asks whether all or just parts of proceedings should be televised, perhaps limiting broadcasters to opening and closing statements by lawyers, the summing up by the judge or the delivery of a verdict.One option is to distort the face and voice of a witness, or leave out the more sensitive parts of a hearing such as the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. Other possibilities include enforcing delays on broadcasting until the end of a trial.
