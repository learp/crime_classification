The supermodel, Naomi Campbell, was today released on bail after being arrested at Heathrow airport on suspicion of assaulting a police officer, following a dispute over a mislaid bag.Campbell became the latest victim of the Terminal 5 baggage chaos when she was told one of her checked-in bags had not been delivered to the aircraft. According to passengers on board flight BA269 to Los Angeles, Campbell was in the first class cabin when told of the error.Witnesses said police were called to the Boeing 747 jet after she became abusive towards cabin crew when told that she had the options of flying off without her bag or disembarking from the flight and being reunited with the bag for a later Los Angeles service. The 37-year-old allegedly swore at the police officers and was removed from the aircraft and taken to Northside police station on the airport perimeter.Campbell's spokeswoman said the supermodel had checked in two bags, having arrived at the terminal "in plenty of time". "Once on the plane she was told one bag could not be found and was missing," she said. "BA decided to resolve this by insisting she leave the flight and then called the police to forcibly eject her from the flight. "So far as we are aware BA have still failed to offer any explanation as to why her bag went missing at Terminal 5."Calvin Harris, the Scottish dance music artist, became another celebrity victim of T5 this week when it emerged that he had lost the only copy of his second album in T5's baggage sorting area.BA admitted yesterday that hundreds of cancelled flights, thousands of lost bags and severe damage to its reputation as a result of the T5 baggage system fiasco had cost the business £16m. Analysts say the disruption could cost up to £50m if passengers boycott the airline for a long period. BA said it expected to cancel 34 flights today, although it planned a full schedule on Saturday.The BA baggage mountain, which stood at nearly 30,000 pieces of luggage at the weekend, has fallen to 14,000. BA said 9,000 of those bags were being processed for delivery to passengers.
