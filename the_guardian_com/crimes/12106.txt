The home secretary, Jack Straw, is calling on the mobile phone industry to play its part in reducing street crime by making it harder for thieves to steal mobile phones.Mr Straw will be holding a briefing later today on the issue, and hopes to meet manufacturers sometime discuss the possibility of building greater security measures into the phones.The mobile phone industry estimates that 15,000 handsets are stolen every month, and Metropolitan police figures show that the number of street crimes involving mobile phones increased more than fourfold in the period from April 1998 to July 2000.Even Mr Straw admits that such security measures will not be easy to achieve, particularly given the prevalence of pay-as-you-go plans that do not link a phone to an identifiable owner.He has likened the problem to that faced by car manufacturers who built security measures into car stereos in order to make them unattractive to thieves.The home secretary will also unveil the government's latest plan to reduce violent crime. The British Crime Survey showed a 10% fall in total crime between 1997 and 1999, but robberies were up by 14%.In the 12 months to March 2000, the number or robberies reported to the police rose by 26%.Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe described Mr Straw's claim that it was impossible to say whether, overall, violent crime had gone up or down, as his "feeblest excuse yet"."If, overall, it had gone down, he would be shouting that from the rooftops," she said.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, urged Mr Straw to encourage police officers approaching retirement to stay on for up to five years and also to invite back good officers who had recently retired.He said, "I am today formally asking Jack Straw to invite police officers approaching retirement to stay for up to five years and to invite back good police officers who have retired in the last five years."Mr. Straw answered both points. He said: "The number of police officers who have been retiring or resigning has actually gone down in the last three years."We have pushed up the pay for London officers by £3,500 and recruitment is now in many parts of the country at its highest level."Conservatives have basically nothing to say on crime. During their period in office, crime doubled," he added. Home Secretary Jack Straw surprised a Big Issue seller today by handing over a tenner - then asking for his change.Homeless Big Issue salesman Jaz Walter offered the politician a copy of the £1 magazine during a walkabout in King's Cross, central London.Mr Walter said that he thought Mr Straw was going to give him the whole lot when he took the £10 note out of his wallet.But confusion followed when he then had to dig round in his pockets to reimburse him.Mr Straw, who was viewing the success of a scheme to tackle street crime, eventually settled for £8, which was all that Mr Walter had with him.Related storiesJuly 4 2000: Theft of mobile phones by children fuelling rise in robbery, says StrawDecember 29 2000: Police appeal on mobile phone theftsUseful linksThe Home Office crime reduction siteThe government's crime reduction strategy, January 2000The federation of the electronics industryThe Big Issue
