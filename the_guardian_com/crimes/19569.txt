The news that John Worboys assaulted and raped a large number of women in his black cab shocked the country. It shocked me over a year ago when my friend told me she might have been one of his victims. As the hearing of Worboys's arrest triggered a series of flashbacks in her mind, she phoned the Metropolitan police. She was told four words that have carried her through this whole dreadful ordeal: "You will be believed."Criticism of the officers working on the Worboys case has been fierce. It seems opportunities were missed and many of his crimes could have been prevented. These issues need to be addressed and those responsible for the mistakes held accountable. But comments from Lisa Longstaff from Women Against Rape (Comment, 14 March) angered my friend hours after she had heard the verdict.I appreciate that Longstaff is using this case to highlight changes that must be made in how rape cases are dealt with. But at a time when police were appealing for more of Worboys's victims to come forward, it is careless to write that the police are the "rapists' best friend". My friend has pulled a close circle of support around her in which Longstaff's media-savvy catchcries have no place. My friend keeps saying, "They got him. They got him!' To her the police are heroes and should get the recognition they deserve.Name and address supplied
