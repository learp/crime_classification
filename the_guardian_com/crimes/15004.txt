Police in London are holding face painting sessions and zumba classes in an effort to cut antisocial behaviour during the summer holidays, it has been announced. The events are part of a scheme inspired by a similar push by the Los Angeles police department.Officers said the Summer Night Lights programme was successful in uniting communities and good relations with the police when it ran in Los Angeles in 2008.Officers said they were serving hot food and inviting young people in Haringey, north London, to attend football classes with Tottenham Hotspur football club, as well as boxing and boxercise classes.Sergeant Sue Marsh, who is stationed in Haringey, said: "Engagement is key to formulating long term solutions to the issues that can have a negative effect on the quality of life for local people."The scheme is running in seven London boroughs, including Tower Hamlets in east London. And the local borough commander, Dave Stringer, said that the project would be evaluated and developed before perhaps being rolled out across the whole of the capital.He said: "In the US, the project has helped achieve a significant reduction in violence and has also helped develop stronger [bonds in] the community."The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, said that the events were "strategically placed" during the summer holidays, which he said he hoped would encourage participation. Police added that the events were specifically timed to coincide with peak times for robberies and violence.
