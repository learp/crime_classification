A car salesman was found guilty of strangling his partner to death after he discovered she was planning to leave him for another man.Alan Jermey, 41, throttled 34-year-old Kirsty Wilson, the mother of his two children, before setting her body alight in an attempt to make it look as if she had died in a fire at their house in Woking, Surrey.Jermey had planned the murder of Wilson, who intended to leave him for the boss of the Mercedes garage where she worked. He bought a 100,000-volt stun gun online to knock her out, before strangling her and pouring petrol over her body.After calling 999, he took their two daughters on to the roof of their house, but the fire failed to take hold and they were rescued by firefighters. Jermey seemed calm and unconcerned about Wilson's fate, the court heard. He will be sentenced on Monday.Wilson told Jermey that she wanted to end their relationship in May last year. She planned to marry her boss, Simon Goddard, who had already left his wife. The couple, who began an affair in spring 2007, were "very much in love", said Goddard, speaking after the judgment.
