A five-year-old Spanish girl has vanished from a Spanish border town, 120 miles from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz where Madeleine McCann went missing last May.The private detective agency hired to find the British girl, Metodo 3, is now attempting to establish if there is a link between the two disappearances.According to reports, Mari Luz Cortez was last seen on Sunday afternoon going to buy a packet of crisps from a local shop. Her family, who raised the alarm after searching for her when she failed to return, are said to fear she has been abducted.Officers have been scouring the area for the girl, and Portuguese police have also been carrying out searches on their side of the border.The McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said there were "comparisons" that could be made, but stressed it was too early to say if the two cases were linked. He said Metodo 3 was looking into the Spanish youngster's disappearance as a priority."Our investigators are working very closely with the Spanish police in the first instance, and with the family, to establish whether there are any links or similarities."He said Kate and Gerry McCann were aware of the case and their thoughts were with the girl's family."They are highly concerned to hear that another young girl has gone missing in the region. Their thoughts and prayers are with the Cortez family."They, of all people on the planet, can imagine the sort of agony the family are going through."The McCanns travelled to Huelva in August last year to raise awareness in the region about their daughter's disappearance.
