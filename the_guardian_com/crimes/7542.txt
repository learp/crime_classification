The home secretary announced in October that the government was minded to use the right it has under the Lisbon treaty to opt out of measures for cooperation within the EU on police and criminal justice affairs. However, she promised that the decisions would be subject to a vote in both Houses of Parliament and that the government would consult a wide range of committees in both Houses before making this decision final.The House of Lords has now produced a report after a wide consultation. It is unequivocal in its conclusions. The case for opting out is not convincing and would have adverse effects on the internal security of the UK and on the administration of criminal justice. It also found that the European court of justice presents no danger to our criminal justice system. Its conclusions are based on evidence from the police, the Law Society, the Bar Council, those representing the victims of crime and many others.The government's decision should not depend on whether one is a Europhile or Eurosceptic. It should be based on concern with the security and safety of this country and on evidence, not political prejudice. The government should abandon its plans to trigger the opt-out. If, however, for political reasons, Conservatives feel unable to accept the conclusions of the report, then Labour and Liberal Democrats should vote against the opt-out, which will only benefit the terrorists, paedophile rings, people traffickers, drug dealers, money launderers, those who exploit cyber crime and other serious criminals who increasingly operate across borders and who can only be effectively dealt with by a co-ordinated cross-border response. Liberal Democrats pledged in their manifesto to keep Britain part of the international crime fighting measures that are subject to the European Court of Justice. Nothing in the coalition agreement prevents them from keeping this pledge.Dick TaverneHouse of Lords
