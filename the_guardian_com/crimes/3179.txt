Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police tiggered last summer's riots, was trying to set up a drug deal in the weeks before he was killed, a court has heard.The 29-year-old was shot dead by police on 4 August last year in Tottenham, north London. He was killed after getting out of a taxi which had been stopped by armed police. Officers have said Duggan raised a handgun he was hiding in his jacket.A jury at London's Snaresbrook crown court heard Duggan was looking to shift cannabis and had sought the help of his friend, Kevin Hutchinson-Foster.Hutchinson-Foster is on trial accused of supplying Duggan with the gun he is alleged to have wielded before he was shot.Hutchinson-Foster, who has convictions for possession of cocaine and heroin with intent to supply, said he regularly used cannabis but offered to get involved with Duggan on a bigger deal.The defendant said that in July last year he had a conversation with Duggan and a friend called "Mo" about the deal.Asked by his barrister, Stuart Denney, what the thrust of the conversation was, Hutchinson-Foster said: "They knew somebody who was cultivating cannabis and wanted to know if I knew anybody who was interested in buying it. I said if they got me a sample I would give it to my dealer to see if he was interested."Hutchinson-Foster, 30, of no fixed address, is charged with "selling or transferring a prohibited firearm" to Duggan between 28 July and 5 August last year. He denies passing the modified BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to Duggan, contrary to the Firearms Act 1968.The case continues.
