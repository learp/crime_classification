Conservatives on the London assembly today rallied to Boris Johnson's defence as opposition members sought to apply pressure on the mayor of London to deliver on a promise to fund four rape crisis centres.Jenny Jones, a Green assembly member, tabled a motion calling on the mayor to set out a timetable for delivering funding by the end of the year, since "not a penny" had yet been received.Johnson delighted campaigners during the mayoral election by promising £744,000 a year to fund four rape crisis centres, claiming the provision was "desperately needed" by victims living in the capital.But, 12 months after coming to office, the mayor announced that just £1.4m had been earmarked for the project over three years – £832,000 less than the original sum promised.Johnson now wants boroughs to "match-fund" City Hall contributions to make up the shortfall.Jones used an assembly plenary session to call on the mayor to honour his electoral promise and agree to find the remaining £832,000 from savings, as originally planned, if councils failed to deliver.But the nine-strong Conservative group came to Johnson's defence as they accused opposition members of political point-scoring by "asking the mayor to do something he had already committed to do".Speaking after the meeting, Jones said: "Not a penny of this funding has been paid. It seems to me we have waited long enough. I just do not understand what the problem is."Matty Mitford, a member of the "Boris Keep Your Promise" campaign set up last year to urge the mayor to deliver on his manifesto commitments in full, said that several of her colleagues had voted for Johnson purely on the basis of this promise."There are a number of people in my group who voted for him based on that issue alone who would not have voted for him otherwise ... Unless you stand by this promise you are using some of the most vulnerable people in society. It is the mayor who has been opportunistic."James Cleverly, a member of the Conservative assembly group, said that all members were in agreement about the need for rape crisis centres, but it was felt within his group that the motion was intended to suggest that the mayor had somehow lost interest in this commitment.Cleverly, who also chairs the London assembly health and public services committee, criticised opposition colleagues who he claimed had failed to air their concerns when his panel had scrutinised the mayor's draft domestic violence strategy over the summer. "None of them turned up, which is why it's so cynical."He added that Johnson had "put noses put out of joint" when he first suggested the funding because it highlighted his predecessor's failure to tackle the demand for such centres."I feel people were caught on the hop and want to play political catch-up," Cleverly said.The motion was passed by 14 votes to nine.
