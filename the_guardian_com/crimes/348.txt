In his time Robert Hyams has posed as oneof the world's top microbiologists,claiming breakthroughs in the field of Aidsand cancer. He has tricked banks, propertyagents and car companies out of fortunes.But it was his pretence to be amillionaire art buyer that finally led to jailfor the conman when he attempted toswindle the auctioneers Christie's outof more than £1m worth of Frenchmasterpieces.Sentencing Hyams, who pleaded guiltyto six counts of attempting to obtain propertyby deception and three relatedoffences at Southwark crown court yesterday,Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QCdescribed him as "a persistent, serious andsophisticated fraudster" who had leddetectives on a "sorry dance".The court heard how the attempted artfraud, which a repentant Hyams said hadmade him feel "dirty", began in February2002 when the 51-year-old approachedChristie's posing as a professor ofbioscience and wealthy art collector. Heconvinced the auctioneers of his wealthwith a forged bank reference, purportedlyfrom the Union Bank of California, whichsuggested Hyams had £5m to spend.Edmund Fowler, prosecuting, told thecourt how Hyams' claim to be a professorhad been falsely corroborated by a certificatefrom the non-existent "University ofCanterbury", which Hyams had purchasedin the US for £200.Having successfully hoodwinked theauction house, Hyams then deceived hisdaughter, Catherine, asking her to conducttelephone bids on his behalf.Oblivious to her father's inability to payfor the six paintings, Ms Hyams bid atotal of £1,188,000 for six French masterpieces.Her spending spree on her father'sbehalf culminated in the purchase of threeworks by Marc Chagall, two by GeorgesBraque and one by Jean Dufy. The mostexpensive work, Marc Chagall's La Pistedu Cirque, was sold for £530,000.Christie's began to question the authenticityof the bids, the court heard, whenMs Hyams talked about placing one of thepaintings in a frame she had seen in thehigh street chain, Habitat.But it was not until Robert Hyams failedto pay for his purchase, while simultaneouslyinsisting the six paintings beshipped to an address he gave, that suspicionswere aroused and Christie's contactedthe police.Although the paintings were neverdelivered, the cost to the auction house,which bought the paintings from thevendors at the inflated bids to protect itsreputation, was estimated to be £150,000.When detectives finally caught up withHyams he was living with his family in a$3m (£1.7m) mansion in Palo Alto, California,with "his and hers" Mercedes jeepsparked in the driveway - both had beenobtained under false pretences. His newguise was that of a senior academic whowas on the verge of discovering a cure forcancer.He was finally arrested in January 2003after making excuses for the non-appearanceof the money and sending a secondforged document to account for the missingfunds.But it was after he was bailed owing toillness that the true extent of Hyams' compulsivebehaviour was exposed, as hecommitted a further 81 offences relatedto deception.While his case was still pending, thecourt heard, Hyams set about constructinganother identity: this time as a biologistfrom the Medical Research Councilworking for a fake company he calledPacific West Biotechnology.He fraudulently set upaccounts with Barclays,Halifax, Abbey National,Lloyds andbanks in the Isle ofMan to commitcheque fraud. He alsohired a Mercedes,rented a three-bedroomhouse and sent his twoyoungest daughters to£4,000-a-term King's school in Ely, Cambridgeshire. All, the court heard, byusing a complex web of cheque fraud toexaggerate his wealth.During this period Hyams also bid£7,000 for furniture at a second auction,this time at Bonham's. The total costsincurred by Hyams' latest bout ofdeception was said to have amounted to£68,500.Passing a five-year jail sentence yesterday,Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC, said: "Youseem to have almost a compulsion to tryto trick people out of their money."That is not necessarily only and purelyfor the financial benefits involved orpotentially involved but because of whatyou have yourself variously described asthe 'kick' or the 'buzz' that you get out ofsuch behaviour."Unhappily, none of this is of comfortto the very many people whom you persistin defrauding."Detective Inspector Roderick Goddard,who led the investigation, said: "Hyamsis a career conman who has a string ofconvictions for fraud and has left a trail ofmisery and bad debt behind him."He's a Walter Mitty. That is his character.He lives this lifestyle. He goes for thefull monty. He can't help himself. I haveno doubt he was up to no good in theUnited States. He had to keep doing it tokeep going, to keep up the lifestyle."
