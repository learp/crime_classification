Judge Roger Jarvis is right to say: "Substantial sentences are justified for binge drinking offences." (City 'field hospital' to treat victims of drunken violence, August 2). Our sector has long argued for a change in application of the law in order to make alcohol misuse and drunkenness an exacerbating factor in sentencing for alcohol-related crime. All too frequently drunkenness is seen as a mitigating factor to excuse those charged with offences.The exception is drink-driving, where an offence committed while over the limit attracts a much stiffer penalty. The result, of course, has been a dramatic reduction in drink-driving. It is time to apply that lesson to a different context.Rob Hayward British Beer & Pub Association
