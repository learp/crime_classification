A 16-year-old boy has been banned from entering Manchester until 2014 under an anti-social behaviour order.Terence Westran, who is originally from Scotland, is not allowed to enter the city for 10 years under its terms. Manchester youth court heard that he had taken part in "gratuitous and unbridled attacks" on a businessman in Gorton, north Manchester. He hit him with a baseball bat and broke his nose with a bottle. District judge Alan Berg lifted reporting restrictions on the case. He said: "The public is entitled to have any ammunition it can in order to ensure this anti-social behaviour order is properly policed." Judge Berg said he had listened to a catalogue of gratuitous and unbridled aggression towards innocent members of the public, including Robert Crawford, who works at a second hand goods shop in Gorton. Westran and two other youths had confronted Mr Crawford at the shop, bruising his hand with a baseball bat, last September. An elderly man was knocked to the ground in the fracas. A month later, he returned to the shop with two friends and attacked Mr Crawford again, breaking his nose when a heavy glass bottle was thrown at his face. The trio were chased and Westran assaulted a police officer. The judge told him: "It was violence of the worst type. It was completely unprovoked and gratuitious, it was the violence of a bully - because that it is what you are. To indicate what a coward you are, you were part of a marauding gang, not for the first time." Basil Curley, Manchester council's housing spokesman, said: "We have used the new legislation at the earliest possible opportunity to help publicise our anti-social behaviour orders." Westran was also given a two-year training and detention order on five charges, including wounding, assault, assaulting a police officer, affray and criminal damage. He pleaded guilty to all the charges, and will be detained for 12 months.
