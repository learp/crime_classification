An undisclosed number of police forces are reviewing murder investigations following a confession by the convicted serial killer Levi Bellfield that he abducted, raped and killed Milly Dowler.Bellfield’s confession, during an investigation into whether the 47-year-old had an accomplice, was revealed by Surrey police on Wednesday.Levi Bellfield found guilty of killing Milly Dowler The former bouncer, who converted to Islam five years ago and now calls himself Yusuf Rahim, was convicted of murdering Milly, 13, in 2011 but had always denied any involvement in the schoolgirl’s death.The Metropolitan police confirmed it was now liaising with a number of other forces regarding other criminal investigations amid reports Bellfield had also confessed to a range of other crimes.

Bellfield was living just 50 yards away from where she was last seen alive on 21 March. Her badly decomposed and unclothed body was found six months later by mushroom pickers at Yateley Heath Woods, near Fleet, Hampshire.Bellfield refused to return to court to be sentenced after his conviction for Milly’s murder; the trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie said he was “a cruel and pitiless killer” who had “not had the courage” to come to court.Reacting to Bellfield’s admission, Milly’s family said in a statement on Wednesday: “The effect of this information has been devastating for a family which has already had to endure so much.”
