A 30-year-old man who was stabbed to death during a bungled robbery at a flower shop had previously gone on trial and been cleared of killing a teenager, it has been reported.Gary Mullings was part of a gang who tried to rob a shop in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, on Tuesday night. But he was fatally stabbed during the incident at Feathers, Frills and Flowers and pronounced dead in hospital. Shopkeeper Cecil Coley, 72, who was also injured, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and he will be questioned by detectives on Thursday after his release from hospital.Coley had been playing dominoes in the shop with a 60-year-old friend, who was also injured, when the robbers struck.A 19-year-old man who was stabbed and treated at Manchester Royal Infirmary, has also been arrested.Police sources told the Manchester Evening News that Gary Mullings was acquitted in January 2002 of the murder of Alan Byron, 18, who was shot dead in a car in Longsight, south Manchester, in 2001. Another man was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.During the incident in which Mullings died, police said a number of men had tried to rob the shop and that a gun had been found at the scene. Police have not formally identified him and the results of a postmortem have yet to be released.Greater Manchester police said a 19-year-old man who presented himself at Manchester Royal Infirmary with stab wounds on Tuesday had been arrested on suspicion of robbery.Cecil Coley's nephew, Glen Simms, 49, said his uncle had had the shop premises for 40 years. He said: "I heard that two men went in to rob the shop and that my uncle was there with a friend."It appears they were attacked and my uncle acted to defend himself."Shauna Smith, 17, said Coley was known as "Pudding" because he used to make "slushies" – crushed ice drinks – and described him as a "very nice and lovely man".During a similar incident in Pendlebury, Salford, in June, a burglar was stabbed to death and a homeowner arrested. Peter Flanagan, 59, was told last week by the Crown Prosecution Service that he would not face charges because he had acted in self-defence and with reasonable force.
