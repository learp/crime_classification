A mother of five who admitted entering into a civil partnership with another woman while still married was today given a suspended prison sentence.Suzanne Mitchell is believed to be the first person convicted of this form of bigamy since same-sex unions were introduced in December 2005.Sentencing Mitchell to a suspended eight-month prison term and 100 hours of community service, the judge, Robin Onions, rejected the 30-year-old's claims that she had not realised she was breaking the law."I reject utterly your claim that you thought you were taking part in some kind of blessing of your friendship," he told Shrewsbury crown court in Shropshire."You knew exactly what you were doing, and you have not expressed a trace of remorse for what you have done."Mitchell, from Ditherington in Shrewsbury, had lied to her civil partner, Caroline Beddows, in what was "an offence of cruelty and deception", the judge said.Mitchell, who is pregnant with her sixth child, had admitted falsely claiming to be single to enter into the civil union with Miss Beddows in February last year.Mark Linkins, prosecuting, told the court that the pair became friends after a chance encounter at a bus stop while both were pregnant. Following the birth of their children the relationship developed and became intimate, and in September 2005 Miss Beddows and her baby moved into the Mitchells' marital home.In February 2006 the women held a civil partnership ceremony at Shrewsbury register office, at which Mitchell declared that she was single.However, their relationship deteriorated rapidly and the next month Miss Beddows moved out. Mitchell has since been reunited with her husband, Charles.In mitigation, Michael Brogan said his client was a woman of "limited acumen" who had acted naively.Last month, the justice ministry and the Crown Prosecution Service said they believed it was the first such case under the civil partnership law, which allows same-sex couples to have a legally recognised union akin to marriage.There were almost 16,000 ceremonies in the nine months after the law came into effect.
