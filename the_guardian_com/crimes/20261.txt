America's so-called qui tam law, which the Home Office is considering adapting for use in England and Wales, is an anti-fraud measure originally dating back to 1790 but which has received a new lease of life in the past two decades.The term is an - understandable - shortening of "qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hoc parte sequitur", Latin for "he who sues for the king as well as himself" and first emerged to allow private citizens to take legal action on behalf of the US government.Part of the False Claims Act, it permits anyone who knows about fraud against the federal government - whether currently or in the past - to launch a lawsuit, which US prosecutors can then decide to take up themselves. If they decline, private citizens can press on alone, although such claims succeed far less often.The key to the measure's current prominence and success is that it allows the original whistleblower to claim a proportion of any assets or fines and settlements recovered by the state. In 1986 the law was changed to make it more attractive, allowing plaintiffs to receive up to 30% of seized assets or payments.Since then there have been more than 5,000 successful actions, recovering £5.5bn for the federal government - not to mention £900m in awards.Among the biggest of these went to pharmaceutical executive Douglas Durand, who became alarmed at learning of illicit practices such as bribing doctors to use certain drugs when he joined Illinois-based TAP Pharmaceuticals.To protect his reputation - and, as he put it, "cover his rear" - Mr Durand launched a qui tam action which federal prosecutors then took up.In October 2001, he received a healthy $77m, or just under 15% of the total penalty levied on TAP.Only a fortnight ago, a former manager with US defence contracting company Science Applications International Corp received $500,000 for blowing the whistle on over-charging for environmental clean-up work at a Texas air force base.Michael Woodlee filed the claim after becoming concerned that SAIC was charging for far higher labour costs than it actually incurred.
