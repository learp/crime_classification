The lack of any proof to support a claim by convicted killer Jane Andrews that she was sexually abused as a child by one of her brothers was placed on the public record by three appeal court judges yesterday.The judges said: "This allegation of sex abuse has never been admitted by or proved against the alleged offender, and that fact needs to be recorded because of the publicity that this case has received." Andrews, 36, a former dresser to the Duchess of York, had made the allegation against her brother, Manchester theatre director Mark Andrews, during interviews with psychiatrists. She sought to use the resulting psychiatric reports for an appeal against her conviction at the Old Bailey in May 2001 of murdering her lover, Tommy Cressman, at the house they shared in Fulham, west London. Three weeks ago the appeal court refused to consider the fresh evidence and rejected her plea for a retrial aimed at securing a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder on the basis that she acted under provocation or in a state of diminished responsibility.
