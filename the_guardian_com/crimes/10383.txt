The people carrier, vehicle of choice for the New Labour middle classes, is the car least fancied by car thieves, according to Home Office research.The official 1999 index of car theft in Britain shows that when it comes to a Ford Galaxy or the Renault Espace, five out of every 1,000 are stolen each year, while a 16-year-old Toyota Carina is the car most likely to be stolen, with 154 thefts per 1,000. The figures were disclosed yesterday as the home secretary, Jack Straw, launched an anti-car crime campaign to highlight how simple measures can dramatically cut theft.  Mr Straw said car crime was down 17% in three years but motorists could cut it further by parking in safe areas, using alarms and immobilisers, shutting windows, locking doors, and not leaving things on display. "One in eight of thefts are from vehicles that have simply been left unlocked by the driver," he pointed out. The trend for modern cars to be fitted with ever more sophisticated anti-theft devices means that thieves are now targeting older cars. Cars that are 15 years old have the highest theft rate - 27 per 1,000 stolen each year. In comparison, cars first registered in 1997 had a theft rate of four per 1,000 cars. Mr Straw admitted that his car, a 1986 Ford Orion, was stolen some years ago in his Blackburn constituency, and he only got it back after he of fered a reward. Its steering lock had been broken, but he still owns the car and uses it. The Home Office says 391,271 cars are stolen each year, and the government is aiming for a 30% cut by 2004. Somebody whose car is broken into on average ends up £100 out of pocket. If a car is driven off but recovered it costs its owner an average of £470.
