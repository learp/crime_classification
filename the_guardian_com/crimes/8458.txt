 1.08am BST We are going to wrap up the blog now but will be back with coverage of Tuesday's appearance by the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.Its chairman, MP John Whittingdale, said on Monday that the most important question the BBC faces is why the Newsnight Savile investigation was dropped last year.Here is a summary of developments over the course of Monday:• The editor of Newsnight, Peter Rippon, "stepped aside" on Monday after the BBC said he had made "inaccurate or incomplete" statements about the Jimmy Savile scandal.• A BBC Panorama investigation has reported that Newsnight journalists were worried Rippon was feeling under pressure from his bosses to axe an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by Savile.As barely hidden internal tensions at the BBC burst into the open, a Newsnight reporter, Liz MacKean, told Panorama that she believed Rippon would not support the nearly prepared film.• The Commons culture, media and sport committee will hear evidence from the BBC director general, George Entwistle, on Tuesday, but will consider asking Rippon and other Newsnight journalists to appear before them if they feel his evidence is incomplete.• Opening tonight's Newsnight, which clashed in the scheduling timetables with the Panorama investigation into it, presenter Jeremy Paxman said it had been a "bad day" for the BBC.• The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has insisted he has not ruled out further inquiries into the scandal but said he did not want to "slow down the search for the truth". 12.53am BST Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian's head of media and technology, says that the Panorma investigation largely consisted of stories already highlighted in newspapers: There was also a broad allegation of a sex ring operated by staff connected with Top of the Pops in that era, although this was not directly linked to Savile.The programme also revealed that Newsnight editor Peter Rippon did not see the key on the record interview his journalists had secured, with one of Savile’s victims, Karin Ward.Rippon also used a surprising phrase in an email to dismiss the evidence that the production team had secured, noting it consisted of a backgroundHowever, Dan adds that the programme could emerge as a major catalyst for further developments if if audience figures, due to be unveiled shortly before 11am on Tuesday, show that it had a drew a particularly large audience.Updated at 12.54am BST 12.40am BST The Independent leads with a question: 'So, Director General, who did fix it for the Savile investigation to be dropped? and when will the BBC tell the whole truth about this scandal?' 12.38am BST The Times has 'Chance to make Savile face justice was missed' 12.37am BST Unsurprisingly, the Savile story leads on the front of many of tomorrow's UK newspapers.The Sun goes with 'Savile - BBC's abuse of your licence fee'Updated at 12.38am BST 12.25am BST Miriam O'Reilly, the former BBC Countryfile presenter who won a victiory over her former employers when a tribunal ruled that the corporation was guilty of ageism in axing her from the rural affairs show, has been voicing some fairly sharp commentary on twitter:Miriam O'Reilly (@OReillyMiriam)From my own experience I have no faith or belief in the word of some BBC execs. I've found they say whatever they have to.October 22, 2012Miriam O'Reilly (@OReillyMiriam)George Entwistle said to work for the BBC again I had to come up with a 'brilliant' idea. I expect he's trying to come up with a few himselfOctober 22, 2012 12.21am BST The Newsnight story is damaging to BBC journalism’s reputation, but is more important as a symbol of the kind of institutional problems it has that meant it failed to address the much, much greater fault of sheltering a paedophile.That's according to Charlie Beckett, the director of Polis, the LSE's media think-tank, who has posted a thoughtful blog here. It carries an upbeat conclusion: Let’s remember after all, that one of journalism’s key roles is supposed to be rocking the boat, thumbing the nose at the famous and holding power to account.This week’s Panorama has helped belatedly to restore some faith in the BBC’s ability to do that, paradoxically by revealing the wider failure to hold itself to that task.Updated at 1.16am BST 12.10am BST Comments made on Panorama by Karin Ward, Newsnight's key interviewee last year and the person who said that Savile's dressing room was "packed" with people while Gary Glitter abused a girl, might well be the most moving of all.I didn't get a chance to take a note of them earlier, so here she is on how she felt about the Newsnight investigation and her interview being dropped: It's hurtful. It was difficult because I had been pushed so hard when I did not want to do it.You have have to remember that I was not very well at all because I had cancer and for all that stress.. that was what made me angry.. they never used it because someone higher up did not believe meUpdated at 12.12am BST 12.00am BST However, many are also especially zoning in on emails between senior members of BBC staff, which were revealed by Panorama.In particular, there is anger at language used by Peter Rippon during an email by him in November last year to Meirion Jones, a Newsnight producerOn the question of whether or not to air the investigation Rippon wrote:Having pondered this overnight I think the key is whether we can establish the CPS did drop the case for the reasons the women say. That makes it a better story – our sources so far are just the women and a second–hand briefing.Here's a flavour of some of the reaction to that this evening:sianushka (@sianushka)'Our sources were just the women' - what a telling phrase on how society doesn't hear survivors of sexual assault #panorama #ibelieveherOctober 22, 2012Patrick Strudwick (@PatrickStrud)We should all stand outside the BBC in silence with placards saying, "JUST THE WOMEN."October 22, 2012stellacreasy (@stellacreasy)The phrase 'just the women' alone shows something at the BBC has gone very, very wrong- Liz Mackean and Meirion Jones v brave too...October 22, 2012Jane Merrick (@janemerrick23)"Just the women" - quote from Rippon in 2011 could've been 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990. That's the problem all along. "Just the women"October 22, 2012Updated at 1.15am BST 11.53pm BST If twitter is anything to go by, it's largely a thumbs up from Panorama viewers tonight for the work of BBC journalists:Juno McEnroe (@Junomaco)V good BBC Panorama on Jimmy Savile. How a media corporation failed to act. Now, it's being held to account. A lesson for all media.October 22, 2012Updated at 1.15am BST 11.45pm BST Reaching its conclusions, Panorama says that "the final big question" relates to George Entwistle, who is now the BBC's director general.It reports that Helen Boaden, the BBC's head of news, knew enough about Newsnight's Savile investigation at the beginning of December 2011 to warn Entwistle.She told Entwistle – who was responsible for the BBC's TV channels – that if the Savile film aired, he would probably have to drop planned Christmas tributes to the BBC star, who had died the previous October.That conversation is said to have lasted no more than a few seconds, with Entwistle apparently asking no further questions.Entwistle, a former editor of Newsnight himself, has consistently said that he was "aware" of the programme's Savile investigation – but asked no questions about its detail, believing it was not his place to interfere in the work of another department of the BBC. 11.41pm BST Panorama is now moving up to the most pressing recent questions about the Savile affair and the BBC's handling of the Newsnight investigation.Kevin Marsh, a former editor of PM, the World at One and the Today programme, tells the Panorama that he has spoken "to a lot of people at all levels in the BBC and a lot of people would have to be lying" for it to be true that pressure was put on Peter Rippon [The Newsnight editor who has stepped] to drop the Newsnight item from last year.However, Panorama says that Liz MacKean was left with the clear impression that Rippon "was feeling the heat".She told Panorama that she believed Rippon would not support the nearly prepared film. Writing in an email to a friend at the time, on 30 November of last year, MacKean said what she thought was really going on: "PR [Peter Rippon] says if the bosses aren't happy … [he] can't go to the wall on this one."Updated at 11.43pm BST 11.33pm BST More praise for the Panorama team on twitter. BBC management not so much:Martin Bright (@martinbright)BBC appears to be stuffed with over-cautious managers. #savile. However, this #panorama is excellentOctober 22, 2012Liz MacKean of Newsnight is also being praised:Emma Kennedy (@EmmaK67)What a brave and brilliant woman Liz MacKean is. #savileOctober 22, 2012Updated at 11.34pm BST 11.31pm BST My colleague Lisa O'Carroll has been watching tonight's Newsnight, which also led on the Savile scandal but, unlike Panorama did not have the main players as the stars of its narrative. Reporter Liz MacKean and producer Meirion Jones were nowhere to be seen.Instead, an unusually cowed looking Jeremy Paxman and his team had to rely on clips that were run on various news outlets earlier in the day and the already aired interview with Karin Ward, one of the victims interviewed originally by Mackean.A brief analysis in the studio involving former boss of ITN Stewart Purvis and Sian Kevill centred on the damage wrought by the BBC by itself. Both agreed it was incredible the corporation has allowed the programme's editor Peter Rippon's account of the decision to drop the original Newsnight investigation into Savile to stand for as long as 20 days.That the "director general and chairman of the Trust came out and backed" the original explanation indicated they thought that the decision was “absolutely defensible", said Kevill, who edited Newsnight between 1998 and 2002.The fact that it transpired that neither the DG or the chairman had a full account however was extraordinary. Nobody, it seems had gone back to Mackean or Jones which Kevill said was "amazing" as they would have discovered the now public "divering views".She said she instinctively didn’t believe there was “any corporate squashing” of Newnight. but given the inconsistencies in stories over the last 20 days, nothing would surprise her. 11.25pm BST The political commentator and journalist Iain Dale is among those impressed with Panorama:Iain Dale (@IainDale)This Panorama programme is the BBC at its best. Shame it also reveals the BBC at its very worst. Incredible stuff. Superb journalism.October 22, 2012Some reaction too from Ireland, where Christine Bohan has been watching and drawing some comparisons:Christine Bohan (@ChristineBohan)Parallels between Savile and Catholic Church abuse. Adults suspected - or knew - but did nothing, kids not believed, abuser was facilitated.October 22, 2012Updated at 11.26pm BST 11.24pm BST Two other pieces of footage are shown, with Savile commenting directly on some of the suspicions surrounding him.On Have I Got News for You, he is asked "What did you do in your caravan?" to which he replies "Whatever I could get my hands on"In another appearance, sitting alongside journalist Louis Theroux in the back of a vehicle, he says: "How do they know what I am or not? I know that I am not" 11.20pm BST In their 'new' context the footage of Savile interacting with young women and children, including boys, on television during the 1970s makes the blood run cold.Panorama includes stock clips of him cuddling up to young guests and running his hand up the knee of a young woman.A male interviewee, whose identity is blacked out, tells the programme about an encounter with Savile after going on to to Jim'll Fix it as a boyscout. He claims that Savile took him aside after the appearance and sexually molested him.  11.04pm BST So there might be 'no smoking gun' (yet?) from tonight's Panorama, but it's hard not to be struck once again by the sheer number of people now saying that they were aware (or had suspicions) of the kind of man Savile had been, but chose not to talk about it when he was alive.They include former BBC journalists who joined him when he was on the road with a camper van.Dan Davies, Savile's biographer, meanwhile told Panorama that he learned from his own research that the entertainer had a reputation very earlier on in his career for being someone who "preferred" young girls.The Times journalist David Aaronovitch tweets:David Aaronovitch (@DAaronovitch)Why did ‘biographer Dan Davies’ wait till #Savile died before he started tracking down victims?October 22, 2012 10.57pm BST Paraic O'Brien of Channel 4, who has been at the forefront of some media coverage of the Savile scandal tweets:Paraic O'Brien (@paraicobrien)It doesn't look like #bbcpanorama have smoking gun = proof that BBC top brass leant on Rippon because of #savile tributes.October 22, 2012Updated at 10.59pm BST 10.55pm BST Back on BBC1 Liz MacKean of Newsnight has been taking Panorama through the narrative of her investigation last year."They were all telling the same story," she says of other women who she and the Newsnight team spoke to.How could Savile's alleged abuse have continued when so many were aware ?Beeb veteran Paul Gambaccini has an answer: This horror took place while all of society was watching but because it was off the scale of everybody's belief system they did not really come to terms with it 10.50pm BST Over on BBC 2, former Newsnight editor Sian Kevill has made an appearance at her old stomping ground.She said the fact that the "director general and chairman of the Trust came out and backed" the original explanation on the dropping of the Savile investigation "showed this was absolutely defensible".But what was "amazing is that they hadn’t got back to the original reporters who had diverging views".Updated at 11.47pm BST 10.47pm BST Shelly Jofre is anchoring the Panorama investigation, which has some particularly poignant comments from Ward a year on from her interview with Newsnight."I had spent my whole life not being believed," says Ward, who is still angry about the decision not to air the investigation."It was hurtful and difficult because I had been pushed so hard to do it." 10.45pm BST Panorama is off and running now, and showing segments from the interview last year with Ward, who was seriously ill with cancer when she gave the interview to Newsnight.Ward's allegations include that Savile forced her to perform oral sex on him and that she saw Gary Glitter having sex with a girl in Savile's dressing room.  10.41pm BST James Reed is now taking Newsnight watchers through a summary of today's events, which includes images from the original investigation last year.It includes words from Karin Ward, a former pupil at Duncroft approved School (which Jimmy Savile visited repeatedly) who provided some of the key evidence against Savile.She is shown being interviewed by Liz MacKean, the Newsnight journalist who has spoken publicy about her unhappiness at how the item was dropped.Updated at 1.11am BST 10.36pm BST Jeremy Paxman is wearing his best poker face for tonight's Newsnight.He opens with: It's been a bad day for the BBC but we can at least take some comfort that much of the damage that was done came from the BBC 10.30pm BST Coming late to coverage, or (no shame in it) a little bewildered by the sheer pace of developments surrounding the Savile scandal and the fall-out at the BBC?Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian's head of media and technology, has penned a piece looking back at the past 11 days of turmoil at the corporation.While BBC grandees were reluctant to point finger over the axed Newsnight report, he traces how inconsistencies emerged. 10.15pm BST Some commentary now from the twittersphere, where Phillip Blond of the ResPublica thinktank is among those coming to the defence of Peter Rippon, the Newsnight editor responsible for dropping a report into claims Savile sexually abused people:Phillip Blond (@Phillip_Blond)Peter Rippon is another good man scarified to contemporary madness - lets not prosecute the BBC because we can't imprison SavilleOctober 22, 2012Simon Hattenstone, of this parish, is meanwhile among those noting the somewhat surreal aspect to coverage tonight:Simon Hattenstone (@shattenstone)BBC news leads with investigation intobbc investigation about BBC investigation. post-modernism gone madOctober 22, 2012Updated at 1.10am BST 10.08pm BST BBC News Home Editor Mark Easton (whose report on the Savile affair is currently going out on the broadcaster's 10 o'clock news) has posted a blog entitled: 'why BBC Panorama is investigating BBC Newsnight'.He says that, to the general public, there may be something almost bizarre about the editor of one of BBC journalism's flagships - Panorama - commissioning an investigation into why the editor of another of BBC journalism's flagships - Newsnight - decommissioned an investigation.But he adds: ... at stake is something the corporation regards as one of its crown jewels - the independence of its journalism.Any suggestion that news reporters were prevented from broadcasting a story because of its inconvenience to the corporation could undermine the credibility of BBC News.And so the fact Panorama is able to investigate editorial decisions within the Corporation is seen as evidence of a vital freedom. 9.52pm BST David Cameron has insisted he has not ruled out further inquiries into the Savile scandal but said he did not want to "slow down the search for the truth".That's according to a transcript of his interview with ITV 1's The Agenda, which goes out in about forty minutes time.The Prime Minister said earlier today that it was "concerning" that the BBC effectively changed its story about why it dropped last year's Newsnight report into child abuse Savile.In the interview with The Agenda, he said: We've got two independent BBC inquiries; we've got three inquiries at the NHS covering Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General.I made sure the Department of Health has got a separate inquiry to oversee that with someone independent. I think if we added another inquiry.... What this is, there are some victims who have suffered terribly and I think we've got to remember them at the absolute heart of this, these women and boys and others that are coming forward... and they must be able to tell their stories and these inquiries must be independent enough to get to the truth.Asked if he envisaged a phone-hacking style inquiry covering all of the allegations, he said: No, I think the inquiries we've got are right. I don't rule out further inquiries. We've got about six under way and I think if you added another one it might slow down the search for the truth. I think the most important one is the judge...former judge...looking at the BBC and the cultural practices and I think we should allow that to get to the truth. 9.40pm BST Ahead of tonight's broadcasts, there is some food for thought from Mark Damazer, master of St Peter's College, Oxford, and a former high ranking BBC figure who had stints as a controller of Radio 4 and as a deputy director of BBC News.In a piece for the Guardian, he says that the BBC relishes a good self-kicking but that Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and his superiors don't deserve it:  People under this degree of constant pressure are, from time to time, going to miscalculate.Who wouldn't? Maybe the BBC could have made this or that move a bit earlier. Maybe. But I do not see an organisation that is being cavalier about Savile or Newsnight, or even particularly defensive.The BBC lives by noble ideals, of course often imperfectly executed, and is trying to get to the bottom of it.I know that many licence-payers will feel let down. But the BBC has recovered before from editorial dramas – and we ought not to enjoy its misfortunes. 8.48pm BST Good evening and welcome to our live blog coverage of the deepening fall-out from the sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile and the controversy over the BBC's handling of the affair.The next couple of hours will potentially be extremely uncomfortable ones for certain figures at the Beeb as the corporation airs an investigation by a team at Panorama into what happened at Newsnight late last year when an item into the Savile claims was dropped.It emerged earlier today that the Newsnight editor responsible for dropping that report, Peter Rippon, is to step aside, as the BBC was forced to admit that Newsnight was aware of allegations that Savile had abused teenagers on the corporation's premises and had unearthed information not previously known to the police.The BBC said that Rippon's initial explanation as to why he killed off a Newsnight investigation into Savile in December 2011 was "inaccurate or incomplete in some respects". The corporation has made three corrections to a blogpost written by Rippon, which was published on 2 October, when the Savile abuse allegations first became public. We will be keeping an eye on Panorama, which airs at 10.35pm on BBC 1, reaction to it and also tonight's Newsnight itself, which will start on BBC 2 at 10.30pm.In addition, ITV 1's The Agenda goes out at 10.35pm with a pre-recorded interview with David Cameron in which he has made another intervention into the affair.Updated at 9.28pm BST
