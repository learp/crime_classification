A primary school caretaker was found guilty today of carrying out a nationwide letter bomb campaign in which eight people were injured.Miles Cooper, 27, from Cambridge, denied the charges but told a jury at Oxford crown court that the bombs were a protest at what he described as "overbearing" state control over the individual.The devices, constructed out of party poppers and nails or broken glass, were sent to addresses in London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Kent, Birmingham and Swansea over a period of two weeks in January and February this year.The targets were three forensic science laboratories, a computer company, an accountancy firm, the DVLA and a residential address.Five of the seven devices sent through the post exploded. Those who opened the padded envelopes were showered in glass fragments or nails, the court heard.Adjourning sentencing until tomorrow, Judge Julian Hall told the jury he "wholeheartedly" agreed with their verdict.Michelle Evans, of Orchid Cellmark in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, was the first person injured in the letter bomb campaign on January 18.Michael and Rosemary Winfield were the next people hurt on February 3, after they received a device at their home in Folkestone, Kent.Another letter bomb was opened by staff at Capita in Victoria, central London, on February 5. No one at the firm, which deals with the administration of congestion charging, including fines, was hurt.The following day, Richard Gorringe was injured by a letter bomb sent to Vantis, an accountancy firm based in Wokingham. The firm deals with the post for Speed Check, a safety camera supplier.Meanwhile, staff at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea were injured by another device on February 7.Following the verdict, George Wingfield, one those injured by the letter bombs, said: "I'm as happy as I can be I suppose."During his testimony, Cooper said his bomb campaign was a protest against Britain's "surveillance society".
