A football fan who ran on to the pitch and punched a player has been jailed for 12 weeks.Robert Fitzgerald, 24, was also banned from attending regulated football matches in England and Wales for six years after assaulting Stevenage defender Scott Laird.Fitzgerald had previously admitted invading the pitch and punching Laird as fans celebrated the club's 3-1 win against Newcastle United in the FA Cup on 8 January.The altercation, which was captured by TV cameras, occurred because the player had previously had a relationship with Fitzgerald's girlfriend and "not treated her correctly", Stevenage magistrates court was told.His pregnant girlfriend, Jade Coles, wept as he was led away from the dock.Sentencing him, the chair of the bench, Linda Nadauld said: "The offence was fuelled by alcohol, and it has become clear from the television evidence that you made a beeline for this particular player."We have also heard evidence that a steward noticed disorderly behaviour from you directed towards Mr Laird."The victim was in a vulnerable position as he was in the location to fulfil his duties as a professional football player. The attack was unprovoked and unexpected."The court must impose a deterrent sentence to stop this type of behaviour and conduct on a football field."
