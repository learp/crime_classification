From skateboarding to dog mess, busking to swinging from bridges, parish councils are to be given sweeping new powers to deliver instant justice.Britain's oldest form of democratic government will be able to impose fixed-penalty fines of up to Â£100, and set local laws without seeking the approval of central government.Some will see the plans as a busybodies' charter, but supporters believe Thursday's local government white paper may also breathe life into local democracy.At present, bylaws, often enshrined in tiny print on village noticeboards, must be sent to Ruth Kelly, the communities and local government secretary, for her approval, or, if relevant, the transport secretary.Once established, bylaws can be cumbersome to enforce - breaches are dealt with through magistrates courts. By introducing fixed penalty fines, however, the procedure will be speeded up so parish councils will have an immediate power to control their local miscreants.Ms Kelly apparently believes that, as bylaws are local laws dealing with local issues, they should be set locally in consultation with people in the area, without any reference to central government.Councils currently can seek to pass bylaws on anything that is not covered by national legislation. Ms Kelly, or her officials, can veto any measure if they believe it will be "repugnant" to existing national legislation, or it is deemed unreasonable. Reflecting the Victorian legislation from which they stem, they can cover issues such as "people nuisance in public walks, pleasure gardens and open spaces".In practice, the subjects covered can be gloriously varied, ranging from issues such as playing dangerous ball games near a highway; interfering with life-saving equipment; riding cycles on grass verges used by pedestrians; touting for business through flyers; climbing upon and hanging from bridges; setting up circuses; and urinating in public places.Under the proposals, the fixed-penalty fines will be imposed by police, community support officers and some local authority officers.But senior judiciary and the Conservatives are opposing the increasing use of fixed-penalty fines by the government, claiming summary justice breaches the fundamental principle that the prosecutor in a case should not also determine guilt and set the penalty.It is not yet clear whether it will be possible for an offender to plead not guilty to a bylaw offence and take his case to a magistrates court.There are 8,700 parish and town councils covering 30% of the population. There are indications that the white paper will enable setting up more parish councils. Their powers to pass bylaws largely derive from legislation more than 100 years old, including the Public Health Act 1875 or the Open Spaces Act 1906.Ms Kelly has been struck by surveys conducted for her department showing that people want to have a greater stake in their local neighbourhood.Two-thirds of those asked did not believe they could influence decisions affecting their local area. Just one in five was satisfied with the opportunities available to them to participate in local decision-making, with one in three dissatisfied.Ms Kelly will set out new powers for people to ask local councillors to review decisions or consider improvements to local services on their behalf. This can cover all areas of a council's work from street lighting, waste and housing to leisure facilities.There will also be a new duty to publish public satisfaction indicators to ensure authorities are more customer-focused on how they deliver services.Ms Kelly has been hamstrung in what she can do in the local government white paper as the comprehensive spending review, which will take into account the report on local government financing being conducted by Sir Michael Lyons, is due next year.
