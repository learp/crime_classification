Appeal court judges began hearing test cases today that could lead to the quashing of scores of murder convictions where witnesses were allowed to give evidence anonymously.A panel of five judges is deciding how emergency legislation on witness anonymity should apply to cases tried before the law came into effect in July this year.The 2008 Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act, designed to protect witnesses from intimidation, was introduced after a landmark ruling by the law lords in June that defendants had a right to face their accusers.The ruling in effect outlawed the practice of allowing unnamed and unseen "screened" witnesses to give crucial prosecution evidence.The following week the Crown Prosecution Service sought an adjournment in all cases using anonymous witnesses. Under the Act, a trial judge will still have the power to allow witnesses to keep their identity secret in the particular circumstances of the case.While the Act is designed to ensure that convictions cannot be quashed on appeal solely because anonymous evidence was used, it says that anonymity should not in general be granted to witnesses whose testimony is the "sole and decisive evidence" against the accused person.It is that provision which is at the centre of the appeal hearing.In one of the five test appeals, convicted murderer Junior Glasgow - jailed for life for shooting dead a youth worker in a confrontation over a stolen gold chain in Brixton, south London - claims he did not get a fair trial.His lawyers told a court headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, that the case against him was based almost entirely on the evidence of anonymous witnesses, whose testimony was "decisive".The trial judge had accepted at face value the "protestations of fear" expressed by the witnesses.Without knowing who the witnesses were, Glasgow was unable to instruct his defence team as to whether he was acquainted with a witness or whether the witness might have a motive for lying, it was argued.The hearing continues tomorrow.
