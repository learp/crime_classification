Delays in information being shared by agencies, staffing problems and insufficient training led to failures to intervene in the case of a four-year-old boy beaten to death by his mother and stepfather, a report has found.Daniel Pelka died of a head injury after a campaign of abuse by his mother, Magdelena Luczak, and his stepfather, former soldier Mariusz Krezolek, both of whom were last year jailed for a minimum of 30 years for his murder.An independent report by Coventry Safeguarding Children Board on Wednesday found delays in information being shared by health professionals, school staff and social workers along with staffing difficulties and insufficient training led to failures to help Daniel.A serious case review published by the board last year found that Daniel was "invisible" at times, with numerous chances missed by agencies to help him.The new report comes after Edward Timpson, children and families minister, requested a more detailed analysis of why mistakes occurred following the publication of the damning serious case review.The report, carried out by independent experts, found there were delays in recording information on social work records. The delays were due to the challenges involved in managing the volume of information in relation to domestic violence and insufficient administrative support within children's social care, the report said.The report also found "unacceptable delays" in circulating the minutes of a strategy meeting that looked at a broken arm suffered by Daniel in 2011. In particular, there was "insufficient management oversight" to ensure that the minutes were circulated, the document said.It also noted that such delays were not unusual at the time due to work pressures in children's social care, including insufficient administrative support.The report also found that health visitors and Daniel's school nurse did not have a full picture of his family's circumstances because there were no family records within community health services. Central allocation of health visitor tasks such as developmental checks or new birth visits resulted in a lack of consistency in work with the family, the report said.Daniel's school was unable to form an accurate assessment of need and risk to the pupil owing to inconsistent use of its recording systems and information not being brought together in a central place, the report found. This was due to lack of effective leadership within the school and insufficient school-focused training and external scrutiny in relation to the development of safe, effective child protection systems, it added.
