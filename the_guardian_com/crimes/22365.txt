A police scheme under which officers are authorised to remove valuable items from unlocked cars could mean that they are breaking the law, a top criminal lawyer warned today.The shock tactics have been employed to encourage motorists to lock their vehicles. Officers have been told they can remove valuable items such as handbags, computers and satnavs, leaving a note telling the owner that they can pick the item up from a local police station.The scheme has been introduced in the affluent area of Richmond upon Thames in south-west London, which suffers from a high number of thefts from cars, but solicitor Louise Christian said police could be breaking the law."The way for the police to encourage the law to be kept, is not to engage in something that verges on lawbreaking," she said. "If this was done by a private person they would undoubtedly be prosecuted for theft."Christian said the law governing theft means that apart from taking someone else's goods, a person must intend to permanently deprive them of it to be found guilty of theft.She said people could sue the police for trespass, but the amount of damages an individual might be entitled to would be unlikely to make it worthwhile.Police have defended the scheme, saying it helps drive the message home to motorists to lock their cars."The 'vulnerable vehicles scheme' has been running for just over a year in this borough. We recently revamped it to add in a process whereby officers can seize items of high-value property from the car and retain them for safe keeping whilst attempts are made to contact the owner," said Chief Inspector Duncan Slade of Richmond police."Since the start of the scheme we have identified 366 cars where property was either on display or the car was insecure or both. Since the scheme was revamped at the start of July ... we have identified 55 such cars."Although property has only been seized from one vehicle there have been 25 occasions where officers have been on the verge of seizing property only for the owners to return to their cars. These people are then given some advice about crime prevention measures to take in future."The message to car owners is, help us to help you."A Richmond council spokesman said: "We do have an issue with theft in the borough and particularly theft from cars."We see our borough as a green and pleasant suburban place and this can lull householders and car owners into a false sense of security in that they leave house keys under flowerpots and display items prominently in unlocked cars."
