Tony Blair yesterday accepted that levels of crime and the fear of crime remained too high, as he published a five-year plan aimed at reducing crime by 15% by 2008. Community policing A new neighbourhood approach will be pursued. The number of community support officers is to rise from 5,000 now to 25,000 by 2008, thanks to £50m of new money, and reduced bureaucracy freeing an extra 12,000 police officers to work on the front line. A Safer and Stronger Communities Fund, worth £660m over three years, will help local authorities and police target high crime areas through better security and CCTV, while the highest crime areas will receive extra policing, school holiday programmes, more intensive support for drug users, and support for families through Sure Start children's centres.Under plans to be published in the autumn, communities plagued by crime will be able to trigger snap inspections of their local police by gathering petitions to make police more responsive to local needs.Anti-social behaviour Increasing the number of anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) is credited with giving communities the confidence to take a zero-tolerance approach to antisocial behaviour. The plan aims to expand the number of designated areas from 12 to 50. Police and councils will be able to impose fixed penalty notices for misuse of fireworks, criminal damage and minor theft, including on 10 to 15-year-olds. Specialist prosecutors - 12 at present - and specialist antisocial behaviour response courts will ensure swift justice. Legal aid for Asbo cases will be streamlined to avoid late guilty pleas, and children under 16 who breach Asbos may lose their right to anonymity. Repeat offenders With 100,000 people committing half of all crime, and 5,000 committing one in 10 crimes, the plan envisages a blitz against "prolific offenders", subsuming the current persistent offender programme. Police, probation, and youth offending teams will identify main offenders in their areas and intensively monitor, catch and punish them. An extra 1,000 drug-using offenders a week should be directed into treatment. Tagging - which has been applied to 150,000 people since 1999 and up to 9,000 people at any one time - will be increased by up to 100% by 2008, and from September satellite tracking will be piloted for sex offenders, perpetrators of domestic violence and prolific offenders after prison. Offenders will be managed during their sentence through a new National Offender Management Service, and given greater support to find work and accommodation, to reduce reoffending by 5% by 2008, and 10% by the end of the decade. Criminal justice system By 2008, more than 150,000 more offences should be brought to justice each year. Legal advice from the CPS to police will be provided 24/7 to encourage earlier guilty pleas and make sure the right charges are brought, and more people will be diverted from court through fixed penalty notices and conditional cautions. Cases will arrive at court ready to proceed, cutting wasted trial hearings, and there will be greater enforcement of court orders, with rigorous collection of fines.Victims and witnesses' experience of the courts will also be "as painless as possible" with separate waiting facilities. They will have a right to minimum standards of service from each criminal justice agency.Immigration and asylum Despite a backlog of 24,500 applications, the removal of failed asylum seekers is 75% higher than in 1997, with 13,000 people now being removed a year and further increases intended for 2008. A new electronic tracking sys tem will be rolled out from 2008, which will photograph everyone who has boarded transport for the UK, check them against databases of individuals who pose a security risk, and keep an electronic record of entry into the country. Legislation for the introduction of national ID cards will take place by 2008, and all non-EU citizens coming into the country for more than three months will have one.Home Office Staff at the departmental headquarters will be cut by 30% or 2,700 to free up £100m for the front line, and better technology will ensure office functions are streamlined.By 2007/8, the Home Office will spend £2.8bn a year more on public services than at present, and improve value for money to the taxpayer by at least 3% or £1.97m a year.
