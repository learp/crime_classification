Police in Lancashire are searching for a thief using a wheeled walking frame who was captured on closed circuit television stealing a purse from a shelf next to a cashpoint at a bank in Morecambe. The purse contained several hundred pounds.The bank's CCTV camera clearly shows the woman, believed to be in her 70s or 80s, arriving at the Lloyds TSB bank. She immediately notices the purse, leans over and grabs it, before briefly pausing as if to check if she has been noticed and rapidly heading for the exit. Lancashire police hope someone will recognise the woman from the CCTV footage, which lasts just 15 seconds. She is wearing a long grey skirt and matching cardigan and cream shoes. The theft took place on the morning of 28 April at approximately 9.46am according to police, who say the purse contained Â£340 in cash plus bank cards.The owner of the purse, Donna Mansfield, 41, said she realised her mistake when she arrived home and found her purse was missing. She returned to the bank to check the cashpoint machine but by then it was gone."My little boy is three on 19 May and part of the money was for stuff for his party," she said. "I had already bought some presents but we can't afford a party how. My husband and I also planned a meal out for our first wedding anniversary, but we can't afford that either. We never get out and it is very upsetting."I could strangle whoever took the purse. It's left us in a rut as it was all our bill money."Mansfield's dark brown and leopardskin purse contained various bank cards, a TV licence and cash.A police spokesman said: "Inquiries reveal that the woman who picked up the purse was not known to bank staff. Her lack of mobility would suggest she is a local." Anyone who recognises the woman is urged to contact Lancashire police.
