Four more police officers are being investigated by the police watchdog over the treatment of a disabled man murdered by a vigilante who branded him a paedophile.Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, repeatedly contacted Avon and Somerset police complaining that he was the victim of antisocial behaviour and was being unfairly targeted by his neighbours in Bristol.Ebrahimi begged officers to help, telling them he did not feel safe in his own home, just hours before he was beaten to death and his body set on fire by neighbour Lee James, 24, last July.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said on Friday it had issued another four investigation notices to Avon and Somerset police officers.It has carried out two further criminal interviews with two officers and one PCSO as part of an investigation into police actions before Ebrahimi's death."These are further steps in an intricate and complex investigation into how Avon and Somerset police dealt with Mr Ebrahimi before his shocking murder," IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said."As this investigation unfolds it is imperative that we address all the evidence emerging – so that we get to the truth of what happened. This is what the public rightly expects of us and we continue to update all interested parties, so that progress and lines of inquiry are clear."We are carrying out a thorough and robust independent inquiry into police contact with Mr Ebrahimi as swiftly as we can. We are following where the evidence leads, and the number of officers and staff under scrutiny gives some indication of the scale of an investigation which is looking at police contact with Mr Ebrahimi going back several years."The four additional notices have been served on an inspector and two sergeants, and on a police constable and PCSO. The inspector and two sergeants relate to Ebrahimi's period in custody, while the police constable and PCSO were part of the police response to calls on 12 July – hours before his death.The notices are official notification that the officers are under investigation for misconduct offences. They take the total number of officers under investigation in relation to the murder of Ebrahimi to nine.Three of these nine officers are under investigation for suspected criminal offences.An inspector, sergeant and a constable who dealt with Ebrahimi in custody on 12 July 2013 have already been interviewed for gross conduct.A spokesman for the IPCC said: "We have since withdrawn the notice for gross misconduct against another inspector who has been advised that he is no longer subject to IPCC investigation. A control room supervisor, a dispatcher and four call handlers who dealt with phone calls from Mr Ebrahimi have also been interviewed by the IPCC for gross misconduct."This means that in addition to the nine officers under investigation there are a seven civilian police staff under investigation."James, of Capgrave Crescent, Brislington, Bristol, pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years imprisonment.Stephen Norley, 25, who lived next door to James, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender after obtaining white spirit and helping to drag Ebrahimi's body to where it was set alight. He was jailed for four years.A postmortem report found Ebrahimi suffered multiple heavy blows to the face and head, and died before he was set alight.
