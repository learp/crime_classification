Police searched the home of Shafilea Ahmed in the Great Sankey area of Warrington. They found song lyrics in the Muslim teenager's bedroom which spoke of her unhappiness.In one song, Happy Families, the teenager refers to a clash of cultures and her family's preoccupation with "honour".I don't pretend like we're the perfectfamily no more.Desire to live is burning.My stomach is turningBut all they think about is honour.I was like a normal teenage kidDidn't ask 2 muchI just wanted to fit inBut my culture was differentBut my family ignored.A second song, I Feel Trapped, refers to an unspecified event that changed her previously happy life.It was my last year in schoolSo happy with my friends I got lots to doBut came this day when everythingchangedI came home it seemed like a normal dayBut sumthing wasn't rightI wish I coulda changed the eventI shoulda killed myself insteadI'd rather have been deadCoz now I have a burden on my chestAnd no it won't go away, the guilt,the pain.In the chorus she wrote:I feel trapped, so trapped, I'm trappedI'm trapped, so trapped, I'm trapped(I don't know wot to do) I feel trapped
