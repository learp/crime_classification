The family of student Anuj Bidve, who was shot dead in Salford on Boxing Day, are travelling from their home in India to the UK to repatriate their son's body. They are understood to be flying into Heathrow and will visit parliament, for talks with Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, who was contacted by the family last week about their concerns over the police investigation into the murder.It is understood that the family left India on Wednesday afternoon from Mumbai and will travel to Heathrow - it is not clear when they will arrive.But they will go to Salford to pay their tributes at the place where their son was murdered. A vigil was also held there this week by members of the community who were horrified by his death.Officers from Greater Manchester police have travelled to India, to meet Bidve's relatives, amid criticism that the family learned of their son's death through Facebook.Greater Manchester police said the family will be visiting Manchester on Friday.Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson, who travelled to India to meet the family, said it was not uncommon to send officers to other countries if the victim's family come from outside the UK. "The visit of Greater Manchester Police officers to India has been with this purpose in mind," he said. "Our role has been to meet the family, to explain about the case so far and of course to go through the last moments of Anuj's life with them as we understand them to be from the investigation so far."He said they were able to fill in some of the gaps in understanding of the events leading up to Anuj's death. "We remain in close contact and shall be so for the coming months, if not years."A 20-year-old man, Kieran Stapleton, has been charged with murder and remanded in custody.
