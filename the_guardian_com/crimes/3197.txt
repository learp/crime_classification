The mother of Maxine Carr was jailed yesterday for intimidating a witness in the Soham murder trial, despite evidence that she was suffering chronic post-traumatic stress at the time of the offence.Judge John Reddihough sentenced Shirley Capp to six months in prison, rejecting pleas by her barrister that she had already suffered enough by being vilified by the press.A jury at Sheffield crown court last month convicted Capp, 61, of intimidating her neighbour in Grimsby, Marion Westerman after she gave a police statement about what she observed in the days after the deaths of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002.Ms Westerman told police she saw Ms Carr weeping as she peered into the boot of her boyfriend Ian Huntley's car.Police believed this suggested Ms Carr may have known soon after the double murder that Huntley had killed the girls and transported their bodies in the car.In May 2003, at which time her daughter was in prison awaiting trial, Capp told Ms Westerman, 36, she "was going to be dead" if she gave evidence at the Old Bailey.Gordon Stables, for Capp, said her behaviour was out of character. "She [Capp] has been thrown into the public eye in a way which has vilified her as being equally as vile as her daughter."The court was told that Capp was diagnosed as suffering chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. When she gave evidence, Capp described how she was besieged in her home by the media after Ms Carr's arrest.Judge Reddihough told Capp he had taken into account the "difficulties you have faced and continue to face by reason of the notoriety of your daughter, Maxine Carr".But he said her neighbour had been "extremely upset and frightened" and had expressed the wish not to give evidence.The judge said: "This is a serious offence and in recent years, courts have been very concerned at the increased number of witnesses that are threatened or intimidated. It would send out completely the wrong message should a custodial sentence not be imposed."Ms Westerman did give evidence at the trial. However, the jury did not believe that Ms Carr - who changed her surname after her father and mother split up - had known that Huntley had killed the girls when she gave him a false alibi. She was cleared of the more serious offence of assisting an offender but convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Ms Carr was released from prison in May.
