An 84-year-old man who left a bogus bomb at his dentist in a revenge attack for apparently being overcharged was given a suspended jail term and banned from the surgery for life yesterday.Peter McShane of Pembroke Dock, Wales, threaded wires through a box, placed a ticking clock inside and carried it to his local dental surgery. The large oblong box, weighed down by a brick, triggered a major police operation when it was discovered on 15 February. Homes surrounding the surgery were evacuated and the box was destroyed in a controlled explosion.McShane was living in Ettrick House, in nearby Laws Street, at the time and was among those evacuated when the police were called. Despite witnessing the scale of the action he failed to tell the police the bomb was bogus.The hoax was the climax of a catalogue of attacks on the dental surgery triggered by a visit in October 2007 when he was charged Â£187. Despite eventually being refunded the full amount, anger at what he believed was an unreasonable rate prompted a series of attacks.McShane was sentenced to 34 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, when he appeared at Swansea crown court. Judge Keith Thomas told him he had only been spared jail because of his advanced age and previous clean character."I have to sentence you for a catalogue of offences carried out by a vindictive man determined to get his own back on those who had upset him," the judge told him. "If you continue with your vindictive behaviour the court will have no option but to sentence you to prison."The judge imposed a restraining order prohibiting McShane from attending the dental surgery for an indefinite period. He said: "If you go back to those premises and continue your vendetta against them you will be committing an offence and will be brought back to court to answer for it." The judge also imposed a three-month curfew order on McShane operating during the hours of darkness.McShane had admitted making the bogus bomb and placing it on the surgery's steps at an earlier hearing.
