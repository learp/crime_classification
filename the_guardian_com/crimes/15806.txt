The number of young motorists involved in accidents while under the influence of alcohol is increasing despite high profile anti-drink-drive publicity campaigns, police warned yesterday.Scotland Yard revealed that almost a quarter of all offenders and casualties in London were aged between 17 and 24 and, according to a survey by Radio 1's Newsbeat, a similar picture has emerged across the whole country.Sgt Ivan Stafford, of Leicestershire police, said: "They're the majority of the casualties, they're the majority of the offenders. And the numbers of people being killed in a drink-related accident have increased dramatically."And they're killing themselves, they're mutilating themselves, which is such a tragic waste of life."Figures from the Department for Transport support the police warnings: there were 1,050 17 to 19-year-olds involved in drink-drive accidents in England and Wales in 2005, the latest year for which figures are available, compared with 810 in 1995. For 20 to 25-year-olds, the figure increased from 2,170 to 2,280 in the same period.Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, called for an urgent reduction in the drink-drive limit. He said police should be given powers to breath test motorists anywhere and at any time. "Studies have shown that cutting the drink-drive limit from 80mg to 50mg would save 65 lives and 230 serious injuries on Britain's roads each year," he said.
