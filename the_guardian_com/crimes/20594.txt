The family of a teenager stabbed to death as he filled his car with petrol last night described their horror at the killing.Hassan Kul Hawadleh, a second year journalism student at the University of East London, was one of two teenagers killed in separate incidents within hours of each other in London on Thursday night.The 19-year-old was attacked in Wealdstone, north-west London, shortly after 7.30pm when he was confronted by a gang of up to eight people on a petrol station forecourt. Another teenager who was with Hawadleh was also stabbed.Police said he was in a stable condition in hospital last night.Speaking from the family home in Colin足dale, north London, Hawadleh's sister, Ubed, described him as the baby of the house."We can't believe this, it is a mystery why it would happen," she said. "I'm still in shock, it feels like I'm living in a bad dream. Obviously we're all incredibly upset."Chief Inspector Nigel Crane of Harrow police said: "There is a suspect we are 足certainly looking for at this time, but we have not found him yet."Three hours after Hawadleh was killed, a 17-year-old was found by a member of public with stab wounds near Maryland railway station in Stratford, east London.The Metropolitan police said the 足teenager, named as Michael Simon Wright, had been stabbed in the torso."He was taken to Royal London hospital but died shortly after arriving." Police said no arrests have been made in either case.The murders happened a day after three teenagers, aged between 16 and 17, were stabbed in a suspected gang fight in Chingford, east London.Three teenagers have died in 足London so far this year as a result of violent incidents.
