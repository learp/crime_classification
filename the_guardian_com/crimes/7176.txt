The beleaguered home secretary, Charles Clarke, was today facing new embarrassment over the handling of foreign prisoners after the Home Office admitted more than 900 had no recorded nationality.The admission means the number of overseas nationals behind bars could be even bigger than the official reported level of more than 10,000 - already a record.It has exposed further evidence of lax record-keeping and poor communication between the prison service and immigration officials, and comes after Tuesday's revelation that more than 1,000 foreign prisoners had been freed before being considered for deportation.Yesterday, it emerged that, since warnings about the problem last year, 288 foreign prisoners had been freed before deportation was considered. Mr Clarke has already twice offered to resign over the fiasco."At the end of February 2006, there were 915 prisoners in prison establishments in England and Wales with no nationality recorded on the central IT system," a Home Office spokesman said:The spokesman said prison rules required the immigration service to be notified when a foreign national prisoner arrived at reception and then again when they were convicted and sentenced.Their eligibility for deportation was a matter for immigration officials, he added.BBC Radio 4's Today programme also reported that another 600 prisoners had "falsely claimed to be British".Mr Clarke faces another key test today when recorded crime figures for the final three months of last year are released. When the previous quarter's figures were published earlier this year, violent crime had risen by 4%, including an 11% jump in robbery.A similar trend in today's statistics could inflict further damage on the home secretary.His continuing difficulties follow a torrid day for the government. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, was forced to go to ground after admitting an affair with his diary secretary, and Patricia Hewitt was heckled and barracked during a televised speech at a nurses' conference.The work and pensions secretary, John Hutton, today insisted the government would not be distracted by the run of embarrassing stories."The only response for us to make in these circumstances is to go on governing in the interests of the country, and that is what we are going to do," he said on GMTV."[We are going] to make the big judgment calls and to get them right for people at home and also for our relationships abroad. We are not going to get distracted by these sorts of rows"Mr Hutton insisted Britain was "better, stronger and fairer" since Labour came to power in 1997, and said the government would continue to apply the manifesto on which it was elected last year.He said Mr Prescott needed space to resolve his situation, but said he believed he would be attending the cabinet meeting today."John will be at cabinet this morning," he said. "Charles has got the absolute full support of not just the prime minister, but of every member of the cabinet."He is doing a brilliant job as home secretary, and he is on the public's side trying to sort this problem out."
