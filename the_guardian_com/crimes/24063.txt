New moves were announced yesterday to stem the wave of gangland gun crime in south Manchester which has resulted in 27 violent deaths in less than four years.Greater Manchester police have joined forces with the city council and the probation service to launch Britain's first team approach to halt the tide of killings and injuries. The joint strategy involves both cracking down on known offenders and employing outreach workers who work in schools, youth clubs and on the streets to divert those at risk away from gangs and crime. Chief Superintendent Adrian Lee, commander of south Manchester division, said at yesterday's launch that Mmags - the Manchester multi-agency gang strategy - would investigate the reasons for crime as well as crime itself. "Why do young people join gangs and what can we do to stop them?" he said. "These gangs have been born out of lack of hope in young people and we have let a lot of them down in our society." The initiative was welcomed by Patsy Mckie who helped launch Mothers Against Violence after her son Dorrie, 20, died in 1999 near his home in Hulme after being chased and shot was by three youths on bikes. "We all see the symptoms [of gang violence] and need to be working on the causes," she said.
