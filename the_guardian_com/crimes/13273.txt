The grandmother of a five-year-old girl who was mauled to death by a pit bull terrier-type dog was yesterday charged with manslaughter. Ellie Lawrenson suffered severe head and neck injuries in the attack by her uncle's pet at her grandmother Jackie Simpson's home in St Helens, Merseyside, early on New Year's Day.The one-year-old dog, Reuben, was owned by Ellie's uncle, Kiel Simpson, 23. He has since been charged with possession of a dangerous dog.Mrs Simpson's granddaughter had been staying overnight at her house while her parents, Darren and Lindsey, were out celebrating New Year's Eve.The Crown Prosecution Service said Mrs Simpson had also been charged with possession of diamorphine.The fatal attack happened at 4.20am on New Year's Day. Ellie's grandmother had allowed her to stay up so her parents could see her after they returned from a party at approximately 3.30am, expecting her to be put straight to bed. However, she was allowed to stay up even later.Colin Davies, of Merseyside CPS, said he had decided to prosecute after careful consideration of all the material. "I made the decision that there was sufficient evidence and authorised that Kiel Simpson should be charged with the possession of a dangerous dog, namely a pit bull terrier, and Jackie Simpson with the manslaughter of Ellie Lawrenson and possession of a controlled drug, diamorphine," he said at a news conference yesterday.The chief crown prosecutor, Paul Whittaker, said the charges should highlight the perils of keeping dangerous dogs. He said: "Many people throughout Merseyside and the UK were shocked by the terrible and violent death of five-year-old Ellie Lawrenson on New Year's Day this year. She had been savaged by a pit bull terrier-type dog belonging to her uncle while she had been left and cared for by her grandmother."This was another deadly attack by a pit bull terrier and this tragic case once again highlights the very real danger these dogs present."Detective Superintendent Stephen Brougham, of Merseyside police, said: "A team of police officers have spent three months piecing together the circumstances surrounding the tragic death.The CPS have decided, based on the evidence gathered, to charge Jackie and Kiel Simpson." He said they had been bailed to appear at Liverpool magistrates court next Wednesday.
