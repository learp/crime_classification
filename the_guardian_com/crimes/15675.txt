Detectives were questioning two men yesterday about the murder of the City financier John Monckton.The 49-year-old and his wife, Homeyra, 45, were stabbed in their Chelsea home on November 29. Police believe two burglars, one dressed as a postman, tricked their way in. The couple's nine-year-old daughter, Isobel, phoned for help, but Mr Monckton died later in hospital. Mrs Monckton is still recovering from major surgery, but her condition is stable. Their elder daughter, Sabrina, 12, was at boarding school. The murder sent shock waves through one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods. But some locals said burglaries had become more common, and an elderly man was beaten and left for dead nearby last year. Mr Monckton, who was the managing director of the bonds department of Legal & General, belonged to a long-established Catholic family. His cousin Rosa Monckton, the wife of Sunday Telegraph editor Dominic Lawson, was a close friend of Princess Diana. Police think one man was injured during the attack, as a trail of blood was found leading from the house on Upper Cheyne Walk. Both suspects made their escape through Glebe Place and Bramerton into King's Road. The two men are being questioned at separate London police stations. One was arrested in the west of the city at midnight on Tuesday, the other in south London at 2am yesterday. Officers previously arrested a man in his 30s in connection with the investigation. He was bailed to return to a west London police station in January, pending further inquiries.
