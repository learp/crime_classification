A 12-year-old boy who was one of the youngest people to go on trial for murder at the Old Bailey was yesterday cleared of the crime.The child, 11 at the time of the attack, admitted "dutifully" fetching a knife used to fatally stab a 15-year-old Somalian refugee, Kaiser Osman. But he claimed he believed his then 14-year-old cousin - who was yesterday cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of provocation - had only wanted the weapon to scare the victim. The 12-year-old, who wore his school uniform throughout the three week trial, began swaying after the jury found him not guilty of murder and manslaughter. After the hearing, Detective Constable David Leach spoke of the difficulty of questioning a child who was so young the interviews had to be interspersed with discussions about sweets and comics. "It was difficult to make him understand all the legal requirements we were obliged to give him," he said. The court heard that Kaiser, whose family fled to Britain in 1989 to escape the war in Somalia, was stabbed through the heart outside a youth club on the Church End estate in Harlesden, north London, on March 12 this year after the 12-year-old's cousin told him to fetch "the biggest, sharpest" knife he could find. The younger boy, who had never been in trouble with the police before, told the court he ran home, climbed in through a window and picked up a kitchen knife - later found by police wrapped in a copy of The Voice newspaper featuring an article about the trial of Damilola Taylor. But the child said he did not realise his cousin, who left Kaiser to bleed to death, would harm him. "I thought he was going to try to scare Kaiser," he explained. "I didn't think he was going to kill him". The elder defendant, who admitted stabbing Kaiser and said he lost control because of previous incidents when he felt bullied, was remanded into secure accommodation until October 25, when he will be sentenced following further reports.
