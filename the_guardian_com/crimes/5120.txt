Two brothers have been remanded in custody after a judge ordered them back to court over abusive Facebook messages posted shortly after they were handed suspended prison terms.Daniel Sledden, 27, mocked Judge Beverley Lunt online within 90 minutes of his original sentencing for drug dealing.Samuel Sledden, 22, also posted an offensive comment barely 40 minutes after he received a suspended sentence over his involvement in the supply of cannabis.Both defendants, from Accrington in Lancashire, were recalled to court on Tuesday as Lunt ordered a review of their two-year jail sentences, suspended for two years.Daniel Sledden had posted: “Cannot believe my luck 2 year suspended sentance beats the 3 year jail yes pal! Beverly Lunt go suck my ****”, while his brother wrote: “What a day it’s been Burnley crown court! Up ur **** aha nice 2 year suspended...”Lunt told the court she did not want to read out the messages which contained “offensive sexual elements”.She said: “It is plain they were never intending for me to see it, so they are not harassing me.” The messages did not amount to contempt of court because the hearing had concluded and she was not aware either had committed an offence, she said. “I would have to complain, wouldn’t I?” she added.Lunt said remorse and contrition was “a vital component” when considering sentencing but the length of the jail terms were not wrong.She continued: “It is the issue of suspension. Would I have done so had I appreciated, as I do now, their true views and what they really thought of the court proceedings?”The Sleddens and their father, William, 45, who also received a suspended sentence, had all admitted dealing cannabis from the family home in Accrington between May and September 2014.At the earlier sentencing hearing, Lunt said she had been partly persuaded not to send the three to prison because there had been no criminal wrongdoing since.The court heard on Tuesday that the brothers had written letters of apology to the judge. The review was postponed until 26 February so the full transcript of the sentencing remarks could be obtained to assess what weight the judge gave to the previous expressions of remorse.Lunt said she was not prepared to grant bail to either defendant and remanded them in custody.
