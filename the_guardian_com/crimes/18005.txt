An Iraq soldier who was sentenced to life in jail for the racist murder of a Bangladeshi waiter had said at the time that "blacks should be shot and have a gun put to their head".Michael Ross, now aged 30, was 15 when he went into a restaurant on Orkney island in 1994 wearing a balaclava and executed 26-year-old Shamsuddin Mahmood in front of diners.The Black Watch soldier, who was decorated for bravery as a sniper in Iraq, was told by the judge, Lord Hardie, that he must spend at least 25 years in jail before being eligible for parole.Describing Ross's actions as "a vicious, evil, unprovoked murder of a defenceless man", Hardie told Ross: "On June 2 1994, you murdered [Mahmood] in cold blood in a premeditated fashion. He is a great loss to his family and friends and the people he served."Ross's defence barrister, Donald Findlay QC, told the court Ross believed he was innocent, not a racist, and that his conviction was a "great loss" to his family and country.The murder was the first on Orkney for 25 years and today's verdict ended a 14-year quest for justice.The procurator fiscal for the Highland and Islands, Andrew Laing, described the murder as "callous" and said the "cowardly act" had shocked the local community and Scotland."Prosecutors and officers from Northern constabulary were determined that justice would be done in this case," he said. "Many people have worked on this investigation over the years and all will be satisfied with today's outcome." Laing thanked the "great public spirit" of people who came forward from Kirkwall, the administrative centre of the Orkney Islands and its largest settlement.A Northern constabulary spokesman said: "The sentencing today finally brings a conclusion to a long and difficult period for the family of Shamsuddin and the community in Orkney."Despite circumstantial evidence, the crime went unsolved until a new witness came forward last year and Ross was convicted. His father, Eddie Ross, who was a 57-year-old policeman on the island at the time, spent four years in jail for covering up vital evidence. He was stationed outside the restaurant after the killing.0n June 20 this year the jury found Ross guilty by majority verdict after a six-week trial.After the verdict was read out, Ross leapt over the witness stand and fled through the side exit at Glasgow's high court. He made it outside before being apprehended by a court official.He was also found guilty by majority of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of the murder weapon and changing his clothing.
