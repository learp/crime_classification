A planned terrorist attack on a far-right demonstration would have led to "a tit-for-tat spiral of violence and terror" that would have reverberated around the country, a court has heard.Prosecutors said on Thursday that six men who have pleaded guilty to plotting an attack on an English Defence League demonstration in Dewsbury last year – using a home-made bomb, guns, knives and a machete – were trying to spark inter-community violence that would have had "a serious detrimental effect on race relations"."There can be little doubt that a violent attack of the kind intended to be carried out would have been bound to draw a response in revenge from its target and most likely would have led to a tit-for-tat spiral of violence and terror," prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC told the two-day sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey.The court heard the mission was abandoned only when the group turned up two hours after the EDL demonstration on June 30 last year had finished – and was only uncovered when a police officer carried out a routine stop on one of the cars as the men made their way back to Birmingham."Their plain and now admitted intention was to carry out a terrorist attack using a varied selection of offensive weapons: an improvised explosive device, two sawn-off shotguns, swords and knives," said Cheema.Omar Khan, 28, Mohammed Saud, 23, Jewel Uddin, 27, Zohaib Ahmed, 22, and Anzal Hussain, 25, pleaded guilty at Woolwich crown court in April to engaging in preparation for acts of terrorism. A sixth man, Mohammed Hasseen, 23, pleaded guilty to the same offence and possessing a document likely to be of use to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.On Thursday, dozens of EDL supporters gathered in a pub near the court for the start of the two-day sentencing process. The group's leader, Stephen Lennon, and his deputy, Kevin Carroll, briefly went into the public gallery of court 12 to watch the beginning of the hearing. There was a heavy police presence and barriers had been erected in the street outside the building.The court heard that a couple of hours before the planned attack on the EDL demonstration, the would-be terrorists had searched for the terms "Worship for success in battle" and "Worship for success in Jihad" on the internet.When they set off for Dewsbury, they had their arsenal of weapons in holdalls and 10 A4 printouts of a document addressed to David Cameron and the Queen that set out in chilling terms their determination to take revenge on the "enemies of Allah" – the "English Drunkards League".It stated: "We love death more than you love life … What we did today was a direct retaliation of your insulting of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon Him) … It is of the greatest honour for us to do what we did and we all call upon the Muslim Youth to rise up & defend the honor of ALLAH & HIS Messenger."Cheema said it was clear the group were planning "a terrible vengeance on the English Defence League for what they perceived to be the EDL's recent blasphemous words and actions against the Prophet Muhammad and Islam."The EDL has held a number of virulently anti-Muslim demonstrations in towns and cities across the country since it was formed in 2009 and an Islamic community centre that was burned down this week had "EDL" scrawled on the wall.The court heard that the rally in Dewsbury had been due to finish at 3pm or 4pm but the headline speaker did not turn up. When the would-be attackers arrived at 4pm, the EDL supporters – numbering between 400 and 700, according to the police – had already left. The men drove around the town to the sites where the demonstration had passed and then, after stopping at a chip shop and mosque, made their way back to Birmingham.The failed plot may never have been discovered had it not been for a traffic officer who decided to carry out a routine stop on one of the cars as it headed back to Birmingham along the M1 motorway. The gang had given the wrong registration number when they purchased car insurance over the phone earlier that day.The car was seized and on the following Monday morning, staff at the compound discovered the weapons. A full-scale search involving hundreds of counterterrorism officers began. Within 48 hours all six men had been arrested.Cheema told the court that the defendants were a "tight and cohesive group", dismissing earlier suggestions that they were disorganised or shambolic. She said thousands of pieces of "extreme ideological material" were found during searches of the men's homes, including videos showing hooded fighters planting a roadside explosive device and files containing advice on how to carry out a successful terrorist attack.One of the men – Khan – had a green A4 notebook in his bedroom with "This belongs to Omar Khan so don't touch" written on the cover. It contained passages suggesting that jihad is an obligation.The Old Bailey heard that the group had carried out extensive planning ahead of the attempted attack, researching EDL demonstrations and information on Lennon – who also uses the name Tommy Robinson – as far back as 2010.
