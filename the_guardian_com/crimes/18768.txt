The number of assaults at British railway stations has soared over the past year, with Leeds named as the station with the most incidents, the Conservatives said yesterday.According to statistics acquired from British Transport Police there were 159 recorded assaults at Leeds station in the 2005/06 period. But half of the 10 most dangerous stations are in London.Victoria station in London, which had five recorded assaults in 2001/02, had 71 in 2005/06, while London Bridge station assault figures leapt from none in 2001/02 to 45 in 2005/06. Assaults on passengers at Manchester Victoria station have gone up from 10 in 2001/02 to 25 in 2005/06, while York station has seen a five-fold increase to 20 over the same period.Shadow transport secretary Chris Grayling said: "One of the key promises the government made in its 10-year [transport] plan was to ensure that people using public transport would see their journeys becoming safer. What these figures show that in many parts of the country passengers are far more likely to get mugged than they were five years ago. It really is time the government got to grips with the law and order problem on our public transport system."A British Transport Police spokesman said the figures could not be directly compared because of changes in the way such incidents were reported.
