Disciplinary action has been taken against a member of staff from a Doncaster child protection agency involved with the two young brothers detained for torturing a pair of children, it has emerged.After the sentencing, the council's interim director of children's services, Nick Jarman, warned that further action could be taken against other staff members.Jarman said: "We shall be appointing an investigating officer who is independent of children's services who will examine all these issues, without fear or favour."As for staff who have since left the authority, if we find reasons for criticism you may be sure that we will be passing those to their professional authorities."Jarman gave an unqualified apology for what he called the service's "admitted failings which led to this terrible incident." He said that on his appointment last year, after the government finally intervened in Doncaster following the deaths of seven children in care, he had "found an organisation which was totally broken".He said: "Frankly, valuable though it is, we did not need a serious case review to tell us what was broken, and more importantly what needed to be done to put them right."He said that nine months since the takeover had seen many problems put right by a "most utterly robust, government approved intervention plan". But he added that much work remained to be done."Two Ofsted inspections have demonstrated clearly that real progress has been made," he said. "Believe me, it needed to be. At times the action which needed to be taken has been very uncomfortable for, and unpopular with, our staff. But no one is under any illusion as to why this action needed to be taken."Now that the serious case review has been published, we are in a position to consider where, if at all, action needs to be taken against those responsible for this catastrophe."Caroline Flint, Labour MP for the Don Valley, joined the chorus of criticism of Doncaster children's services, but warned against over-reaction.She said: "Procedures were not followed in this case. This family has been under the radar of social services for something like 14 years but things have gone terribly wrong."It is very hard to decide when is it right to say that intervention isn't working and children should be taken away to a place of safety, to protect them and maybe other children from potential harm. That is a debate which needs to take place not only in Doncaster but across the country."But let us remember that this was a completely untypical event, in the context of most children leading happy and contented lives."Meanwhile, Doncaster's Safeguarding Children Board is refusing to publish its full review of the Edlington case and has called in police to investigate its leaking to the BBC.Concern over identifying any of the children involved prevented even the judge at Sheffield crown court from seeing the document, even though some of its contents were described on Newsnight earlier this week.The board's chair, Roger Thompson, said after the sentencing: "We are aware that there is widespread debate for the board to publish the serious case review in full. But we are following government practice by publishing the executive report only, to protect the families involved."This is what all safeguarding boards across the country adhere to. If government policy changes then the Doncaster board will follow that guidance."The review's 18 recommendations would be backed up by rigorous monitoring of local children's agencies. Thompson said: "The board will challenge the practice of any agency it believes to be failing in their statutory duties in order to improve safeguarding for vulnerable children in need."He said that the board was "very concerned" about the leak of the serious case review.
