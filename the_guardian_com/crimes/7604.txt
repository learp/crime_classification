The singer Amy Winehouse was released on bail last night after being arrested and questioned over alleged drug offences. The 24-year-old was interviewed by officers after voluntarily attending a police station in east London.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "A 24-year-old woman from the Camden area attended a London police station by arrangement and was arrested in connection with the alleged possession of a controlled drug ... This is in connection with an investigation connected to [video] footage passed to the Metropolitan police on January 22."Two weeks ago, Winehouse received a police caution for common assault after an early-morning fracas outside a bar in north London. The Grammy award-winning singer spent the night in a police cell after allegedly head-butting one man and punching another. At the time, her spokesman said she "slapped" a man with an open hand and accepted the caution.That arrest coincided with a court appearance by Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, 26, who is awaiting trial for grievous bodily harm with intent following an altercation with a London pub landlord. He denies the charges.Winehouse's turbulent personal life has coincided with an increasingly successful musical career: in February she won five Grammys, including record and song of the year for Rehab and best pop vocal album for her second LP, Back to Black. Problems with her application for a US visa meant she was unable to attend the awards ceremony in Los Angeles and performed live via a satellite link from LondonSince last year, her problems have escalated. In October 2007, she and Fielder-Civil were arrested at a Norwegian hotel for marijuana possession, and soon afterwards fans booed her on stage as she slurred her way through gigs. Two months later she was photographed wandering barefoot on a London street, wearing only jeans and a bra and looking confused.
