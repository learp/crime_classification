The 652-strong Council of Circuit Judges has told the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, that they oppose his plan to increase the existing 30% sentence discount for early guilty pleas because it could mean a rapist being released after just 15 months.The crown court judges added that if a rapist had been in custody on remand before the trial the victim might see him on the streets only weeks after he appeared in court.But Clarke has rejected this as "total nonsense" and poured scorn on the idea that a few, if any, convicted rapists receive a sentence as short as 12 months.The judges based their claim on the fact that a sex offender who admits a single rape faces a starting sentence of five years. They say the maximum 50% discount would reduce that to 30 months and as offenders serve half their sentence out on licence they would walk out of jail after just 15 months.But what is the truth about the "average sentence" for rape? There is enough evidence to show that the "culture of disbelief" throughout the police and criminal justice system is a key factor in the abysmally high attrition rate which sees only 6% of rape complaints to the police end in a conviction.But the latest published figures show that once a rape case ends in conviction the courts are now far from lenient when it comes to sentencing rapists.In fact the "going rate" has risen from 77.8 months in 1996 – nearly 6.5 years – to 95.7 months in 2009, or nearly eight years.The average length of a rape sentence rose by more than 14 months between 2005 and 2009 alone partly as a result of successful campaigns against unduly lenient sentences by Harriet Harman and Lady Scotland when they were law officers.The justice secretary proposes to increase the maximum discount available for offenders who plead guilty at the earliest opportunity from 33% to 50% in an effort to boost conviction rates and save £130m a year. He told Question Time, filmed for the first time inside a prison with eight inmates in the audience, that his plans would apply to "every crime".So is Clarke right to cast doubt on the idea that his plan will mean anyone walking the streets after 15 months? The breakdown of the 2009 sentencing figures for rape show that 885 rapists – 95% of those convicted – were given immediate prison sentences.Only five of them received sentences of less than 12 months – presumably they included the very few cases that involved mutually agreed sex between two children, for example a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old below the age of consent. A further 42 were given sentences between 12 months and three years and 57 were given three to four years.More than 780 of the 885 sentenced rapists were given sentences of more than four years including those on public protection sentences which have no fixed release date.The largest group – 325 – were given five to 10 years, and a further 171 received more than 10 years but not life. Eighteen were given life sentences and another 151 were put on the indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) which has no set release date. Most of those on IPPs have a tariff of at least five years before their release could be considered.In the light of this it is hard to see how the judges can be regarded as lenient in sentencing rapists when their starting point is five years before they consider the aggravating or mitigating factors. Indeed three of the five cases which received sentences of less than 12 months in 2009 were referred to the court of appeal for being unduly lenient, but in two of the three cases the original sentence was upheld. Only in one case which involved two charges of rape and two more of indecent assault was the original sentence imposed by Basildon crown court increased from a 12-month suspended sentence to eight years.These figures underline Clarke's claim that the "going rate for rape" is now eight years and not the five years cited by the judges. The Ministry of Justice also points out that the current maximum discount of 30% translates into a 25% average discount in practice. It predicts that the 50% maximum will work out at 34% on average.In practical terms this means that a rapist serving the average sentence of eight years will see his 96-month sentence reduced to 62 months for an early guilty plea. He would be released on licence after 31 months – more than two and half years and not the 15 months claimed by the judges.
