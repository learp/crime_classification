The fifth July 21 bomber, who threw his bomb away before going on to the London Underground, was a "consummate liar" and his experience painting and decorating helped him cover up his part in the failed terror attacks, a court has heard.The details emerged before Manfo Asiedu, who is Ghanaian, faced sentencing after a retrial at Kingston crown court.He had been tried alongside the other July 21 bombers earlier this year, but he pleaded not guilty and the jury was deadlocked in his case.This month Asiedu changed his plea to guilty of conspiring to cause explosions of a nature likely to endanger life between March and July 2005.He has admitted buying all the hydrogen peroxide used in the attempted bombings, but said he refused to take part in the attacks.Nigel Sweeney QC, prosecuting, claimed that Asiedu carried out the vital task of buying the hydrogen peroxide but also "brought some significant talents to that role".Sweeney told the court: "His experience as a painter and decorator would help with the false cover story that it was being purchased for painting and decorating. His appearance was unlikely to raise suspicion".Asiedu is charged under the names of Sumaila Abubakhari also known as Manfo Kwakuasiedu, as he has used fake identities since coming to the UK in December 2003."He is plainly, or thinks he is, a consummate liar or deceiver - only someone who thinks that could go about false entry into the UK, adopting a false identity to remain here and go to the police taking them on in over 1,000 transcripts of interviews during which he sewed an intricate web of lies to try and avoid his guilt."He went on to give false statements and evidence on oath."Sweeney claimed that Asiedu had been in telephone contact with three of the others jailed in connection with the attempted attacks, Yassin Omar, Muktar Said Ibrahim and Adel Yahya.Asiedu's device was supposed to have exploded his rucksack in the failed 2005 attack but he lost his nerve at the last moment and dumped it in the woodlands of Little Wormwood Scrubs, in south London.The device was found abandoned two days after the attacks on July 21.These took place on three Underground trains at Shepherd's Bush station, Oval station and Warren Street station and on a bus in Hackney Road.The bombs failed to go off only because of mistakes calculating the ratios of the deadly ingredients.Two weeks earlier, on July 7, a similar plot killed 52 people on London's transport network.He lived in a one-bedroom flat, turned into a bomb-making factory in New Southgate, north London, with some of the men now convicted in connection with the attack and was in telephone contact with them."Further, he took part in a cover-up after the bombs failed to explode both for his benefit and the benefit of his conspirators," Sweeney said.
