One of Britain's most wanted fugitives - a convicted police killer and armed robber - has been recaptured in the Netherlands after more than 13 years on the run.James Francis Hurley, 45, was detained by Dutch police 10 days ago during an investigation at a property in The Hague.Hurley was convicted of murdering an off-duty Hertfordshire police constable, Francis Mason, who intervened in a security van robbery outside Barclay's bank in Hemel Hempstead in April 1988. Hurley, the getaway driver, shot the officer in the back. In 1989 he was convicted of murder, armed robbery, and firearm offences and sentenced to life.Five years later, while being transferred between jails, Hurley and another prisoner threatened a prison officer with a knife and Hurley escaped. Hurley has featured on numerous official lists, such as Crimestoppers, of the UK's most wanted fugitives. Rewards of up to Â£30,000 have been offered for his recapture.Scotland Yard said last night that Dutch police had found a large quantity of class A drugs at an address in The Hague and arrested two English-speaking men.Detective Chief Inspector Paul Maghie, of Hertfordshire Constabulary, said: "The force still feels the loss of PC Francis Mason, who selflessly gave his life intervening during this robbery." Mason's widow, Jill, said: "I am really pleased to hear the news. It doesn't bring Francis back, but Hurley needs to serve time for the crime he committed."
