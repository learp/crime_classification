David Blunkett, the home secretary, provoked anger last night when he announced plans to privatise the forensic science service.The sell-off - the first in the world of a publicly owned science service providing evidence in criminal investigations - was condemned by unions yesterday. Prospect, the union for professionals, and the Public and Commercial Services union said the move would disrupt forensic science work for police forces. Prospect's general secretary, Paul Noon, said: "The government seem determine to out-privatise the Tories." Mark Serwotka, PCS general secretary, said a campaign would be mounted against "an unwanted and unnecessary privatisation." The decision was also condemned by Labour backbenchers. John McDonnell, leftwing chairman of the Campaign group, said: "This is the riskiest privatisation of them all." The government's justification is that it needs to spend some £20m-£30m on modernising its laboratories. The service already charges police forces for its work, and a private firm could increase charges to the taxpayer to recoup the cost of the modernised laboratories. Mr Blunkett said yesterday: "It is essential that we ensure that the FSS continues to be a world leader in its field. Freeing up the FSS to operate more effectively, in what is an increasingly competitive environment, is essential to that."
