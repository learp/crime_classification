Barry George, who was acquitted of the murder of the television presenter Jill Dando after spending eight years in prison, won the first round of a legal battle today to win compensation.A high court judge in London gave George, 50, the go-ahead to challenge a prior decision that he is not entitled to compensation. But he may have to wait until next year for further developments.Mr Justice Collins, granting permission for a judicial review, placed a "stay" on further action in the proceedings until a decision is made by the supreme court on a number of similar cases.It emerged earlier this year that George – who was found not guilty of the Crimewatch star's murder after an Old Bailey retrial in 2008 – was refused a reported claim of £1.4m.Dando, 37, was shot once in the head outside her home in Fulham, in south-west London, on 26 April 1999.Neighbours said a man in a dark blue overcoat had been seen hanging around before and after her killing.George was convicted of her murder at the Old Bailey in 2001 but the conviction was quashed on appeal in November 2007.For permission to be granted today, it had to be shown only that George has an "arguable case" to challenge the decision over compensation by the justice secretary.The next step usually is for the case to be dealt with by the high court, with each side giving full argument before a ruling is delivered on whether a disputed decision can stand or should be quashed.Mr Justice Collins said today: "I think the appropriate course for me is to grant permission but to direct that no steps are taken – that there should be a stay on any further action – until the decision of the supreme court is known."The highest court in the land is due to hear three appeals in February concerning the meaning of the phrase "miscarriage of justice" in relation to compensation claims.
