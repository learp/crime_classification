A navy commander has been jailed for six months for dishonestly claiming £53,000 in allowances to send his two children to an exclusive boarding school.Anthony Gray, a nuclear submarine expert, was also dismissed from the Royal Navy and told to pay the money back.Sentencing him at a court martial in Portsmouth on Friday , Judge Advocate Alistair McGrigor said: "This was a gross breach of trust such as you cannot remain as an officer in the Royal Navy."Speaking on behalf of the board of senior officers that tried the case and determined the sentence, he added: "We understand the devastating consequences on you and your family. The clang of the prison door will be your greatest punishment."Gray, 49, had claimed the money when he was not entitled to do so because he had split from his wife and was therefore no longer the "prime carer" of his two children.McGrigor explained that they viewed Gray's claims to have been made fraudulently when he started paying child support allowance (CSA), which would have meant that he was no longer the main carer.The judge added that Gray would have ignored clear warnings about the consequences of making inaccurate claims when applying for the expenses.Major Jon Harris, prosecuting, told the court martial the charges related to allowances paid to Gray, who worked at the Ministry of Defence, Abbey Wood, in Bristol, to send his children to Kingswood school in Bath.The court heard he was no longer entitled to the service benefits after he separated from his wife, Laure, in July 2007, which led to them selling their home in Bath.Harris said from this point Gray was no longer the primary carer for the children and was, therefore, not entitled to the continuity education allowance (CEA), which is designed to allow children to stay at school if their parent is posted elsewhere.Harris said Gray had "dishonestly" completed the application forms to receive the benefit and added: "This is not a marine who struggles with literacy or difficult concepts, this is a senior naval officer."Gray's wife, who was called as a prosecution witness, told the court her husband had left her with no financial support when they sold the family home in Bath for about £640,000.She said she used her half of the proceeds of the sale to buy a three-bedroom house, which became the family home for her and the two children. She said she received no other income until October 2007, when she got a job at charity shop and Gray began to pay her child support allowance. "Anthony left us without any financial support, he also stole my credit cards, cheque books from my bag and left me with nothing," she added.Bob Williams, defending, told the court his client had received advice that he was still allowed to claim the CEA. Williams said the defendant felt he was the "prime carer" because he continued to pay for much of the children's expenses. He said Gray was in line for promotion and had been a consummate professional during his 30 years of service.Williams told the court: "Up until now, Commander Gray has been a man of good character, in fact he has been a man of exemplary character, especially in the context of the service." He added that his offences were not in the "same league" as the MPs expenses scandal.Williams said: "This was not to finance some lavish lifestyle, not a jet-setting existence, they were spent on what they were designed for, the education of his children."Gray was found guilty of nine charges of making fraudulent claims between July 2008 and March 2010.
