 The rock star Pete Doherty was accused by a judge today of being either stupid or publicity hungry for dropping a bag of heroin as he left court after a previous hearing.Doherty was arrested when he dropped a bag containing nine wraps of heroin while walking out of Gloucester crown court last month, having admitted driving offences.Today, his lawyer, Bruce Clark, said the problem was that the Babyshambles singer had too many suit jackets and had forgotten to check his pockets."My client was in a rush to get to court. He was handed a coat in the morning and he didn't check the pockets."My client has many suits and did not know there was anything in the pocket. He had been in and out of court twice before the package fell out of his pocket. He feels very stupid … but he accepts responsibility."He is currently receiving treatment to get him off the drugs and he wasn't aware he would find drugs in his suit pocket. This was no mickey take, it was a mistake."District judge Joti Boparai, sitting at Gloucester magistrates' court, said Doherty was either very stupid for dropping the drugs in court or he was "doing it for publicity".She said: "I am sure by your reputation this was simply stupidity on your part and it wasn't any more than that. It was simply an error."Doherty was fined £750 for possessing heroin and told to pay his previous fine of £2,050 for drink driving and driving carelessly.After the hearing Doherty, who arrived 45 minutes late for court, said: "I'm pleased with the result."
