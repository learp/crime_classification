Five people have been convicted of a multi-million pound conspiracy to sell fake Viagra in the largest ever counterfeit drugs case in the UK.Thousands of customers bought the tablets for up to Â£20 each but many complained they had no effect or caused nausea.The pills were manufactured in factories in China and Pakistan, smuggled into Britain, repackaged and sold online to customers in the US, UK and Bahamas.A trial at Kingston crown court heard the products were almost identical to the real thing, with carefully forged packaging, logos and patient information leaflets.Jurors were told only an expert who knew exactly what to look for would be able to spot the counterfeit.The medicines contained around 90% of the normal active ingredient found in the authentic tablets - but regulators said customers were put in danger because of other possible ingredients.Salesman Gary Haywood, 58, student Ashwin Patel, 24, and businessman Zahid Mirza, 45, of Ilford, were all found guilty last month of taking part in the conspiracy. Two other defendants have not yet been named.Reporting restrictions on the seven-month trial were finally lifted today.The court was told that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) was aware of problems with fake Viagra on the market in America but did not believe the tablets had been smuggled into the UK.A chance seizure of thousands of tablets alerted the MHRA to a massive manufacturing and supply ring.The prosecutor, Sandip Patel, told the court: "This was an inquiry which would in due course prove in its breadth and depth unparalleled in the history of the MHRA."The geographical spread was global and the financial rewards were immense."A spokesman for the MHRA said: "There is no such thing as a safe counterfeit. For all we know they could have been made in someone's garden shed."
