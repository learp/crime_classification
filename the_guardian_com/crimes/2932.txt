Acclaimed screenwriter Jimmy McGovern is to examine the controversial legal doctrine of joint enterprise in a 90-minute drama for BBC1.The award-winning writer of Hillsborough will examine the common purpose rule – which can result in a group being convicted of a crime, regardless of which member committed it – in the feature-length Common.The law, increasingly invoked in instances of gang-related attacks and murders, is the subject of debate as campaigners question its potential for injustice.Fears have been raised over whether joint enterprise leads to some young people being unnecessarily dragged into the legal system, and others being imprisoned for crimes they witnessed but neither committed nor helped plan.Others argue that the law is an effective tool against gang culture – and ensures perpetrators are not left unpunished in instances where the crime was reasonably forseeable and none of the gang tried to stop it."Joint enterprise was first used in Britain's courts a few hundred years ago. It was designed to stop the aristocracy duelling," said McGovern."If one duellist killed another, then all involved in that duel – the seconds and the surgeons – were charged with murder. It worked: Britain's aristocrats stopped duelling."Now the law is being used against Britain's youth. If someone dies in a fight and you're involved in any way whatsoever, you can find yourself charged with murder."The writer, who said the burden of proof required in joint enterprises cases was "frighteningly low," focuses his drama on Johnjo, a 17-year-old who drives away in panic from a fatal stabbing at a pizza restaurant, with three other young men in his car.Common follows the attempts of the police and the victim's parents to uncover the truth about the stabbing – and Johnjo's to navigate the legal system."Common is an ambitious and controversial film," said Ben Stephenson, the BBC's controller of drama commissioning. "Much in the same way as Hillsborough and Sunday, Jimmy McGovern wanted to write this film after talking to the families of those directly affected by the joint enterprise law."We believe that it is right for the BBC to give writers such as Jimmy an opportunity to tell a story like this, and to allow the audience to make up their own minds about it."McGovern, perhaps best known for his drama serial Cracker starring Robbie Coltrane, has recently made two series of Accused, for BBC1 starring Sean Bean, Anna Maxwell Martin and Stephen Graham, among others.Common will broadcast in 2013, with long-term McGovern collaborator David Blair directing, and casting yet to be announced.Earlier this year, following a report from the Commons justice committee, the director of public prosecutions Keir Starmer promised new guidelines on joint enterprise.
