Priceless moment on SkyNews during its 1pm bulletin today in an item about the police hunt for a convict who has gone missing after temporary release from prison. Michael Wheatley, nicknamed the Skullcracker, was reported to have failed to return to Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.Then news anchor, Lorna Dunkley – in a two-way with the reporter Clare Fallon standing outside the prison – asked her: "Any idea where's he's gone?"Fallon, unsurprisingly, ducked that one.
