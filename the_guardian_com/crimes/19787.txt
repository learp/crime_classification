The former Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie has said unfounded allegations of tax evasion ruined his career in football and led to abuse from members of the public.The verdicts in the case against Storrie's former Portsmouth colleagues Harry Redknapp and Milan Mandaric mean Storrie's acquittal at a previous trial in October 2011 can now be reported.Storrie told Southwark crown court he has not been able to revive his football career as he waited to clear his name."For four years I could not tell everyone that I was an innocent man," he said. "For 17 years I was held in very high regard in football. At the moment it is impossible for anyone in football to employ me. If they Google my name all they can see is this case against me and 'tax fiddle, tax deal and tax fraud'. It is totally impossible for me to get into football until I clear my name."He said since the acquittal he has applied for a number of jobs unsuccessfully and he has been living on his savings, which are "dwindling". "Fortunately we are in a position to do that but I need to get back to work."Storrie described his anguish at abuse from the public, some swearing at him while he was out walking his dogs and others shouting in the street.In one instance, at a Portsmouth away game at Southampton, he was forced to report a matter to the police, he said. "I left the game with my wife and family. We were approached by half a dozen Southampton supporters yelling into our faces 'tax fraud'. It was horrendous."Storrie added: "Clearing my name and ultimately restoring my reputation has come at a heavy price affecting not only me but also my family and friends who rallied around me. I have suffered both mentally and physically at the hands of my accusers."For four years it has felt like I was on trial every single day. Although my innocence has been unconditionally established, the lasting damage to my reputation throughout this long ordeal has left a very bitter taste in my mouth."
