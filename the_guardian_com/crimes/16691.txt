Legal reforms being considered by the government could mean thousands of petty criminals being dealt with without appearing in court. Those pleading guilty to offences such as shoplifting, theft and criminal damage could have their sentence decided by a prosecutor in consultation with the police, instead of going before magistrates.The scheme is being drawn up by the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, and solicitor general, Mike O'Brien, in order to reduce the number of cases heard in magistrates courts by as much as half. It is hoped it will speed up the system and cut the Â£350m annual legal aid bill for magistrates' courts cases. Serious crimes, including all of those subject to prison sentences, would still have to be heard in court.A spokesman for the Department for Constitutional Affairs said: "Lord Falconer is a big reformer and this is the next step to make the criminal justice system more efficient, linked into what the prime minister, Tony Blair, said about bringing the system up from the 19th century into the 21st century." If the reform is approved, there would still be discretion for defendants who wish to have their cases heard by magistrates, he said.Last week the prime minister said that the traditional court processes did too much to protect the rights of the accused while proving "utterly useless" in protecting the ordinary citizen on the street.Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights pressure group Liberty, said that defendants should not be denied the protection of the court. "There could be pressure on people who are innocent to plead guilty," she warned.Yesterday a survey found that almost two-thirds of victims of crime interviewed believe prison does not stop petty criminals reoffending. An ICM poll, commissioned by Victim Support, found 54% believe making offenders do unpaid work in the community is better than a short prison sentence for non-violent criminals.
