A writer who plotted to have his mother's lover murdered in a wrangle over her will was jailed for eight years today.The Old Bailey had heard that Charles Hills was arrested when the men he thought were hired killers turned out to be undercover policemen."I need him dead," Hills told the supposed hitmen at a meeting, adding: "I just hope you aren't police."The 51-year-old, of Clapham, south London - who has previously written for the New Statesman and the Guardian - admitted two counts of soliciting to murder Flavio Rosa.The court was told that Hill hatched his plot to have Mr Rosa killed in a Â£15,000 hit because of a bitter dispute over his mother's inheritance.When she died in 2002, Hills was left her villa in the Algarve region of Portugal, but the will stipulated that Mr Rosa, a handyman in his 50s, should be allowed to live there for the rest of his life.Hills challenged the will, but the legal case dragged on. The document was later declared invalid.The court heard that he told the undercover police his reasons for wanting Mr Rosa dead, saying: "He is my bitterest enemy, this guy. He took my mother from me, he took my house from me."Duncan Penny, prosecuting, said Hills had two meetings with the policemen, telling them the murder should ideally look like an accident and Mr Rosa's body should be dumped in Spain to complicate the investigation.Hills was arrested when he failed to turn up for a third meeting and claimed to have abandoned his plan.Jailing him today, Judge David Paget said the offence was serious, but noted that Hills said he had given up on the plot when he thought he could not do it."The irony of this case is that the legal action succeeded about a month ago when the will was declared invalid," he said. "However, you were not prepared to let the legal system take its course."The court was read excerpts from The Son's Story, Autumn 2003, a personal manuscript by Hills, in which he contemplated having Mr Rosa murdered."What have you got to gain from being a good boy and playing the system in the good and honest way?" one passage read. "And you're up for a bit of murder and mayhem, fat and 50 as you are."He wrote in another: "Where on earth am I going to get a hitman, though? Somebody said a professional one would charge 10,000 [pounds] just to travel to Portugal. Anyone else would just bungle the job or double-cross you."Hills also wrote about hoping to have the murder committed before Chirtsmas because "it would sort of be a Christmas present for me".Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Inspector Craig Turner of Scotland Yard said Hills was a "very intelligent man", who spoke five languages."He used his intelligence to plan a murder, employ counter-surveillance methods and avoid actions that would make it hard for a police investigation," he added."Without doubt, had we not stopped Hills he would have met someone willing and capable of carrying out his plan."
