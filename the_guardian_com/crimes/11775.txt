A 96-year-old was so determined to help convict the burglar who raided her Sutton-in-Ashfield home that she turned her lounge into a courtroom.With hearing, sight and mobility problems, she could not visit Nottingham crown court to give evidence against Jonathan Morris, 24. But she said yes to a TV link from her armchair. Morris, of Mansfield, changed his plea to guilty, said the prosecution, when he realised his victim would appear in court after all. Kate Carty, Nottinghamshire chief prosecutor, said it was an exceptional case: "A senior crown prosecutor took the decision to make an application for a remote TV link to be considered as it was in the public interest for this matter to proceed. Using new legislation, the crown prosecution service asked for the TV link when he denied the charge. A judge gave permission because a court appearance could affect the victim's health. Morris will be sentenced today.
