Jean-Pierre Djimbonge, a Congolese university lecturer, who is taking legal action against the government after his arrest in Northern Ireland under immigration laws, is to return to Africa to fight his case. Justice Ronnie Weatherup, sitting in the high court at Belfast, lifted the stay on the removal from Britain of the 51-year-old lecturer in hydraulics and thermodynamics after hearing of his wish to go home. Djimbonge, who is challenging the UK Border Agency, was held for a fortnight in detention centres across the UK. He says he was travelling legitimately, with a visa.
