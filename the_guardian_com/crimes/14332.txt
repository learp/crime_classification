The law on provocation, which allows a killer to be convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter, is in such a mess that it should be abolished in its present form, the Law Commission concludes in a consultation paper today.It is seeking views on whether the defence of provocation should be swept away, reformed, or combined with diminished responsibility to create a new defence to a murder charge. But it has "great doubt whether a satisfactory version of the defence can be devised". The home secretary, David Blunkett, asked the commission to look at the law because of concern that it was allowing men who kill their wives in a burst of anger to receive lenient sentences but not battered women who kill violent husbands after years of abuse. The commission stresses it has reached no firm views and wants feedback from the public. It says the problems with the law on provocation cannot be put right by judges and need tackling by legislation. Harriet Harman, the solicitor general, who wants the law reformed so that killers can no longer blame their victims, said: "The Law Commission signals that provocation has had its day." She said the commission's eventual conclusions after the consultation would be incorporated in a proposed domestic violence and victims bill in the new year.
