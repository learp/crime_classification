A 26-year-old man convicted of killing PC Sharon Beshenivsky after a bungled armed raid at a travel agency was jailed for 20 years today.Hassan Razzaq, of Sebert Road, Forest Gate, in east London, was sentenced at Leeds crown court for manslaughter, robbery and firearms offences.He was found guilty of manslaughter but cleared of PC Beshenivsky's murder after an 11-week trial last year.Three other men had already been sentenced to a total of more than 80 years in prison after the robbery, in November 2005. Razzaq's case, however, was adjourned in order to enable pre-sentence reports to be completed.Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah, 25, was one of the "absolutely ruthless" key members of the gang that carried out the bungled armed robbery, which led to the death of the 38-year-old mother from Keighley, Newcastle crown court heard.He and 20-year-old Yusuf Abdillh Jamma, from Birmingham, were told by Mr Justice Andrew Smith that they must both serve at least 35 years before being considered for parole.Razzaq's younger brother Faisal, 25, also of Sebert Road, was cleared of the officer's murder but convicted of manslaughter, robbery and firearms offences. He was given a life sentence and told he must serve at least 11 years before being considered for parole.PC Beshenivsky was shot and killed on November 18 2005 as she arrived at the scene of the robbery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on the day of her youngest daughter's fourth birthday.Julia Hodson, the West Yorkshire police deputy chief constable, said: "She was just an ordinary cop doing her duty, and her life was taken away from her by ruthless criminals."Pc Beshenivsky was the first woman police officer to be shot and killed on duty since Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London on April 17 1984.Her colleague PC Teresa Milburn was also shot in the street as the robbers escaped with little more than Â£5,000.Detectives said after the trail that "very dangerous" criminals with no respect for human life had been taken off the streets.
