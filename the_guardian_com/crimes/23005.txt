Drinkers in Leeds and Blackpool are to test a simple 5p device to cut the risk of date rape in bars and clubs. The plastic security device snaps over the bottle and guards unwatched drinks from being spiked with such drugs as benzodiazepines, GHB and ketamine. More than 60,000 tops will be distributed over the next few weeks before full-scale production begins. At least 20,000 were handed out during freshers' week in Leeds. If successful, the tops could go on sale across the UK, with bars urged to add 5p to drinks prices to cover costs. The Drinksafe top is the brainchild of retired design engineer John Blundell from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. "The cap has a ring which is forced over the standard crown-cap bottle and is then very difficult to remove," he said. "The cap goes into the top of the bottle when you are not drinking ... It's very difficult to get the cap off. It's a one-off device. When you come back to your drink, you snap off the bottom half of the tamper-proof leg. You can then fit another cap if you wish. "An extra 5p on a bottle is not a great deal of money. Let's say people have six bottles in a night: the extra protection will then cost them only 30p."
