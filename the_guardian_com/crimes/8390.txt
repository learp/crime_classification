A mother of two who concocted a fictional job and employer to claim £6,000 of tax credit payments yesterday became the first benefits cheat to be sentenced to spend weekends in jail.Julie Beastall, 44, who pleaded guilty to several offences of false accounting in respect of claims for working families' tax credit and income tax evasion, must leave home every Friday afternoon for the next nine months before returning on Sunday night.Beastall (also known as Julie Nelson) of Sutton-in-Ashfield, near Mansfield, was told by Judge Dudley Bennett at Nottingham crown court that he was duty bound to pass a custodial sentence but said "in your case it will be far more constructive if it is an intermittent one that allows you to carry on with your job".The Inland Revenue, which brought the prosecution, said several benefit cheats had been jailed for fraudulently claiming tax credits, but this was the first instance when new rules allowing intermittent sentences had been used to punish them.The rules came into effect at the end of January and form a key part of the Criminal Justice Act passed last year.A spokeswoman for the Home Office said intermittent jail sentences were part of a pilot being used by judges to pass custodial sentences without breaking family ties and plunging them into poverty.Beastall had also fraudulently claimed £17,500 worth of housing benefit, income support and council tax benefit while she worked as a childminder and nanny for clients in Britain and Ireland.She maintained that she was working part-time for an employer on a low wage until investigators discovered she was receiving large cash payments at her own request while claiming the tax credits and enjoying perks including the use of a car.Tax credit payments act as top-up payments to reward workers taking paid employment.
