A bereaved father who publicly appealed for calm hours after his son was killed during last summer's riots has been given a 12-month suspended jail sentence after being convicted of a roadside attack.Tariq Jahan, 46, was found guilty on Thursday of inflicting grievous bodily harm following a four-day trial at Birmingham crown court.Jurors heard that he punched 34-year-old Sajjid Ali after the pair got into an argument in Handsworth, Birmingham, on 6 JulyThe attack happened a month before Jahan won national acclaim for his appeal for peace after his 21-year-old son, Haroon, was killed during disorder in the Winson Green area of Birmingham.Judge William Davis QC said: "People who break people's jaws in this kind of mindless violence normally go to prison but I take a view that because of his extraordinary position it is right to suspend sentence."Addressing Jahan, he added: "There is in your case this extraordinary combination of events. For that reason and that reason alone I can suspend the sentence."The judge told Jahan that in the aftermath of his son's death "you took steps which in my judgment … probably prevented really serious disorder continuing in Birmingham."The judge, who said he had sentenced many people for riot-related crimes since last summer, described Jahan's actions as "a genuine public service".Jahan's sentence was suspended for two years and he was ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work.He was also told to pay £1,000 compensation to Ali within 12 months.
