Before the trial started, one of the defence barristers accused government officials of turning a blind eye to the "shadow industry" of Chinese cockle picking and allowing the illegal immigrants to remain in the UK. During legal argument Lord Carlile told the trial judge that the UK Immigration Service (UKIS) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) acted as "agents provocateurs" and created a situation in which cockling was an accepted part of British industry.It was said that instead of detaining the Chinese cocklers, UKIS and the DWP allowed them to carry on working in the knowledge that they were not a drain on the state. Lord Carlile, who represented Tony Eden, who bought cockles from the Chinese gangmasters, argued that the UKIS and DWP officials were as guilty of facilitation - helping people breach immigration law - as any of the defendants. He said: "Officials and possibly ministers knew at all times that the Chinese were working as cocklers and would continue to work as cocklers. The reality is that the officials of the government and ministers connived and coopted people into acceptance of the illegal cockle trade."The Home Office and the DWP said in a statement: "UKIS was aware of issues relating to illegal working in the Morecambe Bay area prior to February 2004 and took robust and appropriate action by mounting intelligence-led operations, with the involvement of the DWP, to tackle illegal working in the area and taking steps to remove those individuals with no legal right to be here. Despite this activity, it was not possible to predict what happened on February 5 2004."The Home Office minister Tony McNulty said yesterday: "A recent agreement with the Chinese government to work together to tackle illegal immigration from China will help prevent Chinese nationals being exploited by organised criminal gangs and speed up the removal of people found to be living or working in the UK illegally. We have legislated to make trafficking for forced labour a criminal offence and we are strengthening legislation preventing illegal working in the immigration, asylum and nationalities bill."
