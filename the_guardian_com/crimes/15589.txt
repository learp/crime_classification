Your article, Alarm in prisons at Scientology drug cures aimed at inmates (November 15), contains several misleading points. We in Criminon have been offering our programmes to inmates of HM prisons for close to 10 years now and it is because of the effectiveness of our programmes that we have continued.Hundreds of graduates of our courses have made testament to the restoration of responsibility, decency, common sense and respect towards themselves and others, as compared to their previously miserable and criminal ways. A number of Criminon courses are accredited by a valid and respected college network - which counts as college accreditation for the prisoner, very useful to someone facing what can be an uphill struggle to be accepted back into society upon being released.The Criminon courses effectively reduce re-offending, in alignment with the National Offender Management Systems and the Partners in Reducing Re-offending initiative, in which Criminon is an active partner. This is a huge effort, which we wholeheartedly support in its efforts to reduce re-offending, and have been doing so.We see greater value for the people of England and Wales, in that groups which offer services to inmates that help with education, drug problems, and other badly needed important life skills, work together to achieve the goal of reduced re-offending, safer streets and neighbourhoods and happier lives. That is our intention, nothing less. Alison Daniels Chief executive, Criminon, England and Wales
