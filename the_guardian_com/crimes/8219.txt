Sunderland defender Titus Bramble has been charged with two counts of sexual assault and one of urinating in a public place.The 30-year-old footballer, who was arrested on 28 September, will appear at Teesside magistrates court on 10 November.His lawyer Phil Smith, from Tuckers Solicitors of London, said: "My client vehemently denies these charges and will be vigorously contesting them."Cleveland police said: "A 30-year-old man from Wynyard has been charged by police with two counts of sexual assault and urinating in a public place."The man was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday 28 September on suspicion of sexual assault and possession of a class-A drug. He was rearrested on suspicion of sexual assault on 14 October after a second allegation was made."He has been released with no further action on suspicion of possession of a class A-drug."The Premier League star was suspended from his team after the allegations against him surfaced, pending the outcome of a club investigation.The first sexual assault accusation relates to an alleged incident in a taxi while the second one, made by a different woman, relates to an alleged offence in a nightclub, a source close to Bramble said.The player was stunned by the accusations, the source said."He's absolutely shocked that he's been charged," he added.Bramble's career started at his hometown club, Ipswich, before he moved to Newcastle United under Sir Bobby Robson for Â£6m.He joined Wigan Athletic and then moved back to the north-east with Sunderland last year.The powerful but sometimes error-prone centre back was picked 10 times for England's Under-21s.
