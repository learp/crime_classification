A music fan who was stabbed 11 times in an attack at a rock festival was nearly killed for trying to help a female friend caught up in a row with two men.Tayside police said the 22-year-old man suffered eight stab wounds to the body and three to his head in an attack which is being treated as attempted murder. It is understood he tried to help his friend after she began arguing with two men who were urinating on her tent shortly after midnight on Saturday at the T in the Park festival in Kinross. Eyewitnesses said he staggered through one of the campsites looking for help. He is now stable at Ninewells hospital in Dundee after treatment at the festival. The event's police commander, Chief Superintendent Matt Hamilton, said the incident was the low point of an otherwise successful three-day event. Now in its 15th year, the event was headlined by REM, the Prodigy and Amy Winehouse.The victim, believed to be from Glasgow, was interviewed by detectives yesterday and police believe they have recovered useful scientific and eyewitness evidence from the scene and his clothing. But Detective Chief Inspector Bruce Kerr said their inquiries were hampered by the fact that 80,000 people were at the site, and detectives believe the two suspects could have changed their clothing and dumped the weapon.
