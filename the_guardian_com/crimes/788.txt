The back from the dead canoeist John Darwin has begun an appeal against his prison sentence, his solicitor said today.The 58-year-old was jailed in July for six years and three months after admitting faking his own death in a canoeing accident to allow his wife, Anne, to make fraudulent insurance and pension claims. Anne Darwin has launched an appeal against her conviction and her six and a half year sentence.John Darwin's solicitor, John Nixon, said his client had applied to the court of appeal for the right to challenge the sentence.The judge in their sentencing at Teesside crown court said the couple had carried out a "determined, sustained and sophisticated" fraud to obtain £250,000, meaning a severe sentence was necessary. He said the lives of their sons - who had no knowledge of the deception - had been "crushed".John Darwin shocked police when he walked into a London police station in December last year claiming he had amnesia and could not remember anything since 2000, two years before he went missing. Five years ago, an inquest into his disappearance after a canoe trip recorded an open verdict and the case was closed. Three months before he turned up at the police station, officers revisited the case after being alerted to new information.The Darwins had been struggling with financial difficulties. Anne Darwin's trial heard how six days before the scam took place the couple were refused a £20,000 bank loan and faced bankruptcy.Last month, the Darwins were granted legal aid to fight efforts to recover their illicit gains.
