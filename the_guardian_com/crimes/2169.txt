A motorcyclist who filmed himself riding at speeds of up to 150mph and uploaded the footage to YouTube has been given a suspended jail sentence.Robert Mark Owens, 48, of Bletchley, used a helmet-mounted video camera to record himself speeding on his Kawasaki 600cc motorbike on roads around Milton Keynes and Bletchley in Buckinghamshire on four occasions in April.He was sentenced at Aylesbury crown court, sitting at Amersham magistrates court, after admitting four counts of dangerous driving, a spokesman for Thames Valley police said.Some of the footage, which showed Owens doing wheelies, riding on footpaths and weaving in and out of traffic, was posted online and he was arrested after police received an anonymous call about the internet footage.As well as a 51-week jail term suspended for two years, he was disqualified from driving for five years, following which he will have to pass an extended test.He also had his licence endorsed with 10 points, was ordered to complete 150 hours' unpaid work and had his £3,000 bike and £150 camera confiscated, the spokesman said.PC Steve Roebuck, a road policing motorcyclist based at Milton Keynes, said: "This was among the worst examples of dangerous driving I have seen during my time as a police officer and the fact Owens willingly put himself and others in such danger almost beggars belief."It is a miracle he survived many of the situations he put himself in and to upload this footage on to a social networking site to boast about what he had done is abhorrent."He added: "In his own words he has accepted that he was 'an accident waiting to happen'. He placed himself in positions which, despite any motorcycling skills he had, could easily have resulted in tragic consequences."
