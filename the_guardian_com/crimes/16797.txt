Police are hunting a rapist who may be responsible for a string of attacks on women across south-east England.Three rapes, in Woking, Epsom and Redhill in Surrey, in a six week period this summer are being linked to the rape of a 10-year-old girl in Ashford, Kent, last November. Women in both counties have been warned to be extra vigilant. In each case the victim has been approached from behind, and dragged into nearby bushes before being assaulted and raped. Most attacks have been in daylight close to public footpaths or busy roads, and all have been on weekdays. On three occasions the attacker has taken items of clothing. Detectives said they had investigated the theory that the attacker, who had no apparent means of transport, may have travelled by train from Waterloo, which links all the locations. The attack on the 10-year-old was so brutal that she could have been killed, Detective Chief Inspector Colin Murray, of Kent police, said yesterday. The girl was leaving a community centre event where she was a volunteer when the rapist ran across the road and picked her up, before carrying her into a wooded area. The rapist is thought to have struck next on July 11 in Redhill, grabbing a 30-year-old woman who was power-walking near a common, punching her in the face a number of times. In most of the attacks the rapist is described as white, aged somewhere between 30 and 45, with stubble and a low or hushed voice.
