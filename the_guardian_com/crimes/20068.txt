Three teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of murder after the death of a woman in a house fire apparently started when a firework was pushed through her door on Thursday evening, police said today.An 18-year-old man and two 17-year-old youths will be interviewed in connection with the death of Mary Fox.Fox died after helping one of her sons to escape from the burning house in Bodmin, Cornwall.The 59-year-old mother of nine was trapped in her bedroom after helping her son 17-year-old Raum, who has learning difficulties, to safety.After jumping from the three-storey house, he ran to alert neighbours that his mother was still trapped in the building, but firefighters were unable to save her.The remnants of a firework were found behind the front door of the house in Carpenter Court.The arrested men are being detained at Launceston police station, but officers stressed that the investigation was still at an early stage and appealed for more information.Police have investigated claims that Raum was being bullied at school and that his family had been targeted by youths who were throwing fireworks in the street.It is believed Raum moved from Bodmin College to St Austell College because of bullying, but Devon and Cornwall police said there was no obvious evidence that Fox or her son had been victims after speaking to schools and social services.Fox had not made any complaints to police about harassment or intimidation.On Saturday, Fox's children paid tribute to their "loving and caring" mother, saying she had devoted her life to them."We, the sons and daughters of Mary, would like to thank everyone for their kind words at this difficult time," a statement said."We would also like to say a huge thankyou to the fire service who tried to rescue our mother from this horrific fire that makes no sense."Our mum devoted her life to us, her nine children, and went without herself to provide the best that she could for us."Anyone with information about the fire is urged to contact police on 08452 777444 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
