A man jailed for eight years for inflicting "biological" grievous bodily harm by infecting two lovers with HIV has won the right to a retrial.Mohammed Dica, 38, the first person in 137 years to be convicted in England and Wales for sexually transmitting a disease, had his convictions quashed by the court of appeal yesterday. But the judges refused to release him on bail pending retrial before a high court judge in about six weeks. The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, sitting with Lord Justice Judge and Mr Justice Forbes, ruled that the judge at Dica's trial last October should not have withdrawn from the jury the issue of whether the women consented to intercourse, knowing Dica was HIV positive. Kenyan-born Dica, of Mitcham, Surrey, was found guilty on two counts of causing grievous bodily harm under section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act. Giving the court's judgment, Lord Justice Judge said consenting adults had always taken risks of infection or pregnancy or even the danger of childbirth. He said a legal precedent set in 1889 when a husband was cleared of causing bodily harm by infecting his wife with gonorrhoea had no continuing relevance.
