The number of police special branch officers has more than doubled in the past 25 years, despite the end of the cold war and the ceasefire in Northern Ireland, according to research by the civil liberties group Statewatch published today.It is notoriously hard to establish the number of police officers involved in the special branch, tasked with countering terrorism and monitoring "subversive" organisations, but, Statewatch says the numbers in Britain grew from 1,638 in 1978 to 4,247 last year.The special branch is now two and a half times as big as it was at the height of the cold war or the worst part of the Northern Ireland conflict."The combination of the 'war on terrorism' and demands to combat EU-wide protests on a range of issues - peace and the environment, racism and globalisation - means that domestically the political police - special branch and MI5 - are more intrusive in everyday political activity than at any other point in British history," claims Tony Bunyan, editor of the Statewatch bulletin.In addition to the growth in its size, the special branch "now has far more civilian staff and the means for mass surveillance of telecommunications and the payments of informers which it never had in those days," he adds.In the run-up to the next EU summit in Brussels in mid-October, each special branch division in Britain will be expected to provide the names and profiles of activists who are expected to go to Belgium to protest, Statewatch says.The special branch was set up by the Metropolitan police in 1883 to combat the activities of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, otherwise known as the Fenians, in England and Wales.Yet by the mid-1960s it still had only 300 officers. Provincial forces only began to create their own special branches after the mass protests of 1967 and 1968.So the growth of special branch numbers to 1,638 by 1978 represented a big expansion in the activities of the "eyes and ears" of the security services.As the BBC series True Spies documented last year, the 1970s saw the special branch infiltrating and recruiting paid agents in trade unions and leftwing organisations, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmanent and the National Union of Mineworkers.By the early 1990s the size of the special branch had grown to 2,220, with the biggest point of expansion in the 600-plus officers stationed at ports and airports around Britain.But, as Statewatch points out, the growth in the 1980s was even more rapid than this figure suggests, because first the 93 officers in the anti-terrorist branch were hived off into a separate organisation, followed by the 847 officers in the royalty and diplomatic protection squad.This process continued in 1992 when the lead role in the special branch's original function of combating Irish terrorism was handed to MI5.Before September 11 some chief constables were reducing the size of their local special branches, but since then the numbers have risen to their latest total of 4,247, with an increasing role played by civilian staff as intelligence analysts.Each police force in Britain outside London has a special branch varying in size from couple of dozen to several hundred officers.They complement the work of the security services who rely on them to detain suspects and present evidence in court.A review by the chief inspector of constabulary, published this year, confirmed the changing role of the special branch in monitoring emerging threats, including Islamist extremists.But it also concentrated its efforts on the threat to public order from groups such as the animal rights movement and anti-globalisation demonstrators.Its official brief says its operational work "is directed towards counter-terrorism, followed by public order ... the two main methods of targeted surveillance collection being through human sources and surveillance". The events of September 11 underlined the "urgent need to monitor those who abuse democratic liberties to further their terrorist intentions".In this context the term "surveillance" means observing, following, bugging homes and offices, and tracking, including placing bugs on vehicles, says Mr Bunyan.The use of human sources means running "covert human intelligence sources" or agents within the procedures laid down by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.The potential for running such operations is limited by the number of special branch "handlers" who are available, but the Home Office has made clear that some universities now provide training courses.Traditionally such agents are recruited either from among those who are politically or ideologically hostile to the individual or group they are spying on, or who are blackmailed into becoming agents in return for dropping charges such as drugs, or covering up embarrassing personal information.Mr Bunyan says that it is surprising how small the financial inducements involved may be, with a regular payment of Â£100 a week not unusual in return for information.A second important role for the special branch is the monitoring of demonstrations that may lead to a breach of the peace.Although a distinction is made for legitimate political protest, the special branch also sees it as its role to keep in touch with local or national demonstrations.Undercover officers may attend planning meetings and may even volunteer to help in an attempt to gather information.In this role they have a distinctive function compared with the security services. The special branch will investigate potential threats to public disorder, while the security services are limited to those who pose a direct threat to national security.
