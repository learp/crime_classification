A teenager has been issued with an antisocial behaviour order (Asbo) which bans him from wearing a "hoodie" for five years.The action against 16-year-old Dale Carroll was brought by the city council in Manchester, which has the accolade of being known as Britain's capital of Asbos.Manchester magistrates heard that Carroll was part of a gang who caused mayhem to residents of Collyhurst village in the city for almost three years.The court heard he had attacked locals and once attempted to cut down a CCTV lamppost with a chainsaw. The teenager threw fireworks at cyclists and at one stage pulled a person from their bike and threatened them with an axe. He also drove a car on to a pavement and down steps close to the Sparrow pub in Collyhurst.Carroll of Cheetham, Manchester, was found guilty of anti social behaviour and was banned from wearing a hoodie or cap in public and from entering a large part of Collyhurst, including the home he shares with his mother in Manordale Walk. He was also prevented from congregating with more than two people, except family members, and banned from possessing fireworks, axes or chainsaws. Manchester city council's executive member for housing, Eddy Newman, said: "This young man has caused absolute misery for the people he has terrorised in this neighbourhood, and is out of control. "He should be absolutely clear we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and unless he radically changes that behaviour, he faces a long period in custody." Carroll, who appeared before Manchester magistrates on Tuesday, is the latest person to be made subject to an Asbo brought by Manchester city council, which has taken out 474 orders against 280 individuals since the orders were created under the government's Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003.
