Violent crime and street robberies rose sharply again last year for the ninth time in 10 years, according to recorded crime statistics for England and Wales released by the Home Office today.The Home Office confirmed that, although overall crime fell slightly, by 0.2%, in the 12 months to September 2000, there was a worrying rise in assaults and muggings.Overall violent crime rose by 8%, with robbery rising by 21%, but the violent crime rise is half that of the year before, when it was 16%.Four of the eight metropolitan forces in England and Wales recorded overall falls, but their success was outweighed by increases in Greater Manchester (up 1.7%), Merseyside (up 2.4%), the Met (up 3%) and West Midlands (up 3.2%).London's Metropolitan police force recorded the highest number of robberies in the country at 5.6 robberies for every 1,000 residents. The West Midlands police followed with 4.1 offences per 1,000 residents, followed by Greater Manchester at 3.7%.Central Newcastle had the highest number of incidents of violence against the person, with 236.5 for every 1,000 residents.Despite the increase in violent crime, the home secretary, Jack Straw, labelled the statistics "encouraging". He placed particular emphasis on the fall in recorded burglary and vehicle crime.Burglary fell by 8%, the seventh consecutive fall, while thefts of vehicles fell by 7% and thefts from vehicles fell by 6%. The number of sexual offences recorded also fell slightly, by 0.4% - the first fall for five years.Mr Straw said: "These figures show the continuing success of effective action against crime. As a result of excellent work by the police, local councils, community groups and others, recorded crime fell over the 12-month period."Overall crime in England and Wales has fallen over recent years and is continuing to fall. But it is still far too high and we must continue to work together to bring it down further."Both Labour and the Conservatives consider the numbers on crime and policing crucial to the upcoming general election. While Mr. Straw attempted to focus on the lowest overall crime rate in 10 years, Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe pointed out falling numbers of police officers.Labour will take comfort that a record 822 officers began training this month - a 74% increase on January 2000. And 5,268 have already joined the force since April - the start of the financial year - compared to just 3,963 in 1999-2000, the Home Office said.Mr Straw set aside Â£1.6 billion in a bid to plug the shortfall, with 9,000 extra officers needed by 2004.But as police numbers continued to drop to a 10-year low, and violent crime figures increased, the Conservatives accused Labour of failing on crime.Miss Widdecombe said: "These figures are a cynical manoeuvre to cover up government embarrassment over the huge rise in violent crime and, looked at in context, they are not even that exciting."Labour has presided over a fall of 2,500 police since the last general election and this modest rise in the recruitment will not reverse that decrease before the election."Home office minister Charles Clarke attempted to counter the criticism when he revealed today that the government would soon be announcing moves to make it more attractive for experienced officers to carry on after they complete 30 years' service.Full figures What's crime like where you live?Related articles 16 January: Police recruitment figures up by 74%11 January: How the fad for phones is fuelling crime11 January: Straw pledges crackdown on street crime18 July: False crime statisticsUseful linksHome OfficeHome Office: crime reduction toolkits
