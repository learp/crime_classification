Organised gangs are operating inside the 1,100-inmate Risley prison, near Manchester, the largest adult male training jail in England and Wales, according to a report published today by the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers.Ms Owers says that Â£80,000 worth of contraband and 123 mobile phones were retrieved in the past year at Risley, there were more than 5,000 security incidents and 13 assaults were reported a month.The critical report is published as the number of prisoners in England and Wales reached a new record, rising by more than 100 over the weekend to 78,196.The chief inspector says that the level of violence within Risley is such that more than a third of the prisoners - including more than half of black and minority ethnic inmates - reported that they have felt unsafe at some point.Despite a "robust approach" to drug smuggling into the prison, 15% of prisoners tested positive for drugs and 45% said it was easy or very easy to get hold of illegal drugs. Ms Owers says that the prison keeps its database of gang members up to date, but no member of staff was assigned to analysing the information.The chief inspector also says that there was no obvious weakness in physical security but that often procedural security was not sufficiently robust: examples included keys being left in the pharmacy door and radios left on desks. This year the security manager warned night staff about takeaway food being delivered to them from outside the prison.Ms Owers said that this was the second consecutive inspection report that had raised concerns about safety at Risley. She said that Risley had a chequered history of changing roles - it had once been a notorious young offender institution - and that there had been outbursts of prisoner indiscipline, often related to gangs and drugs, but it had benefited from a period of relative stability in recent years.The chief inspector said that some things were going in the right direction. Drug smuggling had been reduced and a much-needed segregation unit was nearing completion. The quality of healthcare was generally good and a sound resettlement strategy was in place for prisoners nearing the end of their sentences. But given that the jail was the largest adult male training prison in England and Wales, too many prisoners were unemployed or in low-skilled, unaccredited work that did little to help them get a job on release.Phil Wheatley, the director general of the prison service, said steps were being taken at Risley to improve safety and reduce violence.
