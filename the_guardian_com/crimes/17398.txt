The Metropolitan police was again on the defensive yesterday over prejudice in its ranks, after an officer was recorded allegedly racially abusing a Kurdish youth and threatening to fit him up.The policeman was suspended from duty after the court heard a recording in which he allegedly told the youth during an arrest that he would "smash his fucking Arab face in".Constable David Yates, 26, is to face a criminal investigation for alleged racial harassment after the secret recording of his racist and expletive-ridden tirade against the 16-year-old emerged.Mr Yates had gone to court to testify against the youth, who was charged with a public order offence after the officer arrested him. Last Friday the case was thrown out after the judge branded the officer unreliable.Yesterday the Independent Police Complaints Commission took over the inquiry into the incident.Sir Ian Blair, the Scotland Yard commissioner, condemned the officer's alleged behaviour as "outrageous"."If the evidence stacks up, then we will put the officer on a fast track procedure out of the force," he said.The teenager, from Bayswater, managed to activate a recording feature on his mobile phone as he was handcuffed inside a police van with PC Yates and another officer.The exchanges lasted two-and-a-half minutes and the recording was played in West London youth court last Friday. In it, Mr Yates was heard threatening violence, swearing 18 times and accusing the youth of being a "robbing, rapist arsehole".District Judge David Simpson threw out a charge of threatening behaviour against the youth, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and said it was for police and the director of public prosecutions to consider disciplinary and criminal proceedings. "I cannot believe anything these officers have told me," he said.The fate of the second officer involved in the arrest was unclear last night.The youth has lived in the UK since childhood and is a British citizen after his mother claimed asylum.Police had stopped him in a street in west London. After arresting him, Mr Yates allegedly called him a rapist and said: "If you say one more fucking word, I'll smash your fucking Arab face in. Do you understand?"The youth had been in trouble with the police before, and in the recording Mr Yates talks of having arrested him on a rape allegation, of which he was later cleared.Mr Yates then appears to threaten the boy: "This isn't one that you won't fucking get off of at court, because I'll write it up properly."A recent Commission for Racial Equality investigation found the police across England and Wales had more work to do to stamp out their own discrimination. British Muslims have complained that the police have used the war on terror to harass them. Massoud Shadjareh, chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, said government rhetoric had led some officers to think they could do whatever they wanted.
