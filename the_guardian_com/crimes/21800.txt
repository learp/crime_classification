Motorists who kill through carelessness will face jail sentences for the first time when the new offence of causing death by careless driving comes into force in March or April.Killing through dangerous driving already carries a maximum sentence of 14 years but currently those convicted of the less serious offence of careless driving cannot be jailed even if death results. The usual penalty is a period of disqualification from driving plus a fine.Under draft guidance issued yesterday by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, those convicted of the new offence of causing death through careless driving will face up to three years' imprisonment in the most serious cases. But for cases where the driver's culpability is low, for example where the motorist misjudges the speed of another vehicle, or turns without seeing an oncoming vehicle because of poor visibility, the usual penalty will be a community order.The new offence was brought in after an outcry over cases such as that of lorry driver William Ishani, who was banned from driving for a year and fined Â£1,000 in 2004 after killing a family of four - a sentence the trial judge acknowledged would be seen as "derisory". The Khambaty family from Northampton died when his 38-ton lorry ploughed into the back of their car on the M1. The prosecution claimed Ishani fell asleep at the wheel, which he denied. The jury found him not guilty of dangerous driving but guilty of careless driving.Another new offence to come into effect at the same time, causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured, will carry a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment.The new offences, together with a tougher prosecution policy for motoring cases where death results, follow allegations by campaigning organisations that drivers who caused deaths were too lightly punished.The guidelines also cover the existing offences of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs. They increase the starting point for sentencing in dangerous driving cases from six to eight years and highlight a range of factors which can increase the seriousness of the offence.Drivers charged with causing death by dangerous driving who were using a hand-held mobile phone, which is illegal, or who read or composed text messages over a period of time face jail sentences of four to seven years. Those charged with the same offence who were briefly distracted - for example, by reading a text message or consulting a map - could go to prison for between two and five years.Courts will also have to consider a range of aggravating and mitigating factors, such as the number of people killed and the driver's previous driving record.
