The media's continuing concern about its differing reactions to the disappearances of four year-old Madeleine McCann and nine-year-old Shannon Matthews has been explored yet again in the Sunday Telegraph in a fine piece by Olga Craig. Just as the Independent on Sunday asked the week before, she wonders why Shannon's disappearance has not been at the forefront of national attention.She writes: "This is an awkward question to pose and an uncomfortable one to answer. And it is in further comparison to the search for Madeleine that some hard truths become evident." Then she tries to come up with some answers...The mother, Karen Matthews, "does not possess the poise or eloquence of Kate McCann, something which helped that family attract wide publicity and generate a worldwide search... Nor does she have the benefit of a focused and driven husband. Instead, Shannon comes from a deeply fractured family with a complicated home life."Craig goes on to explain the tangled domestic life of Mrs Matthews before describing the area of Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire, where the family live. It is not a sink estate, she says, but quotes a local churchman who calls it "an area of acute social deprivation".Nothing new in all that, of course. But what distinguishes the Craig article is the way in which she paints a poignant portrait of Mrs Matthews's obvious anguish. Three weeks on from the day her daughter failed to arrive home, it is one of the most sympathetic description of Shannon's mother to appear in print.
