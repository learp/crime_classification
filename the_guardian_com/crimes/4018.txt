Richard Latham underlined the "juxtaposition" of some phone conversations Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr allegedly had together with actions taken soon after by Mr Huntley, which the prosecution claims were part of an attempt to hide his crime: Monday, August 5 6.35pm: Ms Carr and Mr Huntley allegedly speak on the phone. He is in Soham, she in Grimsby. 7pm: Mr Huntley is seen washing his car while other people search for the missing girls.  10.41pm: There is another alleged call between Mr Huntley and Ms Carr. 10.50pm: Mr Huntley allegedly "invents" a story about seeing a man acting suspiciously. Mr Latham also pointed out an apparent inconsistency in Ms Carr's account of when she learned who the girls were who had gone missing:  2pm: Ms Carr tells a bus driver she knew the two girls who had gone missing. 4pm: She claimed when interviewed by police after her arrest that Mr Huntley had not told her the names of the girls who were missing until 4pm when they spoke on the phone.
