Scotland Yard has defied plans drawn up by chief constables to triple the number of people caught speeding, saying the policy will turn motorists against the police.The decision has driven a wedge between the Met and leaders of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) and recent rows between them over the issue have underlined the differences in priorities between forces. The Met has also told Acpo that motorists will turn against the police if they believe forces are targeting them just to make money - legislation introduced last month allows the police to keep funds from speed camera fines, provided they use the cash to buy or run more of the devices. The goal to triple the number of people caught speeding was revealed by Richard Brunstrom, chief constable of North Wales, who head's Acpo's traffic technology committee. Police forces stop 1m motorists a year, with offenders usually getting three penalty points on their driving licences and fines of Â£60. By clamping down even harder on speeding drivers, Acpo, which represents all the country's most senior officers, believes forces will be able to afford more advanced cameras and develop bigger networks to catch more cars that are over the limit. With the extra revenue, it is estimated that police forces could add 9,000 speed cameras within a few years. "Speed cameras make a major contribution to road safety. This legislation means motorists can expect to see at least a tripling in the numbers on Britain's roads," said Mr Brunstrom. The Met has told Acpo it is going to ignore the policy and target accident black-spots in the capital instead. "We don't want to lose support of the public," said a Met source. "There is a danger that this policy will be seen as a money making exercise, rather than a technique for making roads safer."
