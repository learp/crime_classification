A fourth person has been arrested on suspicion of murdering Alan Cartwright, the schoolboy who was stabbed to death while riding a bicycle with his friends.Scotland Yard said an 18-year-old man was arrested on Thursday morning after attending a north London police station.Another 18-year-old man was arrested early on Wednesday after also attending a north London police station. A 17-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man were arrested in Camden on Wednesday morning.Police said the three adult suspects remain in custody while the 17-year-old has been bailed to a date in mid-April.The arrests follow an appeal by Alan’s family for witnesses to come forward to help track down the 15-year-old’s killers. Police released footage of the moment the boy was stabbed in the chest as he cycled with friends along a busy road in Islington.He managed to continue riding a short distance after the attack in Caledonian Road on Friday, but collapsed and was later pronounced dead at the scene.A second suspect is shown lunging at one of the teenager’s friends and knocking him off his bike, while a third crosses the road and grabs another friend to pull him off his bicycle. A post-mortem examination found that Alan died from a single stab wound to the chest.His mother and sister described the army cadet and Celtic and Arsenal fan as a “joker” who loved bikes and never caused any trouble.During an appeal on Tuesday, Alan’s mother, Michelle Watson, 39, said: “He always made you laugh about anything and everything. He was just the funny one out of his friends.“I feel angry, I want somebody found for this.”
