Special report: Macpherson reportA "white backlash" may be the result of the official report into the killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, a former Home Office advisor warned today.Dr Marian Fitzgerald, said the report by Sir William Macpherson - held after police failed to bring the killers to justice - had done nothing to address the long-standing problems of ethnic minorities.And she questioned the report's branding of the Metropolitan police as "institutionally racist". She said: "Certainly the term 'institutionally racist' is a fairly empty phrase, which has given no analytical help to resolving the problem."The term has created tension and resentment among individuals within organisations who feel they have been branded racist, Dr Fitzgerald argues in her book, Crime, Disorder and Community Service, published today.Dr Fitzgerald added that the Macpherson report had stirred up resentment among whites, who felt their grievances were being ignored while ethnic groups had gained preferential treatment. "I think there is already evidence which shows that racial attitudes in the UK - contrary to many other places - have actually hardened since 1997," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She added: "There is a danger the whole thing is going to turn into an unholy mess with no-one taking responsibility for resolving it." Dr Fitzgerald said that by seeing everything in terms of race, the report failed to recognise Asian and white youths shared similar problems in places like Oldham - the scene of recent riots. "It has given no help whatsoever. It is all being seen in terms of racial problems, which is simply exacerbating tensions," she said. "In the wake of Macpherson, with the groundswell of potentially a white racist backlash being exploited currently by politicians, and no doubt its counterpart in the police, (it) is going to do nothing to help resolve the very tense situation in Oldham."However, the Lawrence family lawyer, Imran Khan, dismissed Dr Fitzgerald's findings, and argued that the term "institutional racism" had been widely misunderstood.Stephen Lawrence, 18, was murdered after being stabbed at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, in April 1993.Special report: the Lawrence reportRelated articles24.2.2001: Decline in ethnic recruits for police15.12.2000: Anger as Hague is accused of playing the race card18.2.2000: The Macpherson experienceUseful links<a href="http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-00.htm" target="_new>Full text: Macpherson report</A><BR><A HREF=" http:="" www.newsunlimited.co.uk="" awrence="" tory="" ,2763,26030,00.html"="" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">The 70 recommendations - Macpherson report
