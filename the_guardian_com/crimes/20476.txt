A major row broke out last night between the Home Office and senior police officers over how more than 500 serious offenders escaped criminal records vetting despite being convicted of offences around Europe.Senior police officers revealed the fresh Home Office blunder yesterday when they told MPs that data on the convictions of Britons abroad had been sent to the Home Office in London but had simply been left "sitting in desk files" instead of being put on the police national computer so it could be used for vetting checks.The 27,529 paper records containing details of British people convicted around Europe passed to the Home Office include 525 convicted of more serious offences. They include five murderers, 28 rapists and attempted rapists, 29 paedophiles and 17 other sex offenders, and 29 robbers.A Home Office spokesman said last night that this was "a serious issue that is now being remedied" and said it involved a backlog of notification of crimes committed by British citizens abroad up until early 2006. "As the police made clear the case files of all serious offenders in the backlog have been entered on to the police national computer." But chief constables last night said only half of the serious cases have so far actually been logged: "We are processing them but it is taking time," said a spokeswoman for the Association of Chief Police Officers .Urgent checks are also to be carried out on whether any of the 525 serious offenders have applied for jobs and mistakenly been given a clean bill of health to work with children or vulnerable adults by the Criminal Records Bureau despite their convictions. The disclosure last night triggered the announcement of a "full and immediate" inquiry. The home secretary, John Reid, is to summon senior police officers and Criminal Records Bureau chiefs to explain what is being done to deal with the situation.In the face of opposition charges of a cover-up, Mr Reid had to admit that he had only learned of the problem after chief police officers had revealed it when giving evidence to MPs yesterday."This fact was not made public earlier because to the best of our knowledge this matter was not brought to the attention of the home secretary or his ministers until today, otherwise it would have been highlighted when he listed the reasons why the department's systems and procedures were not fit for purpose," said a Home Office statement last night.This new criminal records blunder happened after the paper records on cases of Britons convicted of crimes abroad, mainly in other EU states, was passed to the Home Office under new EU arrangements to share information on criminal convictions across Europe. The data relates to crimes dating back to 1999 up until March 2006 on convictions of British citizens in 15 countries, mainly EU members. Paul Kernaghan, Hampshire's chief constable and an Acpo spokesman, told the Commons home affairs select committee that the situation was "totally unacceptable" and a new system had been set up last May to try to rectify the problem. Urgent checks are now going on to see if any have been given clearance by the Criminal Records Bureau to work with children or vulnerable adults."Until the Acpo criminal records office was created someone could go to Germany, commit a sexual offence and serve a sentence - and this would not be known to any police officer when they came back to the UK. It would not be known to the UK courts if they re-offended and it would not be reflected in their sentencing."Mr Kernaghan said that was a totally unacceptable position professionally and in terms of public protection. "The information was sitting in desk files and not entered on the PNC. They are working their way through putting serious offenders on a risk-assessed basis on the PNC."The police say that none of the convicted rapists had been notified to the sex offenders' register: "If these particular offenders had been the subject of checks for employment through the Criminal Records Bureau, the search would have returned a 'no trace'."The blunder happened before a new agency - the UK central authority for the exchange of criminal records - was set up last May. Before that date the information was sent by other European governments to the Home Office on the grounds that it was the officially designated "central authority for mutual legal assistance".
