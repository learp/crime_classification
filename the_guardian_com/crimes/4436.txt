Nine current or former teachers at two top Manchester music schools are now being investigated by police in a wide-ranging historic sexual abuse inquiry, the Guardian can reveal.A source close to the investigation said allegations had been made against a large number of teachers with apparent links to Chetham's School of Music and the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM), but that so far nine were considered "key" suspects.The list includes Michael Brewer, who was found guilty this month of indecently assaulting Frances Andrade when she was 14 and 15 at Chetham's. He is now in prison awaiting sentencing.Andrade killed herself halfway through Brewer's trial and her family have since said she only agreed to give evidence in the hope it would embolden others to come forward about the abuse they had suffered in similar circumstances.Another under investigation is Wen Zhou Li, 57, who was arrested last Thursday on suspicion of rape. The China-born violin teacher has been suspended from the RNCM and Chetham's pending the police investigation. He was released on police bail until June, when he must report back. Friends said he strongly denies the allegations against him.Also being investigated is Malcolm Layfield, who stepped down from the board at the RNCM last week after learning he had been "outed" by Andrade during the Brewer trial. Three women have told the Guardian that Layfield initiated inappropriate sexual relationships with them when they were 16 to 18 and still his pupils.Layfield is still head of strings at RNCM but has consulted employment lawyers as he attempts to either stay at the college or hammer out a leaving package. He insists all of the young women he slept with were over the age of consent and that while he now regrets his behaviour, the "relationships" were consensual at the time.Also in the frame is Chris Ling, a freelance violin teacher at both institutions in the 1980s. Thirteen women have told the Guardian that he sexually abused them or behaved in a sexually inappropriate manner when they were as young as 12. Most are now helping the police with their inquiries.Most of the women say he indecently assaulted them while he was working at Chetham's. But one claimed he made her strip and took indecent photographs of her when she was employed to clean his house in Reading in 1987.Over the weekend another woman came forward to the Guardian to complain about Ling's behaviour when he taught freelance at the RNCM.An RNCM spokeswoman confirmed that Ling had taught part time at the college between September 1989 and 1990 and that at least one other of his former pupils had subsequently complained about him.She said: "In 2005 the then principal of the RNCM, Professor Edward Gregson, received a letter from [name redacted] alleging that whilst a student at the college in 1989 she had been sexually assaulted by Christopher Ling who was her violin tutor at that time."[Name redacted] said that she had not disclosed this information to anybody at the time, but that as part of her healing process, she now wanted to relieve herself of the burden of carrying the responsibility for what happened to her. She requested that no investigation be opened nor any action taken."Professor Gregson returned [name redacted's] correspondence saying that Christopher Ling was employed as a part-time tutor for one academic year between September 1989 and June 1990 and that whilst he noted [name redacted's] expressed wish that no action be taken, he profoundly regretted that she had endured such a painful experience and that he hoped that her healing process would be completed soon."As Christopher Ling had long since departed the college, and recognising [name redacted's] wishes, the RNCM was, regretfully, unable to take any further action."Since 1990 Ling has lived in the US and now runs a music agency in California representing classical musicians and conductors. He declined to comment on the allegations when contacted at his Los Angeles home earlier this month.Another teacher under investigation is Ryszard Bakst, a Polish piano teacher who died in 1999. Six women have told the Guardian that he indecently assaulted them while tutoring them at Chetham's or the RNCM.Each year the RNCM commemorates the late pianist by awarding the Ryszard Bakst Memorial prize for the best playing of Chopin. Since the allegations emerged about him last week a webpage advertising the next prize giving has been taken offline.Though the dead cannot be prosecuted, Greater Manchester Police are keen to talk to any former pupils with information about Bakst or other teachers as they attempt to understand the culture at Chetham's and the RNCM in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.
