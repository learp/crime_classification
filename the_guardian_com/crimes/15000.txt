Scotland Yard's most senior officers are being warned that they must fall in behind the reforms of Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, if they want to keep their jobs.In a long-awaited move to crack down on apparent splits and dissension within the Met's highest echelons, officers are being told they must stop private rows becoming public. The blunt message was being relayed to force chiefs at a meeting with the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), the body that oversees the force, last night and later today.Sir Ian and his supporters are hoping to establish his grip before the release of two potentially damaging reports from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) about the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and its aftermath.In a move widely seen as an attempt to impose his authority after a succession of damaging leaks, the commissioner recently redeployed two senior colleagues who have been privately criticised by Sir Ian loyalists for not being "team players".Deputy assistant commissioner Brian Paddick was moved from deputy command of territorial policing to a post involving information management. Assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur has been moved from the specialist crime directorate, where he was in charge of murder investigations, organised crime and gun crime, to central operations, which deals with the firearms command, public order, traffic and emergency planning.Mr Ghaffur was named in a newspaper report as considering legal action over proposed job cuts to his former department. Mr Paddick also consulted lawyers over his treatment by the force.One senior Met insider told the Guardian: "For whatever reason, the commissioner has suddenly developed a rod of steel down his back - some would say not before time - and has culled the two people he thinks have been causing him the most grief."Jenny Jones, a member of the MPA, said: "It is time the people at the top started working as a team and not acting as a bunch of free agents."Mr Paddick was questioned after the leaking of comments by Sir Ian at an internal management board meeting about the operation to remove placards from the anti-war demonstration by Brian Haw outside Parliament. Sir Ian told the MPA that the operation cost £7,000 but issued a clarification amending the figure to £27,000 after his comments were leaked. Mr Paddick denied being the source of the leak.The recent changes pose political difficulties because Mr Paddick is the highest ranked openly gay officer in the country while Mr Ghaffur is the most senior ethnic minority officer in the Met. George Rhoden, chairman of the Metropolitan Black Police Association, said: "What message does this send about respect and reflecting diversity in the police service?"The De Menezes inquiry continues to menace the commissionership of Sir Ian. Yesterday it emerged that assistant commissioner Andy Hayman, the head of anti-terrorism, has been served with a "regulation nine" notice warning him that he is under investigation over the Met's handling of the aftermath of the Stockwell shooting. The IPCC is also expected to interview Sir Ian under criminal caution after serving him with a regulation nine notice.
