An innovative community sentence to give drug abusers treatment instead of jailing them is failing, since only one in three offenders completes the order in full, according to the National Audit Office.More than 18,400 drug testing and treatment orders have been imposed on offenders since they were introduced in 1998. The completion rates have varied considerably across the country, from 71% in Dorset to only 8% in Kent. The spending watchdog's report, published today, says the probation service has faced a difficult challenge in keeping chaotic drug misusers on the intensive and highly structured programme. The government wants to double the number of drug testing and treatment orders imposed to 12,000 a year next year. The order requires the offender to have two drug tests a week and complete between 12 and 20 hours' a week contact with probation workers and counsellors. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, which commissioned the report, said: "The order has had an impact on some drug misusers, reducing their habit and making them less of a threat. "The real issue, though, is the dreadfully low number of offenders who actually complete the order - less than one-third. Much more needs to be done to ensure offenders comply with the terms of the order."
