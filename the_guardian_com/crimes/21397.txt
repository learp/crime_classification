Major companies are prepared to pay for large-scale flyposting campaigns because it is cheaper to pay the fine than advertise legally, a committee of MPs said yesterday, demanding that the government cracks down on the practice.Among those named and shamed is Mates, the condom manufacturer, for its "ishaggedhere" campaign. The environment audit committee said the company saw "illegality as a way of boosting sales as a result of accruing street credibility through what is effectively promotional crime".Penalties of between £75 and £2,000 levied by the courts against offenders are so small that it was certainly cheaper than advertising legally.The report says Mates employed a London company called Diabolical Liberties - reported to have a turnover of £8m a year - to put up the posters.Meanwhile, Westminster council, which suffered 2,032 incidents of flyposting in 2003, a rise of 23% on the previous year, spent £400,000 combating the menace. The council complained to the committee that it did not have sufficient powers to end the problem.One of the powers of the council is to serve an order to the companies concerned to take the posters down. "When Mates was so served in 2003 the company took down or otherwise removed the offending posters but its agents were all the while continuing to put others up elsewhere."The committee called for heavily penalties and community service orders against offenders, and new rules to make it less easy for companies to use the defence that they did not know their products were being advertised illegally.The report makes it clear that music events are one of the main offenders, and reports with approval Oadby and Wigston borough council in Leicestershire, which used staff to post another notice of its own across the offending poster saying simply "cancelled". This apparently stopped the practice.Camden council took out anti-social orders against big name offenders, including Sony, which agreed to discontinue all of its flyposting activity.The committee also looked at fly tipping, litter, graffiti and noise, and argued that the combination of all these offences in particular areas encouraged other crime and degrading of areas.Illegal tipping of waste is also on the increase and the report describes it as "a national blight". The committee called for local authorities and the Environment Agency to have access to driving and vehicle licence records so that they can carry out speedy prosecutions against those caught. Currently they have to apply by post, which often makes prosecution impossible."If the government wishes to see fly tipping reduced it must match its rhetoric with resources and give the agency greater financial support," the report says.Peter Ainsworth, chairman of the committee, said: "There can scarcely be a town or village across the country where the local environment is not damaged or defaced by heaps of rubbish, fast-food litter, walls covered in illegal posters, obscene or ugly graffiti, or excessive neighbourhood noise."He said the government was making some progress, but there were deficiencies and central and local government needed to "sharpen up their act" to deal with local environmental blight.Stephanie Surrey, a spokeswoman for Mates, said yesterday: "I can say that Mates has now stopped the practice of flyposting, and we have decided to take our environmental responsibilities seriously."
