A woman told the Old Bailey today of the moment she discovered the bloodied body of murdered teenager Sally Anne Bowman after going to investigate "a pair of white legs" near a skip."I knelt, just as a natural thing, and said 'Oh, poor darling'," said Anne Hardy, a neighbour of the Bowman's in Croydon, south-west London.Hardy described how she had been woken by two screams early on the morning of September 25 2005, which she thought may have come from a fox or a girl.She told the jury: "I put on my dressing gown and slippers and went across the road. I walked round the left side of the skip. I just felt I knew what I would see."It was not going to be a model or a mannequin. I just related it to the screams."Asked what she saw, Hardy replied: "Sally Anne's body."She said she did not know the 18-year-old but had often seen her leaving for work and being dropped off late at night.Mark Dixie, 37, is accused of murdering the aspiring model in the early hours of that morning.He denies murdering her, but admits having sex with her corpse while high on drink and drugs.Earlier, another neighbour living opposite Bowman's home in Blenheim Crescent, Croydon, south London, said she also heard the screams.June Cumpper said she then saw a man walking across the road and lost sight of him at Bowman's house. She described how the man was looking from side to side with his hands open.She said: "I heard a dragging noise. I thought it was somebody going to put something on the skip.Bowman's boyfriend, plasterer Lewis Sproston, 22, had given her a lift to her home. Less than half an hour after he eventually drove away, Bowman was stabbed to death and then raped. The trial continues.
