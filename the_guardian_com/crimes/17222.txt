Police today arrested a 34-year-old man on suspicion of abducting and molesting a six-year-old girl who was snatched from her bath.The child was driven off and subjected to a 15-minute ordeal before being dumped naked and shivering in a snowy north Tyneside lane on December 27 last year.Northumbria police said the suspect was arrested this morning at his address in the Blyth area of Northumberland. He was being questioned at North Shields police station.The girl's family had been informed, a police spokeswoman said, but did not wish to comment.Later, Northumbria police said a 25-year-old woman had also been arrested in connection with the abduction.A spokeswoman said: "She was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and is also being questioned at North Shields police station."The abduction caused widespread public outrage at the time.Last month, police arrested three people on suspicion of hampering the investigation by providing the inquiry team with false names. The girl was taken from her downstairs flat when her mother had temporarily left her alone.Detective Chief Inspector Jim Napier, who has been leading the inquiry, previously described her abductor as "extremely dangerous".The girl, who remembered seeing local landmarks during a 15-minute journey in the abductor's car, said the man wore gloves and was dressed almost entirely in black.The description was obtained after the girl was interviewed by specialist officers. She told police she did not know the man. The girl's account and minor injuries she suffered led police to believe that a sexual assault occurred. The girl and her 18-month-old brother lived with their mother and her female partner. The children's father, a former soldier, lives apart from the family but has been back to help his daughter recover from her ordeal.
