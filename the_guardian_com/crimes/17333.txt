Police chiefs appear now to be under acute pressure over the legal action brought by the women who were deceived into forming long-term, intimate relationships with undercover officers.‬More than three years after the women launched their legal action, it seems that the women may - at last - have reached a position where they are able to compel the police to give them some answers.‬They have for a long time criticised police for using a series of obstructive tactics during the drawn-out legal action to cover up the truth.‬The women won a significant victory last week in the High Court when a judge largely ruled against an attempt by police chiefs to block their lawsuit.‬The judge, Mr Justice Bean, concluded that the police could not rely wholesale on a legal defence that they had been deploying.‬The police have been arguing that they are prevented from contesting the women's legal action by their strict secrecy policy. This policy meant, they said, that they could neither confirm nor deny whether an individual was an undercover officer.‬Bean's ruling (which can be found here) means that the police now have until July 30 to either deal with a series of allegations or concede that they are true (unless they appeal).‬By that time, they will have to either admit or deny that two men - Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert - were undercover officers.‬They will also have to either admit or deny that undercover police officers "engaged in long-term intimate sexual relationships with those whose activities the Metropolitan Police wished to observe" and that "this was authorised or acquiesced in by senior management".‬The judge found that there was no justification to allow the police to neither admit nor deny in general whether the undercover officers formed sexual relationships with people they had been sent to infiltrate (see paragraphs 41 and 42).‬"There can be no public policy reason to permit the police neither to confirm nor deny whether an illegitimate or arguably illegitimate operational method has been used as a tactic in the past," he concluded.‬Bean highlighted how Mick Creedon, the Derbyshire Chief Constable in charge of the police's internal investigation into the undercover infiltration of political groups over 40 years, has said that such intimate sexual relationships would never have been permitted and were moreover "a gross abuse."‬In his ruling, Mr Justice Bean noted Creedon's "trenchant" views, adding :"I believe most people would agree with him". Creedon has himself conceded that the allegation that officers formed sexual relationships with activists is credible and can be corroborated (see page 27 here).‬The ruling was particularly embarrassing for Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. His force had sent lawyers into the High Court to argue that the police could neither confirm nor deny whether four men who had sexual relationships with the women were undercover officers in Scotland Yard's covert unit, the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS).‬Yet Mr Justice Bean found that Hogan-Howe had himself confirmed at a public meeting that one of the men was an undercover officer (see here and here).Bean wrote that Jim Boyling, masquerading as environmental activist 'Jim Sutton', "has been publicly named as an undercover officer by the Commissioner in person".Bean ruled that it was therefore "simply unsustainable" for the police to neither confirm nor deny that Boyling was an undercover officer. He also made the same ruling in the case of Bob Lambert, who infiltrated environment and animal rights groups for five years, as he had admitted that he was an undercover officer and had been named by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission.‬However, in a blow for the women, the judge ruled that the police did not have to either confirm or deny that two other men had been undercover officers. He said that neither John Dines nor Mark Jenner had been officially named as undercover officers, nor had they admitted it themselves.‬Interestingly, Bean said that his ruling "may only postpone the day of reckoning" as he said it "appears likely" that a court would accept that Dines and Jenner were undercover officers, if the police did not mount another challenge.‬Here and here are accounts of how a woman known as 'Alison' had a five-year relationship with Jenner without knowing his true identity.‬There is a remarkable acknowledgement from Bean of how 'Alison' discovered that her one-time boyfriend, operating under the false name of Mark Cassidy, was a member of the SDS. "By a great deal of what may be summarised as detective work of her own she had established, in my view, a clear prima facie case that Mark Cassidy was in fact an undercover officer called Mark Jenner."‬It should not be forgotten how much 'Alison', and Helen Steel who had a long relationship with Dines (see here), have done to expose the real identities of their former boyfriends. These covert deployments were two of the police's deepest secrets, deliberately concealed under layers and layers of elaborate disguise. And yet the pair, drawing on their ingenuity and determination, fitted together disparate pieces of the jigsaw to unmask them. That is the stuff of nightmares for police chiefs who have sought for decades to hide their covert operatives.‬After last week's ruling, their lawyer Harriet Wistrich said :""The police have been on notice of this case for three and a half years and until this judgment, they have wilfully refused to engage in any meaningful way with the most serious allegations put to them."‬"Their ongoing refusal in the face of an overwhelming body of evidence in the public domain has greatly aggravated the distress caused to my clients, who want answers from the police as well as justice and accountability."‬In this analysis of the ruling, the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance hailed the tenacity of the women and their lawyers.
