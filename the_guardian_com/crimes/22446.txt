Two children's teeth and fragments of bone have been found at the former Jersey care home at the centre of a child abuse investigation, police said today.The items were discovered in two of four underground rooms uncovered at Haut de la Garenne, which closed as a children's home in 1986."We cannot be sure at this stage if the bone is human or animal, and it will be forwarded to the UK for tests," a States of Jersey police spokeswoman said."The teeth could have come from the same child â€¦ further tests will be necessary to try and ascertain if that is the case, and how the teeth might have come to be there."Fragments of a child's skull were found buried under a stairwell in the building in February.Tests have failed to identify the child or accurately date the fragment, but forensic examinations suggest the person must have died before the 1940s. Last week, police on the island revealed that they had discovered bloodstained items in the cellar.The developments came as specialists continued to investigate the final pair of four underground chambers referred to as "punishment rooms" by people alleging they had suffered physical and sexual abuse at the home.Forensic experts are also investigating one of two pits dug in the 1970s or 80s. Excavation of the first pit revealed it had lime at the bottom.Police were alerted by a member of the public who contacted them to say staff had asked him to dig two holes near the boys' dormitory. He was later asked to fill them in again and, when he asked staff why, was told it was "none of his concern". Around 100 people have come forward to claim they were abused at Haut de la Garenne, with dozens more saying they had suffered abuse elsewhere on the island.There are believed to be more than 40 suspects in the inquiry as a whole. Only one person has so far been charged.Gordon Claude Wateridge, a former warder, has been charged with three counts of indecent assault on girls under 16 between 1969 and 1979. The 76-year-old, who appeared before St Helier magistrates earlier this month, was released on conditional bail until May 12.
