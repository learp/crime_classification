A man suspected of killing a 41-year-old man and leaving that man's 13-year-old daughter critically injured during a knife attack in Manchester has died after driving a stolen car into the side of a pub.Greater Manchester police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attacks.Officers found the body of the 41-year-old, who had been stabbed, after being called to a house in Moston, three miles north-east of the city centre at 10.20pm on Sunday. The girl had suffered serious injuries, also believed to be stab wounds, and was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary.Less than three hours later, police were called to neighbouring Harpurhey after a man reportedly threatened a car owner with a knife and stole their vehicle. The car was seen by police nearby soon afterwards. When officers approached, a 34-year-old man drove the car into the side of the Alliance pub. He was taken to hospital suffering from a stab wound and injuries consistent with a collision, but died soon afterwards.Detective Superintendent Simon Barraclough, from the major incident team, said: "We are in the very early stages of our inquiries and are piecing together the circumstances that led to two men losing their lives and a 13-year-old girl fighting for her life in hospital."Obviously the community will be shocked as to what has happened but we can say we do not believe anyone else was involved and are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident. However, a police presence will remain in the area to offer reassurance and answer any concerns residents may have."Anyone with information should phone police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
