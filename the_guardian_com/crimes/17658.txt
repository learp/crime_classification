A 17-year-old student found dead on Tuesday morning had been missing for more than a week before she died, Metropolitan police said yesterday.A post mortem examination confirmed that Jeshma Raithatha was stabbed in the heart. Last night, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said that there was no suggestion she was sexually assaulted. Detectives are appealing for information about the A-level student's whereabouts after she disappeared. She was last seen on Monday May 16 by a staff member at Claremont high school, in Kenton, north-west London, where she was in the sixth form. Police believe she was killed on Sunday May 22. Her partially clothed body was found two days later in dense undergrowth near a footpath used as a short cut to Sudbury Hill tube station. "Jeshma had a lot of friends and we are appealing to them to contact us, especially if they had seen or heard from Jeshma between May 16 and May 22," said the officer leading the investigation, Detective Superintendent Sue Hill. Jeshma's family, who reported her missing, described her disappearance as "completely out of character". Jeshma was said to have wanted to be a professional singer and wrote of her ambitions on websites. Police are likely to focus on whether she may have met someone over the internet. On one website which promotes voice-over work, she said she could perform in English and Hindi and offered recordings for radio, television, documentaries and films. "I am used to performing in front of an audience," she wrote. "I go to singing lessons ... I songwrite and I am into music and I used to be in a choir at a younger age." On another site she wrote: "I love music. I am a singer with a strong voice, I have a lot of experience. I love the stage, glamour, lights, auditions and everything." Her father, Suresh, and mother, Manjula, said: "Our beautiful and loving daughter has been taken away from us by an evil person."
