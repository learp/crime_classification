The home secretary has backed down in a row over how much to pay the head of the new National Crime Agency (NCA) – one of the biggest jobs in British policing – in order to attract a senior chief constable to the role.Theresa May said that no applicants would have to take a pay cut in order to take the job, which is being advertised from Wednesday.A salary cap of £140,000 a year – some £20-£30,000 below the current going rate for a senior chief constable – was originally set for the post to ensure the holder was not paid more than the prime minister.The home secretary confirmed the change as she detailed the plans to set up the NCA, which is to "spearhead the fight against serious and organised crime" and will become fully operational from December 2013.It will incorporate an "intelligence hub", which will build a national intelligence picture of the threat from organised crime to Britain, and as an "operational crimefighting organisation" will employ investigators, enforcement officers and other specialists.The NCA will replace the existing Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the Child Exploitation & Online Protection Centre and will tackle drug and people smuggling, major gun crime, fraud, and money laundering.But plans for a unified border police force and economic crime agency within the NCA have been shelved. Instead, the NCA will operate a border-policing command, which will co-ordinate and set the strategy for the work of the UK border agency, special branch ports officers and the police.Whitehall negotiations between the home secretary and the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, have also led to the last-minute exclusion of the Serious Fraud Office from the new agency, although the NCA will have a lead role in tackling economic crime.The City of London police, the Office of Fair Trading and the Financial Services Authority were already excluded from the NCA merger. The continuing independence of these separate bodies will be reviewed 12 months after the NCA is up and running to ensure they are working properly. As a first step, an economic crime board will be set up.Decisions have yet to be taken on the future deployment of the functions of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), which is to be axed under the government's quango cull. The NPIA's responsibility for police training is expected to go elsewhere, as is the national DNA database, but its public protection role and the Missing Persons Bureau are likely to end up with the NCA.The Metropolitan police successfully resisted an original plan to move counter-terrorism work and its e-crime unit to the NCA. The lack of responsibility for counter-terrorism and cybercrime means that the new agency cannot really be considered to be Britain's FBI.The NCA will, however, have significant new powers to set the "overall operational agenda" for tackling serious and complex crime and organised criminality, which means it will have the power to direct other police forces or law-enforcement agencies to undertake investigations."The NCA will have the authority to undertake tasking and co-ordination ensuring appropriate action is taken to put a stop to the activities of organised crime groups," says the Home Office plan for the NCA, published today.It will also have the power to ensure that appropriate action is taken "at the right level by the right agency", and will step in where there are disputes between police and law-enforcement bodies about the nature of approach or "ownership" of investigations.No detailed figures for the cost of the changes were published. Legislation will be needed before the new agency can be set up.The home secretary, to whom the NCA will be directly accountable, said: "For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice, with a fragmented approach to policy, prevention and investigation. It is time for a fresh start."Labour's shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, claimed that the scheme had been badly handled and was likely to cost £120m."Plans to scrap the Serious Fraud Office and take counter-terrorism from the Met have been tried and then dropped. Merging the Child Exploitation & Online Protection Centre is still strongly opposed by child-protection experts," she said."And there is still complete confusion over what is happening to things like the DNA database and national training done by the National Police Improvement Agency."
