A father killed his 12-week-old daughter in “a momentary loss of self-control” after shaking her, a court has heard.Isabella Vallance died of a traumatic head injury suggestive of being severely shaken at the family home in Redditch, Worcestershire, in December 2012.Her father, Tyler Vallance, 21, admitted manslaughter and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, and her mother, Jessica Wiggins, 20, was found guilty after a retrial of allowing the death to happen. They are being sentenced over two days at Worcester crown court.The prosecution QC Christopher Hotton said Vallance, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mild Tourette’s, gripped and shook his daughter in a brief and deadly assault on 12 December 2012. The child died in hospital five days later.A month earlier in another attack, Isabella had been left with eight broken ribs and a bleed on the brain “consistent with gripping of the chest and shaking” delivered with force “equivalent to a car accident”. The telltale internal wounds of that earlier assault were only discovered after a postmortem was carried out following the child’s death.On one occasion, a health visitor visiting the couple at home had noticed a bruise on Isabella’s left cheek, but there had been 10 other interactions with health and social workers who had no concerns, Hotton said.The judge Robert Juckes QC said it was agreed that Wiggins was “an extremely good mother” skilled in caring for her daughter.Prosecutors said during her trials that Wiggins knew her now ex-partner could be violent and was in the home but out of the room during the assault. A jury cleared her of child cruelty.The court heard that the couple had been having relationship problems at the time. Police officers described Vallance as a “callous individual” who “could not control his emotions or his temper”.After his arrest, Vallance tried to pin the blame for his daughter’s earlier broken ribs on family members who had been babysitting for the couple while they had a night out.Abigail Nixon, in mitigation for Vallance, said her client now accepted full responsibility for his crimes. “It was a momentary loss of self-control, with tragic consequences,” she said.Rachel Brand QC said Wiggins had been in thrall to the “emotionally manipulative” Vallance. “To be convicted of this offence is a grave punishment for her indeed,” she said.The judge adjourned the case and will pass sentence on Friday.
