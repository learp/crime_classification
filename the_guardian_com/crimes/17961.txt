The home secretary's disclosure that the two weapons Derrick Bird used in the shootings were covered by a shotgun certificate he had since 1995 and a firearms licence he obtained in 2007 raises questions about the effectiveness of UK gun laws.The Home Office's 210-page guidance to police forces on firearms law shows that despite Britain having some of the toughest gun laws in the world, there appear to be loopholes in their enforcement.For example, the process Bird needed to go through to get a firearms certificate for the .22 high-calibre rifle – granted for "shooting vermin and recreational target practice" – included providing the names and addresses of two referees, but did not necessarily include a check with his doctor on his mental health background.Gun owners are required to give permission for the police to approach their GP but the Home Office guidance is clear that such approaches "should not be made as a matter of routine", only if there are grounds for concern. At the same time, licensing officers are told it is "impractical for a psychiatric assessment to be conducted on an applicant's suitability to possess firearms". Other potential loopholes include the fact that it is possible to renew a shotgun licence by post in some places, including Cumbria, every five years.This means an individual can legally own a lethal weapon for 10 years without a home visit from the police or any other direct contact with licensing authorities.The gaps in enforcement begin to explain how it is possible to have some of the toughest gun laws in the world – and yet have 1.7m shotguns, rifles and pistols in legal private possession.Theresa May, the home secretary, was careful today to postpone any immediate consideration of whether further reform of the gun laws was needed until Cumbria police have completed their investigations. "It would be wrong to react before we know the full facts," she said, promising that ministers would consider all the options and a full Commons debate before the summer recess.But as the Liberal Democrat MP for Southport, John Pugh, put it: "Can I ask you to explain how a simple taxi driver could possible justify the apparently lawful possession of such a formidable and devastating arsenal for such a time? And can I ask what, if anything, can be done to prevent a circumstance like this happening again?"Alan Johnson, the shadow home secretary, hoped the gun law review would focus on whether "follow-up checks" on licensed gun owners were adequate, and whether GPs and the NHS could have a greater role in assessing whether gun owners' mental health was deteriorating.But the whole question of whether doctors will get involved in gun licensing appears to be fraught. The British Medical Association and the Association of Chief Police Officers spent much of last year discussing whether GPs could place tags electronically on medical records indicating whether the patient held a gun licence or had applied for one. Doctors were careful to resist the idea they should become in any way obliged to monitor or oversee the mental health of people holding firearms licences.The initiative followed an incident in which a Shropshire businessman, Christopher Foster, shot his wife, Jill, and their daughter, Kirstie, before setting fire to the family home and shooting himself with a legally held .22 rifle.But the debate over Britain's gun laws is also expected to focus on demands to scrap the confusing two-tier system of gun licensing that sees a "lighter touch" applied to the 600,000 people who own shotguns than the 100,000 who own more powerful firearms, usually rifles or high-powered airguns. The last major inquiry into gun licensing by the Commons home affairs select committee said the police have little or no discretion to refuse "any plausible case" for a shotgun application unless they can prove the applicant cannot be trusted with guns without being a danger to the public.In the case of a stringent firearms certificate, the onus is on the applicant to prove to the police that there is a good reason why they should own such a weapon. The difference stems from the history of gun control in Britain. The Firearms Act 1920 was introduce to control access to rifles, pistols and other types of weapons likely to be used by terrorists and revolutionaries. The traditional sporting shotgun was not brought under control until 1967.But even before this week's massacre in Cumbria, the Home Office has been facing pressure from the Scottish executive to overhaul British gun laws. The Scottish National party has argued that the legislation has been amended so many times since the 1960s it is no longer fit for purpose, since the experts can't understand it, let alone the man in the street.The coalition government has caused alarm in the pages of firearms publications by indicating that the law on airguns will be devolved to Scotland this autumn, opening the door for a separate, tougher law on all firearms legislation in Scotland.ends
