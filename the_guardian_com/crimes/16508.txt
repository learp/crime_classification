By 2005, everyone paying for goods and services with plastic will have to punch their Pin number into a keypad at the till and will no longer have to sign receipts.Meanwhile there are a number of measures already in place aimed at protecting cardholders from the effects of fraud. Although cardholders are potentially liable for the first £50 of any fraudulent losses that occur before their card is reported missing or stolen, in reality the card company will usually refund the full amount lost, says industry body Apacs, the Association for Payment Clearing Services. If you're a victim of counterfeit fraud such as "skimming" or so-called "card-not-present" fraud (involving phone, mail order or internet transactions), you're not liable for anything unless you yourself have acted fraudulently or without reasonable care. On top of this, under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, your credit card company is jointly liable with the supplier if there is a problem with goods or services if the price of the item is between £100 and £30,000. The law doesn't apply to debit or charge cards, although some voluntarily offer protection. Tougher new rules have been introduced to crack down on card-not-present fraud, affecting people who buy goods over the phone, online or by mail order. Card companies have developed a system that allows merchants to check the billing address of a cardholder and cross-check a card security code. Cardholders are asked to provide their full statement billing address and the last three- or four-digit number printed on or just below the signature strip on their card. A fraudster who only has a stolen receipt wouldn't be able to answer either question. For more information on how to prevent card fraud go to the Apacs website, www.cardwatch.org.uk
