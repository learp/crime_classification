Fear of crime has fallen by 19% in the past five years in London, with a majority saying they feel safe, even at night. According to the sixth annual London survey, the extension and greater localisation of policing appears to be cutting crime and calming anxieties.Some 62% of those polled told Mori they feel safe walking alone in the evening and 68% said they had not been a victim of crime in the preceding 12 months. Ken Livingstone, London's mayor, said the findings presented a good picture, but criticised London's overground rail companies for a lack of security in many stations at night.
