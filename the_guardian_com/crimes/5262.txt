The country's foremost forensic testing laboratory is suffering a brain drain of some of the country's foremost scientists, according to sources."Scientists have left, and are leaving, the profession because of the way things are going," said a source at the Forensic Science Service (FSS). "People worked here to support the criminal justice system, to convict the guilty and exonerate the innocent for the good of society. You don't feel like you are doing that any more."The FSS was once seen as a world leader, but was involved in controversy over its handling of the Rachel Nickell and Damilola Taylor murder cases, and has lost significant business as police forces carry out their own work or use cheaper, private companies. There are fears that several of its seven laboratories could be closed. Its scientists fear cuts will leave the criminal justice system badly served because the companies moving into the market do not have the resources or time to commit to research, training and the development of crime-fighting techniques.Jim Sturman, QC, the barrister who defended Colin Stagg when he was wrongly accused of murdering Nickell in 1992, said: "It is a dangerous development and it is all cost driven. If you have the police doing the forensic work, there is a temptation for all sorts of things: non-disclosure and looking at the evidence for the conclusion that you want to find."
