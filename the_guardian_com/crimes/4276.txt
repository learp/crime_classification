A man who caused travel chaos after passing out drunk on a railway line was today fined £560 and given 180 hours' community service.Former company director Kevin Craswell, 48, was heard snoring as he lay sprawled across the tracks with his feet just 12 inches from the live rail.Staff were forced to switch off the power to the line, near Epsom, in Surrey, causing delays for thousands of people on four routes.Craswell, of Ashtead, Surrey, now unemployed, was taken to hospital for treatment after the incident on March 3 at about 3.30pm. He faced up to six months in prison when he appeared at Redhill magistrates' court today to admit obstructing the railway by neglect.CCTV footage of the incident, taken from a police helicopter, showed a train being diverted to avoid striking the man.PC Keith Board, of British Transport police, said: "I've never seen anything like it in all my years of policing. It was truly remarkable that he wasn't struck by a train or fatally electrocuted."In total, four railway lines were impacted, costing almost £8,000 in delays. Trains had to stop running and the power was turned off so that police and emergency crews could safely get to him."A hearing last month was told that Craswell used to be a professional man but fell on hard times five years ago and was now dependent on benefits of £80 a week.On the day of the incident he had drunk a substantial amount of vodka and had no recollection of events. He has since referred himself to an alcohol rehabilitation centre and had arranged to see a counsellor, magistrates were told.Magistrate Ron Fewtrell said although he was aware of the potential risk to rail users from Craswell's actions, he did not believe he intended to harm people. He ordered the defendant to undertake community service and pay compensation to the rail company.
