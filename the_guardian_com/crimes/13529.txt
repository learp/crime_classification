Police were last night searching for five youths caught on CCTV fleeing an estate moments after a teenager fell to his death from a London tower block. The images show a group of hooded youths cycling away from the Trelawney estate in Hackney, east London, shortly after 16-year-old Ahmed Benyermak was chased to his death by a gang. Ahmed tried to climb down the outside of the building last Wednesday to escape youths allegedly wielding knifes, but lost his grip on the seventh floor and fell. Detectives say they believe the gang had gone to the estate to confront Ahmed and his friends.
