Your editorial and Courtenay Griffiths's contribution (Comment, last week) reinforced my view that there needs to be new thinking on criminal justice. Your comment is based on Justice for All in isolation and overlooked the Police Reform Bill currently before Parliament. The Home Secretary has certainly not overlooked the police service and the police service's willingness to embrace change stands in contrast to that of other groups within the system.I take issue with Mr Griffiths's distaste for the concept of defence and prosecution disclosing their respective cases. Surely the court should know the prosecution case is wrong because the defendant wasn't present during the crime. This would enable the court to concentrate on the central issue. The current position that 'he wasn't there and even if he was he didn't knife the victim' brings the entire system in to disrepute. The criminal justice system is to protect society not to provide an intellectual adventure playground for lawyers.Paul KernaghanChief ConstableHampshire ConstabularyWinchester
