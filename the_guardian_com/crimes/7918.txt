The Government today published its "plan of action" to drive through the recommendations made in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry report and set the foundations for a new era in race relations in Britain.Home Secretary Jack Straw said he would personally need a steering group to enact most of the 70 reforms proposed by inquiry chairman Sir William Macpherson.But at the same time he made clear Government reservations over some of the proposals made in the report published four weeks ago.The action plan embraces proposals to shake up police training and procedures on race issues in the light of Sir William's findings that the police were "institutionally racist", and to bring the police fully within the remit of the Race Relations Act.But Mr Straw said the Government had "serious reservations" about proposals to allow prosecutions for racist offences which take place in private. And he stressed that changes to the double jeopardy principle whereby a defendant could not be tried for the same offence would be considered without any firm prospect of action.The action plan states that all aspects of policing will be covered by forthcoming Freedom of Information laws, as proposed by Sir William.But this concession was qualified with exceptions over information relating to an investigation and information relating to informers - an ironic limitation given the embarrassment over the accidental publication of informants' names and addresses in the appendix to the Macpherson report itself.Publishing the Government's response to the report Mr Straw said the report had set the police service and the rest of society "a challenge to which we must rise"."We know that we must deliver real practical change."The focus of this plan is mainly about improvements in policing, because that was the focus of the inquiry, but progress on policing must be part of a wider context."We have a commitment to build an anti-racist society."The steering group to be led by Mr Straw will include members from the Commission for Racial Equality, the Black Police Association, the Metropolitan Police and other police organisations and the Crown Prosecution Service.
