Two brothers accused of murdering Damilola Taylor would have run "the four minute mile" if they had stabbed the 10-year-old and then made a series of mobile phone calls almost two miles away, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Continuing his summing up, the judge, Mr Justice Hooper, reminded the jury of evidence that the brothers' phones were used, just under 1.8 miles away, seven minutes after Damilola received his fatal injury. The defence has claimed the calls prove that the boys, aged 16, were not involved in Damilola's death. Mr Justice Hooper said: "To run that distance would... require a speed of 15mph. It is the four minute mile which was first broken by Roger Bannister a long time ago." The judge added that the route from Peckham, south London, where Damilola died, to Bermondsey, where the calls were made, was 2.4 miles by road. The brothers would have had to have travelled at 20mph - and no evidence had been produced to suggest they could have used anything "faster than their feet". Five calls were made between 4.47pm and 4.52pm on November 27 2000, the time a 999 call was made to police summoning help for Damilola. Four calls recorded on the brothers' SIM cards were credit or time checks while the other was to a phone owned by a friend's mother. The judge said the prosecution case was that evidence from staff and inmates at Feltham young offenders institute who said the brothers admitted involvement in the attack was enough to discount the idea that the boys were in Bermondsey. The prosecution has also pointed out that young people often lend their phones. The prosecution alleges that the brothers were in a group that stabbed Damilola as he walked home from a computer class. The defence has claimed the wound could have been caused by accident when Damilola fell on to glass. The brothers deny murder, manslaughter, and assault with intent to rob. The trial continues.
