Government proposals to tackle antisocial behaviour amount to a nationwide curfew of children under 16 that would breach human rights law, children's charities warned today. The antisocial behaviour bill, which received its second reading in the House of Lords today, would alienate young people from their community and make them the scapegoats for local disputes and unrest, according to the 13 charities including Barnardo's, the Children's Society and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).A legal report on the bill, commissioned by the charities and published today, said that giving the police the power to take children up to 16 unaccompanied by a parent after 9pm back home even if they had done nothing wrong amounted to "a nationwide curfew of young people".It added that the measure would allow the police to take home a young person over 16, if they could not prove their age when stopped, as well as younger children supervised by a 17-year-old sibling.The report by Anthony Jennings QC also condemned as "breathtaking" measures to allow the police to disperse groups of two or more young people even if they were not involved in illegal activity.He said: "This is unduly harsh and punishes someone for merely being present. "The order can last for up to six months and amounts to a blanket curfew."The QC added that proposals to remove reporting restrictions on children subjected to antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) could breach the Children Act as well as the Human Rights Act.The chief executive of the Children's Society, Bob Reitemeier, said: "This bill blurs the distinction between civil and criminal law, which is an extremely worrying development. "This is likely to draw more children into the criminal justice system. We are concerned that some children will be unfairly punished for simply being children."His concerns were echoed by the Liberal Democrat peer Lady Linklater during the second reading of the bill who warned its zero-tolerance approach would not solve the "scourge" of antisocial behaviour. She said: "Much of the tone of the bill is to do with enforcement, based on a very negative, zero-tolerance approach which could not possibly create a new culture of respect - except possibly that respect which is a form of fear, risking further alienation and division and which is the antithesis of what we all seek." In a joint statement, the 13 charities and campaigning organisations criticised the scope of the bill's powers for undermining children's rights.They expressed concern that the lack of clarity in the proposed legislation about what constituted antisocial behaviour could allow its powers to be abused."The use of the term antisocial behaviour without any clear definition to its limits gives rise to concerns about the arbitrary application of sanctions," said the charities."We fear that the effect of the bill will be to alienate children and young people from their communities, to scapegoat children and young people and reinforce negative stereotypes. "Being tough on children is not an effective solution to the root causes of conflict in communities."
