Nottingham is the worst place in England and Wales for car crime, the National Audit Office reveals in a report published today. The safest place to leave your car is Heathrow airport.The report reveals that more cars are stolen per person in Nottinghamshire than anywhere else. The highest figure is for Nottingham itself: 3,723 in the year to last April, with 329 vehicles recovered by police. There were 8,644 thefts from cars in the city, with 199 items recovered.At Heathrow, where millions of people leave their cars every year, there were 40 stolen with 16 recovered by the police. Large numbers of thefts in east London and car break-ins in Islington and Westminster make the capital's car crime figures the ninth-highest. The report reveals that generally car crime is becoming less of a problem, with an overall 30% fall since 1999. Improved vehicle security is the main reason. The police still have a poor record in recovering stolen vehicles, and an even worse one in getting back belongings stolen from vehicles. Although a safer parking initiative is beginning to have an effect, the NAO says car parks are still the most vul nerable areas. Heathrow's are an exception. The report suggests two other unrelated initiatives are also having an effect. In England, criminals can no longer purchase number plates from unregistered suppliers; and a growing number of councils keep lists of salvage operators. Such operators have been used by criminals to provide details of written-off cars so stolen cars can be re-registered and resold. More than half the 200 councils with the highest crime figures did not have a register of operators, although Nottingham was not among them.
