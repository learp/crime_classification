More than a thousand people gathered in central London last night for a candlelit vigil for David Morley, a barman murdered last weekend in a homophobic attack on the South Bank by the Thames.Mr Morley, a survivor of the Soho pub bombing in 1999 in which three people died, was battered to death by a gang as he walked home. He suffered 40 bruises, a ruptured spleen, fractured ribs and died of his injuries in hospital. Seven people have been arrested and questioned over the attack. Mr Morley, 37, of Chiswick, west London, who was known to friends as "Cinders", had been working at the Admiral Duncan when the pub was targeted by a nail bomber, David Copeland, in 1999. The vigil in St Anne's Gardens, Soho, came as a second gay man remained in a "serious but stable" condition after a stranger with a knife tried to murder him on a London night bus. The 25-year-old was returning from a night out with his partner at around 4am on Thursday when a fellow passenger stabbed him four times in a homophobic attack, police said. Detectives have stressed that the two attacks are not being linked. The second victim, a European visiting the capital, was knifed in the neck, shoulders, abdomen and leg. His injuries were not life-threatening, but officers are treating the attack as attempted murder. Detective Inspector Paul Spicer, leading the investigation, said: "By any standards this was a vicious attack. There are always concerns that such an attacker could strike again, which is why we are asking people to help us." The attacker had flicked food and shouted homophobic abuse at the couple after getting on the bus in Archway, north London. He then tried to assault them. They managed to bundle him off the bus, but he pulled the doors open and re-entered, stabbing his victim.
