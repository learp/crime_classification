An "incalculably brave" Royal Navy officer murdered trying to stop a sailor carrying out a gun rampage on a nuclear-powered submarine has been honoured for his courage.Also honoured was a "selfless" policeman who was swept to his death during the Cumbrian floods.Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux was awarded a posthumous George Medal – which is second only to the George Cross – for attempting to tackle Able Seaman Ryan Donovan as he ran amok with an assault rifle on HMS Astute while it was docked in Southampton in April last year.His widow, Gillian, said she felt "extremely proud and humbled" to know his courage had been recognised.Molyneux, 36, from Standish, Wigan, tried to disarm Donovan after hearing shots on board the submarine – which was being visited by local dignitaries – but was shot in the head.The gunman was then wrestled to the ground by Southampton council's leader, Royston Smith, and its chief executive, Alistair Neill.In a letter to Molyneux's widow, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the first sea lord, said: "In giving his life to save others, Ian demonstrated courage of the highest possible order."His selfless actions displayed incredible presence of mind and singular bravery."Gillian Molyneux said: "On behalf of myself and our children, I wish to express how extremely proud and humbled we all feel to know that Ian's remarkable bravery has been recognised with such a prestigious award."Ian is so desperately missed, but his memory will live on through his four beautiful children and in the hearts and minds of all who knew him."Donovan was jailed for at least 25 years in September for murdering Molyneux and attempting to murder Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge, Petty Officer Christopher Brown and Chief Petty Officer David McCoy.The medal citation said: "Lt Cdr Molyneux, with complete disregard for his own safety, had deliberately made an effort to tackle the gunman, knowingly putting himself into extreme danger in order to try to safeguard others from personal injury."His actions were incalculably brave and were carried out in the highest possible service traditions of courage and selfless commitment."Smith and Neill also received the George Medal in the Civilian Gallantry List for their disarming of Donovan.Also honoured was PC Bill Barker, who was awarded a posthumous Queen's Commendation for Bravery for sacrificing his life to help others during the Cumbrian floods in 2009.Barker, 44, plunged into the swollen waters of the river Derwent in the early hours of 20 November 2009 after walking on to Northside bridge in Workington to check for casualties below.The father of four had been sent to the bridge to assess the situation after police received reports that it had begun to collapse.Arriving in darkness, he feared a vehicle might have fallen into the water so he and a colleague stepped on to the bridge, only to discover that its central section had caved in.Seeing no casualties, they started to leave – but Barker looked over the parapet to check once more.It was then that the part of the bridge he was standing on broke away and he was carried off by the water.He was honoured "for sacrificing his own life while trying to save others".The citation for his commendation read: "While recognising the obvious risks to himself, PC Barker took steps to check for casualties in need of assistance, and paid the ultimate price for his selfless actions."
