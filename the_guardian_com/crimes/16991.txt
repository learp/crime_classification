The head of Britain's most successful cocaine smuggling operation was jailed for 30 years yesterday after a judge told him that he had gambled for the highest stakes, and eventually lost. Brian Wright, a 60-year-old gangster nicknamed the Milkman by his criminal associates - because he always delivered - was told that it was possible that he would die in prison."You were a master criminal - manipulative, influential and powerful," Judge Peter Moss told Wright at Woolwich crown court in London. "I accept that you will be a very much older man when you are entitled to be released. I accept too it is a possibility that you may not live that long."Nevertheless, cocaine abuse continues to cause unquantifiable misery to tens of thousands of victims of other crimes committed by those using or seeking to use it ... You played for the very highest stakes and won, for a number of years, a luxury lifestyle. You well knew the consequences of detection and conviction."Wright was brought to trial after an 11-year investigation by customs officers which saw 19 members of his gang, including his son and former son-in-law, also jailed for drug trafficking or money laundering.While amassing a fortune estimated to be as great as £500m, Wright, a lifelong gambler, used some of his fortune to bribe jockeys and trainers, and to arrange for racehorses to be doped. He would then bet £50,000 or more on rigged races, and use the proceeds to conceal the true source of his wealth. He hid for several years in northern Cyprus, which has no extradition arrangements with Britain, but was arrested after travelling to Spain in 2005.
