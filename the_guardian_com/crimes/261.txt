Charles Clarke, the home secretary, was accused last night of moving in a "centralised direction" by senior police officers after he unveiled powers to intervene directly in failing police divisions and poorly performing police authorities.The accelerated powers for the home secretary to send in management "hit squads" contained in the police and justice bill will fuel the political row over the merger of the 43 police forces in England and Wales into 12 or more regional "superforces".Hazel Blears, the police minister, confirmed last night the mergers would be staggered and not take place in a "big bang", with those facing opposition going through a four-month consultation process. Tony Blair promised yesterday that no police force mergers would be forced through.Ms Blears said reform was necessary to "bridge the gap" which meant the police were currently actively going after only 6% of the 1,600 known organised crime gangs operating in Britain.The police and justice bill, published yesterday, is intended to boost neighbourhood policing by providing a community "trigger" mechanism where local residents feel the police are failing to act on local problems. But it also contains a battery of police powers including the ability to demand advance travel details of more than 40 million passengers a year on domestic flights and ferries in Britain, as disclosed by the Guardian on Tuesday.The Home Office said yesterday airlines would have to provide the name, date of birth, gender and nationality of passengers, which would have to be manually inputted, adding to check-in times: "The data will be kept for as long as required by the police, potentially for years," said a Home Office spokesman.The legislation also includes powers to abolish the separate post of chief inspector of prisons and merge the job into a general criminal justice inspectorate, a move which has already aroused strong opposition in the House of Lords.The bill enacts the powers outlined in the government's Respect action plan to tackle antisocial behaviour, strengthens the law against computer crime, including doubling the maximum penalty for hacking, and gives the Independent Police Complaints Commission the power to investigate accusations against immigration officers taking part in enforcement actions such as dawn deportation raids.The home secretary's power to intervene in failing police forces or divisions builds on reserve measures first introduced by David Blunkett in 2002 in the wake of the "lengthy and awkward" sacking of Humberside's chief constable. They are to be extended to police authorities and the trigger for intervention will be widened from a recommendation by the inspectorate of constabulary to the results of a public inquiry or a Home Office assessment of which forces are failing.Sir Chris Fox, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said last night that chief constables were concerned that Mr Clarke was expanding his powers without professional advice."These measures may lead to more centralised direction at a time when forces are trying to give a local response to local problems," he said. His criticism was echoed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat spokesmen, who criticised the "trend towards central control of the police" and the "carte blanche for the home secretary to meddle in the affairs of police authorities". The Association of Police Authorities said the powers for the home secretary to change their role and membership represented a fundamental shift in power from local people to Whitehall. But Ms Blears said they were only powers of last resort and police forces would continue to work voluntarily with the Home Office's police standards unit.Main pointsPolice reform· Power for home secretary to intervene in failing police authorities· "Community call for action" power for residents or crime workers if police fail to take adequate action· Creation of single chief inspector of justice, community safety and custody· Merge police training authority, Centrex, and information technology agency, Pito, into national policing improvement agencyPolice powers· Power to demand advance passenger data from airlines and ferry companies on domestic flights and voyages for any police purpose· Police stop and search power at airports to be used "airside" to curb theft from passengers and smuggling· Power to attach conditions to bail granted outside the police station· Conditional cautions strengthenedAntisocial behaviour powers· Power for community support officers to take part in "truancy sweeps"· Standardised powers for community support officers· Power to issue parenting orders and contracts to be extended to housing associations, housing departments and other social landlords· Trading standards officers to be given power to issue fixed penalty notices to pubs and clubs that sell alcohol to under-18s· Power for courts to remand those who breach Asbos in custody until full hearing is heldComputer crime· Double the maximum penalty for hacking from five years to 10· Ensure all "denial of service" attacks amount to criminal offence· Power for police to confiscate all indecent photographs of children and computer hard drives
