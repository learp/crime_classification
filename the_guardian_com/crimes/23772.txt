The first of five prostitutes found dead in Suffolk over a 10-day period in December 2006 may have been choked to death in an arm lock, a pathologist told jurors today.The prosecution has claimed that forklift driver Steve Wright, who denies charges of murder, asphyxiated or strangled all five women while they were under the influence of drugs.But a Home Office pathologist, Nat Cary, said he could not identify injuries consistent with strangulation when he examined the body of 25-year-old Gemma Adams.He said he could not exclude the possibility that she had been asphyxiated but found no evidence that any item had been placed over her mouth and nose.Cary said it was possible Adams had been asphyxiated by being placed in an arm lock from behind.Jurors were told she was last seen in the early hours of November 15 2006. Her naked body was found on December 2 in a stream at Hintlesham, Suffolk.Cary said the pathological evidence was consistent with Adams having been killed soon after she disappeared. His tests showed that she may have been placed in water within hours of her death.The victims were all individuals "who may have not gone a single hour in a day without some drug on board", Cary told the jury."[But] these are not simply what we would call drug overdose cases in people who may be addicted to hard drugs, because of the circumstances of the disappearances and the dumpings of the bodies and the fact that they were all naked."He said intoxication through drugs may have made it easier for someone to kill them because they may have found it harder to fight back.Wright, 49, of Ipswich, Suffolk, denies murdering Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24 and Annette Nicholls, 29.
