The crime rate in England and Wales is falling again but most people do not believe it, according to the latest Home Office figures.The results of the British Crime Survey, published yesterday, suggested that crime fell by 9% during 2002.The latest quarterly police recorded figures suggest there was a 7% fall in the last three months of 2002 after increases earlier in the year. "Looking at the two together, the general picture is one of falls resuming in the second half of 2002, after a relatively flat period over the previous year," the Home Office statisticians say. The 2002 BCS figures suggest that there has been a 17% fall in car crime, an 11% fall in burglary and a 2% fall in violent crime. The police recorded figures, after adjustments for changes in the national recording practices, for the final quarter of 2002 compared with the same quarter in 2001, show a 23% fall in street robbery, reflecting the Downing Street initiative against street crime; a 4% fall in burglaries; and a 6% fall in car crime. But the police figures show that drug offences have risen sharply, up from 118,000 in 2001 to 137,300 in 2002. A Home Office spokesman said the increase reflected a rise in police activity against class A drugs such as heroin and cocaine. The BCS, which is based on 40,000 interviews about people's experience of crime, shows that the risk of becoming a victim of crime fell slightly, from 28% in 2001 to 26% in 2002, the lowest level since the survey began in 1981. Nevertheless, the results show a sharp rise in the number who believe crime is getting worse in England and Wales: the proportion rose from 56% in 2001 to 71% last year. One in three adults say they are worried about drug dealing, vandalism, litter, and teenagers hanging around the streets. The Home Office minister Bob Ainsworth said the figures showed that government measures to reduce crime were working. "Crime is continuing on a downward trend ... But we are not complacent. "We have a record number of police officers - 131,548 - and we are reforming the way they work." But the Liberal Democrat spokesman, Simon Hughes, said the government had to keep up the pressure on violent crime, which caused the most fear, and not shift its sights to low-level anti-social behaviour. Paul Cavadino of the crime reduction charity Nacro welcomed the continuing fall in crime but said it was a nonsense that people were being sent to prison in record numbers during a prolonged period of falling crime rates. "Prison is notoriously ineffective in turning people away from offending," he said. The police figures have been adjusted to take account of a new way of recording crime introduced in April 2002. The unadjusted figures for the last three months of 2002 show a rise of 4.1% on the same quarter of the previous year, but a fall of 7% when the new practices are taken into account. Home Office statisticians said that, after a fall in violent crime in the latter part of the 1990s, it now looked as if violent crime had levelled off. The Home Office also said that it appeared that the long decline in domestic burglaries seen in much of the 1990s might now be resuming. The latest BCS figures recorded an 11% drop last year.
