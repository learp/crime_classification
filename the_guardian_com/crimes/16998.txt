Eddie "Lord" Davenport, the serial fraudster best known for promoting the notorious Gatecrasher Ball events popular with public school pupils in the 1980s, has been ordered to pay almost £14m in fines and compensation or return to jail for a further 10-year sentence.The ruling comes almost three years after Davenport, who despite past affectations does not hold a peerage, was sentenced to seven years and eight months in jail for £4.5m of loan frauds, preying on scores of small businesses in desperate need of finance between 2005 and 2009. His sentence was later reduced and he was released from prison two months ago.At the heart of Davenport's fraudulent business activities had been a 24-room townhouse on Portland Place, the only substantial recoverable asset prosecutors have been able to trace to him.

It was used as the venue for music videos, including Amy Winehouse's Rehab, a location for films such as The King's Speech and for Kate Moss's Agent Provocateur fashion shoot.Three years ago, a US drinks business converted one room into a giant Courvoisier-filled punchbowl as a publicity stunt.It has taken the Serious Fraud Office three years to convince the courts that proceeds from Davenport's fraudulent activities were used in the unorthodox purchase of the building.The house had previously been the Sierra Leone high commission until Davenport controversially acquired it for a below-market sum in 1999 while the west African country was in the middle of a civil war.He will now be under pressure to sell the property in order to avoid further time in jail. Judge Testar, who also presided at Davenport's lengthy trial, said on Thursday: "For some four years I have had a deep sense that moving matters along in the case has been a truly Sisyphean task, both before during and after the trial … In the end I have decided that the risk of Mr Davenport retaining some of the fruits of his crime is one that my public duty dictates I should not take."A confidence trickster, Davenport surrounded himself with what appeared to be the trappings of wealth: a Monaco address, a garage full of luxury cars and a wardrobe packed with Savile Row suits.He also cultivated an image as a risqué figure on the fringes of high society and the celebrity circuit, a regular in gossip columns.Bogus accounts, glossy brochures and adverts in the Financial Times added to the impression of credibility. Davenport and his accomplices also adopted a string of aliases.Desperate businesses, unable to get loans from their banks, turned to Davenport's firm Gresham, which had been masquerading as a loan provider with a reputable track record. None of the loans were ever advanced, but businesses were persuaded to part with huge sums in "deposits" and fees for "verification", "loan guarantee" and "due diligence".
