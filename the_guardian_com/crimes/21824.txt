A judge's unprecedented attempt to deliver a verdict on her own after allegations of jury-tampering in a fraud trial may be referred to the supreme court.The dismissal of the jury at Wood Green crown court, north London, after it started returning verdicts in a case involving more than £100,000 in housing benefits and council tax claims has led the case into unexplored legal territory. Already heard by the court of appeal but not previously reported, the case could be influential in the development of juryless trials, sanctioned by the 2003 Criminal Justice Act.The first planned juryless trial was held last year and resulted in the conviction of four men concerning a £1.75m armed robbery at Heathrow airport.The Wood Green case tests a section of the legislation that permits judges to continue without a jury if satisfied the jury has been subject to interference and that the defendants can still have a fair trial.The judge, Recorder Caroline English, discharged the jury in March this year after they had acquitted one of five defendants. Evidence had emerged, according to the court of appeal judgment, that a "former companion" of one of the accused had been "in regular contact with a female member of the jury in an attempt to ensure the juror returns a not guilty verdict".The former companion, named in the court of appeal judgment as Sarah Lodge, was said to have been in contact with two of the accused, Cosima Guthrie, 25, from Chingford, and Bianca Guthrie, 35, from Purfleet, Essex.The four accused, who also include the pair's brother Richard Guthrie, 33, and alleged accomplice Courtenay Campbell, 48, from south-east London, deny a combined total of six conspiracy to defraud charges. They are said to have made fraudulent applications for council tax benefit and housing benefit.The appeal court upheld the judge's decision to continue. The defence counsel said he would seek permission to appeal to the supreme court. The case continues.
