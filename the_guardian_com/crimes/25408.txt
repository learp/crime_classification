Portuguese police investigating the disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine McCann are examining apparent discrepancies between statements from three friends of the family and the only named suspect in the case.A British expatriate, Robert Murat, who lives close to where the McCann family were staying in Praia de Luz, was formally named as a suspect on May 12, nine days after Madeleine was snatched. He denies any involvement in her disappearance.Rachael Oldfield, 36, Russell O'Brien, also 36, and Fiona Payne, 34, were on holiday with Kate and Gerry McCann in the Algarve when Madeleine was abducted.They flew back to Portugal earlier this week to meet police and on Wednesday were brought face to face with Mr Murat.Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa, the Portuguese police officer in charge of the case, said: "I know they have been brought together in the same building."I know they have been discussing some differences between the things they said about the night Madeleine disappeared."Mr Murat spent two days this week being interviewed again by police and it is thought that he was asked about an email that reportedly mentioned "the missing English girl".Mr Murat has a daughter the same age. After Madeleine was snatched he volunteered to help with translation for police investigating the case.On the night of the abduction the McCanns were having dinner with a group of friends from the UK in a tapas restaurant opposite their hotel.Police have already interviewed the party in detail, including one woman - whose identity has not been confirmed - who said she saw a girl being carried away by a man in Praia Da Luz. The McCanns have said they are convinced it was Madeleine.
