The fan who was shoved in the face by Manchester City's Craig Bellamy during yesterday's tempestuous Manchester derby at Old Trafford has been charged with unlawfully running on to the pitch.Bellamy confronted the man, who staged a solo pitch invasion, before the supporter was led away by match stewards. Neither the fan nor the Wales striker has made a complaint to police about the clash but the supporter will appear in court later this month over the pitch encroachment. Bellamy could also face further sanction.A Greater Manchester police spokeswoman said: "A man has been charged following an incident at the end of the match between Manchester United and Manchester City at Old Trafford."Jake Joseph Clarke, 21, is charged with going on to a playing area without lawful authority or excuse and will appear before Trafford magistrates court on 30 September."The supporter ran from the United section as City kicked off following Michael Owen's dramatic late winner in the home side's 4-3 victory.
