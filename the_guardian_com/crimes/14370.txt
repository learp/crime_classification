The Greater London Authority has robustly denied taking part in a "cover-up" of criticisms in a draft report about a Boris Johnson scheme to cut youth reoffending rates.The BBC reported on Thursday that the original draft report into the scheme, commissioned by the GLA, said the mayor's project had suffered because city hall's "payment-by-results" approach denied the scheme sufficient upfront funding, but this was removed before the final report was made public.But the GLA insisted the claim was untrue, and expressed disappointment at the negative portrayal of an "ambitious" pilot project designed to help young people turn their lives around.A city hall spokeswoman said the authority "remains proud of this project".Project Daedalus involved selecting 220 first-time offenders to serve their sentences in a separate wing of Feltham young offenders' institution, the Heron unit, to help them back into jobs or education.Young offenders selected to go into the Heron unit were assigned "resettlement brokers" – employed by the charity Rathbone – to help them after their release, in a scheme that cost nearly £3m.Half of the funding came from the European Social Fund and half from the mayor's London Development Agency (LDA), which insisted on the payment-by-results model – the coalition government's favoured approach to tackling crime.The independent evaluation of the scheme, conducted by the market research company Ipsos Mori and published in March, reported that Rathbone had been paid according to its success in meeting a range of targets including the number of offenders helped into education, training or employment (ETE). Only one in six remained in ETE for six months – a key target.The report's authors found that Rathbone was not paid in advance and had to spend too much time on targets and the claims process for payment, according to the BBC, which reported that the original draft report had said "it was hard for them to invest the necessary funds upfront for some of the innovation."Indeed, a number of stakeholders commented on the fact that Rathbone is restricted to some extent by the fact that they are not paid upfront; it was argued that receiving a percentage of their payments in advance of meeting targets may make more sense."The report's authors were told that payment-by-results models could dissuade charitable organisations from getting involved in future projects, a finding omitted from the final report, the BBC reported.In a single paragraph examining the funding process, the final published report mentions "frustrations" with the payment-by-results model.It said: "Resettlement brokers said they would at times feel conflicted in their working practice; there was an uncertainty as to whether their key concern at any one time should be meeting targets, or meeting the needs of young people."A city hall spokeswoman said: "There is no truth in claims by the BBC of some kind of cover-up or removal of criticisms in the independent Heron evaluation report. It is standard practice for all reports to naturally go through various drafts before being published and the mayor's office, the Ministry of Justice, Youth Justice Board, third sector and boroughs have amended inaccuracies and feedback suggestions to ensure findings are accurately reflected and evidence-based."The report has undergone rigorous scrutiny to ensure it is a true refection of the programme. This includes the reoffending data which has gone through comprehensive review by the Ministry of Justice and provides a formal reoffending rate of 41% for nine months post-release."
