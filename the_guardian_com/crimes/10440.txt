A man has been arrested over a fire last night that killed two apprentice jockeys and injured two others.North Yorkshire police said the man was being quizzed by detectives investigating the fatal blaze at a three-storey block of flats known as the Tannery in Norton, near Malton.The two who died are yet to be named. The injured pair were treated in hospital in York for minor burns and smoke inhalation.The racing world went into mourning with Kempton and Thirsk race courses staged a period of silence in remembrance, while jockeys at Stratford wore black armbands. York racecourse, which is staging a fixture tomorrow, was flying its flags at half-mast.Police said the man being held was arrested shortly after the fire. Superintendent Steve Tarn said: "We are going to interview him to establish his involvement or not."At this moment in time the police are treating it (the fire) as suspicious and would ask for the community in Malton and Norton for their help."Group manager Stuart Simpson from North Yorkshire fire service said crews were at the scene within five minutes but had to go in through windows because the staircase was on fire. Sixty firefighters were involved.Local people said dozens of residents fled the flats, some jumping out of windows, and took refuge at a nearby pub.
