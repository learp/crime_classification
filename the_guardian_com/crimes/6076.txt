There is still not enough evidence to bring charges over the murder of 15-year-old Jessie James, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.Two men, aged 20 and 21, were arrested last month after a witness came forward, halting the inquest into the death of the schoolboy, who was shot dead while cycling in a Moss Side park, Manchester, on September 9 last year.Both men have been freed without charge. A senior CPS lawyer said there was a long way to go before charges could be brought."Having reviewed all the evidence given to me, I have decided ... that it is insufficient for a realistic prospect of conviction and does not justify the charging of either suspect in connection with Jessie's murder," said John Lord, head of Greater Manchester's CPS complex casework unit.Mr Lord refused to go into details but said there were "serious contradictions and inconsistencies contained in the latest evidence".He added: "If further evidence comes to light which changes this, then I would review this decision."The two suspects were arrested in separate prisons in north-west England on August 9 after Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows adjourned the inquest to allow police to make further inquiries.Detective Superintendent Shaun Donnellan, who is leading the investigation, said today: "These arrests have been the most significant development this investigation has seen so far. For the first time a witness has been prepared to stand up and give a signed statement about who they believe was responsible for Jessie's murder."While I realise it may be disappointing that the arrests have not resulted in charges, I hope this highlights that we will act on witness testimony. We just need people to come forward."If we are to bring the killers to justice we need solid evidence. I know that it lies somewhere out there in the community."Police have said they thought Jessie's murder was a case of mistaken identity and that he was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".No one has yet been charged with Jessie's murder, despite numerous appeals from his family and police.
