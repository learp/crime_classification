British households are paying a hidden "tax" of £174.35 every year as a result of shoplifting and theft by staff from high street stores, according to figures released today.The cost of crime against retailers in the UK is the highest in Europe, reaching £4.3bn last year, or 1.33% of total turnover."Shrinkage", as the industry calls losses due to theft and wastage, cost retailers £19.5bn across Europe in the last 12 months. The main cause across the continent is shoplifting, accounting for 48.8% of all losses.Where the UK differs to continental Europe, however, is in the proportion of losses due to theft by shop staff. An estimated 38% of all retail shrinkage in Britain is due to theft from within, compared to 30.7% elsewhere in Europe.The most commonly stolen items, according to the latest European retail theft barometer, are, in order, womenswear, perfumes, designer wear and shoes, razor blades, cosmetics, alcohol, DVDs and menswear.The report said this was because such items were easily hidden on the person and could be sold on without difficulty. Next in line came computer games, electrical goods, including laptops, MP3 players, TVs, mobile phones and software."Shrinkage can often be viewed simply as a cost of doing business, but the social and economic impact of turning a blind eye is immense," said David Nuttall, managing director of Checkpoint Systems (UK) which compiled the report. "Retailers simply cannot afford to ignore the problem; it's not going to go away."Mr Nuttall pointed out that the cost of retail crime in Britain had fallen slightly in the past year, thanks in part to more widespread use of electronic monitoring systems and of software that monitored stock.Despite the cost to retailers, however, 40.6% of the most stolen items remain unprotected, the report found.
