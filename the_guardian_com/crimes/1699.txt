   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Boris Johnson was ambushed by female protesters who barracked him over his failure to "keep his promise" over the funding of four rape crisis centres across London, a video posted on YouTube reveals today.The Conservative mayor was surrounded by a group of London students yesterday afternoon as he was riding out on to the main road close to City Hall on his bike.The mayor was forced to stop and hold an impromptu interview after being confronted by members of the London Student Feminist group representing women from campuses from several London universities.The LSF said that, despite the mayor's promise of funding for four years, the only rape crisis centre in London has not received "a penny" of money from the mayor, more than 14 months after he was elected.Johnson has criticised the paucity of services for women in the capital experiencing sexual violence and used his mayoral campaign to promise £744,000 annually to fund both the only rape crisis centre in the capital, situated in Croydon, south London, and establish a further three centres across the Greater London area to cater to the needs of the capital's female population, which numbers 3.9 million.Though Johnson had envisaged securing this level of funding by cutting the media and marketing team he inherited from Ken Livingstone by 20%, he prompted widespread criticism last autumn by putting forward just £220,000 – around a third of the promised money.Johnson, who launched a strategy on tackling violence against women in April, subsequently pledged a further £700,000 from efficiencies to boost the money available to £1.4m over three years – equivalent to around £450,000 a year – but critics say this is still short of the £2.2m originally promised.Beth Evans, a spokeswoman for the group, said: "[Boris Johnson] promised to not only provide funding for the only existing rape crisis centre left in London but to set up three extra centres. So far the rape crisis centre in Croydon has not received any money ... What's more he has reduced the amount of money for the other centres."Pressed by the group to explain when the money was coming, Johnson said the group was "quite right to stick up for this [issue]" in the way that they did, and promised that the four rape crisis would materialise during his administration, although he refused to comment on the fact that the money earmarked was less than he had originally promised."My hope is that when we have another three rape crisis centres, which we will, that you will give the credit to this administration because we put them in place and the last guy [Livingstone] didn't."Rape crisis centres provide crucial support and independent advocacy for all women and girls who have experienced any form of sexual violence.The number of reported rapes in the capital shot up by 14.5% last year and domestic violence incidents rose by 4.4%. Yet only an estimated 10% of women who have been raped or sexually assaulted report it to the police and only 6% of all rape cases end in a conviction.The mayor's office conceded that the funding was not as much as originally pledged but insisted that the promised three centres would still go ahead by working with London councils. "We are going to work with London boroughs to make this happen," a spokeswoman said.Johnson's office said Croydon had yet to receive funding because the consultation on his strategy on tackling violence against women, The Way Forward, finished yesterday.The mayor will now consider the responses and an announcement on how the funding is to be spent will be announced shortly, according to his office.The Way Forward puts prevention of violence against women at its core, and will, for the first time, bring the work of the police, local authorities, voluntary organisations, NHS and criminal justice system to end all forms of violence against women together under one umbrella.
