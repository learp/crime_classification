Two pits are being investigated at a former children's home in Jersey which is at the centre of a child abuse inquiry, police said today.Officers began investigating the pits, one filled with lime, near the former boys' dormitory at Haut de la Garenne after a man contacted officers claiming he was asked to dig them during the 1970s or 1980s.He told police that when he asked staff what the pits were for, he was told "it was none of his concern".When he returned the next day he was ordered to fill in the pits. A police spokeswoman said forensic teams had dug out one pit and were working on the second. "The team excavated the first pit and found it to be about 1.5 metres [5ft] deep," she said. "At the bottom of the pit was a large quantity of lime. There was nothing else in the hole. "The inquiry team can think of no reason why this pit would have been created, nor why it was filled with lime."Fragments of a child's skull were found at the former children's care home in February.Tests on the skull, which was buried under a stairwell, were unable to identify the child but revealed that the bone was placed there no earlier than the 1920s.The site was first opened as an industrial school for boys in the middle of the 19th century. Haut de la Garenne closed in 1986.More than 100 people have contacted police claiming they were abused in four underground chambers which police have been investigating in the building.
