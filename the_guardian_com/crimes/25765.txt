Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a church organist who was attacked on his way to midnight mass on Christmas Eve.Alan Greaves, 68, suffered serious head injuries after being assaulted just metres from St Saviour's Church in High Green, near Sheffield.Two men aged in their 20s and 40s, both from Sheffield, have been arrested in connection with the death and were being held in custody on Saturday night.A South Yorkshire police spokesman said: "Officers are searching a number of properties in the area and there has been a high-visibility police presence in High Green today."Greaves was attacked at around 11.15pm on 24 December after leaving his home to go to church for the midnight service.He was discovered by a member of the public and taken to hospital but died from his injuries on Thursday night.Police have said the motive for the attack is unclear and are appealing for witnesses to come forward with any information.Greaves's widow, Maureen, 63, said she had been left devastated by her husband's death."It is just not what you expect, somebody to walk down the street and get murdered - and at this time of year as well, it's just dreadful," she told the Sun.Canon Simon Bessant from St Saviour's church described Greaves as a "good man" who fell victim to an evil act.He said: "He was a gentle soul. He wasn't foolish - he would have handled the situation as best as anyone would but we don't know what he encountered."The bishop of Sheffield, Dr Steven Croft, has sent a message to every parish in his diocese asking for prayers for Greaves and his family."Alan Greaves died on Thursday night following injuries received in an attack on Christmas Eve as he was on his way to church," he said."He was a reader and organist at St Saviour's Mortomley and High Green in Sheffield."He was married to Maureen, a Church Army evangelist and both Alan and Maureen were widely involved in serving their local community for many years. They have four grownup children."Please would you hold Alan's family and the church family at High Green, with Simon Bessant the vicar and the wider family of Church Army in your prayers in the coming days and especially this Sunday morning."
