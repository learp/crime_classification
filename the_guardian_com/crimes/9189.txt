Detectives have made three further arrests in connection with the brutal killing of soldier Lee Rigby.Two men, aged 24 and 28, were detained at an address in south-east London on Saturday, while a 21-year-old man was arrested in the street in Charlton Lane, Greenwich, all on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.Police from the counter-terrorism command, supported by specialist firearms officers, used Tasers to detain the 21- and 28-year-old. They did not need hospital treatment.The arrests came as Downing Street confirmed the launch of a new terror task force to crack down on extremism.The group, comprising cabinet ministers and top police and security service officials, will focus on radical preachers who seek out potential recruits in prisons, schools, colleges and mosques.The prime minister has also announced that the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) will carry out an investigation following the disclosure that the two men suspected of murdering Drummer Rigby – identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale, 22 – were known to MI5.Authorities in France are also investigating whether the murder of Drummer Rigby was linked to an attack on a French soldier, who was stabbed in the neck in a busy shopping area near Paris on Saturday.The latest arrests in London occurred between 6pm and 6.30pm, and the three men are being held at a south London police station, Scotland Yard said.Officers were last night searching four addresses in south-east London. Searches have also taken place at three other addresses in south London, one in east London, one in north London and one in Saxilby, Lincolnshire, the former home of Adebolajo.A 29-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder has now been released on bail, police said on Saturday night.Two women aged 29 and 31 have been released without charge after they were held on Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, and a number of other people not directly involved with the attack have been charged over malicious comments made on social networking sites.Adebolajo and Adebowale remained in a stable condition in hospital after being shot by police when they charged towards armed officers in Woolwich on Wednesday.Drummer Rigby was hit by a car and then attacked with weapons including a knife and a meat cleaver.The cause of his death has not yet been confirmed by a postmortem examination.The young father's murder has provoked a backlash of anger across the country, with mosques being attacked, widespread racial abuse and comments on social media and a large increase in anti-Muslim incidents.Up to 2,000 people took part in a EDL march in Newcastle on Saturday, which had been planned before Wednesday's attack.EDL supporters sang "RIP Lee Rigby" as they marched through the city, waving union flags and chanting "Whose streets? Our streets", before holding a minute's silence for the murdered soldier.Police said there were no major incidents, with a small number of arrests related to alcohol and public order offences. Three people were held before the march for allegedly making racist tweets.Meanwhile, the BNP has been accused of cynically exploiting the killing to further its "own poisonous ends" after the far-right group announced it would be demonstrating in Woolwich next Saturday.But while there have been widespread tensions, near the spot of Drummer Rigby's murder people showed solidarity on Saturday as they comforted one another and left floral tributes, adding to the thousands of bouquets already there.Along with the floral tributes at the corner of John Wilson Street and Artillery Place, where the attack took place, many hundreds more have been left outside the entrance to Woolwich barracks a few hundred yards away, where Drummer Rigby was based.Drummer Rigby's family also paid tribute to the soldier they described as their "hero"."Lee's dream growing up was always to join the army, which he succeeded in doing. He was dedicated and loved his job," they said in a statement.Drummer Rigby's wife Rebecca, mother of their two-year-old son Jack, said through tears that he was "a devoted father".A book of condolence has been opened at Woolwich town hall, where opening hours have been extended over the bank holiday weekend to allow the public to pay their respects.A service dedicated to the solider will be held at St Peter the Apostle Roman Catholic church in Woolwich on Sunday, while prayers will also be said at Woolwich's St Mary Magdalene parish church.Donations to the Help for Heroes charity through the JustGiving page linked to the RIP Woolwich Soldier Facebook tribute page topped £102,000 on Sunday.Almost £19,000 has also been raised on the official Help for Heroes JustGiving page.
