It must have been music to the ears of the reporter. He was on a plane from Lagos interviewing the father of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old who was murdered in Peckham last week, when the distraught man said that he considered his son's murder racist. Cue front page splash on 'Boy's West Indian tormentors'.All of a sudden we are left talking about whether there is a rift between Britain's West Indian and African communities. And more importantly whether this was to blame for the killing of the little boy. Next thing you know, activists on either 'side' receive phone calls from journalists. Leading questions are put to them. 'All West Indians are trouble makers,' says the Nigerian one. 'Nigerians are just arrogant,' retorts the Jamaican. Divide and rule was always the colonial way. The fact is that if you want to find aggro between any two communities it is not hard to do so. It's even easier when a tragedy such as the one that took place in Peckham last Monday has occurred - tensions are fraught and people are looking for someone to blame. The idea that Damilola was killed by West Indians because he was African serves many purposes, the most obvious being that it offers up a perpetrator. But is the state of relations between the two communities really that bad? The truth is that there has always been prejudice of some sort. But in my experience the situation has become better, not worse, over the years. I remember my mum warning me not to think that I was a West Indian because all they knew was how to cause trouble. And that was typical of the way people thought back then - we're talking early to mid-Seventies here. But I also remember the fact that mum didn't have any friends from a Caribbean background. The only people she ever really mixed with were other Nigerians. So her views were hardly surprising. Black people from the Caribbean came to Britain largely to work in manual trades, black people from Africa, certainly in the late Fifties and early Sixties when they first came here, did so to further their education. So to start with, you had two different classes of people. Caribbeans who wanted to go to uni versity tended to do so in the Caribbean. Blue-collar Africans were never invited to come over here and work and couldn't afford to either, so they tended to stay in Lagos. But things have changed as time has moved on. So in my generation - I'm 39 now - there was far more mixing. For a start we all went to the same schools. Second, we were all black, and third, we all had a common enemy which went by the name of the National Front. Now if that wasn't a reason for uniting then what was? On the social scene we all mixed together too. Listened to the same music, checked the same girls. Common experiences always break down barriers. Our parents were wrong, we found out. Not that there was no prejudice at all. I'm sure that some people of West Indian parentage have called me a 'bubu' or worse, and I've heard them called names too, but there was never any real hostility between us. Fast forward to the present day and as far as I can see any barriers that there were are almost all gone. Socially, we rave together, drink in the same places, laugh at the same comedy. One of the best indicators of whether or not a community is getting on with another is the level of intermarriage between the two. Many of my black friends are married to people of a different cultural background - West Indians to Africans and vice-versa. Thus there are many children who are of mixed parentage - African and West Indian. And when it comes to their generation they are pretty much all the same. When New Nation went to Peckham last week, one of the questions we asked was whether the kids there thought this was an African/West Indian issue. Not a single one of them did. They didn't have time for theories of a new racism. They simply said it was about kids with knives who were not afraid to use them. So while older people with a completely different agenda attempt to invent conflict where there is none, perhaps we would be wiser listening to those who really know what is going on on the streets - the people who live on them, the children.Â• Michael Eboda is editor of 'New Nation', Britain's biggest-selling black newspaper Related stories30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder 30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter' 30 November, leader: Death in Peckham 30 November: Head defends bullying record 30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe' 29 November: Death of a schoolboy 29 November: It's lawless out there Useful linksMetropolitan police The home office Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school Local media: South London online London borough of Southwark Photographs of the North Peckham estate
