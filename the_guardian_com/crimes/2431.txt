The home secretary still has an open mind about whether cannabis should be reclassified, the head of the government's drug advisers said today.Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, the chair of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), said that he had received a letter of reassurance from Jacqui Smith after reports that she was prepared to disregard the committee's recommendations.On the day that the ACMD begins a two-day evidence session examining whether tougher penalties should be introduced for cannabis - four years after it was downgraded from class B to class C - Rawlins said: "I will be reading a letter from the home secretary that I received yesterday, basically saying that the Government has an open mind."Some members of the committee had said that they would consider resigning if the government ignored their conclusions.Asked if he had been reassured by the pledges in Smith's letter, Rawlins said: "Absolutely, yes."He also revealed that the ACMD would today hear new evidence on the latest trends in the potency of the cannabis available on Britain's streets.Research on the drug's effects on mental health would also be discussed.Additionally, the ACMD would reveal the results of market research that looked into whether the public was aware of cannabis's current legal status and the potential penalties for using the drug.Cannabis was reclassified in January 2004, making possession a largely non-arrestable offence, and placing it alongside some prescription anti-depressants and bodybuilding drugs.Gordon Brown announced last July, within weeks of taking over as prime minister, that he would demand a new review of the drug's legal position because of emerging evidence about its effects and reports that stronger strains of the drug were becoming available.
