Four people have been arrested at Manchester airport on suspicion of terrorism, as part of investigations after nine people were stopped by the Turkish authorities on the Syria border earlier this month.Those arrested this morning are aged between 22 and 47. Their arrests follow those of two men, aged 21 and 31, yesterday.Officers are working to establish their reason for travel and apparent attempted entry into Syria, Greater Manchester Police said.The five adults and four children who had travelled to Turkey are from the same family and currently living in Rochdale.Waheed Ahmed, the 21-year-old son of Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed, was arrested at Birmingham airport yesterday, while a 31-year-old man was arrested in Rochdale.All six, arrested under the Terrorism Act, remain in police custody for questioning. The group, which included two women aged 47 and 22, three men aged 24, 22 and 21, and four children aged one, three, eight and 11, were stopped in Turkey’s Hatay province, close to the Syrian border, on 1 April. Labour councillor Shakil Ahmed said he thought his son had been in Birmingham on a work placement when he discovered that he had been detained in Turkey. Police searched Ahmed’s home earlier this month for clues as to why his son had travelled to the country. After the group were detained in Turkey, Greater Manchester Police said they had uncovered “no evidence whatsoever” of any imminent threat to the Rochdale community or elsewhere in the UK. In a statement on Wednesday police said: “Officers continue to work closely with Rochdale Borough Council, local partners, and faith leaders as part of the Prevent initiative.”
