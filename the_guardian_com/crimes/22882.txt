A gang on mopeds raided the store of leading British designer Luella Bartley early yesterday morning, smashing their way in with a sledgehammer before speeding off with more than £10,000 worth of luxury handbags.Minutes earlier, the gang had targeted Brora, a luxury cashmere store, escaping with thousands of pounds worth of rugs and sweaters.Scotland Yard believe the raids are linked and are keeping an open mind as to whether they are connected to other similar robberies on upmarket boutiques.Around 20 handbags were stolen from the Luella Bartley store in Mayfair, London, which only opened last week.About 10 minutes earlier the thieves had seized cashmere rugs and sweaters from Brora on Marylebone High Street, stuffing them into a white holdall.The raiders are described as being in their late teens or early 20s, wearing dark clothing, and used one grey and one black coloured bike, with two people on board each one.The locations of the stores are well covered by CCTV cameras, but the smash and grab raiders wore crash helmets with their visors down to try to avoid detection and had blacked out their bikes' licence plates.Detective Chief Inspector Martin Johnson, who is heading the investigation, said: "This is something that happens infrequently across the West End; we'd be foolish not to link them, based on the method employed."The tactic of using moped or motorbikes to attack upmarket fashion stores has been used several times by criminals this year. Asprey, the royal jewellers, lost £400,000 in one raid and has been robbed several times. In March necklaces and rings were stolen by a moped gang from Avakian, and in June tens of thousands of pounds worth of shoes were stolen from Roger Vivier.Mr Johnson said: "In general it's one or two people on motorbikes or mopeds, arriving at a premises that has high-value goods such as jewellery, exclusive fashion houses, attempting to gain entry through force. Once inside they scoop up what they can and flee as quickly as possible."Usually they strike in the early morning, when very few people are around."Luella Bartley had been based in New York and last week put on a show at London fashion week. She is a 34-year-old mother of three and a former fashion journalist.Upmarket stores are given advice about how to be a s "thief proof" as possible, but remain attractive targets because there is a big black market for their products.DCI Johnson said: "Unfortunately there's always a market for these goods, high-value goods which are easy to dispose of.
