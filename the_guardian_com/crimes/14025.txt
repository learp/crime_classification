The mother of a 12-year-old girl who was stabbed and strangled in Manchester has been found safe and well after going missing from her home.Lynn Ahmed, 34, disappeared from her home in Higher Broughton, in Salford, yesterday, five days after the body of her daughter, Tia Rigg, was discovered. Her disappearance prompted fears that Ahmed was a suicide risk and police launched an urgent appeal to find her.  Tia Rigg.
