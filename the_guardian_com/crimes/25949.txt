The former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been arrested in Mexico, it has been reported.An arrest warrant was issued last month for the 43-year-old in connection with the sale of Rangers Football Club in 2011.Whyte took control of Rangers in May 2011 but the club went into administration in February the following year.A crown office spokesman said they would take steps to ensure Whyte appeared at Glasgow sheriff court, the Daily Record reported.Four men appeared in court earlier this month charged with fraudulent activity linked to the sale of the club three years ago.Gary Withey, 50, David Whitehouse, 49, Paul Clark, 50, and David Grier, 53, were granted bail following a hearing at Glasgow sheriff court.A separate arrest warrant was issued for Whyte after he failed to attend a court hearing last week at the royal courts of justice in London after being ordered to pay more than £17m to Ticketus.Reports on Thursday morning also suggested a string of major figures from the club’s recent past could be called to give evidence in the impending court proceedings.The former owner Sir David Murray and ex-manager Walter Smith are likely to be called as witnesses, the Daily Record claimed.Also likely to be asked to give their version of events are former director Alastair Johnston – axed from the club’s board by Whyte – and the former chief executive Martin Bain, now working for Maccabi Tel Aviv.And current manager Ally McCoist confirmed he has also been warned he may have to take the stand. He said: “I have been sent information that [giving evidence] might be a possibility.”
