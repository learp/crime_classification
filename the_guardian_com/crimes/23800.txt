Widespread rumours that an episode of the TV series Shameless might have inspired the Shannon Matthews kidnap plot have been swiftly dismissed by the head of the police inquiry, Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan."I'd have picked up that straight away if it was correct," he said. "I was born in Gorton in Manchester where Shameless is made."An episode shown a month before Shannon disappeared involved the fake kidnap of a young boy, Liam Gallagher, in an attempt to claim a Â£500,000 ransom. The child was hidden a few doors away from his home, with a friend of his sister.Shannon's mother, Karen, and Michael Donovan were today found guilty of kidnapping the nine-year-old girl by drugging her and having her tethered to a wall in order to claim reward money offered for her safe return.Links between the programme, which attracted 2.5 million viewers, and the Shannon case never came up in evidence, either during the trial or in statements to police. Neither did Madeleine McCann, who went missing in Portugal and whose case dominated headlines for months before Shannon disappeared.Although the 24-day hunt for Shannon was a repeat of the agonising search in Portugal, Brennan said connections would have to remain speculative. "You can see the possibility. Madeleine was still fresh in everyone's minds," he said. "A young, pretty girl was being looked for in Portugal, and Shannon was a photogenic girl missing here in Dewsbury. You can see why two and two has been put together."Neighbours on the Moorside estate contacted the McCann campaign to ask for funding, but Shannon's mother was not involved.
