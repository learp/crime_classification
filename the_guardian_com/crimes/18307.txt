Four men have been jailed for a stabbing after a row about a mobile phone. The victim, Ernest Moyo, developed an infection that put his organs at risk and left doctors no choice but to amputate his arms and legs, Sussex police said.Moyo, known as Joe, who was 25 at the time of the attack in August 2012, was stabbed once in the thigh and twice in the abdomen after a fight at a party in Worthing, West Sussex. He was found in the road by emergency services, a police spokesman said.Moyo had little recollection of what had happened and his family were so distressed that at first they told him he had been in a car crash.Patrick Brookes, 27, from Worthing, and Jeremiah Reynolds, 26, from Ascham End, east London, were jailed for 16 years and 15 years respectively at Hove crown court after being found guilty in March of grievous bodily harm with intent.Dominic Brookes, 19, a student from Croydon, and 18-year-old Trey Johnson, from Worthing, were found guilty of the same charge at the same court last August, and were both sentenced to 15 years.Moyo's fiancee, Amy Dunne, said his family and friends were relieved at the sentences. "For two to three months every day both our families visited him hoping and praying, before finally he was taken off the life support," she said. "Joe and myself will have to deal with his injuries every day for the rest of our lives as we make a future together, making our lives totally different from what they would have been."DC Laura Sinden said: "The attack happened after a row about a mobile phone escalated into a young man almost losing his life. The injuries Joe sustained from the stab wounds have meant he had to have his limbs amputated and therefore the consequences of that night will be with him for the rest of his life."
