The prison service is to review the jail status of a man serving life for a murder he claims he did not commit. The case could set a precedent for prisoners who claim to be victims of miscarriages of justice and thus have to serve longer sentences than if they admitted guilt.In a brief hearing in the high court yesterday, it was announced that the case of Kevin Lane, 40, jailed for life for a 1994 murder, will be examined again by prison authorities. Lane had brought a case against the justice secretary, Jack Straw, because he is denied a downgrading of his prison status.Lane is a high security prisoner in HMP Frankland in Durham because he was convicted of what was seen as a gangland murder. He can only be downgraded if he attends courses that "address offending behaviour", which involve admitting guilt. Because Lane protests his innocence he is not eligible for such courses and is therefore unable to proceed towards release.Mr Justice Bean accepted the prison service would review Lane's status. Simon Creighton, Lane's solicitor, said: "My client is very pleased that the secretary of state has accepted the errors in the way he has approached the case and he is hoping his status will be downgraded as a result."Lane, of Potton, Bedfordshire, was convicted in 1996 of the murder of businessman Robert Magill, shot dead close to his Hertfordshire home. Lane claims the murder was committed by two other men.
