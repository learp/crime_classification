A teenage babysitter battered to death a two-year-old girl who had been put in his care for 90 minutes while her mother went shopping, a court heard today.Demi Leigh Mahon suffered 68 separate injuries to her body and died two days after the alleged attack at her home in Eccles, Salford, last year.The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies murder.The child's mother, Ann Marie McDonald, wept as she gave evidence today at Manchester crown court. She told the jury of six men and six women she had left her daughter with the defendant for around 90 minutes while she went out to pick up her child benefit and buy a birthday card.When she returned, the defendant was standing outside the house with another man. The teenager said: "I picked her up – I might have hurt her – and she fell in the park."McDonald said she rushed into the house and found her daughter in bed, with bedclothes partially covering her face. "Her face was bruised," she said. "I tried to pick her up and her head flopped back. She couldn't breathe properly.I screamed 'Why haven't you rung an ambulance?' He said: "I never done nothing I have not done nothing."McDonald sobbed as she pointed to the defendant and said: "He did that to my daughter," before leaving the court in tears.Prosecuting, Howard Bentham QC said the defendant had inflicted 68 injuries and a bite mark on the child.He told the court: "We say every one of those injuries were caused by this young man. They were all over her body but many of them were to her head and face and [the pathologist Dr Naomi Carter] drew the conclusion that young Demi had probably been punched repeatedly in the face."He said the defendant had lied about what he had done, claiming Demi had banged her head against a radiator and also against an ashtray.Mr Bentham told the jury the defence would argue their client had suffered an abnormality of mind that impaired his responsibility.
