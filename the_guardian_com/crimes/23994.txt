A top-level Scotland Yard detective, who worked on the July 7 bombings investigation, faces jail after today admitting to credit card fraud involving tens of thousands of pounds.Detective Sergeant Richard de Cadenet, 38, charged his personal spending to police corporate credit cards for over a year - and attempted to pass them off as expenses.One of Scotland Yard's most experienced anti-terrorist officers, he was one of three people eventually arrested by colleagues probing 'irregular usage' of the Metropolitan police's American Express corporate credit cards.The investigation that led to his arrest was managed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and was launched after auditors initially found £4.7m of expenses spending was not properly accounted for.The inquiries followed allegations about de Cadenet's overseas holidays and even his wife's cosmetic surgery.He pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court today to one count of 'misfeasance in public office' between July 18 2006 and October 2 last year.Prosecutor, David Levy, told the court that the amount of illicit expenditure initially attributed to de Cadenet was £81,000. This sum was disputed by the defence and the Crown Court said it was prepared to 'review the position...and while it may well be reduced it will not be reduced by much".De Cadenet, who has resigned from the Yard's SO13 unit, will be sentenced on September 4, after Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC reviews psychiatric and pre-sentence reports. Levy added that the defendant, whose wife is also a police officer, would remain out on bail in the meantime.In 2007 3,533 Metropolitan Police police officers and staff had corporate credit cards but the force has since cancelled 1,400.
