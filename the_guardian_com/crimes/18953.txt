Both the parents of missing Madeleine McCann have today been declared formal suspects in her disappearance.Kate McCann was named an "arguida" yesterday morning before undergoing questioning during which she was asked if she accidentally killed her daughter.Her husband Gerry was also given the legal status of a suspect during questioning last night.Detectives investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann yesterday told her mother that she was now formally suspected of involvement in her daughter's death, and apparently offered her a deal if she confessed to accidentally killing the three-year-old.Kate McCann, 39, was questioned over forensic evidence which might suggest that Madeleine died in the family's apartment at the holiday complex in Praia da Luz, rather than being snatched from her bed while her parents were eating dinner as the couple have always insisted.The family's spokesman, Justine McGuinness, said Mrs McCann was also asked about traces of blood found in a car hired by the couple four weeks after Madeleine's disappearance on May 3, and about DNA evidence allegedly found on clothing."They believe they have evidence to show that in some way she is involved in the death of her daughter, which is completely ludicrous," Ms McGuinness said.The line detectives were following was that it was Mrs McCann who was primarily responsible for the child's death, she added. Her husband, Gerry, was questioned separately after she was released without charge.Friends and family expressed shock and disbelief at the claims. Gerry McCann's sister, Philomena McCann, said: "They are suggesting that Kate has in some way accidentally killed Madeleine, then kept her body, then got rid of it. I have never heard anything so utterly ludicrous in my entire life."In a interview with ITV News, Madeleine's aunt added: "They tried to get her to confess to having accidentally killed Madeleine by offering her a deal through her lawyer - 'if you say you killed Madeleine by accident and then hid her and disposed of the body, then we can guarantee you a two-year jail sentence or even less'."Claims of a "deal" could not be confirmed last night with Portuguese police or the McCanns' representatives.Kate McCann was designated an arguida, or suspect, after being questioned for a second successive day at the police headquarters in Portimao, close to the resort where they had been on holiday when Madeleine disappeared.Ms McGuinness said Kate McCann had dismissed the allegations as absurd but feared Portuguese police might move on to actually charge her.The change in Kate McCann's legal status came on a day of high drama, after the results of forensic tests taken from their apartment and car were sent to Portugal from the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham. When Mrs McCann returned to the police station yesterday, she was confronted with a list of 22 questions, including one in which she was asked if she could explain how traces of Madeleine's blood had been found in a car that the family had hired 25 days after her disappearance.No charges have been presented against Mrs McCann or anyone else in the case.Before attending the police station, Mr McCann insisted any suggestion his wife was involved in their daughter's disappearance was "ludicrous"."Anyone who knows anything about May 3 knows that Kate is completely innocent," he wrote on his blog at the findmadeleine.com website.
