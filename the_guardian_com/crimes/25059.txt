PR guru Max Clifford has branded the women he allegedly assaulted as "fantasists and opportunists" who may be trying to win compensation.The 70-year-old, who is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven girls and women, told Southwark crown court that the women who claim he indecently assaulted them were telling a "pack of lies".Clifford made the claims as he was cross-examined by prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC on his third day in the witness box.In an occasionally heated exchange, the celebrity agent was asked to explain why a group of women from different areas, and of different ages and backgrounds, would have made claims about him allegedly assaulting them, sometimes in apparently similar ways.Cottage asked: "Why would somebody want to lie about what you did with your penis? Do you know any reason why these women would have lied to their family and friends all of these years ago?"Clifford replied: "I don't know, because I don't know them. I know that what they are saying is untrue. I can only think it's because of an opportunity for compensation, an opportunity to make something out of this in the current climate."He added: "Possibly they are just fantasists, possibly because they don't like me, they see an opportunity â€“ they would be the reasons."I know that what they are saying is totally untrue, it's pure speculation for me or anyone else as to why they are doing it, I know it's not true."Cottage said two alleged victims had separately made similar allegations about being indecently assaulted by Clifford while on holiday in Spain, while two others had given similar accounts of him making them touch his penis in a toilet.Asked by the prosecutor whether he knew anything that may have linked the women, Clifford replied: "I am not aware of anything that links them together apart from them telling a pack of lies." He said the women "all saw opportunities and they have all taken them".The celebrity publicist said the allegations had been "very, very damaging" to him and his family, but said he had not needed to go back and double-check his diaries to find out where he was at the time of the alleged assaults because he knew they were untrue."I knew that these allegations were totally untrue, so there was no need for me to check diaries because I knew it was rubbish and nonsense," he said, and also dismissed suggestions that he may have destroyed some of his diaries.Clifford claimed allegations that surfaced after his first arrest in December 2012 came after other women "saw it in the papers", but said: "These are lies made up by fantasists and opportunists".
