The new National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating UK suspects over the online illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road.Four men were arrested last week over their alleged role in the online marketplace, hours after the suspected creator of the site was arrested in the US, the NCA said, and other UK suspects were likely to be held in the coming weeks.The NCA, which was launched on Monday, said it was investigating four men, one in his early 50s from Devon and the others in their early 20s from Manchester, over their role in Silk Road. All four were arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs and have been bailed to a later date, a spokeswoman said.The now-closed Silk Road, said to be one of the world's largest websites selling illegal drugs, branded itself an "anonymous marketplace" because users accessed the site through Tor, a piece of software that hides browsers' identities.The NCA director general, Keith Bristow, said those who thought they could hide their identity should think again."These arrests send a clear message to criminals: the hidden internet isn't hidden and your anonymous activity isn't anonymous. We know where you are, what you are doing and we will catch you," he said. "It is impossible for criminals to completely erase their digital footprint. No matter how technology-savvy the offender, they will always make mistakes and this brings law enforcement closer to them."These so-called hidden or anonymous online environments are a key priority for the National Crime Agency. Using the expertise of over 4,000 officers and the latest technology, we will arrest suspects and disrupt and prevent their illegal activity to protect the public. These latest arrests are just the start; there are many more to come."The UK arrests came after NCA officers, led by a team at the agency's Exeter branch and working closely with US law enforcement, identified several suspects who they thought were "significant users" of Silk Road.The investigation also hopes to look into the criminal use of the wider "deep web" – parts of the internet not covered by standard search engines.Andy Archibald, head of the NCA's national cybercrime unit, said: "This is only the start of a wider campaign for the NCA to tackle the dark or deep web and the criminals exploiting it."These criminal areas of the internet aren't just selling drugs; it's where fraud takes place, where the trafficking of people and goods is discussed, where child abuse images are exchanged and firearms are traded. Stopping this element of serious and organised crime will go a long way to protecting the public."Dubbed Britain's FBI, the NCA is leading the fight against serious and organised crime under four commands: organised crime, economic crime, border policing, and child exploitation and online protection, alongside the cybercrime unit.As part of its work against internet threats it will also lead a multi-agency team, working with partners from around the world, which will investigate and fight the threat to the UK from virtual currencies.As part of the closure of Silk Road, millions of pounds' worth of bitcoins – a virtual currency used to buy online goods – were seized.Ross Ulbricht, 29, the alleged mastermind behind Silk Road, was arrested last week after a federal investigation that started in 2011, and is due to appear in court for a bail hearing in San Francisco on Wednesday.Ulbricht, who lives in San Francisco, denies charges that he operated the website. He has been charged in New York with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering in connection with Silk Road, which is believed to have collected more than $1bn (£620m) in revenue, and is also charged in Maryland with arranging to pay someone to kill a witness.
