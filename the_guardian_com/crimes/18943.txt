Sarah Campbell was 18 when she took an overdose at Styal prison, in Cheshire. It was the day after she was sentenced to three years; she could not cope.Her mother, Pauline, watched her wither on remand. "She was very distressed. She was cutting herself, her arms would be bandaged. She had ligature marks on her neck from where she had tried to hang herself," said Mrs Campbell. Sarah killed herself with prescription drugs on January 18 last year. It was the end of a promising life. She grew up in rural Cheshire, played tennis, went to the village school and then to art college. At 16, Sarah developed the heroin habit that lead to her death. In May 2002 Sarah and another woman began hassling a man in the street for money for heroin. "They were pestering him, but this man had a heart problem. He dropped dead. There was no violence, but Sarah was charged with manslaughter," said Mrs Campbell. Sarah was sent to Styal on remand, where she suffered withdrawal. "That should never have happened, it is very dangerous to come off drugs like that," said Mrs Campbell. By the time she was sen tenced on January 17 2003, Sarah had been free from drugs for around eight months. The next afternoon, she asked to see a prison officer. According to Mrs Campbell, there was a long delay before anyone saw her and at 4.25pm Sarah admitted having taken an overdose. She believes there was an unacceptable delay in the ambulance being called. Sarah died later in hospital. "I have no husband, no other children," said Mrs Campbell. "Sarah's death meant the end of my family." "Sarah was hardly more than a child and she found prison very difficult," said Mrs Campbell. "She told a prison officer what she had done. It was a clear cry for help, but they failed her. And I have had nothing but stonewalling - the system has also failed me."
