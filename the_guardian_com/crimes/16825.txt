Legal guidelines to be published today may recommend more lenient sentences for non-violent robbers, it emerged last night. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, the most senior judge in England and Wales, is to reveal a new set of draft rules for courts to deal with such criminals, as well as publishing separate guidelines on sentences handed down to perpetrators of domestic violence.At present, the sentence for street robbery or mugging ranges between 18 months and five years. The Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), which Lord Phillips chairs, considers recommendations put forward by a panel of experts which has suggested that most non-violent robbers should not go to prison. This stance contrasted sharply with a court of appeal ruling which said that there could only be "exceptional circumstances" when a street robber should not be jailed.And it remains unclear whether a controversial proposal on robbery published by the panel in May 2004 will be adopted, namely that juvenile robbers who used "minimal force" to commit their crimes should never get a custodial sentence. The panel also recommended downgrading sentences for muggings, robbery of small businesses, and "less sophisticated commercial robberies".The guidelines prompted the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, to say: "Mugging is a serious crime that merits a serious sentence. New guidelines should not tie the hands of judges. If they feel the offence was particularly violent, they should have the power to issue the appropriate tougher sentences."Government should avoid being rigid on this issue; every crime is different, and sentences should reflect that."Separate guidelines on manslaughter being issued later today are believed to closely resemble a draft from May, which said abused partners convicted of killing their spouses should normally go to jail. The SGC's draft version also said it was possible that someone who had suffered a high level of abuse over a long period of time could escape imprisonment.
