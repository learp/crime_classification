Thinktank reports tend to be rated by the number of the individual policies that are quickly grabbed by grateful jackdaw politicians, but sometimes their importance lies in whether they crystallise trends, and a new way of thinking about the purpose of government.The IPPR report, The Condition of Britain, published on Thursday is likely to notch a decent score on the first count, with the Labour leader Ed Miliband stealing some of its ideas, but it will probably do better still on the second, broader, count.Although the report was encouraged by Labour, it is not a pre-manifesto for the party, let alone a shadow budget. It addresses Social Britain – neighbourhood, welfare, housing, parenting, care for the elderly – and tries to come up with structural changes recognising that austerity requires smart reform of the public services, not more spending.One of its most striking themes is the switch away from materialism. "Social equality and how we relate to each other as citizens matters as much as material equality in closing the gap between rich and poor," it says.Would a Labour thinktank have written this a few years ago? "Excessive reliance on cash transfers to raise incomes has the effect of leaving people dependent on the spending preferences of the government of the day rather than experiencing the respect and dignity that comes from earning a living."After Miliband left the event where the report was launched, it was Labour's Jon Cruddas, the head of the party's policy review, who was most enthusiastic about its overall analysis, saying the party had to get into "the slipstream of [the report's] profound diagnosis".He said: "For us, why this report is so important is that it is coming off the back of our worst defeat since 1918 . There is a crisis of social democratic thinking and the last Labour government was somewhat disfigured by gang warfare and drive-by shootings."The fact is that Labour tends to be good in opposition and so tends to end up in opposition for a long time. So we need to put some jump-leads on this and get back in five years and re-imagine social democracy within a very cold climate economically."Cruddas said he liked the report's commitment to devolving power and responsibility. The report is clear, for instance, that cities (and, outside urban areas, combined authorities) must be handed power over integrated housing budgets, welfare and parts of the criminal justice system. He also welcomed the emphasis on shifting from cash transfers from the state to building local institutions and networks. He backed a switch in spending from cure to prevention – what was once described as more fences at the top of the cliff and fewer ambulances at the bottom.But it was notable that two bigger proposals were rejected by Labour. Miliband spurned the headline £2.6bn plan for free childcare for three-to-four-year-olds, paid for by freezing child benefit for those over five, limiting pension tax relief and abolishing the marriage tax allowance. Miliband said the party would stick to its existing childcare proposal funded from a bankers' levy.Labour staff also rejected the idea of an independent review into "how the national insurance system could be used to progressively lower the planned cap on care costs and raise the asset threshold, with the principles of contribution and risk pooling helping to finance long-term care costs".Many of the housing proposals await a further review. And if there is a criticism of the report, it is that two of its biggest proposals – to re-establish the contributory principle in welfare and switch from benefits to bricks in housing policy – are very long term, and may not produce savings for a decade.What the IPPR report says on families• Family month off for fathers when child is born, paying the minimum wage, plus paid time off for fathers to attend antenatal appointments.• A guaranteed full-time, year-round affordable childcare place for all one-to-four-year-olds, including a free 15-hour right for all two- to four-year-olds.
