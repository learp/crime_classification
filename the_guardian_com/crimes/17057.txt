The number of magistrates in England and Wales is in rapid decline, with benches increasingly comprised of JPs aged over 60, according to a report by a judicial monitoring organisation.The proportion of magistrates from minority ethnic backgrounds relative to the general population has also fallen significantly in recent years, the study released on Thursday by Transform Justice warns.Based on parliamentary answers and official figures, the number of justices of the peace has dropped by more than 1,800 in the past nine months and over 8,000 since 2009. In 2013, only 320 people joined the magistracy. There are currently about 22,160 JPs.Transform Justice says that magistrates are older and less representative of ethnic minority communities than in 1999. More than 55.5% are currently 60, compared with only 32% in 1999. In 14 areas of England and Wales, more than 60% of magistrates are over 60.Fifteen years ago, according to Transform Justice's figures, there were 2% fewer ethnic minority magistrates than in the population, now there are 6% fewer.The director of Transform Justice, Penelope Gibbs, said: "If the number of magistrates continues to shrink as rapidly as it has done recently, numbers will very soon dip below 20,000 and recruitment will grind to a halt."Courtrooms where every magistrate on the bench is over 60 will become common. If magistrates are to remain representatives of the people, radical steps need to be taken to increase recruitment, and to attract younger and more diverse candidates."Last month Labour peer Lord Beecham asked how many lay magistrates had resigned in the past year. He was told that 2,016 had stood down.The Conservative Lord Ahmad told him: "A more diverse judiciary is important in retaining the public's confidence and trust in justice, and better reflecting the society it serves. This government has made a number of changes through the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that we believe will promote judicial diversity."
