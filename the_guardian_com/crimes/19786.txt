A teenage gang laughed as they kicked and stamped a man to death after they had tried to burgle his home, a court heard yesterday.Mark Witherall was attacked after chasing the gang from inside his house in Whitstable, Kent. He died five weeks later in hospital from the injuries he received.Curtis Delima, 19, Mark Elliott, 19, Carley Firminger, 20, and a 16-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons are alleged to have carried out the attack last January.Opening the prosecution case, Camden Pratt QC said a CCTV camera had recorded the defendants' voices as they attacked the 47-year-old builder, whose groaning as he lay outside his house was also picked up by the recording.Maidstone crown court heard that on the day of the attack the teenagers had been at a party with Witherall's partner, Sally George. They had taken keys to the house she shared with him from her handbag and decided to burgle it.They peered through the window, saw Witherall asleep on a sofa, and entered through a back door.Pratt said: "It appears that Mark Witherall woke up, or if he was not fully asleep, became aware of them, because the crown suggests he chased them out of that house."Once outside he was first of all knocked to the ground with a spirit level. Having been knocked to the ground, his face, his head, his body, was repeatedly kicked and punched and he was stamped on, in what the crown says was a joint attack by the defendants."Pratt continued that after beating Witherall to the point of unconsciousness, the teenagers "ransacked" the house while Elliott acted as a lookout outside.Passersby discovered Witherall's body lying in a pool of blood on the pavement.Delima and the 16-year-old boy have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary - but Elliot has denied the charge. They and Firminger all deny murder.Voices on the CCTV recording could be heard, allegedly from the defendants as they looked into Witherall's house. A male voice said: "It's just Mark crashed out."Later another voice said: "Have you got a problem with me?"Shortly afterwards a male voice said: "I just knocked him out."There was sound of laughter before a series of shouts could be heard.The trial continues.
