This weekend sees the end of the government's consultation on proposals that could significantly change the way that help is given to victims and witnesses of crime. As not-for-profit organisations working in and around the criminal justice sector, or working with people affected by crime, we have shared concerns about some of the proposals being put forward. Foremost among these is the plan that funding for victim and witness services be channelled through the new police and crime commissioners (Comment, 18 April), with few guarantees that support will be available to those most in need.We would all endorse the principle that local services should meet local needs. The proposal to achieve this by dividing up current national arrangements and funding into 42 local pots is not a convincing one. Many funding arrangements have shown us that local sharing out of government funding brings with it a significant risk of high administration costs. Even more importantly, it could result in patchy and ineffective service delivery, with those with the greatest needs even more likely to miss out. We urge the government to reconsider this proposal and recognise the risk that local commissioning will end up costing more and will ultimately mean that victims in need of crucial help and support will pay a heavy personal price.Shami Chakrabarti, Director, LibertyMark Goldring, Chief executive, MencapJaved Khan, Chief executive, Victim Support Juliet Lyon, Director, Prison Reform Trust Paul McKeever, Chairman, Police Federation of England & Wales Matt Searle, Director of Operations & Consular Liaison, Lucie Blackman Trust - Missing AbroadDebra Clothier, Director, Escaping VictimhoodBarry Mizen, Founder the Jimmy Mizen Foundation Hazel Evans, CEO, Through UnityRose Dixon, CEO, SAMM National Cynthia Barlow, Chair, RoadPeaceAnn Oakes-Odger Founder/CEO, KnifeCrimes.Org & Victims' AdvocatesAnn Chalmers, Chief executive, Child Bereavement Charity
