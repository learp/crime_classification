The Home Office is preparing to tighten the law preventing the doctoring of stolen mobile phones in its forthcoming violent crime bill, the Guardian has learned.The bill will make it easier to arrest people for illegally reprogramming phones to resell them, in an attempt to stem the wave of street robberies and thefts of mobile phones.The crackdown comes as the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, last week blamed April's 26.4% rise in robberies on the fashion for flashy phones and iPods.It is estimated that some 700,000 mobile phones are stolen in the UK every year. Thefts of handsets now account for 10% of reported crime in London and an average of 304 phones are stolen in the capital every day, half of them from under-18s.Police refer to phones and iPods as "CRAVED" - concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable or disposable items. Mobile phone handsets have a unique 14-17 digit number, the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), which is blocked from its owner's network within minutes of being reported stolen and by every other network in the country within 24 hours, rendering the phone useless.Unblocking software is available on the internet and a kit, including the wire to attach the computer to the phone, has been available to buy on eBay - which is now working with the police to stop the sale of the equipment.The technology works by reprogramming the phone's IMEI number. It is the same technology used to "unlock" a phone from one network for use on others, which is legal and advertised freely on the high street. In phones produced in the past year the IMEI number has been encrypted and made harder to reprogramme.Jack Wraith of the Mobile Industry Crime Action Forum said: "We have come across no evidence that blocking of the new generation of mobile phones from the last 12 months has been compromised. But that day will come and we will have to catch up with them again." However, around two-thirds of phones in use are old generation and therefore still vulnerable to being doctored, he added.The National Mobile Phone Crime Unit, based at Scotland Yard, has carried out 200 raids on market stalls, shops and homes where unblocking is being done, and has arrested 200 people in two years. They found the same shops offering unlocking services regularly offering to unblock stolen phones as well.But each arrest has involved a lengthy police sting, and Superintendent Eddie Thomson, head of the unit, said this has hampered operations.The violent crime bill will make offering or agreeing to unblock a phone a crime, rather than the actual act of doing it. The law will be similar to those preventing ticket touts offering tickets for resale.A spokesman for the Home Office said that ministers accepted the law needed to be tightened up.Police say that they are also facing a new phenomenon of mobile phones being stolen for bulk orders to ship to other countries where they cannot be blocked.Supt Thomson said: "Initially we focused on low-level street crime, the selling of phones in the pub. We feel confident that we've combated those crimes for now."But there is now strong evidence that [stolen phones] are being exported around the world. We know that every single continent has received stolen phone from the UK. Foreign networks tell us that phones stolen from the UK are being picked up on their networks, where there is no power to block them."The unit has identified 40 countries where mobile phones stolen in Britain are being traded for shipments of drugs including ecstasy and heroin.It estimates that the illegal export trade was worth up to Â£140m last year.It has also launched an online register of mobile phones, www.immobilise.com where users can register details of their phone.
