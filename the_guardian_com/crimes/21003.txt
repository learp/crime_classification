We represent a range of voluntary organisations, but our common ground is an interest in the conditions for, and treatment of, older prisoners, whose number trebled in the decade to 2002 (Prisons accused of ignoring age trend, December 14).Prisons are primarily designed for and inhabited by young and able-bodied people. More than 80% of older prisoners have reported at least one chronic illness or disability and more than half have been shown to suffer from a mental disorder. These prisoners do not usually present disciplinary problems and their most common disorder, depression, renders many of them undemanding. With 84 of 139 prisons overcrowded and in the absence of a strong national lead, the shocking cat alogue of neglect documented by the inspectorate is hardly surprising. Urgent action is needed to improve regimes, staff training, health and social care and resettlement. We strongly support the chief inspector's call for the Department of Health and the Prison Service to develop a national strategy for assessing and responding to the needs of older prisoners.

In 2003, of the 300,000 detainees in police custody in London some 10,000 were immigration detainees held on behalf of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Many stayed there for three or more days, effectively acting as cell blockers. If the IND housed these detainees there would possibly not be the need for this move.
