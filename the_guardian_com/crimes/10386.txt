Motorists who use credit and debit cards to buy petrol are thought to have lost millions of pounds in an international 'skimming' scam believed to have funded Sri Lankan rebels.Bank details are being skimmed by a criminal gang understood to be backing separatist group the Tamil Tigers at petrol stations throughout the UK. Card details and Pin numbers are retrieved and money withdrawn from customer accounts. Around 200 of the UK's 9,500 petrol stations are believed to have been targeted. Police are investigating complaints made in Edinburgh, Norwich, Bury St Edmunds, Peterborough, Nottingham, Leeds, Bristol and Hull. Maxwell Keegel, first secretary of the Sri Lankan High Commission in London, claimed the Sri Lankan government had evidence to suggest the scam was funding separatists. Police are investigating the claims and have found no evidence of a definite link.Ray Holloway, of the Petrol Retailers' Association, said his members tried to tackle the problem by training staff: 'The gangs offer large sums to some employees to be involved in it.' Many British petrol stations are independently run which makes them vulnerable to organised crime.
