The boyfriend of a job centre worker who was reported missing on St Valentine's Day appeared in court yesterday charged with her murder the day before "at a place unknown".Paul Dyson, 30, a wood machinist, was remanded in custody for a week by deputy district judge Helen Cousins at Hull magistrates court.He is accused of killing 22-year-old Joanne Nelson, who shared a house with him in Hull. The alarm was raised after Joanne failed to turn up for work, and her car was found unlocked but unused near the couple's home.Police gave detailed information outside the court about their search for her body, which has spread to an area stretching from the Humber to north of York. Farmers and walkers were asked to keep a lookout for anything unusual in open ground near wooded areas.Det Supt Ray Higgins, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: "I would ask them to pay particular attention to areas near to gates and to be especially alert if a gate has suffered recent damage. It has also been suggested that the gate may have green bottles near to it."Vale Watch (Farm Watch), which covers the Vale of York area, has also been contacted and have made their members aware of the search for a body and asking for their assistance to check their land."Mr Higgins appealed for in formation about any sightings of Miss Nelson's white, M-registered Renault Clio, which was seen in the east Yorkshire market town of Howden early on Sunday afternoon, the day before she was reported missing.He said: "This is a very difficult time for Joanne's family and everyone involved in the search. I need the public's help in tracing her body as soon as possible to help her family during this distressing time."A helicopter using heat-seek ing equipment has already helped search parties on wasteland and a golf course near the couple's home. Specialist teams also focused on the Brantingham area, on the edge of Hull, at the weekend as well as the Humber foreshore at Hessle.Mr Dyson appeared in court accompanied by two security guards. He gave his name, date of birth and address, and confirmed the name of his solicitor, Richard Thompson. There was no application for bail.
