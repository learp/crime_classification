A mother has been warned she could be jailed after she admitted leaving her three young children in a car in "dangerously high heat" last Monday.The youngsters, aged between two and eight, were left for 45 minutes in temperatures of 40C (104F) inside the vehicle. Kelly Marie Langham, 26, of Carlisle, told magistrates she thought she would only be away for a few minutes as she visited a city centre shop. She left the car windows slightly wound down but said she did not realise the heat could rise to the extent it did. Langham arrived at the car just after the police were called.Carlisle magistrates court heard that Langham explained to the officer that she had been to the Cash Converters store in Lowther Street – out of sight of the vehicle – and been been stuck in a queue.She was arrested and when interviewed stated that she had earlier taken amphetamine at her home. Langham went on to explain she had become dependent on the drug on a daily basis.Her solicitor, Claire Kirkpatrick, explained to the court that her client did not intend to leave her children in the car for so long in "dangerously high heat".Langham pleaded guilty to three counts of wilful child neglect or ill-treatment and also possession of amphetamine.The case was adjourned until 1 August for presentence reports but magistrates told her they would not rule out custody at this stage.The children did not require hospital treatment but were left traumatised after being removed from the car, a police spokesman said last week.
