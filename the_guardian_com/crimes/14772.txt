Six of the convicted Hatton Garden raiders will learn their fate on Wednesday when they are sentenced for what prosecutors have called the biggest burglary in English legal history.After two days of mitigation the judge, Christopher Kinch, adjourned a sentencing hearing on Tuesday to consider the punishment he will hand down to the six men, who include pensioners and career criminals involved in some of Britain’s biggest heists.The men, aged between 49 and 77, will return to Woolwich crown court on Wednesday morning to be sentenced but will not be joined by one of the key ringleaders – Brian Reader – who suffered a stroke and is undergoing tests for cancer.Ringleaders John “Kenny” Collins, 75, Daniel Jones, 61, Terry Perkins, 67, and Reader, the group’s oldest member at, 77, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary last September.Carl Wood, 59, and William Lincoln, 60, were convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property after a trial.Plumber Hugh Doyle, 49, who had a lesser role in the conspiracy, was found guilty of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property between 1 January and 19 May last year. Making submissions on behalf of their clients on Tuesday, lawyers representing the men found guilty of the £14m burglary asked the judge to take into account the harsh conditions of their remand in custody at Belmarsh prison when he sentences them. Nick Corsellis, defending Wood, said time in Belmarsh had been particularly hard on his client, who has Crohn’s disease, and asked the judge to take into account the fact that Wood’s inevitable jail term would mean that he will “not see” his ailing parents again.He said: “His remand in custody had been particularly difficult because he, and they (the other men), are in double A category. That means that they are housed in a cell on their own. And they are given one hour of exercise a day. It is very rare that that is achieved – half an hour at best. Half an hour of daylight.”Paul Keleher QC, defending Doyle, asked the court to take into account the fact that Doyle spent six months in Belmarsh before being released on bail once the crown dropped a more serious burglary charge against him.Mitigating on behalf of Lincoln, Dante Leccacorvi listed his client’s ailments – arthritis, high blood pressure, chronic sleep apnoea – and said that while these were not life-threatening they had made his time in custody harder that it would otherwise had been.
