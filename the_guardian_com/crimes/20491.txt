For 13 years John Worboys portrayed himself as a respectable, hard-working London cab driver. But to the women he attacked he represented a figure of absolute terror.Having picked them up late at night he elicited their sympathy and pity, before manipulating them into taking a drink spiked with powerful date rape drugs which police have never seen used before. Once his victims were insensible he assaulted or raped them.Like many of the capital's 25,000 black-cab drivers Worboys worked late at night, ostensibly because trade was more lucrative but also because at that time he could target women who were alone, vulnerable and desperate to get home.His tactics proved financially successful. Earning wages of £1,000 cash in hand a week, he bought properties in Enfield, north London, Rotherhithe in south-east London, and Harpenden, Hertfordshire.But it was his life on the south coast in Bournemouth, where Worboys owned a studio, that held the clues to his sordid secret life.His studio flat was rented out to David Charles, also known as David Sands, a pensioner who was a glamour photographer and ran a "swingers' club" in nearby Southampton for couples looking to spice up their sex lives.Sands was a close friend of Worboys, and police discovered that the cabbie allowed his studio to be used as the backdrop for pornographic movies which gained a cult following on cable television and the internet.Worboys himself starred in at least one, acting out the fantasies that he could never achieve in real life.Worboys saw his connections with the pornographic industry and topless modelling as some kind of badge of honour, boasting about them to his victims, even as he eyed them up to assess their suitability for film work.He asked two 19-year-old passengers whether they would consider topless modelling, telling one of them "you fit the boat".As well as being a porn star, Worboys worked as a male stripper in Southampton for 13 years using the pseudonym Terry the Minder, and entertained hen parties and women-only nights.When he ended his career in 1999, aged 42, his hair was greying, he developed a paunch and he was often mocked for his feminine voice and questioned over whether he was gay.Forced by his increasing age and deteriorating looks to give up the stripping, Worboys studied the knowledge and passed in 1996, giving him a position of trust and power over women when they were at their most alone and vulnerable, late at night in the back of his taxi.Five years into his cabbing life, Worboys was prescribed a heavy sedative, which he continued to stockpile for six years as part of a rape kit that would knock his victims out and leave them with little or no memory of what had happened, thereby making it all the more difficult for the police to investigate his crimes.The prescription drug was combined with another over-the-counter medicine to create a powerful cocktail which quickly left the women semi-conscious and powerless to his assaults.The women he picked were always professional, clever, ­attractive and independent – and, he admitted, totally out of his league. He would tailor his lies to them accordingly, claiming he had been to university or, if he wanted to elicit pity, that he was lonely.In every case Worboys, a one-time milkman, backed up his story with a fat wad of cash, on one occasion fanning it out like a quiz show contestant, and his tall tale – which he called his "banter" – about winning a fortune in the lottery, or at a roulette table.Dressed in tracksuit bottoms, reeking of Issey Miyake aftershave and with a bag filled with Tesco own-brand drink, sedatives and an ashtray to grind up the drugs, he made sure he had everything needed to carry out his plans.Worboys painted a pathetic picture in the witness box, claiming that the women had willingly had sex with him and blaming his craving for attention on a lack of "cuddles" when he was a child.Born in 1957 in Enfield, Middlesex, he grew up with his younger sister, Barbara. His mother was diagnosed with cancer when he was nine and died four years later leaving the children to be brought up by their father.He left school at 16 with four CSEs and joined the Express Dairy in Potter's Bar as a milkman. Despite his claims to be lonely and unloved Worboys had a string of relationships, marrying in 1991.By 1995 the relationship was over, however, and a year later Worboys began his career as a black-cab driver.He protested during evidence: "I wanted to get these women home safely, which I would always do."But in reality, he used his position of trust to abuse and terrorise on a scale which makes him one of the most prolific serial sex attackers in British criminal history.
