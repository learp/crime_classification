Those behind Soca don't like being called the British FBI but its creation does mark the introduction of some US-style ideas of justice into the British legal system. For the Serious and Organised Crime Agency isn't just about bringing together 4,200 police, customs, immigration and MI5 officers into a more sophisticated and integrated body to tackle the Â£20bn-a-year trade in organised crime. They will also have new powers at their disposal.The most important stems directly from the American experience in tackling the mafia and major drug gangs - the formal introduction of plea bargaining and a system of "supergrasses" into the criminal justice system in England and Wales. The prime minister was in no doubt yesterday that the offer to turn Queen's evidence - immunity or a reduced sentence in return for testifying against fellow gang members - was the best way to breed uncertainty in any criminal organisation. There is a promise of new safeguards against corruption.Soca has to persuade the public that not only footsoldiers, such as street dealers, but also middle-ranking organised crime figures involved in people trafficking and heroin smuggling should be free to walk the streets because their evidence has put away more significant crime figures. Harm reduction, as it is called, is at the centre of Soca's strategy - a fundamental shift in tactics from arresting every drug dealer or seizing every shipment. It is regarded as more important to break up criminal networks than to secure a short-term publicity coup by making quick arrests. It works for the FBI because it makes sure it gets the headlines for every operation so it gets funding.But Soca will have to build new partnerships with the new regional police "superforces", customs and tax investigators, and private businesses. An FBI-style strategy of claiming credit for everything they are involved in will get up their partners' noses.
