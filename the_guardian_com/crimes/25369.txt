A playwright who owns the New End theatre in Hampstead, north London, is premiering a play in Leeds about the Yorkshire Ripper within a mile of the red light district where Peter Sutcliffe attacked some of his victims.Brian Daniels, who has written the play Where's Your Mama Gone, was a trainee teacher in the city in the 1970s when Sutcliffe was terrorising the local community.His play was inspired by the autobiography of Richard McCann, whose mother, Wilma McCann, was Sutcliffe's first known victim. Her murder in 1975 took its toll on her daughter, Sonia, who eventually took her own life.Daniels, who is also a theatre producer, said: "I wanted to write about the effects that a murder like that has on the rest of the family - whether a family can live a normal life after something like that. All murders of this type leave behind a string of other victims - the surviving relatives and friends."The play follows last month's court of appeal ruling that Sutcliffe, now 64, who was convicted 30 years ago of murdering 13 women, will spend the rest of his life behind bars. While Sutcliffe may appeal, Daniels is putting the finishing touches to his play, which will be staged at the Carriageworks theatre for a six-week season from 18 April."I can remember the fear that all women had of going out," he said. "No woman felt safe."In conducting his research, he spoke extensively to McCann. The play is about siblings whose mother, who works as a part-time prostitute, is murdered in similar circumstances to Wilma McCann. Her daughter eventually kills herself.Daniels said: "When I first wrote the play, I was collaborating with Richard McCann. Then I decided to fictionalise it because I sensed it was difficult for him to accept some of the issues that have to be dealt with in the play. He felt it was 'his mum'."An exhibition and educational programme will accompany the play after an application to the Heritage Lottery Fund, supported by the NSPCC, was given the green light last week.
