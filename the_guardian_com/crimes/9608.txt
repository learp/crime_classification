A modern-day Artful Dodger is believed to have been trained by his family to work in a gang of mobile phone thieves operating in cafes and fast-food restaurants, police said today.Detectives suspect that the child, who turned 10 at the weekend and can now be prosecuted, is part of a group responsible for 30 phone thefts in Leicester in the past two months. Officers believe the child works with other youths up to the age of 18, stealing from people who have left their phone on view while they eat. It is thought that the families involved, who are known to police, may travel around the country and could be responsible for offences in Derby, Cardiff and Sheffield. A police spokeswoman said: "We suspect that he was trained by his family but we are still in the process of gathering evidence. "There were concerns for his welfare and the way he was being brought up and the possible criminal background of his parents ... We are very keen to get any information we can from the public about these offences." A 15-year-old boy was arrested on Wednesday by Leicestershire police on suspicion of a number of thefts. He was still being questioned yesterday.
