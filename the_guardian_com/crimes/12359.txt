A Saudi prince was remanded in custody at the Old Bailey accused of ­strangling a man at a luxury central London hotel. Saud Bin Abdulaziz Bin Nasir Bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, 33, was in the dock to hear his application for bail adjourned to allow for defence submissions. His father, a nephew of the Saudi king, sat a few feet away. Saud is charged with murdering 32-year-old Bandar Abdullah Abdulaziz, said to have been an aide, whose body was found at the Landmark Hotel in ­Marylebone last week, and causing him grievous bodily harm on 22 January.
