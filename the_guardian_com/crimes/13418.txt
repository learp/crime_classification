Dartmoor and Liverpool prisons, which have been named as among the worst in England and Wales, yesterday escaped privatisation after demonstrating their potential for improvement.Martin Narey, Home Office commissioner for correctional services, who took the decision, said there had been advances at both prisons and they would remain under public sector management under a new five-year contract. Dartmoor was criticised last year by Anne Owers, chief inspector of prisons, as the "prison that time forgot". Liverpool, the largest jail in western Europe with 1,500 inmates, has been described as running an "unacceptable regime". Both prisons have improved significantly since the threat of privatisation was announced in April, when they were put through the "performance testing" process. Mr Narey said that new agreements had been reached with the unions at both jails to provide more out-of-cell time, greater access to showers, and more effective resettlement programmes. The agreements concluded with the governors and staff of each prison are designed to set minimum standards for every aspect of prison life. "When I visited each of the prisons last month I was delighted with the improvements made so far, and I am confident progress will continue during the lifetime of the service level agreement," said Mr Narey.
