The man dubbed the "Camden Ripper", Anthony Hardy, was today given three life sentences for the murder of three women.Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Keith told Hardy: "Only you know for sure how your victims met their deaths but the unspeakable indignities to which you subjected the bodies of your last two victims in order to satisfy your depraved and perverted needs are in no doubt." Hardy, 53, from Camden in north London, had previously denied the murders, but changed his plea to guilty within minutes of appearing in dock earlier today. His counsel, Malcolm Swift QC, asked the judge to allow three charges to be read to him again. The unemployed 53-year-old replied "guilty" as each was read out. At a hearing in April, the unemployed 53-year-old denied murdering Sally White, 31, Elizabeth Valad, 29, and Bridgette MacClennan, 34, in December 2002. All of the women had worked as prostitutes in London.Parts of the dismembered remains of Ms MacClennan and Ms Valad were found in bin bags and rubbish bins in north London in the early hours of December 30, 2002. The body of Ms White was found in January last year. Mr Justice Keith told Hardy he would have to decide later whether he could ever be released on licence by recommending a minimum term.
