Judges need more powers to deal with people who cause fights in county courts, according to Sir James Munby, president of the family division. Delivering judgment on a father who punched and kicked his former wife during an access hearing at Southend county court, Munby said only sentences of up to three months could be imposed by civil courts.Simon Ramet, who carried out the assault, had already been sentenced by a crown court to 20 months for the attack. Munby said that, although his behaviour had been "disgraceful", Ramet had already been punished enough and he did not propose to add to his misery beyond finding him guilty of contempt.But he expressed concern at the difficulties civil courts faced in dealing with serious contempt. Judges and recorders should be given more extensive powers in such cases, he said.
