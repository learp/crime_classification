Newcastle United officials today said they planned to hold urgent talks with Joey Barton over his future after he was sentenced for an attack on a former Manchester City teammate.The midfielder, capped once by England, was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to do 200 hours community service after admitting to punching Ousmane Dabo, 31, during an argument at training.Barton, 25, is already serving a six-month sentence for an attack on a group of people outside a Liverpool branch of McDonald's on Boxing Day last year.Today's sentence has been suspended for two years. Barton has also been given a nine-month supervision order and ordered to pay £6,500 costs, with £3,000 going to his victim."Newcastle United notes the sentence passed to Joey Barton at Manchester's Minshull Street crown court today," the Newcastle statement said."The club now intends to hold discussions with Joey and his representatives at the earliest possible opportunity. "Until such time that this meeting has taken place, there will be no further comment from the club."Sentencing Barton, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told him: "As a professional footballer, you are someone who is talented and greatly idolised by young and old alike, whether you are playing at Manchester City and now at Newcastle United."You are constantly in the public eye. You have a high profile, there would be instances of provocation ... being an idol brings with it responsibilities which you have to carry with you all the time."The judge told Barton he should be "setting an example, particularly to those who idolise you, particularly youngsters who look up to you".Barton and Dabo were on opposite teams in a training match when the former made a late challenge. An argument broke out after the match finished and, as Dabo walked away, Barton ran to him and punched him on the side of the head, a police statement said.Barton had previously ''strenuously denied'' the assault on Dabo, claiming he had acted in self-defence.However, he changed his plea when awaiting trial and yesterday admitted attacking the Frenchman, punching him to the ground and continuing the attack in an "explosive combination of football and violence", the court heard. Dabo, who was unconscious and covered in blood after the attack, was taken to hospital with a trauma injury, a scratched retina and severe bruising to his face. He needed stitches for the cut below his eye, could not sleep for a week and suffered from headaches for three weeks. Another of Barton's then teammates, Georgios Samaras, said he had never seen such a violent incident on a football pitch and added that he would never forget it.Barton pleaded guilty after Khokhar indicated that he would impose a suspended sentence for the assault.
