A tale of greed, woe and comic folly - not unlike those contained within its ancient pages – appeared to be nearing its final act today after the recovery of a "priceless" edition of Shakespeare's plays stolen a decade ago.The first folio edition, printed in 1623, was among a number of books and manuscripts taken from Durham University library in December 1998.The Shakespeare book alone would have a market value of around £15m, though the university described it as an "irreplaceable" part of north-east England's heritage.At the time it was stolen, experts said it was "the most important printed book in the English language".Today, detectives confirmed that a man was arrested last night in the town of Washington, Tyne & Wear, after the book had been taken to a US library.Durham police said a 51-year-old man, claiming to be an international businessman who had acquired the volume in Cuba, had showed the folio to staff at a library in Washington, DC and asked them to verify it was genuine.In a moment of apparent foolhardiness, he agreed to leave it with librarians, whose research revealed it as stolen.After a search involving the FBI, the British embassy in Washington DC alerted Durham police to the find. Academics from Durham University expressed their "excitement and delight" at the Shakespeare volume's reappearance.Bill Bryson, chancellor of the university and author of a book on Shakespeare, said: "Like Shakespeare himself, this book is a national treasure, giving a rare and beautiful snapshot of Britain's incredible literary heritage."I'll certainly be joining the crowds who will be eagerly welcoming it home."The Shakespeare first folio was acquired by John Cosin, former bishop of Durham, and was part of the library he established in Durham in 1669.It was one of the first collected editions of Shakespeare's plays printed. Only between 200 and 300 copies are thought to have survived.It was taken from a display stand during an exhibition charting English literature since the middle ages. Also stolen were two handwritten manuscripts from the late 14th or early 15th century, one bearing an English translation of the New Testament and the other being a fragment of a poem by the Canterbury Tales author, Geoffrey Chaucer.A Beowulf edition printed in 1815 and two editions of the Old English epic by the 10th century scholar Aelfric, one printed in 1566 and the other in 1709, were also taken.The arrested man was taken to Durham city police station where he was still being questioned, Durham police saidA police spokesman confirmed that officers had discovered other old volumes at the Tyne & Wear property."They have found a large number of old books and documents."They will be inspected by experts."He said there was no suggestion at the moment that the house contained the other seven books and manuscripts taken from the library.The Shakespeare edition is in the care of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC until it is returned to Durham. The university's vice-chancellor, Prof Chris Higgins, said security had been significantly improved in the past decade.
