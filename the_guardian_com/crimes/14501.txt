A DJ killed a man who woke up at a party to find a penis had been drawn on his face, the Old Bailey has heard. The joke is said to have turned sour when the "boy banter" got out of hand and partygoer Anthony Thompson, 26, was punched to the ground outside. Thompson's head struck the floor and he died from brain damage, jurors were told.Thomas Evans, 32, of Morden, south London, denies manslaughter, claiming self-defence. Vanessa Barrows, who hosted the 10-hour party at her flat in Tooting, south London, in February last year, told the court that everyone at the party had been enjoying themselves.She said Thompson had fallen asleep in an armchair when morning approached and some condoms had fallen out of his pocket. She added: "I got my lipstick out and drew a penis on his face. It was done for a laugh." Barrows said that when Thompson woke up, he had seen the funny side of it. She also nodded off and woke to find a row going on. She said: "It was just silly boy banter between Anthony and Tom."After people started to leave, she heard scuffling outside and found Thompson on the ground when she got downstairs.Peter Clement, prosecuting, said that when Thompson woke up he seemed to take the drawing on his face in "good spirits". As the banter continued, Thompson was heard to say in bravado: "I can knock any one of you blokes out." Evans replied: "You couldn't knock me out."Clement said: "That set off a chain of events."The case continues.
