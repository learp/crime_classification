A man who battered his wife and daughter to death with a mallet before hanging himself left a note that said: "I hope I rot in hell", an inquest heard today.Flower salesman Hugh McFall, 48, was found hanged in his industrial lock-up on 5 February, four hours after the bodies of his wife and daughter were discovered at their home in Oswestry, Shropshire. Susan, 56, and Francesca, 18, died of head injuries, an inquest at Shrewsbury magistrates court into the three deaths was told.Detective Superintendent Niall Parker told the court that a handwritten note was found near McFall's body, which read: "My world, Frankie and Susan, just ended, I love them so much, nobody can understand. Part of me wants to stay alive just so I can keep thinking about them. The pain is too much â€¦ I hope I rot in hell."And in a 999 call he told an operator: "I've just killed my wife and daughter. I love them so much."The inquest heard that Susan McFall and her daughter were found lying side by side on a bed in the master bedroom of the bungalow covered in a "considerable amount of blood".Dr Alexander Kolar, a Home Office pathologist, told the court the women had injuries consistent with having been struck by a rubber mallet recovered from the scene.Coroner John Ellery recorded a verdict of suicide for McFall and unlawful killing for Mrs McFall and Francesca, known as Frankie.Following the deaths, detectives seized a computer from the family home. A senior forensic investigator from West Mercia police said internet searches for "HIV testing" and "sexual health clinics" had been carried out on it. The same user had also searched for escort girls, massage parlours and skin complaints.
