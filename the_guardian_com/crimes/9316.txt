Six people have been arrested in connection with an attack in which a 19-year-old woman was doused in high-strength cleaning fluid.West Midlands police said four men and two women had been detained by officers investigating the incident in Tividale, near Tipton.A police spokesman confirmed that three of those arrested were being held on suspicion of wounding, one on suspicion of conspiracy to wound, and two others on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.The victim was left with serious burns to her face and neck at about 3pm on Tuesday after answering the door at a property in MacDonald Close.West Midlands police are appealing for witnesses to the attack to contact them. Detective Inspector Jim Munro said: "We believe this was a targeted attack. It's not clear what the substance is yet but initial thoughts are that it's some kind of high-strength detergent."Police remained at the scene of the attack on Thursday and the front door and porch of the terraced house were still covered with a blue tarpaulin.Neighbours said they believed the woman who was injured did not live at the address and had been visiting a friend.Police investigators have carried out local inquiries and CCTV cameras captured images of the attacker running from the scene along with three other men.Detectives have plotted their path from MacDonald Close into Addington Way, Portland Drive and along a footpath connecting Shelbourne Close and Palmerston Drive, which leads on to Temple Way.A man in his 60s who answered the door along with the victim suffered minor burns.
