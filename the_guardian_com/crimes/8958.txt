The police complaints authority is to investigate the fatal shooting by armed officers of a man in south London yesterday.The authority, which is already examining the shooting dead of a mentally ill man in Liverpool last Thursday, will separately investigate the Metropolitan police after its marksmen killed a man in Brixton.Armed police had been hunting a suspect for 15 minutes amid reports that he was carrying a handgun near a block of flats in the Angell Town estate. Early unconfirmed reports from the scene suggested the weapon may have been a cigarette lighter in the shape of a gun.A black man, believed to be in his 30s, was shot after being confronted by police at 3.20pm. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4.30pm.The PCA confirmed later that six shots were fired but were unable to say whether any were from the suspect that police were pursuing.Last night detectives were questioning two people who, it is believed, had been threatened by the man shortly before his death. The area surrounding the scene of the shooting had been sealed off and what appeared to be a silver handgun was lying in the street.Hundreds of police in 30 vans were on standby in Brixton last night amid concern at rising tension following the shooting.Bob Broadhurst, chief superintendent of Lambeth, appealed for calm: "There were a number of young people who were angry by what had happened. I would appeal to these people to remain calm until the full facts are known."Jennifer Douglas, chairwoman of the Lambeth community and police consultative group, said there were concerns about how police responded to incidents involving black suspects. "We have been concerned about the disproportionate use of some tactics against young black suspects."The deputy assistant commissioner, Tim Godwin, said: "I don't accept that police officers act more excessively with black suspects."Brixton has been at the centre of a drugs war between rival gangs of Yardies. There have been reports that the gangs have recruited hit-men from Jamaica to settle feuds.The incident is likely to increase calls for non-fatal methods of subduing armed suspects. A spokeswoman for Inquest, a pressure group, said: "We are very concerned about yet another fatal police shooting. We feel public confidence is being undermined by these deaths."The home secretary, David Blunkett, is said to be "horrified" by the case of Andrew Kernan, a 37-year-old schizophrenic, who was shot dead by police marksmen in Liverpool last week because he was armed with a samurai sword.Mr Blunkett is reported to have asked officials to examine plans for police to use tranquilliser guns where the suspect involved does not appear to have a real gun.
