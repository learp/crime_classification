Child murderer Robert Black was sentenced to 25 years in jail on Thursday for the kidnapping and murder of a nine-year-old Northern Ireland schoolgirl in 1981.Sentencing Black at Belfast crown court Mr Justice Ronald Weatherup said the convicted murderer subjected Jennifer Cardy to "unpardonable terror" after snatching her as she cycled to a friend's house in Ballinderry, County Antrim.Black, originally from Grangemouth in Scotland, is serving multiple life sentences in Wakefield prison for the murders of three other children.He was automatically given another life sentence when he was convicted of killing Jennifer two months ago and on Thursday the minimum tariff was set at 25 years."You subjected a vulnerable child to unpardonable terror and took away her life," the judge told Black.The judge referred to victim impact statements provided by Jennifer's father and her brother Phillip: "Jennifer's brother was a six-year-old boy who lost his sister."He speaks of fear and dread, of a child's nightmare of the family being targeted again, of dreams of what Jennifer's last words were, and how she would have struggled in her final hour."Outside court Jennifer's parents, Andy and Pat Cardy, said they believed Black would spend the rest of his life behind bars.Mr Cardy said: "It has been an emotional couple of hours. It has been a long, long journey. It has been 30 years of a journey. We think that justice has been done. We don't think Robert Black will ever be out of jail again to assault little girls."Jennifer's parents heard the judge tell Black he would be at least 89 before he would be considered for release.In August 1981, Black was working as a delivery driver for a London-based poster company. His job brought him to the Lisburn area on the day Jennifer went missing.Black's own lawyer offered no plea for mercy. David Spens QC told the judge: "This is one of those rare cases in which there is no mitigation and so I propose to say nothing in that regard."In November, Black's legal team said they would be appealing against his conviction for kidnapping and murdering the County Antrim schoolgirl.Jennifer's murder was the fourth for which Black has been convicted. In 1994, he was found guilty of three unsolved child murders in the 1980s â€“ those of 11-year-old Susan Maxwell, from the Scottish Borders, five-year-old Caroline Hogg, from Edinburgh, and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds.Detectives in Devon are reviewing the evidence against Black in connection with the disappearance of Genette Tate, 13, who went missing while doing her paper round in a Devon village in August 1978.
