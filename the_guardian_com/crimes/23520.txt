Police have named a suspect wanted in connection with the murder of a married couple and their two daughters, who were found dead at their home in Northampton on Sunday.Northamptonshire police said they want to trace businessman Anxiang Du, 52. He is believed to have had business dealings with university lecturer Jifeng Deng, 46, who was murdered along with his wife Helen Chui, 47, in their detached house in Simpson Manor, Wootton. The bodies of their children Xing, 18, and Alice, 12, were also discovered upstairs by officers. Police said all four had multiple stab wounds and called the attack "not random".They were still searching for a five-door silver Vauxhall Corsa with registration plate BG60 PMO that was believed to have been at the family's address on Friday 29 April and had been hired by one of the dead family members."The car was hired to one of the deceased, but is not at the address and its whereabouts are currently unknown," police said.They warned members of the public not to approach the car or any driver.More than 30 detectives were working on the investigation. A spokesman for the Northamptonshire force said: "The motive behind the deaths does not appear to be due to burglary or robbery."Neighbours became concerned after the family, who are understood to have lived at the house for five years, had not been seen for several days and the curtains were closed.On Monday police were conducting house-to-house inquiries and said they were "liaising with residents and local people to offer reassurance and advice over any safety concerns". However, the senior investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Glyn Timmins, said in a press conference he did not believe there was a wider risk to the public.Ding, a senior lecturer in environmental science at Manchester Metropolitan University, was often away for work, while his two daughters attended local schools.One neighbour, Andrew Dixon, who knew the couple as Jeff and Helen, said: "This is suburbia, not the Bronx. You don't expect to come home to your house one evening and see police swarming everywhere … Jeff was a lecturer at a university – he was quiet but a well-to-do man."Family friends also paid tribute to the couple's daughters, who were keen musicians: "They were both such bright girls. It's very sad."The police said they were also trying to trace a yellow Fiat 500 which was driven by Xing, also known as Nancy, and which is thought to have been sent for repair at an unknown garage.
