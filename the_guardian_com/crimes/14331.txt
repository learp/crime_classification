An 18-year-old man is expected to appear before a magistrates court in Crawley today charged with the murder of 15-year-old Ricky Butler, who was attacked with a martial arts weapon at his brother's Halloween fancy-dress party, police said.Richard McGarvey Martin was charged with one count of murder and one count of causing actual bodily harm.Ricky, from Roffey, Horsham, was believed to have been attacked with a nunchucks - which consist of two batons connected by a chain or rope - outside the party flat early on Saturday morning, and died later in hospital. Yesterday detectives searched the area around the flat in Gorringes Brook, Horsham, for the martial arts weapon.The attack took place outside a "pimps and whores" fancy-dress party in the West Sussex town. A second boy, aged 16, needed stitches for head injuries.Police believe there was a "verbal altercation" before the attacks, which happened shortly before 2am on Saturday. There were about 15 people in their early 20s and late teens at the party when police and the ambulance service arrived following a 999 call. It is understood that detectives have found no evidence of drugs at the party.Yesterday, police distributed letters to local residents asking them to check their gardens for the murder weapon, which may have been discarded by the attacker. A Sussex police spokeswoman said: "We believe a pair of nunchuks were used in the assault. We haven't recovered them."A spokesman for West Sussex county council said the victim attended a local school. He added: "Educational psychologists will be at that school tomorrow to talk with pupils and staff."
