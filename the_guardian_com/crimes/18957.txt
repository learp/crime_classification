Doctors yesterday declared Michael Adebowale, one of the suspects in the murder of Lee Rigby, medically fit to be interrogated by counter-terrorism detectives, as new claims surfaced about alleged security service threats against the other suspect and his family.Adebowale, 22, has been in hospital since last Wednesday, when he was shot by armed police who arrived at the scene of the attack on Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London.Counter-terrorism detectives have been waiting to question Adebowale and another man, Michael Adebolajo, 28, who were arrested at the scene. Video shows two men rushing at armed police when they arrive.Both Adebowale and Adebolajo were arrested on suspicion of murdering the soldier, but could not be questioned until their release from hospital, where they were being treated for bullet wounds.Amid other developments , fresh claims made by Adebolajo emerged, which allege that the security services had harassed and threatened his family as they tried to recruit him and knew he had been threatened with sexual assault while detained abroad.Adebolajo, who is alleged to have travelled to Kenya at some point to try and join al-Shabaab militants in neighbouring Somalia, made the claims to a friend, who was arrested last Friday after repeating the allegations to BBC Newsnight. On Tuesday it emerged that Adebolajo gave a separate account to a Muslim group, alleging MI5 had knowledge of his torture and of him being threatened with rape while held in Kenya in 2011. The claims can not be independently verified, but close family members also complained to the Muslim group in April 2012 about the approaches they received from both MI5 and MI6.The claims were made to a group called CagePrisoners, which believes the western response to terrorism has been too harsh and whom critics accuse of underplaying the terrorist threat.Arnaud Mafille from CagePrisoners said he met Adebolajo in April 2012 and could see he was in a state of mental distress: "You could feel he was under a lot of pressure," Mafille said.A note taken by a worker at the group who met Adebolajo said he had never "seen someone in such a state of paranoia".Adebolajo claimed to CagePrisoners, in notes seen by the Guardian, that he was detained in Kenya in 2011 and held in Mombasa, where he was tortured and threatened with rape. He was released after a trial and sent back to Britain where, on arrival, he was questioned for several hours by police and MI5.The domestic security service allegedly told Adebolajo they knew he had been detained in Kenya, but chose not to intervene.Adebolajo alleged to CagePrisoners and separately to the friend who spoke to Newsnight that he believed MI5 had been complicit in his torture. According to the Muslim group's notes, Adebolajo on "12/13 March, he met with one agent in central London at their request". He refused an offer to work for them and received a text, allegedly from MI5, saying: "We have no option but to proceed without you."According to Adebolajo's claims to CagePrisoners, MI5 pressured a family elder at a meeting, who was left "in a state of great distress" after they pressed him to get Adebolajo to turn informer.The notes also contain claims that a younger, close family member of Adebolajo, who was teaching in the Middle East, was "subjected to multiple forms of intimidation" and warned "he could not travel anywhere in the world except to the UK".On Tuesday it emerged that the man arrested after appearing on the BBC last Friday, to allege that Adebolajo had been harassed by the security services, had written to MPs. Ibrahim Hassan, 31, was arrested under terrorism legislation minutes after recording an interview at the BBC's headquarters. In the letter to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), Hassan writes: "I believe my arrest was ordered by the intelligence services because I made the information public."Hassan then writes of Adebolajo: "I do not make excuses on his behalf nor do I condone what he has [allegedly] done."I implore you to investigate any connection between the UK and Kenyan authorities in the mistreatment of Michael Adebolajo â€¦ I am witness to the fact that the Michael I knew ceased to exist after his treatment in Kenya." Hassan says he had known Adebolajo since childhood and both attended talks by alleged extremist groups. In his letter, Hassan says "so called radicalisation cannot alone explain the behaviour" of Adebolajo.On Tuesday the chief of MI5, Andrew Parker, handed a preliminary report on what it knew about the alleged attackers to the parliamentary body that is responsible for monitoring the intelligence agencies.Rifkind, who has already received an oral briefing from Parker, told the Guardian the report was a short written statement setting out some general points.The prevailing assumption is that the Woolwich attack was not the result of any long-term plan, and certainly did not need any advance preparation, intelligence sources made clear.The ISC will also question why MI5 later approached Adebolajo, allegedly as a potential informer.Rifkind said he was confident the ISC would get to the bottom of MI5's previous knowledge and assessment of the suspects.
