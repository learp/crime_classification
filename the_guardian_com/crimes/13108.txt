An eight-year-old girl who is alleged to have been raped by two 10-year-old playmates was "squirming" with embarrassment as she told her mother what had happened, the Old Bailey heard today.The boys, who are now aged 10 and 11 and cannot be named for legal reasons, deny raping and attempting to rape the girl in London last October.And yesterday, , as she gave evidence to the court via videolink, the girl said she had lied about the attacks because she had been "naughty" and thought her mother would not buy her sweets.But she later maintained that some touching had taken place, before the judge brought her ordeal to an end after saying she was exhausted.Today mother told the jury of six men and six women that she had been angry with her daughter after she discovered she had wandered off from near her home.After driving to a petrol station on the way to shops, she asked the girl what had happened."She was very quiet and I asked her what's been happening," said the woman."She said [the boys] have been doing sex with me."Her daughter then told her the boys had penetrated her."She told me she wanted to go home but they made her do it. They told her not to tell anyone," said the woman."I was still sitting in the car because I was absolutely stunned by what she had told me. She was very, very embarrassed. She was squirming."The mother said she drove back straightaway and confronted the boys.When she asked the younger boy what he had done to her daughter, he replied: "Nothing. It was [the other boy].The older boy then appeared and, when she asked him the same question, he told her: "I didn't touch her."Under cross-examination from Chetna Patel, counsel for the younger boy, the woman insisted her daughter was a "very good girl".She added: "She hasn't got a sweet tooth. She eats a few sweets but she likes savoury things."Patel said: "I am suggesting she likes sweets and wanted sweets that day."The mother replied: "I disagree with that."The case continues.
