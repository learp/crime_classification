A judge who died in a fireball in his garden shed shortly after he asked his wife for a divorce may have committed suicide, judges at the high court said today after ordering a fresh inquest into his death.Andrew Chubb, 58, died at his home near Chard, Somerset, in 2001, shortly after telling his wife, Jennifer, that he was leaving her for another woman.Mrs Chubb was initially arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released without charge.The new inquest comes after the judge's lover Kerry Sparrow, 37, appealed to the high court on the grounds that the first inquest was inadequate and that crucial new evidence had been found that could reveal more about the circumstances surrounding the fire.Mr Chubb, a lead prosecutor in the Rosemary West case, had been having an affair with Ms Sparrow during the week while he worked in Portsmouth and would go back to the family home near Ford Abbey in Somerset at the weekend. He had arrived home on a Friday evening about 7.30pm, changed into gardening clothes and told his wife of 34 years that he wanted a divorce.Mrs Chubb says he went into the garden, and she looked for him in the shed, where he was standing over a motorised lawnmower. She returned to the house and at about 8.50pm heard an explosion.Lawyers for Mrs Chubb, who moved to Australia after she inherited her husband's Â£1m estate, admitted at a court hearing recently that a "lingering cloud of suspicion" hung over the widow. They said she was "neutral" over whether or not a new inquest should be held.However, high court judges today appeared to clear Mrs Chubb of any involvement in her husband's death, insisting there was "not a shred of evidence" to support a verdict of unlawful killing.The Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips and Mr Justice Roderick Evans said that the possibility still remained that Mr Chubb had killed himself."It is right that we should say that nothing that has come to light lends positive support to the suggestion that Judge Chubb was unlawfully killed," the judges said. "What the fresh evidence does do is to render it more difficult to explain Judge Chubb's death as being an accident and to lend support to the possibility that he may have taken his own life."Ms Sparrow's call for a fresh inquiry was supported by Mr Chubb's brother and sister. Her solicitor, Raju Bhatt, said his client was "over the moon" with the court's decision and welcomed the chance to find out exactly what had happened.
