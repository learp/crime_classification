Ian Huntley offered his condolences to Holly Wells's father within moments of the family making a televised appeal for her safe return, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.The caretaker, who denies murdering Holly and her friend Jessica Chapman, approached Kevin Wells following a press conference held three days after the 10-year-olds vanished on August 4 last year. Earlier in the case, the court heard that Mr Huntley told villagers and police that he had seen the girls outside his home in Soham, Cambridgeshire, on the night they disappeared, but changed the time of the sighting three times. The prosecution alleges that he killed them that evening, within minutes or at most hours of encountering them. Holly's father said he was at the press conference when he became aware that someone was standing behind him, "too close for comfort", and realised it was Mr Huntley. "He said 'Kevin, I'm so sorry. I didn't realise it was your daughter'," Mr Wells told officers in a statement read to the court. Mr Wells added: "I saw nothing wrong. I genuinely felt he was being sincere in offering his condolences." The case continues.  Full story, page 9
