The choral works of Bach are, on the whole, designed to encourage rather than deter people from visiting church. But a vicar is planning to deal with rowdy teenagers by forcing them to listen to classical music.The young men and women who gather to drink on the steps of St James church in Denton Holme, Carlisle, may soon find that their shouts are drowned out by the works of Bach and Handel.The Reverend John Libby said that the classical assault on teenagers' ears was being considered after a series of incidents in which church property was vandalised and a warden was intimidated."We're considering an offer to put up CCTV cameras; also the idea of playing classical music, which has been used in various other situations, to stop these people congregating," Mr Libby added. "Apparently Bach and Handel can be effective."Groups of youths gather at the church at the weekend, mostly to drink and smoke. Jeff Carson, a church warden, said a disabled handrail had been vandalised, and on Saturday a teenage girl was found drunk and unconscious. When the police arrived they were pelted with stones and bottles, Mr Carson said."They generally sit outside the church, smoking and drinking," he added. "They are very intimidating to me."The ecclesiastical move follows the more commercial action of the Co-op, which has been playing classical music to successfully deter youths at its "problem stores" for a year.Concerns about the problems at the church were raised at a meeting in the local community centre. One person who attended, Lynn Bainbridge, said: "St James church seems to be victimised. These kids can be very intimidating."
