The Serious Fraud Office was last night considering a criminal investigation into ITV's abuse of premium phone lines as pressure mounted on chairman Michael Grade to take action against the senior executives implicated.Meanwhile, MPs lined up to condemn the cases which the broadcaster confessed to this week, one labelling them "clearly fraud" and calling on the regulator, Ofcom, to further review the implementation of its licensing code.The regulator confirmed it was launching an investigation into the cases revealed by a report from the consultancy Deloitte into the misuse over years of premium phone lines on some of ITV's biggest shows. It showed that £7.8m was wasted by callers to shows including Saturday Night Takeaway, The X Factor, Soapstar Superstar and Gameshow Marathon. Mr Grade admitted they amounted to a "serious cultural failure" and called them "shocking".On the day he should have been looking forward to a ratings bonanza with tonight's Rugby World Cup final and the start of the live segment of The X Factor, which will return without SMS and red-button voting, Mr Grade appeared to be losing the PR battle.Work and pensions secretary Peter Hain described ITV's behaviour as "almost daylight robbery".Ant and DecTwo of the most shocking cases, amounting to £6.5m in worthless calls, involved shows hosted and executive-produced by Ant and Dec, the network's Saturday night golden boys. Ant McPartlin said they had "no idea" and were "extremely disappointed" that producers were disregarding millions of calls because entrants lived in the wrong area, would not look good on screen or did not "sound lively".But John Whittingdale, the Tory MP who chairs the culture, media and sport select committee, said: "It's quite obviously fraud. Whether that's better dealt with by Ofcom or the police is for them to judge."Mr Grade said yesterday he would have resigned if he had been in charge when the offences took place but still planned to stand behind the senior executives in charge of production and ITV's consumer business at the time.Mr Whittingdale, whose committee will question culture secretary James Purnell on the subject of trust in broadcasting this week, said of Mr Grade: "He will find it difficult to defend the fact that no one has gone, particularly in contrast with other broadcasters where there have been high-level resignations. It betrays such contempt for the viewers - we'll take the suckers' money and it doesn't matter."In the first indication that criminal charges could follow, the SFO said it been in touch with Ofcom over the earlier case of GMTV, the breakfast-time broadcaster that admitted taking up to £35m from viewers over four years for competitions they had no chance of winning.Following a series of complaints from members of the public, the SFO said: "We have told Ofcom that if there is anything significant that we might have a remit over in terms of serious or complex criminal fraud, they should pass it to us."An Ofcom spokeswoman confirmed that it would pass on its findings to the SFO.In a move that appeared to break a procedural impasse between Ofcom, the SFO and the police over who was responsible for initiating a criminal investigation, the government body responsible for cases of serious fraud worth more than £1m said it would "await the outcome" of Ofcom's investigation into the Deloitte cases.While Mr Grade admitted that the misdemeanours were "horrible", he said he had been advised by ITV's lawyers, Eversheds, that there was "no case of criminality".Ofcom has the power to fine ITV up to £70m, equivalent to 5% of its qualifying revenue for the year. ITV insiders hope its action in immediately suspending phone-ins, launching an inquiry and coming clean about the results will act as mitigation.It has also offered to refund money to viewers and donate any difference to charity in a package of measures which, including its contribution to GMTV's remedies, will add up to £18m.GMTV, which is 75% owned by ITV, was fined £2m by Ofcom and accused of "gross negligence" in failing to notice telecoms partner Opera was routinely shortlisting winners before the lines had closed despite making £49.2m in revenues from the calls.The shadow culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has also written to the media regulator, saying the recent spate of problems raised "serious questions over whether the current regulatory system is working" and asking it to tighten its broadcasting code and be more proactive.It responded that in the light of a report published in July, broadcasters would be held directly responsible for premium phone lines and be subject to third party audits. "The introduction of any pre-emptive powers in this area would be a matter for parliament," it added.Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price said Ofcom should call in the police because "it is not for ITV to be judge and jury in their own case". He added: "I think we need to have a proper investigation because it does seem to me that money was taken under false pretences."ITV said that, while Ant and Dec were listed as executive producers on all seven series of Saturday Night Takeaway, it was only the most recent that was made as a full co-production with their company Gallowgate Productions. That series, which ended last weekend, did not feature any premium phone line elements.'Complete muddle'ITV, which made the show through its own production arm, said it was the sole beneficiary of its phone line revenues.Mr Grade (pictured below) had earlier pledged there would "zero tolerance" for anyone who deceived viewers but said his mandate would not be applied retrospectively and that a "witch hunt" for a "couple of token scalps" would solve nothing. "The failings were quite complex," he said. "It has taken us until now to identify the complexity and understand what a mess it was in terms of who was taking responsibility for what. The thing was a complete muddle."Mr Grade also backtracked from his assertion that it was younger producers, who had little appreciation of the values of the industry, who were to blame. "I think I was completely wrong about that. It is clear from the incidents across the industry there is no demographic group responsible for this. It's not a generational thing, it's a cultural thing."
