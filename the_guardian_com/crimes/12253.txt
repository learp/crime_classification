A man was arrested today on suspicion of murder by detectives investigating the disappearance on Valentine's Day of Joanne Nelson, Humberside police said.Ms Nelson, 22, vanished after exchanging Valentine's Day cards with her partner, Paul Dyson, 30, at their home in Hull on Monday morning. She subsequently failed to turn up for work and has not used her mobile phone or bank account since she disappeared. Mr Dyson has said he left her in bed at their home and, when he returned from work, her car was unlocked in the drive and she had vanished, along with a ring he had just bought her. The couple had planned to marry next year. In an appeal yesterday, her mother, Jane Nelson, said: "I want to say to Joanne that, regardless of what you may think, no one is cross with you and we want you to please come home." Describing her as "loving and homely", Mrs Nelson said: "She is kind, considerate and a popular girl who is still friends with people she has known since school. She is very close to all of her family and she wouldn't do anything to upset us." Detectives yesterday appealed for anyone who had seen Ms Nelson on Sunday or Monday to come forward, after it emerged that Mr Dyson was the last person to report seeing her.The couple apparently drove to a local beauty spot for a picnic lunch on Sunday and then returned home. Speaking yesterday, Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins said: "There is nothing in her background that we have been able to find out that would suggest a convincing reason why she should choose to go missing. We are very concerned. We are hopeful for a positive outcome but as the hours and days go by that is becoming far less likely." Asked if her fiance was a suspect, Mr Higgins said yesterday that the investigation was still at a very early stage and "nothing was being ruled in or out". The officer said a computer and other items had been taken from the couple's home as part of the investigation.
