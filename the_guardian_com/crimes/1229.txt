Britain's prison system faces an unprecedented overcrowding crisis next year, according to official figures. The Home Office estimates that the UK prison population could hit 84,260 in 2007, compared with the current population of 77,141, a figure which penal reform campaigners claim is already placing the system under immense pressure.The government forecasts that Britain's 136 prisons will be able to hold only 80,700 prisoners at most in 2007, resulting in a potential shortfall of 3,500 prison places. But it is adamant that it has no current plans to build more prisons. By 2011, the Home Office estimates, the prison population could reach 90,800.A Home Office spokesman pointed out that changes in sentencing guidelines could reduce the overall prison population over the next year. 'The government is keeping the need for any further increase in capacity under review, but will ensure that places are available for those prisoners committed by the courts,' the spokesman said.Under the new guidelines, custodial sentences for offences such as rape and robbery are being reduced by an average 15 per cent. There has also been an increase in the number of people given tagging orders rather than custodial sentences.One option being considered is to build more 'pre-fabricated' prison units within existing prisons.
