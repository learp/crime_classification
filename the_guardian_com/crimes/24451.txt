The senior detective who led the cash-for-honours inquiry has defended the investigation, saying it had been a "search for the truth".Metropolitan police assistant commissioner John Yates is under sustained pressure from critics who say he wasted 16 months on a costly investigation that ruined reputations for no result.Angry Labour MPs are highlighting the fact that Scotland Yard first became involved after a Scottish National party MP complained the party may have broken a 1925 law banning the sale of honours - even though Labour's high command was already in turmoil over the allegations.Today Mr Yates accepted his inquiry had not been a "comfortable time" for those, including Lord Levy and the former prime minister Tony Blair, who came under its spotlight.But he insisted: "With allegations such as these, which were of utmost seriousness, the investigation had to be thorough and meticulous in every respect."With any investigation you go where the evidence takes you and during the course of the investigation it became necessary to consider whether there had been a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. "The investigation would have been concluded much earlier if this latter aspect had not arisen." He said he was "clearly aware" of the political sensitivities in the case, in which Mr Blair was questioned three times. "The decision to investigate was not one that was entered into lightly," he said."The police role in these matters is to gather evidence, analyse it and present a case to the [Crown Prosecution Service] in order to prove or disprove the allegations."It is a search for the truth."Mr Yates said he would report to the Metropolitan Police Authority on "both the cost and the outcome of what has been a high profile and resource intensive investigation". He said: "There can be little doubt it has been a challenging case. The proportionality and necessity of any action were matters uppermost in my mind throughout."But he stressed that despite the discomfort, the allegations were serious, adding: "It was absolutely proper therefore that, when appropriate, police used the full range of powers at their disposal to gather the available evidence or potential evidence."Tony Blair supported Scotland Yard, saying: "The police were right to carry out a thorough and complete investigation."They were put in an invidious position by the SNP complaint and had a very difficult task to perform."The Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, stressed Mr Yates and his team had his "full support and confidence"."The inquiry has been a meticulous and proportionate response to the serious allegations that were made," Sir Ian said.
