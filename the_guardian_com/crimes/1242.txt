Drastic measures to force fine evaders to pay by clamping their cars or deducting the cash from their wages and benefits were announced yesterday by Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary.Persistent defaulters will be threatened with credit blacklisting to reduce the huge backlog of unpaid fines which runs to tens of millions of pounds out of some Â£400m levied every year. Ministerial action follows a National Audit Office report which revealed incompetence and lost records of imposed fines in magistrates courts across the country. Staff shortages meant that half the people fined could escape detection and at one stage more than 100,000 warrants to obtain the money were never executed.Lord Falconer launched the expanded range of penalties at Bingley magistrates court, West Yorkshire. He said: "If people are fined, they must pay the fine - people want to see justice being done."
