Social workers responsible for looking after a severely disabled girl found hanged in her bedroom after weeks of neglect were poorly trained and overworked, a report found today.Charlotte Avenall died in her "revolting and squalid" room despite being known to social workers throughout the eight years of her life.Staff at Nottinghamshire county council knew she was locked in her bedroom at night but did not realise her parents confined her for up to 14 hours a day in the weeks before she was found on 12 September last year.The child was forced to use her chest of drawers as a toilet and had smeared excrement on the walls and ceiling of her bedroom.Senior police officers described the room at the house in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, as the filthiest they had ever seen.Charlotte's body was found in a kneeling position, supported by a cord she had tied to a window frame. A pink bunny soft toy was at the other end of the cord.Today, an Ofsted report severely criticised the care provided by social workers at Nottinghamshire county council, calling it inadequate."There is a significant shortage of frontline social work staff and the demand for the service, particularly referrals and re-referrals, has increased by 43% resulting in children not being effectively safeguarded," the report said."The level of skill, knowledge of and experience of social work staff is significantly impairing the quality of service provided and in some offices there are too many newly qualified staff carrying heavy caseloads."The report added that the number of children deemed at risk had increased from 430 to about 600 in the last year.Last month Charlotte's mother, Susan Moody, 24, and 33-year-old stepfather, Simon Moody, were each jailed for a year after admitting one count of child cruelty.During the hearing at Nottingham crown court, Judge Joan Butler QC was told that Charlotte, who had the mental age of a three-year-old, was known to social services.A social worker visited the family's house in Moor Street the month before she died but failed to make a follow-up appointment after finding nobody at home.The report found a backlog of 140 children waiting to be assessed had built up while social workers argued which cases should take priority.Many children at risk of serious harm had to wait too long to see a social worker, Ofsted found after conducting an unannounced inspection of the council's services in October last year, the month after Charlotte's death.It found "significant weaknesses" in the council's ability to protect childrenand said the quality of assessments of youngsters was mostly poor.The county council's own serious case review into Charlotte's death was also published today. It said the staff who dealt with the case had been retrained.Social workers were also reassessed to see if they met required standards, while more administrators had been employed in the children's social care department to help frontline staff.
