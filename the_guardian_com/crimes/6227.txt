An Australian graffiti gang of "six talented artists" were jailed today for their part in a vandalism spree that caused more than Â£70,000 worth of damage. The gang were known as the AMF and covered tube and overground trains throughout London with their creations using tags like "quack", "puse" and "kelts". The gang's spraying spree lasted for a six-month period between late summer and Boxing Day last year. The six were named as Scott Mulhearn, 21, Adrian Hing, 22, Luke Vassell, 23, Jack Shumack, 24, Alex Wisman, 24 and Marcus Wisman, 22, and were jailed for between eight and 16 months.
