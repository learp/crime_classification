Detectives in Manchester yesterday described an attack on a 97-year-old woman in her own home as appalling.Evelyn Jackson was taken to hospital with a broken hip and jaw and severe facial bruising after she was punched by an intruder at her flat in Longsight last Friday. He stole cash and left her lying on the floor. Mrs Jackson, who has one arm, was found by a neighbour, who called an ambulance. She is now in a stable but poorly condition in the Manchester Royal Infirmary. Detective Inspector Frank Robbie, of Greater Manchester police, said: "I went to visit Evelyn in hospital yesterday and to see her lying in bed bruised and in pain was totally appalling. I cannot understand how someone could have punched this frail and defenceless woman and then just left her lying on the floor while they stole money from her." Mrs Jackson had lived in the flat for 38 years. Her granddaughter, Diane Monks, 34, described the person responsible for the attack as "some kind of animal, someone evil or someone on drugs who doesn't know what they are doing". She said: "Throughout her life, she has always been an extremely independent and proud woman and up until five days ago she still acted that way. The person who has done this has knocked the stuffing out of her. She is now confused and her independence has been taken away." A 14-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the attack, but has since been released on police bail.
