Jeremy Clarkson must be fuming. Plans have been unveiled for a new hi-tech speed camera, which can track cars driving above the speed limit for up to six miles. They are currently used on motorways and A roads during roadworks, but the new scheme could allow local councils, police and highway authorities to install them nationwide.Detractors maintain that the cameras will not increase safety but could actually make driving more dangerous, as drivers stare at their pedometer instead of concentrating on the road, while others maintain that any new devices preventing drivers from speeding are to be welcomed.What do you think? Are those new cameras another move in the "war against motorists", or a step forward for road safety?
