The husband of Vanessa George, the nursery worker who admitted sexually assaulting children in her care, yesterday revealed that he intends to demand a face-to-face meeting with his wife.Andrew George, who knew nothing of his wife's bizarre three-way internet relationship with two other paedophiles, said he wanted to persuade her to say which children she assaulted.After George and her co-accused, Colin Blanchard and Angela Allen, admitted their crimes, the judge, Mr Justice Royce, made it clear he expected her to end the agony of dozens of families who sent children to Little Ted's nursery in Plymouth and reveal the identities of her victims.In five police interviews she has refused to do so. The faces of the children she assaulted are not shown in the scores of photographs she took and shared with the other two paedophiles.Her husband said: "My priority is for her to tell the names of her victims. But he warned that George, 39, might try to use the information "as a bargaining chip for personal gain".He said his wife of more than 20 years owed it to him and to their two teenage daughters to allow him to visit her in prison. "I can't force her to see me, but she owes me and the girls big time for all the suffering she has caused us," he said."I hope she will do the honourable thing and allow me to visit her, because I want her to know how she has devastated not only the victims' families but our lives too. But I am not counting on it â€¦ The horrors I have learned about her in the last few months have filled me with revulsion and loathing."Blanchard's business partner, who helped to bring the three abusers to justice after finding images of child abuse on Blanchard's computer, spoke out for the first time.The partner, who asked not to be named, said: "I feel proud that I have started something which has uncovered the truth for many, and potentially saved a lot of young lives from abuse."
