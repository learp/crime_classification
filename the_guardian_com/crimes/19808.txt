A Vietnamese fisherman found dead in a ditch in a country lane had been running a UK cannabis factory for a criminal gang, an inquest heard today.Kim Van Tran, 34, was found by council workers on 8 May in Five Roads, Carmarthenshire, west Wales, wrapped in plastic bags bound with tape.A phone number prefixed with the international code for Vietnam found on Tran helped police identify him, an inquest in Llanelli heard.Detective Constable Wayne Bowen said the UK immigration service had confirmed it had a first record of Tran in May 2008 in Surrey.The Metropolitan police was later to establish a link between him and a criminal gang behind a sophisticated conspiracy to supply drugs.Within days of Tran's body being dumped and discovered, Dyfed Powys police arrested five men in a car in Carmarthenshire,The breakthrough led to raids on two cannabis factories with the potential for an annual output of drugs worth more than Â£1m in the country.At one secret drugs factory in Porthyrhyd, where Tran is believed to have been the "gardener", 498 cannabis plants were discovered.At a second address at a property in Thomas Street, Llandeilo, a further 373 were found.DC Bowen told the inquest sophisticated hydroponic equipment, used to cultivate cannabis plants, was found at both addresses.Electricity supplies at both properties had been illegally tapped because the twin operations needed huge amounts of power.As a result electrical experts had to make each property safe and remove protective "booby-traps" before police teams could enter.Earlier Dc Bowen had explained how inquiries had established that Tran had originally been an offshore fisherman in Vietnam.He had a wife, 28, and young daughter and had lived at Tan Lap Hamlet, Village Ward, Aghi Quang, in An Province, Vietnam.He had been brought up a Catholic and a service for him had been held at a local crematorium on September 13.None of the arrested gang members had been willing to give evidence at the inquest about how Tran had died.Carmarthenshire coroner John Owen said tests suggested electrocution may have caused Tran's death but there was no conclusive evidence. He recorded an open verdict.
