A businessman suspected of murdering a family of four travelled to the victims' home a day after losing a bitter court battle over their shared business interests, it has emerged.Northamptonshire police said Anxiang Du, who has still not been traced, was now known to have caught a train from Birmingham to Northampton last Friday, when the family are thought to have been stabbed to death.Du, 52, was named as a suspect on Tuesday by detectives investigating the murders of the university lecturer Jifeng Ding, his wife, Helen, and their two daughters.Releasing CCTV images showing Du at both Birmingham New Street and Northampton railway stations, Detective Superintendent Glyn Timmins confirmed that the businessman felt he was owed tens of thousands of pounds by Helen Ding.Addressing a press conference, Timmins said officers had also established that Du caught a bus from Northampton to Wootton, where the Ding family lived.Explaining the links between the suspect and the victims, Timmins said the business relationship between Du and Helen Ding was being explored as the primary motive for the killings.The detective added: "Clearly there was a dispute over a considerable amount of money related to a business that ended up in the civil courts."I think there was a suit and a counter-suit and at some stage I believe that the judgment went against Du, or at least he hadn't received the money that he felt he was due."That is the motivation that we are exploring."Timmins, who confirmed that the final court activity was thought to have taken place last Thursday, said Du, who was carrying a yellow Adidas rucksack, was seen at New Street station at 11.22am on the day of the royal wedding.Further footage showed that he was in Northampton by 12.35pm and the family, whose bodies were found in separate rooms, are believed to have been killed later that afternoon.After Du caught a bus to Wootton, his movements are unknown. A Vauxhall Corsa hired by one of the victims was missing from the address, and police are examining whether it was driven away from the Northampton area.Du, who lived in Coventry and worked in Birmingham, was reported missing by his family on Friday after they discovered a suicide note at the shop where he worked.Jifeng Ding, who worked at Manchester Metropolitan University, his wife, a part-time teacher, and their daughters were found dead at their detached home in Wootton on Sunday.The Corsa has not been traced and officers say they are puzzled that it has not been seen since, or triggered cameras that record number plates on the road network.Chinese-born Du is described as being of slim build and usually wears a baseball cap.Members of the public are being advised not approach Du and anyone who spots him or the silver five-door Corsa, which has the registration BG60 PMO, is urged to call 999.
