The prime minister is once again focusing on crime, instructing the new home secretary to introduce new measures - but failures of process, such as the appalling errors in the probation service, do not exactly help to maintain public confidence in the judicial system.We know, however, that simple measures work. Crime can be reduced even more. We do not know the exact quantitative relationship between policy changes and the impact on crime, so there is no point in setting yet more numerical targets, but qualitatively, we know what works.As home secretary, Michael Howard took on the conventional wisdom in the Home Office and insisted that prison works. More people were sent to prison, and with longer sentences. New Labour continued the same policy, with the result that the prison population doubled - and over the same period, crime has fallen sharply.Steven Levitt, of Freakonomics fame, finds exactly the same phenomenon in the American evidence: sending more people to jail for longer reduces crime.It works in two ways: first, people in prison can't commit crime, and second, even more importantly, tougher sentencing deters others.That's the stick. The carrot is, in part, a prosperous economy so that jobs are easy to find. More directly, it is the minimum wage. Almost all criminals are poor young men. A higher rate for the minimum wage gives them more incentives to take a legitimate job. For all the headlines, crime really doesn't pay. Most criminals would be much better off with a steady, low paid job.So we don't need eye-catching headlines to reduce crime, just two simple policies: tougher sentencing and decent increases in the minimum wage.
