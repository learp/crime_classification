The Metropolitan police will today stage the largest reconstruction in its history, in an attempt to trace the killer of a 27-year-old US-born artist.Margaret Muller, a student at the Slade School of Fine Art, was found in a pool of blood on a path in Victoria park in Tower Hamlets, east London, on February 3 by joggers and cyclists who had heard her screams. She had been stabbed to death.Detectives are recalling all known witnesses, of whom there are more than 100, to the park in the hope some will recall further clues. The witnesses will be asked to stand in their exact positions at the time of the murder in an attempt to recreate the situation on the day Ms Muller died. It is hoped any witnesses so far not identified will be remembered by the others. Det Chief Supt Jon Shatford, co-ordinating the reconstruction, said yesterday: "This is the biggest event of its kind in the Met's history. It is designed to fit together all the pieces in the puzzle. "We have spoken to over 100 witnesses who were either in Victoria Park or close by on the morning Margaret was murdered. It is essential that we build up a precise picture of all the events leading to her brutal stabbing." In total, the reconstruction will involve more than 300 people, including the witnesses, 100 officers to help them mark their positions, and 100 support staff who will log any findings or developments, and direct the public. Posters urging witnesses to return to the park and help with the reconstruction have been put up at bus stops within a two-mile radius.
