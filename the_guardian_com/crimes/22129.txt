The government is to hand out awards worth up to £5,000 to local people who have helped tackle nuisance neighbours in their area. The Taking a Stand scheme is designed to encourage more people to act as witnesses in cases involving antisocial behaviour.One of the main difficulties in dealing with the problem is persuading people to testify against their unruly neighbours because they fear reprisals if they do so. This is one of the reasons why there have been relatively few curfews imposed against perpetrators of neighbour nuisance under the government's antisocial behaviour orders.The new scheme will reward 30 people each year with a prize of £1,000 in recognition of the "bravery it takes to stand up to yobs".A national winner will be given a prize of £5,000. The scheme is a joint initiative between the Home Office, the Co-op Group, National Neighbourhood Watch Association and Crime Concern.The first awards will be made in November.Launching the scheme, Home Office minister Hazel Blears said: "The government alone cannot do everything. We must work with the police, the courts, and most importantly, local communities themselves to beat this problem."She added: "There is already a great deal of good work being done by individuals, local agencies and community groups which is helping to rid antisocial behaviour from our streets."These people are an inspiration to others, they are prepared to make a difference to their communities and special recognition."The initiative was launched in Dean Street in Oldham where a group of local women acted in witnesses in a series of Asbo cases.
