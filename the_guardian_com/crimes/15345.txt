How should Jersey address the crisis that is unfolding around the police investigation into allegations of child abuse on the island?Last weekend, the Jersey Care Leavers' Association invited me, Fay Maxted of the Survivors Trust and Valerie Sinason of the Centre for Dissociative Studies to meet its members and to address a public meeting on the issue. The meeting was attended by care leavers and survivors, lawyers, police, social workers, psychologists, trade unionists and politicians.Care leavers spoke highly of the inquiry team, the police willingness to listen to survivors' accounts, and the high level of forensic investigation. They took us to see the former care home at Haut de la Garenne, where police revealed yesterday that the remains of five children had been found. We heard first-hand accounts of care leavers' traumatic childhoods. Some spoke in whispers, exploring carefully whether we could bear to listen.As a group, the care leavers have a great deal to say, but it is clear to us that they need assistance in accessing trusted sources of support and therapeutic services. This could be far from straightforward, however. The island is a small place. It is possible that professionals in the statutory services may have at some time held responsibility for one or more of the child victims. The care leavers made it clear at the meeting that some professionals are not trusted. There is a need for independent funding to enable them to choose services and access help in addressing their trauma and pain. Denied a caring home as children, they now need a base. We asked senator Jim Perchard, assistant minister for health and social services in Jersey, to provide them with a house to be a place of comfort and centre for their activities. As one care leaver said to us: "Warm words mean nothing."The UK experience of investigating serious crime against children in the context of institutional abuse is well documented in policy and procedure, and there are definite links with the UK in this investigation. We heard accounts of "holiday" exchanges of children between UK children's homes and Haut de la Garenne, and it is known that UK children were placed there. It is imperative that a joint police and social work investigation is set up in the UK to identify which children were sent, and to trace them as adults. Questions need answers. Which residential staff took the children to Jersey? Who approved the financing of these trips? How were children selected for these holidays? Which authorities placed children in Jersey children's homes? And how did they monitor the care of the children? Individual children's records may or may not exist, but there will be financial sources of crucial information. It is not so long ago, and there will be staff in the authorities who remember aspects of these events. Nothing must stand in the way of the police investigation. It has a long way to go, and we heard only fragments of evidence from the care leavers' accounts. We had difficulty understanding the reasons why some had been placed in care in the first place, as well as comprehending the punitive professional responses they reported after their first disclosures of crimes committed against them. Many care leavers are still too traumatised to join the group or to manage to get to a meeting. A redress board must at some stage listen to each and every one of them for as long as it takes and hear from those who witnessed these crimes. Haut de la Garenne had a very high staff turnover, and some may have left because of the horrors they saw. It was not, of course, the only children's home implicated. We met Jersey health and children's services representatives who assured us of their commitment to the current protection and safety of children within the care system. They need to attract new and experienced staff to the island, but this will not be easy, given the claim of Simon Bellwood, a UK social worker, that he was sacked for blowing the whistle on the practice of holding children as young as 11 in solitary confinement at another children's home on the island last year. The need for a thorough analysis of the child protection system in Jersey remains. It is time now for UK authorities to contribute to the investigative process, and for officials to reach out to the many care leavers and survivors who have not yet come forward. But first and foremost, those who are already speaking out need support.Â• The Jersey Care Leavers' Association: cla.jersey@yahoo.co.ukLiz Davies is senior lecturer in children and families social work at London Metropolitan University
