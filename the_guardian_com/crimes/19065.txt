It has ALL my Olympic photos on it and from the past two years. I am devastated to have lost such amazing memories. I would be so grateful if you're in this area of London if you can keep your ear to the ground, I know its a long shot but got to try everything. Thanks Jenny x."A spokeswoman for Jones said the laptop was taken from the boot of her Volkswagen Golf at around 9.30pm on Tuesday night while she attended a screening at the Riverside Studios.
