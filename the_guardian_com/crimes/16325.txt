Even Scrooge might have hesitated to send festive cards to debtors with rhyming warnings to pay up, or the police might come knocking over Christmas.But courts in West Mercia, Derbyshire, South Yorkshire and Humberside have sent thousands of greetings to persistent defaulters who they believe can afford to pay their fines but refuse to do so. "We want defaulters to know that next time they hear a knock on the door, it is more likely to be from enforcement officers than carol singers," said justice minister Michael Wills. Cards have jingles like: "Tis the season to be jolly/ Thoughts of Santa and of holly/ But just because its Christmas time/ Don't forget to pay your fine."West Mercia has posted more than 1,000 cards, including to 75 persistent defaulters who owe a combined Â£26,000, and also bombarded them with text messages."No one wants the festive season to be ruined, but the reality is that some offenders could spend it in custody if they ignore the seasonal reminder," said Neil Ward, chief executive of Her Majesty's Courts Service. "This strategy has proved successful in the past; we are serious about ensuring orders are complied with."
