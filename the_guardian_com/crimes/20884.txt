The three counts will be prosecuted in addition to the 13 alleged sexual offences with which Mr Harris was charged on 29 August 2013. The alleged offences relate to one existing complainant and two new complainants."These three allegations were included in the file sent to the CPS by the Metropolitan police in August of this year. However as part of the ongoing review process for all cases, it has been decided that these allegations should be formally added to the indictment as further counts."Evidence relating to these further counts has already been served on the court and the defence, so it is not necessary for Mr Harris to appear again at magistrates court."He will next appear at Southwark crown court for a plea and case management hearing on 14 January 2014."His lawyer indicated at Westminster magistrates court in September that he would plead not guilty to the initial 13 allegations.Harris has lived in the UK for 50 years.
