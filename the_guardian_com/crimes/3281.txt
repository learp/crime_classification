Two men were today arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the Cumbria train derailment in which an elderly woman died, police have said.The men, aged 60 and 64 and from near Tebay, in Cumbria, were questioned about the crash at Grayrigg on February 23, in which more than 20 people were injured.The 64-year-old man has been released on police bail pending further enquiries until 26 March. The 60-year-old is still in custody and is expected to be released later tonight.A Network Rail employee from Preston, arrested in July in connection with the incident, remains on police bail until 26 March. An inquiry into the Virgin West Coast Pendolino train incident said the immediate cause of the derailment was the condition of the points.One passenger on the train, Margaret Masson, 84, from Cardonald, Glasgow, was killed and five others were seriously injured when the London to Glasgow train derailed at around 95mph.The train driver, Iain Black, described the Pendolino as like a "violent bucking bronco" as the carriages hurtled off the track. The west coast main line London to Scotland service was closed for around a week after the accident.A report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) after the crash said one of the three stretcher bars on a set of points at the crash site was not in position, two were fractured and bolts were missing. The bars keep the moving rails the correct distance apart.The report said there was no complete stretcher bar in place between the switch rails immediately before the derailment. One of the bars was possibly fractured before the crash and one after, it added.The document also said there was evidence that the last scheduled inspection of the points, known as Lambrigg 2B, on February 18, had not taken place. It was subsequently revealed that less than a week before the crash, a track inspector had left the railway before spotting critical track failures because he wanted to finish early.Another failure occurred after loose bolts were found on the Lambrigg 2B points more than six weeks before the accident. They were replaced, but the cause of the problem was never investigated.In later weeks, trains passing over the points dislodged the bolts again, causing the stretcher bars separating two sets of track to come under pressure, the report found.
