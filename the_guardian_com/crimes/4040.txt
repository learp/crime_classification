A pensioner who slipped mercury into his estranged wife's tea in the hope of winning her back by nursing her when she fell ill has avoided jail today.William Dowling, 69, of Colne, Lancashire, put the poison in Maureen Dowling's drinks at least five times, leaving the 64-year-old with indigestion, headaches and bouts of forgetfulness.She had moved out of the marital home four years earlier but was a regular visitor, and customarily accepted a cup of tea.She was only alerted to the fact Dowling was adding mercury to her drinks during visits last year after spotting what seemed to be ball bearings in her cup, and telling her daughter, who became suspicious. Dowling had tried to explain away the mercury, telling his estranged wife it was something "coming off the kettle".The former electrician admitted administering a poison or noxious substance with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy between January and April last year. He was today given a 350-day prison sentence, suspended for two years, at Preston crown court. Judge Robert Brown also imposed an 18-month supervision order. The maximum possible sentence would have been five years in jail.The judge told Dowling, who is deaf in one ear and limps as a result of a stroke 10 years ago, that his wife of 28 years had left him because "she had become fed up of what she regarded as your controlling attitude towards her".He continued: "In judging the seriousness of the crime you committed, your â€¦ wanting her to return to your care is irrelevant."What is relevant is that you are not a medical expert and it follows from that that it was more by good luck than anything else that your wife did not suffer serious harm."Although the judge described Dowling's behaviour as not only "wicked" but also potentially fatal, he chose to suspend the sentence after acknowledging the defendant's early guilty plea, his previous good character, and the fact that he was "well respected and liked" in his community and had shown "genuine remorse".Prosecutor Mark Lamberty said that on a visit to see her estranged husband on 13 February last year Mrs Dowling was given a cup of tea as was custom in a white china beaker and mentioned that she could see something like ball bearings."She said there were four or five occasions she had noticed that in the past," said Lamberty. "She commented and he riposted: 'They must be coming off the kettle,' and in another comment said: 'They must be coming off the teabags'."When Mrs Dowling noticed the silvery substance in her tea cup the following week the defendant told her he really must clean the kettle, Lamberty said.His wife, however, mentioned what she has found in the cup to her daughter, Julie, who scrutinised the contents of the cup, but "the defendant seized the cup from her, threw the contents into the bin and appeared agitated".When police later searched Dowling's home, he was seen trying to hide the mug, which still contained mercury, in a drawer.He told officers: "I hid it because I know what would happen if you found it."Lamberty said that Mrs Dowling had suffered "devastating" effects from the poison and had lost her self-confidence.Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector David Broombridge of Lancashire police said the victim had been left "very fragile, both physically and mentally" by her ordeal."But at least she can now draw a line under this," he said. "This has been a very unusual case. Poisoning fortunately is very rare, but what this case has shown is that very little is beyond the scope of a determined mind."
