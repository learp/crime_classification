Police are investigating whether the murder of a Muslim teenager in West Yorkshire was racially motivated.Ahmed Hassan, 17, was fatally stabbed on Saturday afternoon near the entrance to Dewsbury railway station. The area was crowded with Christmas shoppers.Three teenagers, aged 17, 18 and 19, are being questioned about the murder. A 24-year-old who had earlier been held was released last night and faces no further charge.Police said a post mortem showed that Hassan, from Batley, West Yorkshire, died from a single stab wound in the back.Shahid Malik, the town's Labour MP, said police were yet to establish if the attack was racially motivated. "Police are looking at all possibilities and options," he said."I am confident we will get to the bottom of this, but at this moment in time, I cannot say whether it was racially motivated."He said the police were working through the evidence and would only tell Hassan's family why they thought he was killed "when they are in full command of all the facts".The dead teenager should have had a bright future, the MP said. "This was a complete innocent, a young man who has no history of trouble. He was a model pupil and a model citizen and he encountered people that have evil intent."Malik visited the dead boy's family in Batley on Sunday morning."They are devastated and distraught by what has happened," he said. "Their family and their faith are the things that are consoling them at the moment."Family members have no hatred for the perpetrators, they just want to pray for their loss."Malik, who is minister for international development, said the murder cast a shadow over the area, as it happened just before Christmas and Eid, the Muslim holiday which marks the end of Ramadan."Eid will never be the same again for this family," he said. "This is a time when family and community ought to be looking forward to positive things."Prayers for Hassan and his family were said at local churches. "Right across the community, there is a real sense of grief at such a tragic loss of life," said Malik.British transport police, which is assisting the murder investigation, appealed for anyone in the train station at about 2pm on Saturday to contact the incident room on 01924 431139.
