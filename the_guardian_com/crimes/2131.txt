Detectives today announced a review of the death of a man whose body was found in a swimming pool at the home of the television entertainer Michael Barrymore.Essex police described the review as "routine" but said they could interview Mr Barrymore and other people again in connection with the death of Stuart Lubbock, 31, from Harlow, in Essex, who was found dead in March 2001 after a party at the house in nearby Roydon.Police launched a lengthy investigation after Mr Lubbock's death, but no one was charged and an open verdict was recorded at the inquest. Mr Barrymore accepted a police caution for drug offences as a result of the inquiry.A spokeswoman for Essex police said: "We have begun a routine review of the inquiry and that is at a very early stage. A team of officers will look at the file and everything that has happened since. It is possible that people will be interviewed again, but no decisions have been made."In February, Mr Lubbock's family failed in an attempt to launch a private prosecution against Mr Barrymore. Relatives wanted Mr Barrymore to answer allegations of drug misuse, disorderly behaviour and assault.But a district judge blocked the move, saying the evidence offered to a private hearing at a magistrates court in Southend, Essex, was insufficient.The Lubbock family wanted to accuse Mr Barrymore of six offences - four related to the misuse of drugs, one alleging drunk and disorderly behaviour and one alleging assault.Mr Lubbock's father, Terry, also of Harlow, welcomed today's police decision, saying he would continue to "fight for justice" for his son."There were at least eight people present on the night he died and somebody knows why he died and what happened to him," he said."None of them has ever come forward to tell us, or the police, the truth, and I hope that pricks their conscience - and I doubt if they sleep well at night. That includes Mr Barrymore."All I want to know is the truth about what happened to my son and why he died, and I would urge someone to have the courage to come forward and tell the truth."This will never go away. The people who know what happened will have it on their minds forever."In a statement issued after the attempted private prosecution failed, Mr Barrymore said he too wanted to uncover the truth about what happened to Mr Lubbock.After the case left Mr Barrymore's career in tatters, his appearance in the reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother this year seemed to pave the way for a second chance at fame.The entertainer was moved to tears when fans cheered him into the Big Brother house. After he came second in the show, TV bosses were said to be looking for ways to get the former Strike it Lucky host back on to the small screen.Mr Barrymore, who has been living in New Zealand, was said to be returning to Britain to revive his career.
