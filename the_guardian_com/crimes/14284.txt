Two brothers accused of murdering schoolboy Damilola Taylor had shown "no remorse or shame" for the killing, the Old Bailey heard today.Making his closing speech in the trial, the prosecutor, Mark Dennis, told the jury that the allegation against the brothers, both aged 16, remained the same as when the trial started.He said: "They were part of a group of youths who deliberately and unlawfully waylaid Damilola."A concerted assault with a motive of robbery culminated in an act of gratuitous violence borne from cruelty and bullying."The brothers, both from south London, deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob.Ten-year-old Damilola bled to death from a wound to his thigh on the North Peckham Estate, south London, on November 27, 2000.The prosecution says he was stabbed with a broken bottle, which was twisted into the leg, but the defence says he died accidentally after falling on broken glass. Mr Dennis said the brothers had talked of their involvement in two young offender institutions, and that in their alleged admissions to cellmates had said nothing about trying to stop the assault or a weapon being wielded.He added: "What is also missing is a lack of shame for what occurred and an absence of any real remorse."Emotions, sympathy or prejudice, should not play a part in deliberations, the jury was warned by Mr Dennis.He also dismissed the evidence of defence expert Alistair Wilson - that Damilola's injury was caused accidentally.The prosecuter said if this was true Damilola would have had to fall in a "rather convoluted fashion ... with arms akimbo, flying through the air in some sort of Peter Pan fashion".The trial continues.
