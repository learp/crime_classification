Sir Alistair Graham, head of the police complaints authority, warned yesterday that unless care was taken more suspects could die in custody after swallowing condoms filled with drugs.He was commenting on a PCA report which revealed that in a survey of 43 drug-related deaths from 1997 to 2002 more than two-thirds of the victims had swallowed illicit or prescription drugs. Nearly 90% of the cases were male and 86% were white. The average age was 32, according to the research, written by Siobhan Havis, of the PCA research department and Dr David Best, the head of research. The most commonly used drug was cocaine, followed by alcohol, cannabis and diazepam. Thirty-nine of the deaths involved the use of more than one substance. One person had taken alcohol and six different drugs. The report concluded that in 17 (nearly 40%) of the cases the victim had swallowed a package of the drugs in an attempt to hide them; in 15 of those cases, the move was prompted by contact or fear of contact with police.
