We live in a quick-fix society that believes there is a ready-made, usually legal, remedy to each and every problem that we face. Why bother dealing with the structural, underlying problems that make young people drink to excess, get excluded from school or take drugs, when we can simply impose an Asbo on them?And now we have proposals for a new law banning possession of violent and abusive pornography that is accessed via the internet, as if such a law - at the click of a mouse - will end the demand that has created this electronic supply. All that this does, as with Asbos, is create a semblance that something is being done to counter a real issue, without actually tackling the social, economic and cultural circumstances that render women and children powerless and make them pornographic fodder.These structural arguments notwithstanding, there are three other issues that we should be concerned with before passing any proposed legislation.Firstly, much of yesterday's debate centred on the murder two years ago of Jane Longhurst by a friend's boyfriend, who had seemingly spent hours viewing images of women being strangled and raped. The argument here - presented as "common sense" - seems based on the idea that viewing violent images produces violent acts. However, there is now 60 years' worth of research that suggests this simply isn't the case.An offshoot of this research has more recently tried to establish a relationship between viewing child pornography and thereafter abusing children. Here the best we can do is to suggest that one in three "lookers" is a "doer", but we have yet to unravel the complex relationships between images, fantasy and action, and, crucially, which comes first.This whole issue of the relationship between looking and doing is an important one, for it goes to the heart of the supposed benefits of the proposed legislation, which implies a direct causation. Yet we know that the relationship between thinking, viewing and acting on that thinking is multifaceted and complex, and not at all as clear-cut and simple as has been presented.Look, for example, at motivation - in other words, where does the motivation to consume violent and pornographic images come from, and, crucially, is that motivation created by looking at violent and pornographic images, or does it already exist?Our own personal knowledge of this area is perhaps a guide here, for all of us at some time have encountered violent, abusive or pornographic images - for myself most recently in Michael Winterbottom's widely available film 9 Songs - but overwhelmingly we do not act on those images; indeed, we are usually repulsed by them.The small number who are not repulsed will continue to be motivated by a desire to consume these images, whether they are banned or not, and the idea of simply removing one source of the supply of those images is but a drop in the ocean in terms of a suitable response to violent pornography.This raises a second issue about the regulation of private space - what we do in our bedrooms, studies and, ultimately, in our heads. Is what we view not a matter for ourselves and our consciences, rather than a suitable case for state intervention? This might paint a needlessly frightening scenario of Big Brother's thought police, but we have to remember that, increasingly, what has previously been deemed as private has become public and a suitable venue for state action. Look, for example, at the introduction of parental responsibility orders, which suggests that there is a "right" way to bring up our children, that can be taught at evening classes. Again, look at the quick fix - an evening class, rather than support and financial aid.Finally, the reality of the law is that it is always playing "catch up". Put simply, the state has never been able to keep up with the drive and innovation of technology; when, for example, bans were introduced about downloading child pornography, most of the paedophiles I was researching had in any event moved to downloading through peer-to-peer systems and net-enabled mobile phones. In other words, the solutions to child pornography were not to find a quick fix to the supply, but to uncover, expose and overcome those structural strains in our society that fetishised young people's bodies and turned them into a sexual commodity, rather than to continue to prosecute priests, policemen, rock stars, teachers and the rest through Operation Ore.So too the solutions to violent and abusive pornography will come when we deal with those issues which create the demand for abusive and violent images of women and children rather than focusing on how this demand is supplied.Â· David Wilson is professor of criminology at the University of Central England in Birmingham, and the author of Innocence Betrayed: Paedophiles, the Media and Societydavid.wilson@uce.ac.uk
