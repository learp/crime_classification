Police are responding to more than 100 alerts every month from child internet users who are in immediate danger of sexual abuse or violence at the hands of online predators, the Guardian has learned.Specialist officers from Ceop, the Home Office-funded Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, are receiving on average four alerts every day from children who are about to meet in the real world a suspicious character they have met online or are suicidal because they have been so comprehensively groomed. Some raise the alarm when they require medical attention because they have already suffered abuse.The alerts are made through a "report abuse" button, which links directly to a team of specialist police officers trained in handling online child abuse. But the amount of suspicious activity online is likely to be far greater than the volume of complaints suggests because many popular social networking sites, including Facebook, have so far declined to feature the link.The scale of the threat to young people online emerged against a background of growing concern for the vulnerability of everyone who uses social networking and dating websites. Dozens of women came forward this week to tell police they had been in contact online with a man dubbed the "Facebook fugitive", after he became the prime suspect in the murder of a single mother he met on a dating website.George Appleton, 40, had a history of scouring the internet for women, and met Clare Wood, 36, on a dating website. After a short relationship with Appleton, Ms Wood's body was discovered partially burnt at her home in Salford and police launched a national manhunt for him. On 12 February he was discovered hanged in a disused building near his home.Online social networking grew by 35% in Europe in the last year, with 42 million people using sites regularly, a figure that is expected to more than double by 2012. Earlier this month the European commission announced new safeguards for children after MySpace said it had purged 90,000 sex offenders in the past two years.Seventeen social networking sites, including Facebook and MySpace, have agreed to ensure that users can report abuse with a single mouse click although they are not expected to provide direct access to police, a deficiency that Ceop believes leaves children vulnerable. Reports of abuse on Facebook will continue to go to the site's administrators in California rather than to police."When something goes wrong we want young people and their parents to report to the police as they would in the real world," said Jim Gamble, chief executive of Ceop. "We have seen that of the 500 or so reports we receive each month well over 60% come from people using facilities such as Instant Messenger. But there are so many other sites and services – social networking being the main – where we don't see the same quantity of reports coming in, where young customers are not given that direct access to our policing response."Ceop has a team of specialist officers in London who alert other forces and social services when urgent reports come in. One report received through the online emergency button came from a parent who had discovered their 13-year-old daughter had been taking indecent pictures of herself and sending them to a man she had met on a social networking site.In another case, a 14-year-old girl who had received instant messages from a man had arranged to meet him before she realised the danger and reported this to Ceop. Police went to the hotel where they had agreed to meet and arrested the man.A spokesman for Facebook said: "Online safety is at the core of our business and we are active members of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety and collaborate with government agencies, child safety organisations, the police, parents and teachers to educate people about making sound choices online. Our team will always investigate reports of inappropriate contact or threatening behaviour."Ceop believes online stalkers and paedophiles are beginning to use more aggressive tactics to prey on their victims to counter increased awareness of the growing threat among the online community.It has reported an increase in the number of online offenders using threats such as hacking online profiles and email accounts and using blackmail techniques in response to an increasingly empowered internet generation who are recognising and reporting online "grooming'' behaviour to the police agency.
