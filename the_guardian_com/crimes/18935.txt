The mother of Lee Rigby, murdered exactly a year ago in a terrorist attack in London, has said she is plagued by "nightmares in which I am running to try and save my son".Lyn Rigby spoke about the loss of her son, a soldier who was run over and then stabbed to death near Woolwich barracks in south London by two Islamist extremists.The attack was the first inspired by the al-Qaida ideology of violent jihad to claim a life on British soil since the 7 July bombings in 2005.Mrs Rigby told the Sun newspaper on Thursday: "No parent should ever have to bury a child, but the nature of Lee's death was so violent that I can barely sleep at night, haunted by the images of my child lying bloodied and fatally wounded on the street."If I close my eyes I see Lee covered in blood. And when I do fall asleep I have nightmares in which I am running to try and save my son."I wake up in cold sweats with my heart thumping and I feel like I am going to die."Farooq Murad, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: "What took place last May was a dishonourable act that rejected the core tenets of Islam – no cause justifies cold-blooded murder. The killers of Lee Rigby attempted to sow division among British society through a graphic representation of their crime. The Muslim community, then as now, is united in our condemnation."Murad praised the Rigby family, who have chosen a low-key and private commemoration of the anniversary: "The dignity and composure his family have displayed ever since this tragic act took place is highly commendable."Michael Adebolajo, 29, who hacked at Rigby's head, was sentenced to a whole-life term for leading the attack. The sentence means he will die in prison.His accomplice, Michael Adebowale, 22, who stabbed at the soldier's torso, was ordered to serve a minimum of 45 years in jail. Both men had been convicted unanimously by a jury in December 2013.The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said the terrorists failed to divide communities: "It is some satisfaction that those killers have now been brought to justice but it is even more important to note that they failed in their intent."They wanted to divide this city. They wanted to sow hate and recrimination among Londoners. Instead, our city has come together as never before – and shown the world what we are: a place of generosity and openness where no terrorist will ever win."
