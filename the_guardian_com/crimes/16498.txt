The former husband of Tamara Mellon, the founder of the Jimmy Choo shoe empire, was today found not guilty of hiring a detective agency to hack into her computer.During the trial, at Southwark crown court, in London, Ms Mellon said the US banking heir Matthew Mellon had hired a London-based firm to snoop on her financial transactions during their acrimonious divorce.Ms Mellon told the jury that her husband - who she said needed nannying through life - had used Active Investigation Services (AIS) to spy on her £185m business empire.However, Mr Mellon's defence team argued that the heir - thought to be worth £4.5bn - was effectively too stupid to be guilty.Defence QC Nicholas Purnell insisted that even without his woefully poor attention span, there was no way Mr Mellon could have known that AIS would break the law.He said his client had paid the company £12,000 to check whether the Jimmy Choo boss was concealing financial information during their divorce, only to be "duped and gulled" in return.During a 90-minute appearance in the witness box, Ms Mellon portrayed her former husband as loving, but a bumbling incompetent."A day doesn't go by when Matthew doesn't lose his keys, his mobile or even his wallet," she said. "For a long time I didn't want him to be alone with our daughter just because he is so absent-minded."I wanted him to be supervised even though he is fantastic with her. He is too absent-minded to be alone with her. Being married to Matthew was like having another child."She said the former cocaine addict "missed planes like other people missed buses", had never had a job, could not manage bills and bank accounts, could not cope with a comic, let alone a book.Her comments were backed by the psychologist Craig McNulty, a Crown witness, who said Mr Mellon's concentration put him in the bottom 11% of the population.However, outside the court Ms Mellon released a statement in which she insisted the pair were still "good friends".The jury was told they had only been married for four years when their relationship began to founder, and Ms Mellon said that after divorce proceedings began, her estranged husband's solicitors sought the disclosure of the financial state of her company.When they did not get what they wanted, Mr Mellon hired AIS, which mounted a hi-tech cyber assault on his first wife's London headquarters with emails apparently offering the businesswoman sympathy and help in her divorce battle.One of the so-called tempters was signed "A Friend", and claimed to offer "things on your soon to be ex-husband"."I think what he is trying to do to you is terrible, and I think you should have this information to help you out, especially with your lawyers," the email went on. "You will find the information interesting."She passed them to her IT chief because of their "sleazy" nature, and he told her they contained bugs that, if opened, would have recorded every key stroke on her keyboard.Mr Mellon, 43, who did not give evidence during the two month trial, bowed his head as the verdict was read out. He was discharged from court, along with two co-defendants who were also cleared, by Judge Paul Dodgson.Daniel Carroll, 36, of Westminster, central London, was found not guilty of an unauthorised modification conspiracy count and another concerning an interception claim.Maurice Kennedy, 58, of Barnet, north London - who also asked the company to help him during his looming divorce - was acquitted of an interception conspiracy.AIS was headed by serving police officer Jeremy Young, 38, who was on "sick leave" and former colleague Scott Gelsthorpe, 32. Between them, they bragged of decades of Scotland Yard experience.The court heard the agency regularly broke the law to get the information demanded. Specialist hackers were employed, and charges ranged from £3,000 to bug a telephone to £5,000 to hack into a computer.Discounts were available for regulars, and extra costs were incurred for details such as medical records and private banking information.Gelsthorpe, of Kettering, Northamptonshire - who had insisted he did not know anything illegal was going on - was convicted of two conspiracy counts involving the unauthorised modification charge and one of conspiring to unlawfully intercept computer material.He was cleared of two further interception allegations and one modification count.Carroll's father, David, 58, of Highgate, north London, who helped run the agency, was also found guilty. He said he did not think he was doing anything unlawful, but was found guilty of six conspiracy counts - three involving interception and the others modification.Young, from Ilford, Essex, admitted a total of 15 conspiracy charges before the trial began. The three will be sentenced in the autumn.
