Indian police are investigating claims that a triple murder last month in the central state of Andhra Pradesh was a contract killing ordered by a London-based gang lord.The lead came from arrests made in Delhi in connection with the shooting of three men on a remote highway almost a thousand miles away from the capital.Seven men, including four who specialised in contract killings, were detained in raids on Monday night, a spokesman for Delhi police said, after which “it was disclosed by the men arrested that the person who took out the contract is at present residing in London.”The spokesman said the force was investigating allegations that the gang leader had paid £100,000 for the three members of a rival gang to be killed and spent a further £50,000 on weapons and a vehicle.He added that the suspect was thought to have taken out the contract from London, or just before fleeing to London. “We are taking steps to trace him there,” he told the Guardian.Contract killings are frequently reported in the Indian media. Most are connected to organised crime but others involve individuals with scores to settle. According to some reports, a murder can be arranged for as little as £50.Jagghu Pehlwan, one of the most prolific killers in recent years, stood trial in 2011. The former wrestler from Ghaziabad, a city in the poor, rough state of Uttar Pradesh, was accused of more than 100 murders. Victims included businessmen, minor political leaders and gangsters.This most recent shooting was part of an ongoing feud between two different families in Andhra Pradesh, investigating officers said.Police officials in Vijayawada, a city close to where the triple murder took place, said the suspect had left India on in early August and had not been subsequently located.“We don’t know for certain where he is. We will be circulating his details such as passport number to the UK authorities and other possible places and ports of entry in coming days,” one said.
