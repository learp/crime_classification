The jury trying Spurs manager Harry Redknapp and former Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric on charges of tax evasion was sent home on Tuesday after almost four hours of deliberations.Earlier Judge Anthony Leonard had told the jury to ignore the "deeply emotive" subject of football as it retired to consider its verdict, and instead to focus on the evidence it had heard over the past three weeks.The judge told the eight-man, four-woman jury at Southwark crown court: "Football is an emotive subject, stirring in an individual anything from deep passion to resentment. It has become so commercial that it may be thought by some to have lost its way."But, summing up, he said: "This case is not about football but about some allegations of tax fraud."The prosecution claims payments totalling £189,000 made by Mandaric into a Monaco account belonging to Redknapp were bonuses related to the latter's employment as the club's manager.It also contends that one of the payments was related to the £3m profit the club made on the sale of England striker Peter Crouch to Aston Villa.Jurors were warned by the prosecution to "keep their eyes on the ball" when they considered their verdicts.However, Redknapp's barrister, John Kelsey-Fry QC, said on Monday that some of the crown's evidence was "repugnant to all our basic instincts of fairness".Mandaric's QC, Lord Macdonald, said the prosecution was "really flailing", with "paper-thin" explanations for the Monaco payments. "We say the evidence against him is hopelessly weak," he said.Both Redknapp, 64, of Poole, Dorset, and Mandaric, 73, of Oadby, Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public revenue when Redknapp was Portsmouth manager.The first charge of cheating the public revenue alleges that between 1 April 2002 and 28 November 2007 Mandaric paid $145,000 US dollars (£93,100) into the account.The second charge for the same offence relates to a sum of $150,000 allegedly paid between 1 May 2004 and 28 November 2007.
