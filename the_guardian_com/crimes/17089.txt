The public is to gain a direct role in the management of paedophiles and other dangerous criminals, the government announced today. Members of local communities will help child protection experts in deciding how sex offenders are managed on their release from prison.Advertisements were placed today asking for 10 people to join pilot projects in five areas of England.The scheme to involve lay people in the management of sex offenders comes in response to concerns raised by the parents of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne. But it does not amount to the "Sarah's Law" the couple wanted, which would have allowed public access to the 18,000 names on the sex offenders' register. The new scheme will see two members of the public in each police force area join their local multi-agency public protection panels (MAPPPs). Initially, five pilot projects will run in Cumbria, Durham, south Wales, Surrey and the West Midlands. The role of the panels is to assess the risks posed by released sex offenders and consult housing departments in drawing up a monitoring plan. In many cases headmasters and youth group leaders are informed that a sex offender is in their area. The lay members will not be paid or require qualifications but will have to show "an interest in community and social issues". They will be given some details of a sex offender's criminal record, the circumstances in which they are living and the risk of re-offending. But they are not expected to be told the offenders' identities or their exact addresses. Home Office minister Hilary Benn said: "There are potentially dangerous offenders in every community in England and Wales. "We all want to make our communities safe places to live in for ourselves and our loved ones. "Managing the risk posed by potentially dangerous offenders in our communities is a key part of achieving this."
