A former nurse has been found guilty of burning his first wife to death by staging a car crash and attempting to use the same tactics to murder his second wife to cash in on their life insurance.Malcolm Webster, 52, from Guildford, Surrey, was found guilty on Thursday of a meticulously planned crime spree including murder, theft, fraud and attempted bigamy after an investigation which involved detectives in Scotland, England and New Zealand. He will be sentenced on 5 July.Described by prosecutors at the high court in Glasgow as "a most cruel, practised deceiver", Webster murdered his first wife, Claire Morris, 32, just eight months after their marriage by faking a car crash on a rural road in Aberdeenshire 17 years ago.After drugging her and using petrol to start a blaze at the crash site, he tricked police investigators into believing he had run off the road as he tried to avoid a motorcyclist. He went on to claim against a £200,000 life insurance policy, which he then squandered within six months on luxury goods including a yacht and a Range Rover.Webster, who had earned the nickname "Pyro" in the scouts because of his love of fires, tried to use the same tactics five years later in Auckland, New Zealand, where he drugged and then attempted to murder his pregnant second wife, Felicity Drumm.She survived, but not before Webster had emptied their savings account, taking NZ$140,000 (£68,000) and fleeing, provoking a fresh police investigation into the crash in Aberdeenshire. If Webster had succeeded, he planned to claim £750,000 from Drumm's life insurance policies.An artful and polished liar, he then attempted to bigamously marry a third woman, Simone Banarjee, while they lived in Oban. Pretending to have leukaemia, Webster shaved off his eyebrows and hair, and lost weight, before trying to get Banarjee to take out a £500,000 life insurance policy in his name.Derek Ogg QC, for the prosecution, had told the jury that Webster would go down as one of Scotland's most notorious murderers. Edgar Prais QC for the defence, insisted his client was innocent but acknowledged he was a "thief", a "liar", a "philanderer" and a "rat bag."Police twice reopened the case but failed to find sufficient evidence to charge him despite widespread doubts about the original crash and campaigning by his victims' families for Webster to be tried.In 1994, car crash victims were not routinely tested for drugs. But in late 2007, scientific techniques allowed the police to find traces of temazepam in Morris's liver, proving she was drugged on the night of her murder. That linked her killing to the attempted murder of Drumm.In her evidence, Drumm said food made for her by Webster had often tasted bitter. She described "episodes" where she became dizzy and disorientated, unable to walk unaided.She said that after the crash in Auckland she asked him if he was trying to kill her. He replied: "You would have died happy."Evidence of her drugging could not be used in the trial because the samples were lost by a French laboratory, but it gave the police an essential link between the two crimes.Before arresting Webster, the police were forced to warn both Banarjee and Webster's next lover, Ann Hancock. In a highly unusual step, both women were sent "Osman letters", formal police warnings normally used in organised crime cases, stating they were at high risk of being murdered.Banerjee was targeted by Webster after he discovered she lived off a trust fund left to her by her father, a retired consultant surgeon.The guilty verdict followed one of the most complicated police inquiries undertaken by a Scottish force, involving more than 1,000 witness statements, a 25-strong team and police agencies in Scotland, New Zealand and London.With 50 days of prosecution evidence, it became Scotland's longest criminal trial of a single person. The jury in Glasgow took less than four hours to convict him.After the unanimous verdict, Morris's brother Peter said he wanted an apology from the police for failing to properly investigate the crash in 1994. "Those people who made errors along the way should apologise to me and my family," he said. "Some people made mistakes and I'd like the police to admit to that."Lindsey Miller, the head of the serious and organised crime division at the Crown Office, Scotland's prosecutions agency, said: "Webster was a calculating criminal who wove a web of lies and deceit around people who entered his life in good faith. He took careful steps to cover up his crimes, including using specialist medical knowledge gained through his career as a nurse.Chief Inspector Phil Chapman, who ran the "cold case" team at Grampian police which trapped Webster, said: "He basically has used his wife as a vehicle to obtain money."
