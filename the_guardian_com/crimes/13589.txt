Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell has appeared in court charged with a string of child sex crimes.Le Vell, 48, who has played garage owner Kevin Webster for 30 years, is accused of 19 serious sexual offences, including six rapes and six indecent assaults.The father-of-two made a brief appearance at Manchester magistrates court on Wednesday. Wearing a light grey suit and tie and a smart woollen overcoat, he spoke only to confirm his real name – Michael Robert Turner – his date of birth and his address in Altrincham, Greater Manchester.The court heard all 19 charges relate to one complainant, a girl who was under 16 at the time of all of the alleged offences, which took place between September 2001 and September 2010.Le Vell is accused of raping her six times between September 2001 and September 2006 in the Trafford area of Greater Manchester. He is also charged with indecently assaulting her six times between September 2002 and 2004.A further seven charges relate to "non-penetrative sexual activity with a girl under 13" between 2004 and 2010.Le Vell did not enter a plea, but his lawyer said his client planned to contest all the charges against him when the case reaches the crown court next month.The actor was released on bail and told to report for a preliminary hearing at Manchester crown court on 20 March.He was first arrested in September 2011 and questioned over alleged child sex offences, but the matter was later dropped.Earlier this month the Crown Prosecution Service said it was in the public interest to charge him with the current offences, following a review of evidence.The father of two is one of television's most famous faces after playing Webster for the past 30 years.Le Vell, originally from Manchester, began his acting career in the Oldham Theatre Workshop after taking an interest in amateur dramatics while at school.He first joined the soap in 1983 and quickly endeared himself to fans who have followed the trials and tribulations of Kevin, from his apprenticeship with the mechanic Brian Tilsley through to his stormy marriage to Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, and his fathering of two teenage girls as well as a child from his affair with Molly Dobbs.The actor split from his wife, Janette Beverley, last year.ITV has said Le Vell would not be appearing in any further episodes of the soap pending the outcome of legal proceedings. In a statement after his arrest, the actor said he was innocent of the charges and intended to "fight them vigorously".
