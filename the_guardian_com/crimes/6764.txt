Lawyers say today's judgment that released the man who jailed for attacking a burglar had nothing to do with the law of self-defence and everything to do with the unique facts of Munir Hussain's case.Despite the recent media frenzy about the rights of homeowners to protect themselves from attack, the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, stated clearly that the Hussain case had "nothing to do with the right of the householder to defend themselves or their families or their homes."This is not, and should not be seen as, a case about the level of violence which a householder may lawfully and justifiably use on a burglar."Instead, experts say, today's decision was about how harshly someone in Hussain's position should be treated for an act of violence described as totally out of character and one which the court of appeal said "can only be understood as a response to the dreadful and terrifying ordeal and the emotional anguish"."Munir Hussain accepted that he had not used reasonable force and did not appeal against that," said Paul Mendelle QC, a leading defence barrister and chair of the Criminal Bar Association. "The court of appeal relied upon his impeccable character and the fact it was a provoked unplanned attack, and the very strong psychiatric evidence in this case."The comments from Judge, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales, have provoked criticism that the court of appeal has become too conscious of the media and public response to the case, with one lawyer describing the reduction in sentence as staggering.The law on self-defence looks set to continue to be a political issue, with the Conservatives promising they would weaken the legal test to claim self-defence in English law. The shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, has described plans to change the current test of "reasonable force" required to prove self defence, to one of "acting in good faith".Prosecutors have been among those defending the the existing law. Speaking after the conviction of Hussain in December the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, said the Crown Prosecution Service frequently used discretion not to bring prosecutions where a householder had used force, on the basis that no jury would consider it unreasonable."There are many cases, some involving death, where no prosecutions are brought," Starmer said. "We would only ever bring a prosecution where we thought that the degree of force was unreasonable in such a way that the jury would realistically convict. So these are very rare cases and history tells us that the current test works very well."
