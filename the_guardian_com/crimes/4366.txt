Four people have been arrested after a robbery at the Dorchester hotel in London.Three men and a woman were arrested in connection with the smash-and-grab raid that took place at the hotel in Mayfair in the early hours of Thursday.Six people on three mopeds pulled up outside the Dorchester shortly after 2am, with three of them smashing their way through the front door and breaking into display cabinets. The venue was hit in exactly the same way on 10 June when watches and jewellery were stolen in what police called a well-planned heist.In Thursday's robbery the thieves all fled the scene within minutes. Detectives from the Met police's Flying Squad investigating the latest raid arrested three men and a woman at an address in the Kings Cross area.The four suspects in police custody are a man in his 20s, arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rob and conspiracy to handle stolen goods; and two men and a woman – in their 20s and 50s – held on suspicion of the latter offence. Police said they were investigating any potential links between the two raids.Detective Sergeant Mark Staples said: "We continue work towards establishing those responsible for carrying out not only the robbery which took place in the early hours of this morning but the robbery which took place last month."We urgently require the support of the public with providing us with any information no matter how small. There may be people who know who is responsible and I am keen for those with any information to come forward and assist us with our investigation." A spokeswoman for the Dorchester said: "The hotel security team were quick to respond and no one was hurt. The comfort and security of our guests and staff is our top priority."
