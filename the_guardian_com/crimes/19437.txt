Police have launched an investigation into the expenses claims of the Labour MP Harry Cohen who received more than £70,000 in a second home allowance for a house he rarely visited, it was reported last night.Cohen, who was severely criticised last month for a "particularly serious breach of the rules" by a Commons committee, is the fifth Labour MP to be subject to a Scotland Yard inquiry.Officers will focus their investigations on how the MP, who is standing down at the general election, wrongly claimed the second-home allowance for four years.Cohen received money for a second home when he was renting out the property designated as his main home, the standards and privileges committee said last month.Over the past few weeks, the Metropolitan police are understood to have approached Commons authorities seeking documents relating to claims made by Cohen, the Daily Telegraph reported.Today, three MPs, Elliot Morley, David Chaytor and Jim Devine, are due to appear before the courts after being charged last month with multiple offences under the Theft Act.Another MP, Eric Illsley, is also being investigated over claims he allegedly made "phantom" claims for council tax.The Commons committee last month called for the Leyton and Wanstead MP to become the first MP to lose a £65,000 retirement payoff to claw back the wrongly claimed money.Attention has focussed on a Colchester home bought by Cohen in 1998 which he told the Commons authorities was his main residence. He used his second-home allowance to fund a home in his north-east London constituency, which was in accordance with the rules.In 2003 Cohen's wife fell ill and the couple began to spend more time in the constituency home so that Cohen could look after her while still carrying out his parliamentary duties.As the Cohens were not using their Colchester house, they began to rent it out. From early 2004 until August 2008 they periodically let the house on six-month leases.But Cohen continued to tell the Commons authorities that the Colchester house was his main home, thus enabling him to use the second home allowance to claim for the home in the constituency.The parliamentary commissioner for standards, John Lyon, found that Cohen was in breach of the rule saying that an MP's main home should normally be the one where he or she spends the most nights.As an outer-London MP, Cohen could have claimed the London supplement, instead of the second-home allowance, if he had designated his constituency home as his main home.But the committee said Cohen claimed more than £70,000 between April 2004 and August 2008. If he had claimed the London supplement instead, he would only have been able to claim about £9,000.
