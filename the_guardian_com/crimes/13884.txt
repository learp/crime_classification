A cyclist who admitted "wanton or furious cycling" after causing the death of a man by crashing into him on the pavement at 25mph was spared prison yesterday.Peter Messen, 28, pedalled down a hill in Cornwall like a "bat out of hell" before hitting Gary Green, 41, as he loaded his car to go on holiday to Venice with his girlfriend. Messen mounted the kerb at Stenalees, near St Austell, on his Apollo mountain bike just as Green, a supermarket storeman, stepped on to the pavement to fetch his glasses from the house.He was knocked to the floor unconscious and died four days later on April 3 last year in the Royal Cornwall hospital from head injuries including multiple skull fractures. At Truro crown court yesterday, Messen, of Swindon, was given a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years and 300 hours' community service.He had admitted causing bodily harm by wanton or furious cycling under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in jail. Messen said he was cycling fast because he was "desperately emotional" at the time.Sentencing him, Judge Miranda Robertshaw said she had taken into account his remorse, previous good character, and early guilty plea.
