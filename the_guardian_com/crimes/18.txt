A 12-year-old girl who hanged a five-year-old boy from a tree was spared custody and given a 12-month referral order today.The girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - appeared at Dewsbury youth court after having earlier pleaded guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm on the youngster.Her victim was found wandering alone with a red ligature-type mark around his neck and bruises on his body following the attack, which happened in a wood in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in May.The girl also admitted a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice after attempting to blame the assault on other local children.Magistrates had been due to sentence her a month ago, but were told her defence team had not been able to instruct a psychiatrist to write a report on the case in time for the hearing. The case was adjourned until today.At an earlier hearing, magistrates were told the boy had been hanged from a tree with a piece of string and had escaped death by a matter of seconds.The girl eventually confessed she had been the only one present in the woods and was responsible for the attack, which happened near the Earlsheaton medical centre on May 31.
