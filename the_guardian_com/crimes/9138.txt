The conviction of Dr Harold Shipman for the murder of 15 of his patients must inevitably prompt two questions: could it happen again; could it be prevented? After a not entirely dissimilar case 50 years ago, in which Dr Bodkin Adams was suspected of killing eight or nine of his patients, the British Medical Association claimed that the risk of concealed homicide was very real. In response, the government of the day set up the customary public inquiry, which reported six years later and reached the astonishing conclusion that "secret homicide... has not been a significant danger at any time in the past 50 years". Such a conclusion effectively put the whole subject of death certification back on the shelf, and after some initial desultory attempts at reform, the report itself was left to gather dust.The present arrangements for death certification are astonishingly lax. A registered medical practitioner has no legal duty to confirm that death has occurred. Doctors must merely supply a cause of death, but only if they have attended the deceased during the last illness. They are not required to see the body of the deceased, although some 90% do so. Usually a very cursory examination is carried out, which establishes only the fact, and not necessarily the cause or mode, of death.Indeed cases are reported from time to time when doctors have not been able successfully to execute even the first of these tasks. The doctor is almost entirely dependent on the reports of others, usually the relatives, who can hardly be described as disinterested observers and whose grief usually means that the process will be completed as quickly as possible. Once a death certificate has been issued, burial may proceed. No second medical opinion is required, nor does any doctor review the certificate before it is passed on for statistical analysis. If the doctor does not feel able to complete even these meagre responsibilities, the case will be referred to the coroner, who almost always requires a post mortem to be done. The whole system depends entirely on all doctors maintaining the highest possible moral standards and respect for the current law. In fact, the government inquiry did find evidence of concealed homicide, but chose to ignore it. It appears not to have addressed the issue of a doctor being involved in the crime. One reason given for its strange conclusion was the supposed uncertainty in the perpetrator's mind about what would happen during the certification and disposal process. Doctors can of course accurately predict the whole procedure and the efficiency with which it is policed. Indeed it was the attempt by Dr Bodkin Adams 50 years ago to subvert these procedures which led to his arrest on the charges for which he was subsequently acquitted. Cases of concealed homicide have, however, been reported in the medical literature in the last 10 years. There are reportedly cases being investigated at this very moment. Since the advent of the National Health Service, the hospital post mortem rate has declined dramatically. For deep-seated cultural reasons, most relatives are opposed to the procedure and doctors rightly do not wish to add to their distress. The coroner does have power to require a post mortem, but its results are not usually transmitted back to the original doctor, despite the fact that considerable disparities have been documented between the clinical diagnosis at death and the post mortem findings.Doctor Shipman's exposure appears to have resulted from a combination of two unusual circumstances: the daughter of one of the victims happened to be a solicitor, and some of them were buried. However, nearly three-quarters of bodies in this country are now cremated. This means that any evidence of possible wrongdoing disappears up the crematorium chimney. Had all the bodies of Dr Shipman's patients followed the commonest method of disposal his crimes would, almost certainly, never have come to light. Additional safeguards were introduced by the cremation acts in recognition of this difficulty. The doctor must actually see the deceased person; another doctor must verify the findings and almost invariably also sees the body, while a third independent doctor evaluates the medical evidence, before allowing the cremation to proceed. There is increasing evidence that these procedures are becoming progressively less effective. Patently, they failed some of Dr Shipman's patients. First, the procedures are inherently dependent on the second and third doctors maintaining a high level of vigilance and even suspicion. Second, the legal framework was established 100 years ago and the documents still use the language of the period. With the phenomenal advances in medicine in the current century, we should surely expect that the nature of the questions asked would change and obsolete medical terminology be removed. Third, although the system is expensive, the forms are poorly completed. In hospital the first certificate is usually left to the most junior doctor available, while many doctors signing the second certificate appear not to examine the first document for obvious errors, despite the legal requirement for them to do so. A confirmatory certificate can be lawful if every single question is answered negatively, although most medical referees require at least three positive answers. Both the quality of the medical referees and the diligence with which they undertake their task is very variable. They are empowered by law to refuse the cremation, or require a post mortem, but very few do so. No provision has been made for meeting the financial costs of the autopsy. The age profile of medical referees is disturbing. Only 20% are under 50: more than half are over 60 and more than a third over 65. No provision is being made to recruit and train their successors. Present referees believe that their own most urgent needs are an adequate and regular training together with agreement on consistent standards. The situation revealed at Dr Shipman's trial will occur again. With the apparent weakening, particularly among younger doctors, of the medical profession's firm opposition to active euthanasia, the situation becomes more, rather than less, likely. Society has a responsibility for the safety of its citizens, particularly those most socially disadvantaged, which it is currently unable to fulfil. Demands on the home secretary are now so great that death certification is unlikely to be high on his priority list. His permanent secretary should provide him with a synopsis of this case and recommend a suitable response. Doctors have been beating on the door of the home office for nearly 20 years. They should be allowed to enter and discuss the way forward. Tony Blair seems to enjoy criticising doctors for their perceived reluctance to change. He is firmly opposed to "the forces of conservatism". Perhaps he should set an example in one of his major departments of state.
