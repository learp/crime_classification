The parents of Amanda Knox have been accused of libel after claiming she was abused by Italian police questioning her over the murder of Meredith Kercher. An Italian news agency yesterday reported that the couple have been served with a libel notice on behalf of officers in Perugia, in Umbria.Prosecutors accuse Knox, 22, and Italian Raffaele Sollecito, 25, of killing Kercher, then 21, in November 2007, after she refused to take part in a sex game. Her body was found in the cottage the girls shared. Knox, who denies the charges, claimed in court in June that police hit her twice on the head during questioning. Her parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, told the Sunday Times she had told them about her treatment by Italian officers.
