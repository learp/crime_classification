The great train robber Ronnie Biggs was today readmitted to hospital with severe pneumonia.The 79-year-old has been shuttled between his hospital cell and a guarded bed at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital since the beginning of the month. His family say his life is in danger and he has suffered fractures of the hip, pelvis and spine."It is the worst he's ever been," said his son, Michael. "The doctors have just told me to rush there."Biggs's legal adviser, Giovanni Di Stefano, has written to the justice secretary, Jack Straw, urging him to release Biggs on emergency compassionate grounds. In the letter, he said the law allowed for early release where a prisoner was terminally ill and likely to die within three months."It is submitted that for Mr Biggs to die in custody in this manner would be wholly offensive to the general population of the European Union," Di Stefano wrote.This month, Straw refused to release Biggs on the grounds of ill health, saying the great train robber was "wholly unrepentant" about his crimes. Straw rejected a parole board recommendation that Biggs should be released.Biggs's family say he has suffered three strokes and cannot eat, speak or walk, and the chances of him committing another crime are "zero".A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment.Biggs was jailed for 30 years for his part in the robbery of a Glasgow to London train in 1963. The case gripped the media and became among the best-known robberies in British history.Having held up the train in rural Buckinghamshire, the 15-strong gang released the carriage containing high-value items, mainly money being sent by registered post, using the engine to move it to a bridge where sacks of money were transferred to waiting vehicles.During the robbery, the gang beat up the train driver, Jack Mills, before escaping with an estimated £2.6m – equivalent to about £40m at current values. At their trials the following year, the gang members received some of the heaviest sentences ever handed out to robbers.Biggs, who was sentenced to 30 years, escaped from Wandsworth prison, in south-west London, in 1965, climbing a 30ft wall. He fled first to Australia and then to Spain and Brazil, where he fathered a child by a Brazilian woman, protecting himself from extradition.He returned voluntarily to Britain in 2001, impoverished and poor health after having suffered his first stroke in Brazil. His son was given British citizenship after his parents married in Belmarsh jail, in south-east London, in 2002.
