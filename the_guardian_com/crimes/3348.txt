The country's top police officer calls today for an independent watchdog to be set up with statutory powers to make builders and manufacturers responsible for fighting crime.Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, believes society must go "upstream of crime" if the service is to cope with the challenges of the 21st century. Today he tells the Police Foundation, the policing research and development charity, that designers of products such as mobile phones and television sets, as well as builders and architects, must be called to account by a crime safety executive. The publicly funded body could prosecute companies that flouted crime prevention standards and would be run on similar lines to the health and safety executive. A Scotland Yard source said: "The commissioner believes that crime prevention has to start in the concept stage, when products are being designed. A crime safety executive would make manufacturers much more responsible for goods that are prone to crime. This is just an idea at the moment. There are no firm proposals." Another speaker, Nick Ross, presenter of BBC TV's Crimewatch programme, is expected to tell the foundation that mobile phone crime has become an industry. He will call on manufacturers to make phones that are unusable if stolen.
