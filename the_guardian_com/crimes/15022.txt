The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is eager to prohibit the naming of people who are arrested.Newspaper editors counter that maintaining an arrested suspect's anonymity might lead to so-called "secret justice."They believe, as do some police officers, that it can also be beneficial to put the person's name into the public domain, even though - at the time of arrest - they have not been charged with any offence.To that end, Bob Satchwell, the executive director of the society of editors, has issued a statement following today's revelation that BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall has admitted to a string of sex offences against girls and young women.Satchwell said: "With the recent upsurge of calls for offenders to remain anonymous until convicted, it is worth noting that if Stuart Hall had not been named when he was arrested he might never have been brought to court. None of his victims knew one another. "And now one police force is refusing to name people who have been charged. There is a huge danger of secret justice replacing the rights of the public, and indeed defendants, back to Magna Carta. It is time someone put a stop to this frightening trend."
