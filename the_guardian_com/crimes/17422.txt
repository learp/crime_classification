The murderStephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed by a gang of white youths in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. They had taunted him with the word "nigger". The case received little publicity until two weeks later Nelson Mandela visited Stephen's parents in London.Police responseIt was only then that three arrests were made. By that time the suspects had been able to dispose of any forensic evidence. None of the five men widely suspected (and publicly accused) of the crime has been convicted. In July the Crown Prosecution Service dropped murder charges, saying there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction". A new police investigation, with covert surveillance in one of the suspects' flats, did portray the gang as racists with an obsession for stabbing black people, but there were no confessions. In 1996 a private prosecution brought by Stephen's parents also collapsed.The outcomeThe report into the investigation, conducted by Sir William Macpherson, described it as "marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers".
