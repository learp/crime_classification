A woman has gone on trial accused of murdering two people – including her husband – two months after her ex-lover was jailed for the crime.Hazel Stewart, 47, is accused of killing Trevor Buchanan, 32, and Lesley Howell, 31, who died in a fume-filled car in 1991.Her former lover Colin Howell, 51, the female victim's husband, was jailed for 21 years in December after pleading guilty to the crime.Stewart's trial was delayed so the defence could study a "lengthy statement" that her co-accused Howell, a former dentist, gave about the killings, in Castlerock, Northern Ireland, which were initially thought to have been the result of a suicide pact.Stewart arrived at Coleraine crown court on Monday flanked by her son and daughter. Her second husband, David Stewart, walked a few feet behind.After a jury was sworn in for her trial, she was granted bail. Jurors have been sent home and the trial proper is due to open on Tuesday.The case against Stewart, who denies the murders, was adjourned in December after Howell gave the new statement – understood to be 40 pages long – to police from his Maghaberry prison cell.A baptist minister will be among the key witnesses to testify, the court heard. John Hansford was a pastor in Coleraine at the time the victims died.The minister's wife, Elizabeth, will also be called to give evidence, along with other members of Coleraine Baptist Church and Howell's brother Christopher.The case was reopened in 2009 after Howell confessed to the killings. His former lover's trial is expected to last four weeks.
