Police have warned the public to look out on social networks for a missing sex offender who has a history of violence.Cleveland Police urged anyone who spots Geoffrey Mark Ball, wanted for breach of the notification requirements under the Sexual Offences Act, to ring 999 immediately.Ball, who is originally from Newport, south Wales, was seen last Saturday evening in a pub in Redcar. He has lived in the Cleveland area for two years.Detective Inspector Kath Barber from Cleveland's public protection unit said: "He has resided all over the country and has links to other areas, although our search has started in Cleveland as this is the last place he was seen."Mr Ball has got previous convictions for violence, which is why we would advise members of the public if they see him, not to approach him â€¦"He also has previous convictions for fraud, deception and sexual assault."Ball was recently released from prison after serving five weeks for breaching his notification requirement. He has now failed to notify police of his whereabouts.Det Insp Barber added: "I would particularly urge people to be vigilant around social media sites as he uses them to make contact with people he doesn't know."We are concerned because our officers take a proactive approach to managing offenders in the community and it is rare that we do not know where they are."
