An MI6 worker has been given a 12-month jail sentence after attempting to sell intelligence to the Netherlands.Daniel Houghton, 25, offered sensitive information to Dutch agents for Â£2m, the Old Bailey heard today.The software engineer had pleaded guilty to two offences under the Official Secrets Act at an earlier hearing, after arranging to meet the agents at a London hotel.Houghton had offered to hand over sensitive computer files containing information about intelligence collection and MI6 staff lists.The agents initially thought Houghton's approach was a hoax, but later tipped off their UK counterparts. Houghton was arrested after arranging a meeting at a London hotel in March this year."The effect on the SIS [Secret Intelligence Service] credibility and the morale of its officers of this kind of act of betrayal is a serious matter," said Mr Justice Bean, as he passed the sentence.The judge said he did not know whether it was true, as Houghton claimed, that he was hearing voices that told him to do it but said he was a "strange young man".Houghton was sentenced to a year in prison but will be released almost immediately as he has already served half the term while on remand.
