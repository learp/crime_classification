The Attorney General issued a warning to newspaper editors today not to prejudice any future trial with their coverage of the Joanna Yeates murder investigation and the arrest of suspect Chris Jefferies.Dominic Grieve said he was considering what action he should take to ensure that the course of justice was not impeded in newspapers – and also online, where the case has been the subject of intense commentary on Twitter."We need to avoid a situation where trials cannot take place or are prejudiced as a result of irrelevant or improper material being published, whether in print form or on the internet, in such a way that a trial becomes impossible," Grieve said.Asked whether he was preparing to issue an advisory notice to newspapers, he said: "Clearly, we are considering what I have seen in the newspapers today and we will try to take such action, and it is right to ensure that the course of justice is not in any way impeded."His comments come amid heavy media scrutiny of Jefferies, who was arrested yesterday on suspicion of murder. He has not been charged.There has also been repeated speculation about Jefferies on Twitter, prompting speculation that tweets and other online commentaries could damage potential prosecutions and lead to claims for defamation.But there were signs of a backlash today, with one person tweeting: "So far the only things Chris Jefferies has been charged with are: bad hair, reading poetry and not being married."Peter Barron, the editor of the Northern Echo, questioned whether contempt of court laws were applied more rigorously to local newspapers than they were to their national counterparts in the wake of more tabloid stories about Jefferies today.He said that in discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service he had made the "wider point to the CPS chiefs that it is increasingly difficult to know where we stand when the nationals get away with publishing more or less what they want"."Chris Jefferies might look a bit odd, but so far he hasn't been found guilty of anything," Barron posted on his blog today."So I pose the simple question: Is contempt of court a thing of the past – or is it only local editors who feel the heat?"Grieve, speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, stressed that there was "freedom of the press", but said newspapers have to comply with the Contempt of Court Act to avoid prejudicing possible future trials."I don't want to comment on the precise coverage today, but I think it's important to understand that the contempt of court rules are there to protect the rule of law and the fair trial process and they require newspapers, and indeed anyone who is covering material, to do that in a way that doesn't prejudice the possibility of a fair trial taking place at a later date," he said.The Attorney General – the government's top law officer – added that newspapers were "pretty familiar" with the contempt of court rules."In those circumstances I would simply ask them to reflect carefully on how they provide proper coverage on a matter of public importance while at the same time, mindful of how our legal system works, they can also ensure that a trial process – if one were ever to happen – would not be prejudiced by material being published that may be irrelevant to any case that comes before the court but could be seriously prejudicial to an individual who is standing trial."That is the key issue that needs to be considered."
