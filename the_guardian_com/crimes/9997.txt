A four-and-a-half-year jail sentence handed to a man who killed a man with Asperger's syndrome with a single punch in an unprovoked attack has been referred to the court of appeal for review.Andrew Young, 40, died after being struck by Lewis Gill, 20, in Bournemouth, on 6 November last year, in an assault caught on CCTV.Gill later pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced at Salisbury crown court by Judge Keith Cutler.A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said the sentence would be referred to three appeal judges, who will decide whether or not the sentence is unduly lenient.She said: "Having carefully reviewed this case, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve QC MP, has decided to refer the sentence of Lewis Gill to the court of appeal for review."CCTV images of the assault showed Young challenging a cyclist who was riding his bike on the pavement. After a minute of discussion between the pair, Gill – an acquaintance of the cyclist – arrives at the scene.The cyclist rides off and Gill appears to turn to follow him – but suddenly lunges towards Young and launches a punch at his head.Young immediately falls on to the ground, where he lies motionless. Gill, of Sutton in south London, glances back at him before walking away.The incident happened outside a Tesco Metro store in Charminster Road, Bournemouth. Young suffered a serious head injury and later died in Southampton hospital.The case is expected to be listed at the court of appeal within the next five to seven weeks.
