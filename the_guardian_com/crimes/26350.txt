The ex-wife of the accused in the "night stalker" case, Delroy Grant, has said she was left speechless by his "ridiculous" claims she framed him.Janet Watson, 53, giving evidence in court, said Grant's allegation that she stored his semen for more than a decade after their split was "unbelievable".Responding to his defence that she used a white male accomplice to plant Grant's body fluids on burglary victims across south London, Watson told Woolwich crown court: "I was speechless, I was amazed that he could do that." Midway through her testimony, Grant shouted from the dock: "You are a liar."Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, asked Watson about her understanding of DNA evidence. "I have no idea about it to this day," she added.Watson, wearing a black and white dress and glasses, said Grant had initially been a "prince charming" to her but their relationship turned "well sour" soon after they were married in the late 1970s.Watson described how Grant had initially been "really nice, fantastic â€“ a real charmer" on their first encounter outside a pub when they were both 18. They met after Grant had started talking to her baby daughter. "He was very softly spoken and really nice," she said.The relationship progressed quickly, with Grant moving in to her home and proposing. "I was very happy ... I had found my prince charming so that made it even better."They were married the same year and she fell pregnant with the first of two sons she had with Grant. But within weeks of the wedding the relationship deteriorated, Watson said. "He made it very clear that it was not going to be a nice time staying with him," she added.The trial continues.
