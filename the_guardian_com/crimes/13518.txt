A maintenance worker has been jailed for four years for the manslaughter of a two-year-old girl who fell to her death from an apartment building.Robert Warner, 45, removed a glass panel from a fourth-floor barrier at the North Bank flats in central Sheffield, leaving a gap through which Ryaheen Banimuslem plunged on 27 June 2012.Warner denied a single charge of manslaughter by gross negligence but was found guilty by a jury on its fourth day of deliberations.The jury at Sheffield crown court heard how Ryaheen strayed along a walkway to the gap in the barrier while she was playing with her brother in a garden area on the fourth floor. Prosecutors said Warner had removed a glass panel to replace another in a different part of the barrier.Ryaheen's mother, Ola al-Fatle, sobbed in the witness box as she recalled the moment she realised what had happened. She said other residents of the flats called her over and she saw that her daughter had fallen.Mark Auty, of the CPS, said: "This terrible incident was caused by Robert Warner removing a glass panel from a fourth-floor walkway of a residential apartment block. In order to replace a damaged panel in the garden area of the apartments, he deliberately removed a panel from a less obvious place, leaving an unprotected gap through which two-year-old Ryaheen Banimuslem tragically fell to her death."Robert Warner took no steps to prevent access to the gap in the panels and did nothing to warn others of the danger. Although he did not intend to cause the death of a child, today's verdict has found that it is because of his gross negligence, and the obvious dangers he created, that Ryaheen is no longer with us."
