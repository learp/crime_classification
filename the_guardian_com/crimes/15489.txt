A teenager who was arrested on a London street carrying a knife and hammer in his bag and said he was en route to behead a soldier has been jailed for 22 years.Brusthom Ziamani, 19, said he had been inspired by the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, calling one of Rigby’s killers “a legend”.When police stopped Ziamani on an east London street in August last year he was seemingly on his way to carry out such an attack. Officers found a 12in knife and a hammer in his rucksack.Passing sentence, the judge, Timothy Pontius, told Ziamani that his attack was foiled by “sheer good fortune” and he was convinced the teenager would have carried it out if he could.He had been “adopted and totally absorbed by a twisted interpretation of the holy Qur’an”, the judge told him.Ziamani, from Camberwell in south London, dressed in a black shirt and dark trousers and looking down repeatedly, gave no reaction as the sentence was passed. He will be eligible for release after just under 15 years, when he will be 34.The court heard he had previously researched the location of army cadet bases in his home area. His trial heard how before the arrest Ziamani showed the weapons to an ex-girlfriend and said he planned to kill soldiers, telling her he thought Michael Adebolajo, one of the men who murdered Rigby, was “a legend”Ziamani, born to Congolese parents, had abandoned their Jehovah’s Witness faith for Islam less than a year before, and was radicalised by members of the banned radical organisation al-Muhajiroun, the trial at the Old Bailey heard.He was convicted last month of preparing an act of terrorism on or before 20 August last year.  Fusilier Lee Rigby was murdered in May 2013 by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.

He was arrested for this and bailed.After being asked to leave home by his parents, Ziamani linked up with militant members of al-Muhajiroun, who gave him clothes and a place to stay. He attended their talks and joined their demonstrations.Ziamani’s Facebook posts charted rapid descent into extremism. He posted comments saying that he was “willing to die in the cause of Allah” and “Sharia law on its way on our streets. We will implement it, it’s part of our religion”.Ahead of the sentence Annabel Darlow QC, prosecuting, said there were a number of aggravating factors to the case, notably Ziamani’s “settled plan” to decapitate a member of the armed forces or official and display the head, and that at the time of his arrest he had “both the capability and intent to cause death or serious injury”.But defending the teenager, barrister Naeem Mian said Ziamani had experienced “classic grooming tactics” from al-Muhajiroun, who took in a homeless, destitute and unsophisticated young man, 18 at the time, and radicalised him.The fact the group’s members “were able to groom and radicalise a young man in such a short time” indicated his vulnerability, Mian said.Ziamani was now reconciled with his mother, who had visited him in prison, Main said, but faced very dim prospects: “His foolish, naive acts have resulted in him throwing his life away at this tender age. He has nothing to look forwards to now.”No family were in court to see the sentencing.During his trial Ziamani insisted he had merely been “ranting and raging about the situation in Muslim countries”, and that his Facebook posts were intended to please al-Muhajiroun as they had given him a place to stay.While on bail following his first arrest, officials from the Home Office-led Prevent counter-extremism programme tried to arrange meetings with Ziamani three times, but he refused.
