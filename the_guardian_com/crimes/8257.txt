The teenage leader of a gang of youths which caused havoc and misery in Leeds has been handed a 10-year anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) banning him from the city centre.The ban on 19-year-old Emmanuel Emerson Manners, the ringleader of a 66-strong gang of youths, was imposed by magistrates yesterday.In September 2003, the gang members were served with interim Asbos as part of Operation Cape, mounted jointly by Leeds city council and West Yorkshire police.It was alleged they were targeted by the authorities in a crackdown on drug dealing in the Little London area of the city, which led to the largest number of Asbos simultaneously issued in the UK. Yesterday, Manners, who now lives in Rusholme, Manchester, admitted 30 separate acts of anti-social behaviour, out of a total of 34, at Leeds magistrates' court. These included using two-way radios to warn street dealers of police presence; threatening, menacing and harassing behaviour towards other residents and police officers who entered Little London. Leeds city council executive member for community safety, councillor Richard Lewis, welcomed the 10-year ban from the city's streets - a record for Leeds. He said: "This is an extremely significant outcome. The aim of Operation Cape was to target Asbos towards people who committed a range of anti-social behaviour, from those that were deeply involved in such activities, to others who were less so but ultimately played a part in ruining the lives of the local community. "It is clear that Emmanuel Manners was more than just a bit player in anti-social activities across Little London and this has been supported by the magistrates' court's decision to impose the 10-year order. "At the age of 19, things might have got far worse if we had not intervened when we did." Under the order, Manners was banned from being present when controlled drugs or substances are sold and possessing or using a "two-way" radio, walkie-talkie, open band radio or radio scanner.
