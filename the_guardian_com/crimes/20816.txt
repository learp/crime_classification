A Muslim community leader who claimed last week to have been abducted from his own home by racists as part of a British National party hate campaign, has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.Noor Ramjanally had told the Guardian that he was taken from his flat in Loughton, Essex, by two white men at knifepoint. He said he had been bundled into a car boot and driven to Epping Forest where the men threatened him unless he stopped holding weekly Muslim prayer sessions at a community centre. The prayer sessions had been the target of a leafleting campaign by the far right BNP.Ramjanally blamed the extremist party for inspiring a terror campaign against him, including his claim of abduction which he alleged had happened on Monday 24 August in broad daylight. Today police arrested Ramjanally, 36, after consulting the Crown Prosecution Service.Detectives are continuing to investigate allegations that he suffered a firebomb attack and received hate mail in July. Last night Ramjanally was being questioned at a police station in Harlow.Last week he said that after being snatched he had been driven for 10 minutes to the forest, walked around and threatened. "They said 'We don't want your Islamic group in Loughton.' I was scared, I feared for my life. I was in a forest, a knife was held against me, how would you feel? They said, 'If you don't stop, we'll come back.' "The attackers then left Ramjanally alone in the woods, he claimed.Last week, police said they were investigating the incident and two earlier ones at Ramjanally's home. "Police are treating the incidents as 'hate crime' and a possible motivation would appear to be a link to the use of the Murray hall, Loughton, by the Muslim community for Friday prayers," a spokesman said.
