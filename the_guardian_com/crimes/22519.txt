Kevin Lane was jailed for life for the 1994 murder of Robert Magill, and given a tariff of eighteen years. As his daily updated website indicates, he has now completed that tariff plus 46 days. However, he has not yet been released because he continues to protest his innocence.Now Lane has just been told that his case has been "referred to the full court" which means that three judges will finally consider his application for leave to appeal and could, if they find in his favour, move straight to a full appeal hearing, according to his lawyer, Maslen Merchant. There are still public interest immunity issues to be resolved concerning the disclosure of documents relevant to the case before this can go ahead.Magill was shot dead by a hitman in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, as he was walking his dog. Two men fled the scene in a BMW car. Lane and another man, Roger Vincent, eventually stood trial. Vincent was cleared but Lane was convicted and jailed. He has been protesting his innocence ever since. Central to his appeal is the conduct of former Detective Inspector Christopher Spackman, who was a key officer in the case and who was subsequently convicted in 2003 at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to steal £160,000 from the police and misconduct in a public office.In 2011, the court of appeal ordered the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to investigate aspects of the case and report back to them. "What cannot be gainsaid is that Mr Spackman … interfered in the criminal justice system," Lane's barrister, Joel Bannathan QC, told the hearing. According to the CCRC, a response was given to the court last October.Lane is currently in HMP Wolds in Yorkshire and is hopeful that his case will finally be resolved before another year ticks by on his website.
