A picture of confusion, delays and a lack of communication as injured commuters evacuated the smoke-filled tunnel at King's Cross station emerged at the inquest into the 52 victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings today.Faiz Patel, a London Underground customer services assistant, was one of the first to descend to the Piccadilly line platform following the explosion, which happened between Russell Square and King's Cross. He told the inquest of his frustration at the delays in summoning help.He said that, as shocked passengers emerged from the tunnel covered in soot, one of them "quite angrily" said there had been fatalities on the train. "That was the first that anyone had heard of it," he added.Patel told the inquest, at the royal courts of justice in London, that a station supervisor who was new to the job and was with him on the platform had seemed flustered and "reluctant" to take action, so he had taken the initiative to radio the message to the control room.Asked what he did when he was told by the 20th or 25th passenger to emerge from the tunnel that there had been fatalities, he said: "I relayed that information to my supervisor, who was there, and to a colleague."From their reaction ... I don't know, there didn't seem to be any urgency about passing that information on to the control room, so I just relayed it myself."Shortly afterwards, he walked down the tunnel towards the train and noticed a body on the tracks."It seemed like he was a black male, dreadlocks, no arms, no leg – I originally thought it was a doll," he said.For the next three hours, Patel stayed at the scene, acting as a runner between the train – where London Underground radios did not work – and the platform, from where messages could be relayed.Each round trip took around 10 minutes, the inquest heard. Patel said he had not gone into the bombed carriage himself.He said that, while working in the station concourse on an upper level, he had heard reports of smoke coming from the Piccadilly line tunnel, radioed from a colleague on the platform.But while he remained at the scene until midday, it was not until he watched the television news later that he realised the incident had been caused by an explosion.Asked whether he had been told that British Transport police had declared a major incident, he said: "Up until I actually left the site, I had not received any information about any type of bombing or any type of major incident."He estimated that the fire brigade had arrived at the scene at between 9.20am and 9.25am.Earlier, the inquest heard how the bombers had gone to great lengths to stop the plot from being detected, including changing their phones regularly and buying unregistered phones.Detective Sergeant Mark Stuart said that, from May 2005, they used a total of 15 "operational" phones between them, almost exclusively to talk to each other in relation to the planned attack. He said they had engaged in "tradecraft".Asked by the coroner, Lady Justice Hallet, to define what he meant by tradecraft, Stuart said: "Taking care of your communications, buying unregistered phones, changing them regularly to avoid detection."
