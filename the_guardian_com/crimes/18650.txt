The home secretary, David Blunkett, yesterday apologised for calling the BBC's exposure of police racism "a stunt", and said that the television programme's revelations more than justified the way they came to light.His admission that he had made a mistake in criticising the undercover documentary came as the Police Complaints Authority started its investigation into the allegations.Six police officers have so far resigned after the broadcasting of the Secret Policeman, and yesterday two PCA members met senior investigators from the Greater Manchester police and received a pledge of cooperation from the BBC.Mr Blunkett originally criticised the undercover filming methods of the programme and said it was "trying to create news", without having seen the programme, after he was approached by the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which had been briefed on its contents.He admitted to the BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that he had been wrong to criticise the programme: "Let me be honest. It was a mistake on my part to call it a stunt. The revelations themselves justify, in this case, the way in which they came to light."He said it had happened because the BBC would not let the Home Office see any of the material, the video of the programme or any of the detail of the allegations before it was broadcast, despite the corporation having briefed the Mail on Sunday and the Scotsman newspapers.Mr Blunkett said the task now was "to root out racism in the force", and that meant implementing new assessments and training of recruits to weed out those who should not be in the police service.The PCA investigation follows a decision by the Greater Manchester and North Wales police to refer the BBC's allegations about the conduct of their officers. A PCA member, Anne Boustred, who is to supervise the Greater Manchester investigation said: "After our meeting with the police investigators they met with the BBC and will be arranging for officers to collect video and other material. I welcome the cooperation that the BBC has pledged to us."Her colleague, Nicola Williams, who will supervise the investigation into the officers from the North Wales police, said they shared the public concerns raised by the programme: "We are pleased to see the positive response from the Association of Chief Police Officers to learn from it. To assist them, our investigation will also seek to bring out lessons for the benefit of the police service as a whole."Senior police officers have now agreed a seven-point plan to tackle racism, with every force reviewing its own statutory race equality scheme.The BBC's undercover reporter, Mark Daly, is still due to answer bail next month, after he was arrested by Greater Manchester police and held on suspicion of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, and criminal damage caused by hiding acamera in a police vest.
