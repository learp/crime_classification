The majority of shoplifters should get community sentences, even if they have repeatedly breached them in the past, guidelines have recommended.Under proposals from the independent Sentencing Advisory Panel, even persistent offenders would not be jailed. Only aggravating factors, such as use of violence, or high value thefts, would lead to shoplifters being imprisoned. A second option allows offenders to be jailed for up to eight weeks if they were "seriously persistent".The report from the panel, a government-appointed body which recommends sentencing changes to the Sentencing Guidelines Council, recognised that the "no jail" option is a "radical departure" from present practice.Under option one, it said: "The most severe sentence for a standard offence of theft from a shop would be a high-level community order, even where an offender may have failed to comply with such an order in the past."The only factors that could allow a custodial sentence to be imposed would be the existence of identified aggravating factors that are not related to repeat offending." Factors could include use of violence, operating in gangs, professional shoplifting, using children to commit the offence, or targeting vulnerable victims.The British Retail Consortium was scathing of the proposals. Its spokesman Richard Dodd said: "We are disgusted at the suggestion that shoplifters should not face the possibility of going to jail. This sends entirely the wrong message to would-be thieves."The BRC represents 85% of retailers; its latest figures show shoplifting in the UK cost £588m in 2004. Mr Dodd said: "That works out at £1 on the weekly shopping bill for every household in the country. It is not a victimless crime."Shadow home affairs minister Edward Garnier said: "These proposals represent a significant softening of the punishment. The public expect people stealing from shops should be properly punished, particularly if they are persistent offenders."
