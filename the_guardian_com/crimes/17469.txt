The man who allegedly faked his own death in a canoeing accident appeared in court with his wife yesterday, where they faced further fraud charges totaling almost a quarter of a million pounds.John Darwin, 57, and Anne Darwin, 55, were charged jointly at Hartlepool magistrates court with obtaining money by deception, on top of similar charges they already face.It was the first time they had appeared in court since Darwin, who had been declared dead in 2003, walked into a police station on December 1 and announced: "I think I'm a missing person."He vanished after taking his canoe into the sea in Seaton Carew, Hartlepool, in March 2002. It has since been claimed that the former teacher and prison officer was living next door to his wife for much of the time he was thought to have been dead.The couple are jointly accused of defrauding a teacher's pension plan, a civil servant pension plan and the government's bereavement benefit scheme of a total of £88,314.57. In addition, John Darwin was also charged yesterday with obtaining money by deception relating to £137,515.18 from Norwich Union Life Services. He is already charged with dishonestly obtaining £25,000 and making an untrue statement to obtain a passport. His wife is already charged with dishonestly obtaining £25,000 and £137,000 by deception.The joint charges included obtaining £25,186 by deception from Capita Hartshead teacher pension scheme, obtaining £2,000 from a cash giro from the Department for Work and Pensions, and obtaining £2,273,60 from the department's bereavement scheme.The couple's sons were not in court.The pair did not make a plea and no application for bail was made.They will appear before Hartlepool magistrates again on January 18 via a video link, when the case is expected to be committed to crown court.
