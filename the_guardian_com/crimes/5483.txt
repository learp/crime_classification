A woman who threw her newborn baby down a tower block rubbish chute has been jailed for two-and-a-half years after she was found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm.Jaymin Abdulrahman was cleared of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to her six-day-old daughter. The 25-year-old had denied all the charges.The baby, whose cannot be named for legal reasons, sustained skull fractures and brain injuries after she fell more than 12 metres (40ft) into a bin store at a block of flats in Wolverhampton last September.Judge Mrs Justice Kate Thirlwall at Birmingham crown court said she accepted the incident was not premeditated and that Abdulrahman had postnatal psychosis – a severe form of depression – at the time.But sentencing Abdulrahman, the judge said: "You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life. As you said yourself, you were her mother. You should have been her guardian."Abdulrahman had initially told police that her child had been kidnapped by strangers but the baby was found a few hours later, apparently lifeless, at the bottom of the chute.Prosecutors alleged she deliberately placed her baby into the chute with the intention of killing her.But Abdulrahman, who accepted that she put the child into the chute, told the jury she had not planned the incident and had "lost control of her thoughts".Rachel Brand QC, defending, described her client as a competent and loving mother, she also argued that the postnatal psychosis meant she was incapable of "forming an intent to either kill or cause really serious injury to her baby".Speaking through a Kurdish interpreter, Abdulrahman, who came to the UK from Iraq in 2011, told the court she was in tears while cleaning her bathroom shortly before placing the baby in the chute."I was extremely sad," she told jurors. "I went to the living room, I put the baby in a rubbish bag and I threw her away."After I had done so, I just couldn't believe what I had just done, and I couldn't understand why I did it."I was in shock."Abdulrahman added that she had not plannedto do what she did and had not thought about what she was going to do."Even now as I am speaking to you, I am still in a state of disbelief of what I have done … If I thought that by doing so I would do some harm to the baby, I wouldn't have done it."The trial heard Abdulrahman placed the child in a binliner and put her in the rubbish chute six days after giving birth.The infant sustained serious brain injuries in the fall from the fifth floor of the block to the bins below.Following the verdict, Andrew Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court there was a high risk of the baby experiencing learning difficulties in the future.He said she was developing signs of a severe form of cerebral palsy and that she would be dependent on others for support for the rest of her life.Jailing Abdulrahman for 30 months, Thirlwall said: "You have expressed your remorse and I accept it is genuine. It is quite clear from the verdicts that the jury were satisfied that you were or may have been suffering from postpartum psychosis at the time you acted as you did.""Anyone who sat through the whole of the trial will understand exactly how they came to that conclusion.She added: "The evidence of the psychiatrists was that this condition occurs in one in 500 new mothers. Sometimes it is missed because, as in your case, the initial symptoms may be confused with other much less serious experiences that women undergo after giving birth."In your case there was a particular difficulty because you spoke no English and were very reserved."It was only when you were seen at length by a psychiatrist skilled in dealing with women who have just given birth that the diagnosis of post-partum psychosis was made."As the court has heard, in only a very few cases does this condition lead to tragedy as it did here. You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life."The judge told Abdulrahman she must serve half of her sentence before she can be released on licence.
