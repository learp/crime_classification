Gerry and Kate McCann are preparing themselves for a "long haul" to clear their names, after a senior Portuguese magistrate said that unless their daughter Madeleine's body was found it would be almost impossible for police to secure a conviction or for the couple to prove their innocence."Without the little girl's body everything is extremely complicated," Antonio Cluny, president of the district attorney and magistrates' syndicate in Portugal, said yesterday. "There have been cases in which it was possible to obtain a conviction without there being a victim, but there were confessions. In the Maddie case there is no confession."Mr and Mrs McCann fear that unless Madeleine is found, dead or alive, they may remain under suspicion for the rest of their lives, a source close to their legal team said yesterday. "A body never being found is the worst case scenario," said the source. "The mood on the legal side is that they are in it for the long haul."With little progress in the search for the missing four-year-old, who disappeared from the family's holiday apartment on May 3, the couple are understood to have enlisted private security contractors to assist in the search. They have been consulting Control Risks Group, among other firms, since the early days of the investigation, the Guardian understands.It is believed other security operatives may be investigating possible sightings. It emerged at the weekend that in May a second witness reported to police seeing a child who they believed to be Madeleine in Marrakesh, Morocco. A Norwegian tourist had also reported a similar sighting in the same part of the city on the same day, six days after Madeleine disappeared.
