Dissident republicans have been blamed for another gun attack in the Bogside area of Derry.Four masked men attacked a house in the Dove Gardens area around 11.30pm last night. Police said a number of shots were fired at the door of the building. Two men were inside but neither was injured.At around midnight a police patrol investigating the incident came under attack with petrol bombs and other missiles. One officer suffered a leg injury after being hit by a stone, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said.The Real IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann have been active in Derry and carried out a number of attacks over the past 18 months within their own communities against those they deem "antisocial elements".Last night's attack fits a pattern common over the past year and half, where a shooting incident occurs and investigating security forces come under attack from supporters of the dissidents.An SDLP former mayor of Derry and councillor for the Bogside condemned those behind the latest incident. Pat Ramsey, whose home has been attacked by anti-ceasefire republicans, said: "The people of the Bogside area are appalled at last night's gun and petrol bomb attack in Dove Gardens. This is an area populated by families, children and elderly people."Ramsey added: "Our communities have suffered from the obscenity and destructiveness of violence for far too long. The people are very clear in their desire to live in a normal society. As a representative of the people of this city, and speaking on their behalf, I totally condemn the attack."
