A dossier outlining the case against missing Madeleine McCann's parents should go before a judge, a Portuguese public prosecutor decided today.Police had earlier handed their files to the prosecutor, Jose Cunha de Magalhaes, for him to decide whether to bring charges against Kate and Gerry McCann over the four-year-old's disappearance four months ago from a holiday apartment in the Algarve. Luisa Duarte, a member of staff at the prosecutor's office in Portimao, said Mr Cunha de Magalhaes had received the papers and decided they should go before an instructional judge.A Portuguese lawyer, Artur Rego, said this might mean that the prosecutor wanted to carry out fresh searches or more interviews. It is also possible that he is recommending charges, although this would be unusual, Mr Rego said. The judge has 10 days to decide on the next step.The case file on the McCanns amounted to more than 1,000 pages, said Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa, the Portuguese officer in charge of the case.Neither official would give details of the police findings, citing the secrecy laws covering ongoing investigations.Last week, Mr and Mrs McCann were named by Portuguese police as formal suspects in the disappearance of their daughter from the family's holiday apartment in Praia de Luz on May 3.Part of the case is believed to centre on the results of DNA tests carried out by the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham on samples taken from the family's apartment and the car hired by the McCanns 25 days after Madeleine went missing.Unnamed Portuguese police sources said the results indicated Madeleine had been in the hire car after she was reported missing.However, Me De Sousa denied this when questioned by Portuguese journalists.Alipio Ribeiro, the national director of the investigative Policia Judiciaria, suggested the forensic tests were inconclusive."We can't say with certainty whether it was the blood of person A or person B," he told the Portuguese state broadcaster, RTP."They help guide us in our investigation but not with the mathematical precision some people are saying."Today, conflicting and speculative reports from unnamed sources about the nature of the forensic material continued to emerge, with suggestions that Madeleine's hair, blood and bodily fluids had been found by police.Portuguese journalists said they had been told by senior officers that they found "bodily fluids" - not blood - with an 88% match to Madeleine's DNA in the hire car. The sample was taken from the part of the boot where the spare tyre is kept, the sources said.Police searching the car found so much of Madeleine's hair that it could not have been transferred from a blanket or clothes and must have come directly from her body, the journalists were apparently told.Mr McCann said earlier that the distress he and his wife had faced during the past week was "beyond description". Mr McCann said they had "absolute confidence" that the facts would demonstrate they played "no part in Madeleine's abduction"."The pain and turmoil we have experienced in this last week is totally beyond description. Kate and I are totally 100% confident in each other's innocence and our family and friends have rallied round unflinchingly to support us," Mr McCann wrote on his blog, findmadeleine.com.Gordon Brown's spokesman said the prime minister did not regret the involvement - including a telephone conversation - he has had with the McCanns."He doesn't regret that he has had contacts with them but this is an ongoing police investigation and it would be unwise for me to say anything more," said the spokesman.Leicestershire police's most senior detective visited the family's home in Rothley today. Detective Chief Superintendent Bob Small spent about an hour with the family at their house before leaving in an unmarked car.The force refused comment on the visit. A spokeswoman reiterated that it was a Portuguese police investigation.In his blog, Mr McCann wrote that the couple could "never possibly have imagined being put in this unbearable situation"."Despite the anguish and extreme distress this has caused all of our family, long term no one will be able to doubt how intensely Kate and I have been scrutinised. We have absolute confidence that, when all of the facts are presented together, we will be able to demonstrate that we played absolutely no part in Madeleine's abduction."Our primary concern has always been the search for Madeleine and this aspect, that our daughter is still missing, must remain a priority for the investigation."The couple and their two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie, returned to their home in Rothley on Sunday."We have had very mixed emotions since coming back to our own home. It is very comforting to have such familiar surroundings and our own belongings and the twins have settled straight back in as if they have never been away," Mr McCann wrote. "We have had numerous visitors with friends and those in official capacities. We have appointed solicitors to advise us and assist our Portuguese lawyer in preparing our defence against any possible charges."The sooner this is done the sooner we can concentrate fully on trying to find Madeleine, which is the most important thing through this unending nightmare."
