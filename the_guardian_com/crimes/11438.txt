Judges were urged yesterday by the lord chief justice to consider going ahead with criminal trials in the absence of defendants who jump bail and fail to show up at court.Barristers briefed to prosecute by the Crown Prosecution Service are also being told to invite the judge to carry on with the trial without the defendant. Lord Woolf's guidance came in a practice direction urging tougher action on defendants who breach bail. The move follows a ruling two years ago from the House of Lords endorsing judges' discretion to go ahead with a trial without the defendant, particularly if he has deliberately absconded. The law lords upheld convictions against an absent robber even though his lawyers had withdrawn and he was unrepresented at the trial. Fourteen months later he appealed, arguing that he had been denied a fair trial. Lord Bingham, senior law lord, said in the Lords case: "The discretion to commence a trial in the absence of a defendant should be exercised with the utmost caution."
