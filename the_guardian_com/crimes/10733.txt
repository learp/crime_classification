Four teenage boys today pleaded not guilty at the Old Bailey to the murder of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor.The three 16-year-olds and one 14-year-old, who cannot be named, have also denied a charge of assault with intent to rob and one count of manslaughter.A jury will be sworn in on Tuesday and the trial is expected to last three months.Nigerian-born Damilola was attacked on his way home from a computer class in Peckham, south London on November 27, 2000.He bled to death in a stairwell after he was stabbed in the leg.As juveniles, the defendants do not have to appear in the dock and instead sit at a table with a member of their family and legal representatives.The judge, Mr Justice Hooper, and barristers are not wearing wigs for the trial and tables in the courtroom have been arranged in a semicircle around the bench.The special arrangements for the trial have been made under the Lord Chief Justice's recommendations for the trials of children and young persons.Journalists are sitting in what is normally the dock and a media annexe has also been set up in the Old Bailey with a live television link to the courtroom.
