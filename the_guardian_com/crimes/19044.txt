Merseyside police are hunting a gang of teenagers who have been burgling schools and stealing projectors so that they can beam images of video games on to their bedroom walls.In the past month, there has been a spate of 20 burglaries from various schools in Halewood, Merseyside. Each projector is worth £3,000 but the children have been selling them on for just £100. Initially police were baffled by the burglaries, but then they worked out the teenagers had been taking the projectors to use in conjunction with PlayStations and X-Boxes, so that they can project the video games on to bedroom walls. Yesterday Merseyside police officers raided six homes in Knowsley and arrested a 14-year-old boy. Inspector Shaun Holland said: "The crackdown today is just the start of a major investigation to trace this group of youths who we believe are targeting schools and committing these burglaries with the specific aim of stealing the projectors." He warned the thieves against committing further thefts, adding that the projectors were easily identifiable. Knowsley council said it had stepped up security at schools following a handful of incidents.
