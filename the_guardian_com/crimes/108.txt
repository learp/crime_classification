The government will run out of prison spaces within six years even if judges start jailing fewer criminals, official estimates revealed today.The Home Office statistics also forecast that the prison population is set to rise to more than 100,000 for the first time - a prospect one prison reformer described as "gulag Britain".But there is doubt about whether the system can cope with such an increase.Today's estimates show that if current sentencing trends continue, the Prison Service will be nearly 6,000 spaces short by November 2011, even after home secretary John Reid's commitment last week to increase prison capacity by 8,000 places.Today's projections show there will be 94,320 inmates in England and Wales by 2011, if there are no shifts in the law or sentencing guidelines.By then the total number of places available will have expanded to only 88,400.The Home Office figures revealed that the total number of inmates could be as high as 100,200, leaving ministers nearly 12,000 places short.Last week Mr Reid pledged to expand the number of places to 88,400 by 2012 as part of his plan to "rebalance" the criminal justice system in favour of victims.Today's figures mean that to avoid a shortfall, Mr Reid will either need to secure funding for yet more prisons, or plan moves to cut the growing prison population.The lowest projection published today said that changes to sentencing policy could cut the jail population to as few as 88,400 by November 2011 - exactly the amount of jail spaces pledged by Mr Reid for that point in time.In six years from now - July 2012 - the lowest number of inmates will be 89,360 - or nearly 1,000 more than the projected capacity under current jail building plans.There are currently a record 78,500 prisoners in jail in Britain.The Howard League for Penal Reform described the figures as "chilling".Its director, Frances Crook, said: "A prison population of over 100,000 cannot be paid for, will not protect the public and will not stop re-offending. The home secretary is projecting a future of gulag Britain that puts us all at risk."She added: "Grossly overcrowded prisons put staff and prisoners at risk and it is likely that violence, disorder and death will follow."A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "We will always ensure that there will be prison places for those serious, sexual and prolific offenders who ought to be in prison."We are dealing with pressures on the prison estate by building more capacity.She added: "We are also aware that there are people in prison who ought not to be there, including 10,000 foreign nationals, those with mental health issues and vulnerable women."We have outlined our intention to remove these where appropriate, and to use tough community sentences to deal with less serious, non-violent offenders."The Liberal Democrat's home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "John Reid's promise to build more prison spaces has been exposed as desperately short-sighted and ignorant of the facts."These figures paint a picture of chronic and worsening prison overcrowding that will make it even harder to stop prisoners from re-offending."Until we work out effective ways to turn prisoners away from crime, there is no way the prison system will be able to cope."
