Operation Bangor was launched in the same month that Channel 4 broadcast an undercover Dispatches investigation, entitled Third Class Post, that revealed the theft of credit cards, chequebooks and passports at sorting offices in Paddington and Victoria, central London.In one sequence, Dispatches showed a reporter buying a stolen Barclaycard from a Royal Mail employee. Although the credit card obtained by Dispatches later turned out to have been "fenced" and the channel was forced to apologise, the programme prompted demands from MPs for better security, culminating in a change in the law to allow the Royal Mail to conduct private data checks on employees' criminal backgrounds.Nevertheless and despite claims from the Royal Mail's chief executive, Adam Crozier, that the service was going from "strength to strength", the programme makers went undercover in June at another post office on Merseyside and found similar evidence of lax practices, and in one case a postal staff working alongside a tagged offender.In an experiment to test mail security they also dispatched 20 birthday cards containing Â£30 each from Kensington, west London. They found that on arrival at their destination three had been opened and the contents rifled.
