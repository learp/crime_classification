A man who raped an au pair in church grounds in 1989 was jailed for eight years yesterday after a successful "cold case" review by police.Nick Keall, 41, was charged after a DNA sample taken during an arrest for an assault in December 2001 matched the profile from the rape scene. Keall attacked the then 21-year-old Frenchwoman as she walked home alone after a night in a pub in 1989. He dragged her into the yard of a church near Winchmore Hill, north London, and raped her. Keall, a minicab driver and father of three, was caught by a Metropolitan police unit investigating unsolved rapes. He was found guilty of rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm last month after a week-long trial at Wood Green crown court, north London. The court had heard how the attack had "ruined the life" of his victim, who now lives in Belgium. She became depressed and had a nervous breakdown in 1995. Judge Peter Ader said: "She has remained single and has been unable to form a lasting intimate relationship." The victim was in court as Keall was sentenced. Her attacker, whose wife and one of his daughters were also present, showed no emotion. He later swore at the judge as he was led away. Keall had six previous convictions for 21 offences since 1979 when he was aged 17, including burglary, theft and a conviction for actual bodily harm in 2001.
