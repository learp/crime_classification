The failings of the probation system that led to the savage murder of two French students were due to poor judgment and poor management and not a lack of resources, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, told MPs today.Straw appeared before the House of Commons after the shadow justice secretary, Dominic Grieve, tabled an urgent question calling on him to answer questions about the murder of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, who were tied up inside their London flat, tortured and left with 244 stab wounds.Dano Sonnex, 23, from Peckham, and Nigel Farmer, 34, of no fixed address, were found guilty last week of murdering the two students in a case that shocked Britain and France and raised questions about the monitoring of violent offenders by Britain's probation system and the police."This was not a question of poor resources, but of poor judgments and poor management within London probation, as well as errors by the Metropolitan police and the prison service," Straw told the house."As secretary of state responsible for the probation and prison services, I take responsibility for their failings, and the Metropolitan police take responsibility for theirs. On behalf of each agency, I have apologised to the families of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez and I do so again today."The justice secretary said that probation funding had increased by 70% in real terms since 1997 and that London probation had underspent its £154m budget by £3.5m last year."Rather, this was a failure to use resources effectively," Straw said.Prosecutors described the attacks in June last year as "an orgy of bloodletting". The bodies of Bonomo and Ferez were only found after an explosion at the flat in New Cross, south-east London, which had been set on fire.At the time of the murders, Sonnex was out on parole under probation supervision after serving an eight-year sentence for violence and robbery.Straw said the 23-year old killer was a "serial criminal" and at the time of the murders "he could and should have been in custody".The justice secretary has already apologised in person to the families of the two French students and accepted the resignation of London's chief probation officer, David Scott, in February over the "grave failings" in the handling of the case.Official internal probation and police inquiry reports published alongside the verdicts last week identified a series of "grave errors" and "serious management failings" by probation staff, the police and nearly every other part of the criminal justice system.Scott said he accepted that London probation was "partly to blame for allowing the crimes to take place" but said ministers and other criminal justice agencies had lessons to learn as well.The supervision of Sonnex was left in the hands of a newly qualified probation officer who was struggling with a caseload of 127 offenders in the understaffed Lewisham probation office, where nobody had more than two years' experience.Among the blunders was the failure to identify Sonnex as a high-risk offender, that it took 33 days for a warrant to be issued to send him back to prison, that the courts mistakenly released him on bail and that even then the police failed to go and look for him until the day of the murders.The Old Bailey jury was told that both of the accused were habitual users of drugs, including crack cocaine, and Sonnex had a long history of violence. During the trial each blamed the other for the killings.Sonnex had been jailed for wounding with intent and robbery in 2003 and released on licence in February last year. He was subsequently arrested for handling stolen goods and had his licence revoked. Sonnex told the court he had been back in custody for "four or five weeks tops". The victims had been working at Imperial College London as part of a student exchange."When serious offenders are released into the community having completed their sentence, there will always be some risk that they will offend again," Straw told MPs. "However, the criminal justice system has a duty to manage and minimise that risk. Where the system failed in this case, action has been taken."I will personally be monitoring progress until I am satisfied standards have improved. The safety of the public and the memory of the two young men whose lives were so brutally taken demand no less."
