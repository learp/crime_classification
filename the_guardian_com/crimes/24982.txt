A leading lawyer who carried out a year-long review into the use of physical restraint in juvenile detention centres said yesterday he was shocked by some of the techniques used to control children.Lord Carlile of Berriew QC found young offenders in England and Wales were being restrained using methods that inflicted sharp bursts of pain that in another setting would be considered abusive and trigger a child protection investigation.The Liberal Democrat peer, who led the Howard League for Penal Reform investigation, said yesterday that the techniques had frightened him when he asked staff to demonstrate the methods on him.The independent inquiry was set up after the death in 2004 of Gareth Myatt at a secure centre in Rainsbrook, near Daventry. The 15-year-old died after being restrained by three members of staff.The Youth Justice Board told the inquiry that physical restraint had been used 5,133 times on children in prisons between January 2004 and September 2005 and 7,020 times on children in private secure training centres. There are 2,700 children under 18 held in custody in England and Wales. The figures show that at a secure training centre in Medway, Kent, there were 1,818 injuries to children as a result of these restraint techniques between January 2004 and June last year.Lord Carlile said investigators wanted to see a ban on the use of handcuffs for child offenders, the use of physical restraints reduced by at least 50%, and an end to full strip searches.He called for the children's minister to take over responsibility for children in custody: "More effort needs to be made to resolve conflict and reduce violence inside institutions."The Youth Justice Board chairman, Rod Morgan, welcomed the report yesterday, saying many of the young people in custody were difficult to look after because they came from chaotic and difficult family backgrounds.But a YJB bulletin published this week denies that pain is used to punish or force compliance and claims that it is only used when a young offender is violent.Lord Carlile said some staff used these techniques to punish or ensure compliance. On the techniques used on him, he said: "They ranged between the broadly acceptable and the frankly unacceptable. The most unacceptable was not a technique which involved pain - it involved three members of staff placing themselves in martial arts challenging poses before me. They way in which they positioned themselves was supposed to de-escalate the situation and it made me a little bit frightened - and I don't frighten easily."
