The leader of the British National party, Nick Griffin, appeared in court yesterday charged with four race hate offences.Mr Griffin, 45, was charged by West Yorkshire police after a long-running inquiry into the BBC documentary The Secret Agent, which broadcast clandestine footage of BNP activists.No plea was entered at Leeds magistrates court over four counts of using words or behaviour intended or likely to stir up racial hatred in two separate incidents on January 19 and May 5 last year. He was joined in the dock by the party's founder, John Tyndall, 70, who is charged with two of the same offences. Also appearing was Mark Collett, 24, of Rothley, Leicestershire, who was charged with eight race hate offences. All three were granted bail by district judge David Kitson to appear at Leeds magistrates court on May 19, where they will be committed to crown court for trial. The men face up to seven years in jail if found guilty. Mr Griffin, of Llanerfyl, Powys, spoke only to confirm his name and address during the 15-minute hearing. Wearing a navy suit, he seemed relaxed and smiled at the public gallery. Helen Allen, prosecuting, said Mr Tyndall's charges related to a speech at a Burnley club, which was later screened in the documentary. She said the Crown Prosecution Service had charged the men after reviewing more than 200 hours of film. Speaking outside the court, Mr Griffin said: "If the price of telling the truth is prison, it's a price me and my colleague [Collett] will pay."
