Detectives investigating claims of police corruption and misconduct arrested four Metropolitan police officers and another man in east London yesterday.The officers all worked for Tower Hamlets CID, but the arrests are the result of two separate investigations. A 40-year-old woman constable is being questioned about passing on confidential police information to a man suspected of being a major criminal with whom she was allegedly having a relationship. A Dagenham man, 44, was also arrested. Two male detective constables, aged 39 and 36, were arrested for misconduct and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and a 31-year-old male detective constable for misconduct, after allegations that objects had gone missing from a crime scene. Three of the officers are attached to Tower Hamlets CID, and the fourth was there at the time of the alleged offences. All five people were arrested at their homes in east London. The arrests come a fortnight after Scotland Yard sacked Detective Inspector John Redgrave and Detective Constable Michael Charman, who were suspended on full pay in 1997, and charged in 1998 over allegations that they had destroyed documents. They were cleared of criminal offences in 1999. On May 6 this year a disciplinary panel found them guilty of discreditable conduct.
