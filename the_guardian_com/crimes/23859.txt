Gloucestershire’s police force has been criticised by the police watchdog over its handling of a young woman’s complaints about her violent former boyfriend days before she was brutally murdered as she worked in a hair salon.Hollie Gazzard, 20, was stabbed 14 times in the neck, torso and chest in front of horrified customers and colleagues by her ex-partner Asher Maslin at the salon in Gloucester city centre.A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has raised concerns about how Gloucestershire Constabulary dealt with a call she made to the police reporting that Maslin had stolen from her and threatened to throw acid at her. It also suggested that two police officers who went to arrest Maslin but failed to find him could have done more to make sure Gazzard was kept safe.The IPCC said: “The [Gloucestershire] force’s domestic abuse policies and training in place at the time hindered a comprehensive response. “Hollie was murdered by Asher Maslin three days after she had reported him to the police for theft of her bank card and money from her account.“The investigation found that although the officers’ actions were proportionate to the theft, they did not fully appreciate its potential importance when considered as part of a number of domestic incidents.”The watchdog said that though there were failings by the call handler and officers, it did not recommend they face misconduct action, adding: “The officers’ response was symptomatic of the force’s inadequate policies and guidelines. “Just days before Hollie’s murder, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary [HMIC] expressed significant concerns about the force’s ability to consistently and appropriately deal with victims of domestic abuse.”Gazzard was murdered by Maslin, who is serving a life sentence with a minimum of 24 years in prison, on 18 February 2014.On 15 February Gazzard reported that Maslin had stolen her bank cards and taken £300 from her account. She said he had also threatened to throw acid at her and to attack her family. Police knew of a previous incident in which Maslin had been caught on CCTV putting his hands around Gazzard’s throat and also had details of domestic violence suffered by one of Maslin’s previous partners.But, according to the report, the staff member failed to record a number of matters Gazzard had disclosed during the call including the fact that Maslin was “constantly ringing and texting” and that he had threatened to “destroy her life the way she had destroyed his”.The call handler, who has not been named, stated that at this time she had not received any specific training on domestic abuse, nor had she had any training or guidance on stalking and harassment.Two police officers, Officer A and Officer B, spoke to Gazzard on 15 and 16 February. They made two attempts to arrest Maslin at his mother’s address on 16 and 17 February.The report says: “Both attempts were unsuccessful. The officers were provided with two potential alternative addresses ... however, neither of these addresses were visited.”According to the report, the officers might have done more. including circulating Maslin as wanted on the Police National Computer, to increase the likelihood that he would be arrested.The report stated: “The entire safety plan for Hollie Gazzard depended on the officers locating Asher Maslin, and arresting him … it stands to reason that the safety plan should have been reviewed following each of the negative arrest attempts in order to ensure Hollie Gazzard’s safety.”It added: “It is clear that there are failings in regards to establishing and implementing an effective safety plan. Officer A did not identify Asher Maslin’s actions as stalking and harassment; he did not recognise that that they formed a course of conduct.“As with Officer A, it is a concern that Officer B did not recognise that the original safety plan was insufficient following the negative arrest attempts.”Guido Liguori, IPCC associate commissioner, said: “My sympathies remain with Hollie’s family and friends following her tragic murder. “It is clear from our investigation that at the time Gloucestershire Constabulary’s training and policies were inadequate, meaning the officers and call handler were ill-equipped to fully appreciate the domestic abuse factors within the theft.“I am pleased that a re-inspection by HMIC in June has commended the force’s progress in this area. “Indeed, it is a feature of our interviews that those subject to the investigation were able to identify how they could have provided a better response thanks to training the force has recently delivered.”
