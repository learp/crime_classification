A young rifleman who was obsessed with far-right politics has been jailed for two years for making a viable nail bomb packed with deadly shrapnel in his bedroom.Ryan McGee’s homemade device contained 181 metal screws and bits of glass which were designed to maximise wounding capability when it was set off.Police found the bomb when they raided his three-bedroom family home in Eccles, near Manchester, on an unrelated matter last November.The court heard that he was interested in the English Defence League but was not a member and had watched a horrific video of men being bound and executed under a swastika flag.The court heard McGee kept a journal entitled Ryan’s Story Book with stickers of Scooby Doo and birds on the front filled with drawings of guns, machetes, knuckledusters and knives and images of several paramilitary soldiers.It also contained references to right-wing groups such as the National Front, KKK and BNP, the court heard.He downloaded a number of extreme videos and his laptop had links to websites including gore videos, French Skinheads, Russian Racism, Handguns for sale UK and Germany, and YouTube videos of EDL marches against Muslims and Nazi youth.The prosecutor accepted he was not a terrorist or intended to help a terrorist group.Defending, Antony Chinn QC said McGee had been an immature teenager at the time, as demonstrated by the Scooby Doo notebook.He said: “Although he accepts he made the device he never intended to put it to any violent purpose.”McGee, a fifth generation Army man, was “a bit of a loner” who was brought up with far-right views, he said.The 20-year-old, from 5th Battalion the Rifles, had previously admitted buying the Anarchist Cookbook and making the nail bomb and was sentenced on Friday.
