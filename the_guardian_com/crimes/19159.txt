Ian Brady's 14-year hunger strike has been exposed as a charade after a tribunal heard he makes himself toast every morning and consumes packet soup in his room.The Moors murderer, now 75, is appearing before a medical tribunal at Ashworth special hospital on Merseyside, and he has attended sessions with a feeding tube emerging from his right nostril.He insists through his legal team that he is not mentally ill and wants to be transferred to a prison where it would be easier to starve himself to death.He is forcibly fed while at Ashworth. It has now emerged, however, that nurses bring hot water to his room so that he can make flasks of packet soup. They also knock when they call on him to give him time to put down any slice of toast he might be eating.Mark Sheppard, who has been caring for him for the past 28 months, told the tribunal Brady habitually makes toast when he gets up at 6.30am.The chair of the tribunal panel, Judge Robert Atherton, asked Sheppard whether he thought Brady was trying to "find a way out of his hunger strike".He replied: "It's Ian's continued stance that he is on hunger strike and is being force-fed. But I think what we see every day is contrary to what most people would think of as a hunger strike. It serves a purpose for him, and using the nasogastric tube while studying his legal papers is a hugely important part of his day."But I find it hard to believe that Ian is not aware that we see him eating toast in the morning. It would be incredible if he doesn't realise we know he eats regularly."Sheppard said that whenever he went to Brady's room he would knock, in order to give him time to put down his toast."I've observed him eating on most days," he said.Earlier, the nurse recalled Brady lunging at him with a pen on 24 September last year. He was so angry at the time that he was "baring his teeth" and spitting as he spoke, Sheppard said."He pointed the pen towards my face with such anger that he was going to make contact with me. I had to put my hand up and Ian's hand came over and made contact with me. I am absolutely convinced if I had not brought my hand up his pen would have contacted with my face."Sheppard said he believed his patient was delusional and said he had witnessed him having hallucinations.Until last September he would typically get up at around 6.30am, then spend the rest of the day in his room writing, talking to himself and listening to the radio.He now spends almost all his days in his side room, only coming out at night and on Thursday afternoons, Sheppard said.Professor Kevin Gournay, an expert in psychiatric nursing at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London, suggested Brady's sense of grievance was at the heart of his "hunger strike"."That is all part of enjoying battles to sustain him, to keep him going," he said.Brady is due to give evidence to the tribunal on Tuesday.
