Three unarmed police officers tried and failed to follow the car of mass murderer Derrick Bird before he killed a further nine people, Cumbria police admitted today.The first officer on the scene had no vehicle but was given a lift in a car by a member of the public as they followed Bird's car around Whitehaven, Cumbria, in the minutes after he had shot fellow taxi driver Darren Rewcastle.He and the male driver then witnessed Bird shooting another taxi driver and his female passenger and lost sight of him after stopping to help the injured pair.Two other officers who were close behind tried to pursue Bird's Citroen Picasso in a police transit van but were forced to take cover after he aimed a gun at their vehicle, and lost him, according to police.The disclosures will raise questions about whether Cumbria police had the resources and officers to respond quickly and efficiently to a major armed incident which resulted in the murder of 12 people. At that point, Bird had murdered his twin brother, David, his solicitor, Kevin Commons, and Rewcastle.The police statement shedding new light on what may have been an opportunity to halt the killing spree at an early stage was released this afternoon in response to detailed questions by the Guardian about the commandeered car.A family member of the civilian driver who followed Bird told the Guardian that it was "amazing" the police did not have a pursuit vehilce on the ground quickly enough to follow Bird at a distance."[The driver] was having to follow Birdy in his car, a battered Ford Escort, driving around the one-way system, with this policeman sitting next to him knowing that Birdy was using a gun. They drove for several minutes before losing him on Coach Street."The questions we keep asking ourselves are: 'Where were the other policemen?' 'Where were the pursuit cars and helicopters?' 'Where were the guns?'"Lives could have been saved if police had got to Bird or got a handle on his movements sooner," the family member said.The first sighting came when the neighbourhood policing officer heard shots at around 10.30am last Wednesday in Whitehaven and ran out of the police station.He saw a shotgun pointing out of the front passenger window of Bird's grey taxi, alerted colleagues and then got in the nearest vehicle, driven by the civilian, to follow Bird.He saw Bird slow down as he passed a taxi travelling in the opposite direction. As the two cars passed each other, the officer saw Bird shoot the driver.He stopped to give first aid to the injured man, and to move him and his female passenger, who had also been shot, out of Bird's line of sight.Two other officers in the transit van took over the pursuit, providing sightings to the control room and the armed response vehicles on their way to the scene. But Bird pulled into a driveway, turned and pointed the gun at the officers.The force said in a statement: "They were forced to protect themselves after it became clear they could not reverse due to the traffic that had built up behind them. We believe he [Bird] then drove off at speed."It said the officers tried to follow him but despite asking passers-by where he had driven, were unable to find him."They continued to stay in the area where further reports of Birds location were given."These officers were at the time unarmed and in a vehicle not suitable for a high-speed pursuit."Whilst they had no opportunity to bring an end to Bird's rampage they provided valuable information regarding his whereabouts and likely route."They also provided immediate assistance to those shot and injured in the area."Deputy Chief Constable Stuart Hyde defended the force's response. "Our officers are expected to deal with difficult and challenging situations. This incident was unprecedented and exceptional circumstances were fast-moving and highly dangerous. Had any officer or member of staff had the clear opportunity to stop Bird I am confident they would have taken it."
