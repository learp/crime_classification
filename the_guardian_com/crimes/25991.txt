In a case that will warm the hearts of motorists everywhere, a wheel clamper who intimidated drivers and illegally immobilised their vehicles was yesterday served with a five-year anti-social behaviour order.Gordon Miller made life a misery for motorists with his activities, which included driving his truck into one 60-year-old man, fracturing his knee, and attempting to clamp two motorists while they were doing three-point turns. Last year he clamped an on-duty police car; the officers had to go to a cashpoint to get Â£90 to pay for the vehicle's release. Yesterday magistrates in Portsmouth replaced an interim six-month ban with what is believed to be the first anti-social behaviour order, or Asbo, against an illegal clamper, after they heard how Miller had been operating. The Asbo provides a strict list of terms and conditions under which Miller would have to operate. Portsmouth city council believes that the rules are so stringent that he will no longer be able work as a clamper. Miller, who has 34 convictions for 94 offences, and a jail sentence for driving his truck into the man, clamped cars on land where he had no contract and threatened people. A council spokesman said police and council officers had spent six months building the case against Miller, who ran the firm Aquarius Securities. Councillor Les Stevens said he was glad Miller had been removed from the city's streets.
