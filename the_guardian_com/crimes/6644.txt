A woman appeared at Glasgow sheriff court yesterday charged with the murder of one of the three men found dead in a tenement flat in the city on Sunday.Edith McAlinden, 37, of no fixed abode, was charged with the murder of David Gillespie, 42. She made no plea and was remanded in custody. Mr Gillespie was found dead alongside Ian Mitchell, 67, and Tony Coyle, 72, in a top-floor flat in the Govanhill area in the early hours of Sunday. A police spokeswoman said investigations into the deaths of Mr Coyle and Mr Mitchell were ongoing. The flat's entrance was surrounded by green tarpaulin yesterday as detailed examinations of the scene continued. Neighbours spoke of their shock at the deaths of the three men. "I couldn't believe it when I heard," said one neighbour, who gave her name as Margaret. "Tony and Ian liked a good drink, but the pair of them wouldn't harm a flea. It's tragic." Neighbours said Mr Mitchell, a retired joiner, had continued to stay in the flat when he separated from his wife, but had rented out a room to Mr Coyle, a former labourer in the building trade. Mr Coyle, who was originally from Donegal, and Mr Mitchell had reputations for being heavy drinkers. Mr Gillespie is understood to be the father of two teenagers.
