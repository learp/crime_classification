Men must ensure that a woman has consented to sex to avoid being accused of rape, a new Home Office campaign will warn.The move comes amid concerns that an allegation of rape is less likely to lead to a conviction than ever before.A Home Office spokeswoman said an awareness campaign would be launched next week in a bid to reduce the number of rapes by educating young men in particular about the need to gain consent for sex.The campaign will include radio and magazine advertisements as well as posters in men's toilets in pubs and clubs.The issue of consent was central to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which stated that a person must agree to sex by choice and have the freedom and capacity to make a choice, the spokeswoman said."Giving consent is active, not passive, and it's up to everyone to make sure that their partner agrees to sexual activity," she said.Just 5.6% of complaints lead to a rapist being punished, despite long-running government efforts to boost results.Home Office research found that of 11,766 allegations of rape made in 2002, there were just 655 convictions - down 0.5% from the previous year.In 258 cases the rapist pleaded guilty and the remainder were convictions at trial.Researchers found that there was a "culture of scepticism" towards rape victims among police and prosecutors, which led victims to lose confidence in the judicial system.Separate research last year found that one-third of people questioned believed a woman was to blame for being raped if she had behaved in a flirtatious manner.More than 25% also believed a woman was at least partly responsible for being raped if she wore sexy or revealing clothing, or was drunk.
