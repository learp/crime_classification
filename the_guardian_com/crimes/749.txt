Detectives have arrested a woman suspected of treating hundreds of patients by posing as a registered nurse for four years without being properly qualified.The 46-year-old was held on suspicion of fraud by police investigating her employment at four GP surgeries in Medway, Kent, from August 2006 to September last year.More than 1,400 people, including children, who received vaccinations and cervical smears from her are being contacted by health officials.Women who had their last cervical smear with the woman are being offered a repeat test and some extra vaccinations are also being offered.NHS Kent and Medway said the woman, who lives in Brecon, mid Wales, and has been bailed until next month, had a background as a healthcare assistant.Officials said she allegedly gained a position as a registered nurse without the proper qualifications, prompting a police inquiry by Kent and Essex serious crime directorate.Detective Superintendent Rob Vinson said: "The Kent and Essex serious crime directorate are conducting an investigation into a member of staff who worked at some GP surgeries in Medway between August 2006 and September 2010."A 46-year-old woman from Brecon in Wales has been arrested and has been released on police bail."Dr James Thallon, medical co-director for NHS Kent and Medway, said: "We carried out an immediate review to check that the standard of care we expect patients to receive has been maintained."Our investigations have not found any problems with the work this person has carried out and there is no reason to believe that there has been any harm to anyone's health."We have also checked and we are not aware of any complaints about this person at any stage during their employment."As a purely precautionary measure, we have written to some patients individually to invite them to be seen again. Patients can be reassured that if they have not received a letter they do not need to do anything further."He added that the woman also worked at a practice in Essex and health authorities there were adopting a similar response.A total of 341 women had their last smear test taken by the woman. A further 504 under-16s had routine vaccinations by her, as did 431 adults.In addition, 18 under-16s had travel vaccinations done by her, as did around 150 adults, said Dr Caroline Jessel, assistant medical director for NHS Kent and Medway.Jessel refused to divulge how suspicions first came to light, but said that it was not as a result of any medical involvement."We believe that she left just due to personal reasons and went to live in another area," she added.Jessel went on: "A committee of experts has investigated, looking at the procedures that she undertook in the four practices."We have looked at records and we have done a survey of patients that died over that period, and we have looked at all procedures."In some cases her work was overseen but when she was in the Medway practices she was mainly working without another professional in the room."We have been reassured by all the people that we have interviewed, who have worked alongside her, about her competence."Officials said the practices that employed her had no knowledge of any wrongdoing.A helpline number has been set up for patients who may be concerned on 0345 602 9904.
