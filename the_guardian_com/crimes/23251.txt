Detectives yesterday interviewed a man who thinks he might have seen the man who stabbed Abigail Witchalls fleeing after the attack.The possible witness called police after seeing a reconstruction of the attack on BBC's Crimewatch programme on Wednesday night.The man, from Hythe, Kent, said he was in the vicinity of Little Bookham, Surrey, on the afternoon of April 20, around the time that Mrs Witchalls, 26, was knifed in the neck and left for dead in the secluded Water Lane.So far the caller is the only person, other than Mrs Witchalls, who might be able to identify the attacker.A Surrey police spokesman said that if the caller's story checks out he will be shown pictures of suspects, including Richard Cazaly, 23, a gardener who committed suicide in Scotland several days after the attack, and another 25-year-old man who was arrested but released pending further forensic tests.Crimewatch also prompted a call relating to two men seen stoking a bonfire near the scene of the attack.The two have not come forward, and police think they might have seen something but not realised its significance.There were more than 70 calls to police following the programme, including one from a woman who was followed by a man in a light blue car the day before the attack.Mrs Witchalls told officers she first felt uneasy when she locked eyes with the driver of a blue car as she pushed her 21-month-old son Joseph in his buggy along Water Lane. The man then got out of the car, chased and stabbed her.Meanwhile police are awaiting results of forensic tests on bloodstains found on a pair of Cazaly's trousers and inside a car linked to the other suspect.Hundreds of samples have been sent for examination, including swabs from Mrs Witchalls, Joseph and the buggy.A number of results have come back, but so far nothing has yielded a match.Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper, who is leading the inquiry, said suicide notes left by Cazaly did not amount to a confession and stressed that police were keeping an open mind about other possible suspects.Officers flew to Australia to interview Cazaly's former girlfriend, Vanessa McKenzie, who told them he said he "might have done it" and told her to go home because he could not be responsible for her safety.A police spokesman refused to comment on the details of Miss McKenzie's statement, except to say she had been "very cooperative".Mrs Witchalls' husband, Benoit, told Crimewatch that he and his wife felt no anger against her attacker, but wanted him to get help if possible.Mrs Witchalls was left paralysed from the neck down, and it was feared she would die. But she can now speak for short periods and has recovered her sensation throughout most of her body.
