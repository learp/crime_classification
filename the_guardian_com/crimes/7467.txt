A woman has been stabbed to death on a busy shopping street in south-east London in what reports suggest was a random attack by another woman using a stolen butcher's knife. A second victim, also female, was slightly injured.Police said a woman had been arrested at Broadway, the main shopping street in Bexleyheath, following the attacks on Monday morning.A member of staff at the nearby Rose pub said the murder weapon was believed to have been stolen from the British Meat Market, also on Broadway. "I didn't see what happened but I think one of the girls stole a knife from the butcher's. A policeman told my boss that's what happened. We were really shocked," said the woman, who would not give her name.London's Evening Standard newspaper quoted witnesses as saying the attacker, described as a young woman, initially stole another knife from an Asda store before fatally stabbing the first victim. She then took a knife from the butcher's shop before slightly injuring another woman on her hand. The paper quoted police sources as saying the victims appeared to have been chosen at random.A Scotland Yard spokesman said officers were awaiting formal identification of the dead woman, who was believed to be in her 40s or 50s. Next of kin had been informed. He added: "It's too soon to discuss any sequence of events, or what the motive was."Officers were called at around 8.30am to Broadway following reports of an assault.The spokesman said: "Officers and London ambulance service attended and discovered a woman suffering from a stab wound. She was pronounced dead at the scene at 8.41am."An ambulance service spokeswoman said one ambulance crew was sent to the scene, where the more seriously injured victim died. The other woman did not require hospital treatment.
