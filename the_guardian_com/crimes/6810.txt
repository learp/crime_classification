A thief who stole a Â£2,500 painting from a museum was caught after being overheard boasting about it in a pub toilet.He took the canvas, called Brighton, when it was in storage in 1999 during redevelopment of the Castle Museum and Art Gallery in Norwich. But he was heard in a Norwich pub discussing how he could get rid of the piece and the eavesdropper reported him to police.The artwork was returned to the gallery three years after it went missing. The thief was charged but never faced trial because he died in prison. Martin Warren, museum collections and information manager, said a police informant overheard a conversation in which a drug dealer said he had "a load of stuff" he needed to get rid of. The painting depicts Brighton sea front in the style of John Constable and was acquired by the museum in 1940. The painter is unknown. The theft emerged after a Freedom of Information Act request on security measures at the museum.
