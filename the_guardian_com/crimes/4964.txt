More than a million adults who are suffering from a crippling disorder which can lead to criminal behaviour are being overlooked because doctors believe the condition is confined to childhood, it was claimed yesterday. A leading forensic psychologist, Susan Young, told the British Psychological Society's annual conference in Glasgow yesterday that as much as 3% of the adult population could have attention defecit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These people, however, are not receiving essential treatment and medication because many psychiatrists and psychologists believe children grow out of the disorder. Dr Young, of the Institute of Psychiatry, said some studies estimate the condition - which is characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness - may affect up to 25% of the prison population. Little work has been done on the prevalence of ADHD in adulthood, but Dr Young said that 6% of children have the disorder and around half of them will carry it through to adulthood. "I think what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. We cannot possibly have identified all the adults in the population with ADHD." ADHD in adults can be treated successfully with the controversial drug Ritalin - which has been heavily criticised over its effect on children - but adult patients can often become depressed and need additional psychological help. Dr Young studied 30 adults who had been diagnosed with ADHD later in life and compared their progress with a group of 30 adults who had other personality problems, but not ADHD, and a group of 30 "normal" adults. All of the people involved in the survey were from middle class backgrounds and were of average intelligence. But Dr Young found "huge differences" in their lifestyles. Around one third of ADHD sufferers had attended special schools for children with learning difficulties against only 7% of those with other personality disorders. No one from the "normal" group had gone to a special school. People with ADHD also found it much more difficult to hold down jobs and two thirds were unemployed, compared to only 3% of the "normal" group. They also had severe social problems and had difficulty forming friendships. Dr Young also found that 25% of people with ADHD had been to prison. "They were stealing, fire-setting, being cruel to animals - all the way up to homicide," she added. Dr Young set up the first clinic for adults with ADHD at Maudsley hospital, south London, in 1994. There is only one other specialist clinic in the UK.

The psychological therapies were administered to help the patients deal with nausea, vomiting and other side effects inherent in chemotherapy. But the researchers found that, not only did the treatments reduce nausea and vomiting, the patients also survived longer. When they looked at the patients 13 years on, those who had been given relaxation therapy survived for an average of 104.5 months and those who had hypnotherapy and relaxation therapy survived for 125.8 months. Patients who received only conventional help survived for only 93.8 months.
