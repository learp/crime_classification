Thousands of criminals who are dodging nearly £500m in fines are to escape a crackdown forcing them to pay up after ministers quietly dropped the initiative.The Department for Constitutional Affairs confirmed yesterday that it had abandoned Operation Payback, a high-profile campaign with radio and TV advertisements and even beer mats with a slogan warning criminals: "Fine dodgers: we are coming to collect."The cancellation of the campaign, which should have started on January 29, appears to be the first victim of industrial action by civil servants who have been working to rule since a one-day strike at the end of last month. Officials at the department said that industrial action had been partly responsible for the cancellation.The campaign was to have been the fourth in a series to catch criminals who are avoiding paying fines which are increasingly being used by the police and courts to tackle antisocial behaviour and yob violence. Some 165,000 offenders last year were issued with penalty notices for shoplifting, criminal damage, being drunk and disorderly and harassment.Previous campaigns launched under the slogan, Think You'll Get Away With It? Think Again, sought to recover compensation owed to victims of crime and money owed to the courts. The first campaign recovered £750,000, the second £2m, and the last in October recovered £2.5m. The department said yesterday that it was reviewing future campaigns but had not set a date for the next blitz.Yesterday the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCSU), which announced it was stepping up its yearlong action against pay cuts, privatisation and compulsory redundancies, said the cancellation showed that ministers could not ignore the union's action. A spokesman said: "Ministers cannot bury their heads in the sand and think they need not negotiate with us and there will be no consequences."The Conservatives yesterday condemned the government for abandoning the campaign. Edward Garnier, the constitutional affairs spokesman, said: "This is another example of the government being all talk and no action. They announce all these initiatives to tackle crime and then quietly drop them when it comes to taking action."Meanwhile the PCSU is setting aside £500,000 for a national campaign aimed at May's local elections in England and Wales and elections for the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, to put pressure on candidates to oppose closures of local tax and benefit offices and defence cuts.
