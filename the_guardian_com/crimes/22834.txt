Two Colombian drug barons who ran one of the UK's biggest ever cocaine cartels are serving jail sentences of 19 and 17 years, it was revealed today.The scope of the network, run for several years by 45-year-old Jesus Anibal Ruiz-Henao and his brother-in-law Mario Tascon, 32, was such that the price of cocaine on the streets increased by 50% after their arrest.Full details of the cartel and the police operation to smash it could not be revealed until today. It employed at least 50 people, and more than 30 have been involved in a series of linked cases.Reporting restrictions were lifted today when the last of the defendants pleaded guilty to assisting another to retain the benefits of drug trafficking.Ruiz-Henao and Tascon arrived in Britain as asylum seekers in 1990, claiming they were fleeing persecution in their home country. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK.By the time of their arrest in November 2003, they were running an operation thought at its height to have smuggled as much as a tonne of cocaine - worth around £25m - into the country each year.According to senior detectives, Ruiz-Henao was effectively the "sales distribution manager" for cocaine in Britain. Tascon was his deputy.Their capture was the result of a four-year investigation by the National Crime Squad and the Colombian authorities in tandem with a Scotland Yard investigation into a linked money laundering racket.More than 60 people have been arrested in Britain in connection with the two cases. Police seized £3,500,000 in cash and 645kg of cocaine during the investigations.One of the most significant swoops was the seizure of a lorry in Thurrock, Essex in which 72kg of cocaine was hidden in pallets.Ruiz-Henao, of Hendon Way, Hendon, north London and Tascon, of Hampton, Broadhead Strand, Hendon, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class A drugs at a hearing last year and were jailed for 19 and 17 years respectively.Both also pleaded guilty to money laundering, for which Ruiz-Henao received 10 years and Tascon nine years to run concurrently.Sentencing the pair, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said those who ran the drugs trade were very rarely caught. "This is because they pay other people to carry out the dangerous work where an arrest is more likely," he said."Their fingerprints are not found on the drug packaging, no telephone is shown to have made relevant calls, nothing incriminating is found in their homes. "Others carry out their tasks. Meanwhile, they make enormous profits from this foul trade."The judge told them they would be recommended for deportation on their release. Four other men linked to the gang, who were arrested following the seizure of the lorry in Thurrock, were convicted and sentenced in February 2004.William Ruiz-Henao, 33 - Jesus Anibal's younger brother - of Chatsworth Road, east London, and Ramon Navarro, 39, from Almeira, in Spain, were jailed for 16 and 18 years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs.Roque Garcia-Martinez, 31, also from Almeira, and Ivan Garcia Ospina, 31, of Woodlands Park, Haringay, north London, were jailed for 13 and 16 years for the same offence.
