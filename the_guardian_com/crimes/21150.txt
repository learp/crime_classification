The man hailed as a "community hero" for trying to stop youths in Ealing setting fire to bins during Monday night's riots has been named by police, more than two days after he was taken to hospital with injuries that have left him in intensive care.Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, has been identified by police investigating the attack during which he was knocked to the ground and suffered a fractured skull. But they have still to make contact with his next of kin. Mannington Bowes, who remains in a critical condition, had no wallet or identification on him when he was attacked on Springbridge Road.Releasing new CCTV footage of the suspected attacker, police urged the man to "do the decent thing" and give himself up. He is described by police as black, with a big build, wearing a white T–shirt with writing on and a dark jumper over his shoulders.Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane, leading the inquiry, said: "Through CCTV we have identified a strong suspect. I know that, on seeing these images of him, people will be able to identify him. If you know who this man is, please contact my incident room. If you are this man in the CCTV, do the decent thing and give yourself up."Jim Martin, owner of several Ealing businesses including Big Jim's Trims barbershop, said he witnessed the aftermath of the attack but had not seen the victim's face. He believes he knew Mannington Bowes, and described him as "a really, really nice guy, a nice, old, public school gent; really nice, wouldn't harm a fly." But he said he could not be sure until he saw a photograph of the victim.Residents in Ealing are keen to thank Mannington Bowes. "I don't recognise either man [but] it would be nice to tell him we appreciate your help," said Samandar Samari, manager of the Caspian hotel a few doors down from Springbridge Road.Anyone with information is urged to contact the police incident room on 0208 721 4205 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
