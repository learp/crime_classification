Police in Hull were given a further 24 hours last night to question a 20-year-old man about the murder of a college student who was beaten to death in a prolonged attack in her halls of residence.The body of marine biology student Rebecca Love, 26, from Rotherham, was found by staff at a Hull University dormitory in The Lawns, Cottingham, on Friday afternoon. Her mother raised the alarm after her calls went unanswered.A 32-year-old man who was arrested was later released. A police spokeswoman said other arrests were possible.A postmortem examination revealed that the student had been assaulted. Detective Chief Inspector Tony Garton, who is leading the inquiry, said: "We appear to be dealing with a fairly prolonged physical attack. There are no signs of forced entry to the room or the hall, so it would appear that there was some form of consent."Our indications are that she knew who her attacker was, but I'm not saying it was another student. It is important that we find Rebecca's phone as it may hold important information which could assist this investigation."We have searched Rebecca's room but the phone couldn't be found. Rebecca's friends and family tell us she had a silver-coloured Nokia phone, which we urgently need to locate."Ms Love was in daily contact with her mother and last spoke to her on Wednesday evening. Their conversation was cut short and her mother promised to call back the following morning.Detectives have established that she visited a cashpoint in Cottingham on Tuesday evening, went to an off licence and is then believed to have returned to The Lawns. There were several unconfirmed sightings at The Lawns on Wednesday. Ms Love's parents, David and Carol, issued a statement through the police appealing for witnesses.
