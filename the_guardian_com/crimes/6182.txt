A children's after-school club has been shut after two men linked to it were arrested as part of a police investigation into child pornography.Additions Childcare in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, was closed last week after the arrests. Ofsted said it had suspended the club's registration because of fears that children may have been at risk of harm.Police searched the club and it was reported that computers had been taken away for investigation.About 20 children aged between four and 11 attend the centre, which provides care in the morning and evening during school term, and all day during the school holidays.A parent said news of the investigation had left her feeling "physically sick".Gloucestershire police said no evidence had been uncovered that children had suffered physical harm. A spokesman for the force said: "On Wednesday 26 August, police arrested two local men, aged 20 and 23, in Gloucester in connection with computer-related offences."As part of the operation a number of addresses in the Gloucester area which are linked to the men are being searched, including an after-school club."The 20-year-old has been bailed until November and the 23-year-old has been bailed until February.An Ofsted spokesman said: "We have suspended Additions' registration after hearing of concerns about the nursery that suggested children may be at risk of harm. This will allow an investigation to occur."The 26-year-old parent, whose five-year-old son attended the club twice a week, said: "It is every mother's worst nightmare."The Gloucester Citizen newspaper reported her as saying: "I was so angry when I first found out that it had closed, but when I heard that it was being investigated by police my mind went into overdrive and I was physically sick."News of the closure came on Wednesday in a text message sent to parents by Additions.The company's website says it has been operating childcare sessions for working parents for 10 years. It was also planning to expand its activities to offer a Friday night film club and a Saturday afternoon crafts club.Additions' site also said Ofsted had given it a satisfactory rating when it was last inspected.
