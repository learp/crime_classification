A 16-year-old boy today admitted pouring bleach over a woman who had asked him to be quiet during a cinema screening of a Harry Potter film.A jury heard how Annette Warden, 46, was "terrified" when the teenager approached her from behind in a busy Frankie and Benny's restaurant and squirted Domestos over her head as she was having meal with her husband and two children on 26 July.Some of the liquid hit her husband and one of her children and it turned her hair grey and white. Her blouse was damaged and she suffered minor burns that were treated in hospital with saline solution.The family had earlier watched Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince at the Vue cinema in Leeds.The jury was told how the 16-year-old had admitted causing Walden actual bodily harm but he denied a more serious charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.A jury was told how the phones of the boy and his teenage friends kept going off and they were being noisy so Warden asked them to be quiet before calling for a member of staff.Later, as the family went into the nearby restaurant the defendant leaned out of a car and shouted "you fucking slag" at her.The court heard how the youth then went to a service station and bought the bleach.He returned to the restaurant and squirted the liquid on to her head.In a statement read to the court, Warden said: "I was terrified and at the same time scared for my children."Describing the incident in the statement, she said: "Throughout the film the group were texting each other and mumbling. Their phones kept lighting up and ringing."She described how the defendant shouted "yeah, go on" at a point in the film when Harry Potter was kicked in the head.Warden said she went to fetch a member of staff when the disturbance continued and the teenagers were warned they could be thrown out.After the screening had finished, Warden said she again talked to the staff. The court was told she was given a set of free tickets.In other statements, youths in the car said the defendant was very excited and wanted to go back to confront the woman.He asked the driver to go to a nearby garage but the others said they did not know what he bought there. One thought it was eggs.The defendant went into the restaurant by himself and attacked Warden from behind.She said: "It (the bleach) kept coming and fell all down the right side of my face and into my eyes. I didn't know what it was at first. Then I smelt bleach and my eyes started stinging."She rushed to a nearby toilet while her husband ran after the youth, but he fled in a car leaving the discarded bleach bottle.The trial continues.
