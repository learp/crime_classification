The family of Jean Charles de Menezes, the young Brazilian man mistakenly shot dead by police hunting a suicide bomber in south London two years ago, reacted angrily to the announcement yesterday that none of the officers involved in the operation would face disciplinary proceedings. One of his relatives said the police were being allowed "to get away with murder".None of the 11 officers whose actions were investigated will face proceedings, the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled yesterday. No decision has yet been made about the four senior officers who authorised the shooting at Stockwell underground station on July 22 2005 when Menezes was on his way to work.Nick Hardwick, chairman of the IPCC, said he had made the decision after careful consideration. He said he was "struck again by the challenge facing officers of the [Metropolitan police] following the carnage on July 7 2005."Set alongside this is the fate of Jean Charles who was entirely innocent ... The grief and anger of his family is entirely understandable and as I have been powerfully reminded - remains unassuaged."A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "The shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes is a matter of very deep regret to the Metropolitan police service and our continued thoughts are with his family. We have apologised publicly and in private to them and we would again like to take this opportunity to say sorry for this tragedy." Four senior officers, including Commander Cressida Dick, who authorised the shooting, were also investigated by the IPCC. No decision about them will be made until after the prosecution of the Met in connection with the shooting, under health and safety laws, due in October.The family and supporters of the dead man attacked the decision.Patricia da Silva Armani, Menezes's cousin, who shared a house with him at the time of his death, said: "It is disgraceful the IPCC can make such a decision - they are letting the police get away with murder."First officials killed my cousin, then they lied about it and now the officers are walking away without any punishment."A spokesman for the Justice4Jean Campaign, the group set up by Menezes's family and friends, said: "Today's decision effectively says police officers can act above the law, free to take human life without facing a full legal investigation like anyone else."The family have already applied to the House of Lords for a review of an earlier decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring criminal charges against any individual officer in connection with the shooting.A second IPCC investigation, known as Stockwell 2, is still looking into complaints about comments made by Sir Ian Blair, the Met commissioner and colleagues in the wake of the shooting. This inquiry is due to report later this year.
