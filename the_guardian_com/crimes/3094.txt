One of the McCann family's closest friends broke her silence tonight to insist she saw Madeleine being carried away by her abductor.Jane Tanner spoke in public for the first time about what she believes is the last definite sighting of the missing girl.Her evidence is one of the few clues Portuguese detectives have as to what happened to Madeleine at the Algarve holiday complex on May 3.Tanner said she saw a man carrying a sleeping child away from the Praia da Luz apartments just 45 minutes before Kate McCann discovered her daughter was missing.She decided to speak out, despite the instructions of the Portuguese police, after being labelled a liar and a fantasist.In an interview with the BBC she said: "I know what I saw, and I think it is important that people know what I saw, because I believe Madeleine was abducted."Describing the night of the abduction, she said another friend had come to her apartment at about 10pm and said the child was gone.She said: "That was the first I heard about it. Then I saw Kate and Fiona running around shouting, 'Madeleine!' Kate said to me: 'Jane, Madeleine's gone, Madeleine's gone.'"Tanner denied reports she had refused to cooperate with Portuguese detectives or that she had changed her story.Asked why she had not spoken out before, she said: "I have not spoken because the Portuguese police told us not to talk about these things at all."From day one we have done everything we could to help them with the investigation. Maybe I am talking now because I have been called a liar and a fantasist."Tanner and her partner, Russell O'Brien, who live in Exeter, are two members of the so-called tapas nine.The party were eating together at a restaurant at the resort and taking it in turns to check on the children as they slept.The group have reportedly been accused of a pact of silence by the Portuguese police and have rarely spoken to the media before now.Last month the McCanns released a picture of the man created by an FBI-trained forensic artist using details provided by Tanner.The picture, which depicts a man with dark, collar-length hair cradling a pyjama-clad child in his arms, was published on newspaper front pages worldwide.The McCanns, both 39, of Rothley, Leicestershire, were named arguidos, formal suspects, in September over the disappearance.But despite a battery of DNA and forensic tests on samples recovered from their apartment and hire car, no charges have been brought.They deny any involvement and have been trying to keep the disappearance of their daughter in the public eye.Earlier this week it was reported that detectives have 100 new questions to put to the couple and their circle of friends.The Portuguese newspaper 24 Horas claimed police have been prevented from re-interviewing the McCanns unless they can find evidence of their involvement.Â· The Jane Tanner interview will be broadcast during Panorama: The Mystery Of Madeleine McCann on BBC One on Monday, November 19, at 9pm.
