The wife of missing canoeist John Darwin left Panama tonight to return to Britain.Anne Darwin said yesterday her life had become a "nightmare" and admitted that a photograph - apparently taken on July 14 2006 in Panama - showed her and her husband in an apartment they had just rented.The photograph shows a smiling Darwin with his wife, apparently four years after he was supposed to have died in a canoeing accident in the North Sea.When she was confronted with the photograph, she told the Daily Mirror, which originally published the image: "Yes, that's him. My sons will never forgive me."Mr Darwin, 57, turned up at a London police station on Saturday, claiming not to remember anything about the past five years. He was arrested on suspicion of fraud early yesterday morning.Mrs Darwin's departure from Panama came as it emerged that one of her sons left his flat in the middle of the night, leaving a notepad apparently containing "instructions" for his girlfriend to meet him at London City airport.Flatmates of Mark Darwin, 31, called police after they found he had cleared out his room in Finchley, north London.A tabloid bidding war to buy the notebook ensued and reached Â£10,000 before a flatmate emerged and said police had advised them not to reveal further details.One flatmate said Mark had apparently believed his father had drowned in a canoeing accident off the coast near Hartlepool more than five years ago.Cleveland police said Mark was not suspected of a crime and there are no restrictions on his movements.It has emerged that Mark and his brother Anthony had both recently left their jobs.Mark, 31, quit EC Harris, a firm of international property consultants, on Friday, the day before his father's reappearance. A spokesman for the company said he had worked his notice and had not left abruptly.Anthony, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, left his insurance job with Towergate Risk Solutions in Reading in August.Earlier today, the two brothers issued a statement in which they said: "If allegations of a confession from our mam are true, then we very much feel that we have been the victims in a large scam."Having seen the recent media speculation surrounding our parents ever since our dad was arrested, we are very much in an angry and confused state of mind. How could our mam continue to let us believe our dad had died when he was very much alive?"We have not spoken to either of our parents since our dad's arrest and we want no further contact with them. We have been in constant contact with the police and will be helping them with their enquiries in any way we can."Detectives were given the go-ahead to interview John Darwin after he passed a medical examination at a Cleveland police station.
