The Conservative candidate for one of David Cameron's top target seats resigned yesterday, after being arrested over allegations of harassing his opponents. Councillor Ian Oakley was released on bail by police investigating claims that prominent Lib Dems in Watford, including his rival parliamentary candidate, Sal Brinton, suffered a campaign of poison-pen letters, anonymous late-night phone calls and criminal damage. The commuter-belt seat, held by Labour's Claire Ward with a majority of just 1,151, is a tight three-horse race between Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. Oakley's resignation is an embarrassing setback for Cameron, who needs to take such high-profile Middle England seats to win the next election.After he was selected in 2006, he pledged to fight the seat with '99 per cent perspiration and 10 per cent inspiration'. When his maths was queried, Oakley retorted that'nobody deserves to win Watford unless they give more than 100 per cent'. Oakley was arrested on Friday, but Conservative party headquarters was not even aware of the incident until informed by journalists. Oakley resigned after being contacted by senior party officials. In a statement issued late yesterday, a party spokesman said: 'As this is now the subject of police inquiries it would be inappropriate for the Conservative party to comment further.' Lib Dem candidates claim to have suffered a string of incidents over more than three years. These include being sent pornographic material in the mail, property and vehicles being damaged, and letters being circulated claiming that Watford councillors were convicted sex offenders. A police spokesman said: 'Hertfordshire Constabulary can confirm that a 31-year-old man from West Drayton was arrested on Friday.'
