The rapper Beanie Sigel was shot in the stomach inside a home in New Jersey on Friday and was being treated for a life-threatening injury, according to police and his lawyer.The bullet went through Sigel’s stomach and out of his back, Pleasantville police chief Jose Ruiz told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Sigel, whose real name is Dwight Grant, was in surgery and listed in critical condition, according to his attorney, Fortunato Perri Jr.Perri said Sigel’s family told him that the rapper had just taken his children to school and was an unintended target of the shooting, which occurred around 9.30am Friday.“We’re all hoping and praying that he pulls through,” Perri said.Ruiz said that investigators were waiting to talk to Sigel, 40, and that a second man who was injured at the home refused medical treatment and has been uncooperative with police.Sigel has had three top-five albums on the Billboard chart: The Truth in 2000, The Reason in 2001 and The B Coming in 2005. He also starred in the movie State Property and its sequel. He has been in and out of courtrooms over the past decade, sometimes with Jay Z and Beyoncé looking on from the gallery.In August, Sigel was moved from federal prison to a halfway house after serving a two-year tax-evasion sentence, and in September he was released to home confinement. Authorities said he failed to pay more than $700,000 in taxes.In 2006, Sigel was shot multiple times in the arm in Philadelphia after an attempted robbery. He was able to drive himself to a hospital for treatment. He was found not guilty of attempted murder in a 2005 trial.
