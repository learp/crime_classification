The shadow policing minister, Vernon Coaker, has insisted Labour is "likely" to field candidates in next year's elections for police and crime commissioners despite fundamental objections to the establishment of the posts.Coaker said no final decision had been taken about the polls, set to take place in England and Wales next November, but that the party was set to field candidates.His comments came amid speculation that Labour may opt not to field candidates after learning that the Conservatives are considering standing aside in favour of independent candidates in some areas.Blair Gibbs, of the centre-right Policy Exchange thinktank and one of the architects of the policy of introducing elected police commissioners, told a fringe event at the Labour conference in Liverpool it was possible that the Tories would field candidates in most of the 41 police force areas, but might stand down in favour of a like-minded independent in parts of the north.The former home secretary Jacqui Smith warned it would be a mistake not to field candidates – a view echoed at the meeting by Lord Harris, a former chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority.But Coaker told the fringe meeting that while Labour's default position was likely to be to field candidates, "if the Tories don't, we need to consider that carefully".He added: "It is likely that we will field candidates – however, no decisions have been taken."Earlier the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, who opposes the plans, saying they would be waste of money at a time of cuts and would lead to the politicisation of the police, appeared to signal that a boycott in some elections had not been ruled out.Cooper told the Press Association she would have to "look at the right way to respond", adding: "The legislation is not yet on the statute book, it's just finished going through parliament."I am still very concerned about this because you are spending over £100m on police and crime commissioners at a time when police budgets are being cut by 20% – we are losing 16,000 officers as a result."I think that is a big concern when we should be trying to get more officers on the beat."Cooper, preparing to announce details of Labour's independent commission into the future of policing in her conference speech on Wednesday, said the coalition was "deeply irresponsible" for introducing elected police chiefs at the same time as cutting 16,000 constables – a move which she said took "risks with people's safety".When asked whether Labour would boycott some of the elections, she said: "That is not what we have been proposing. We do obviously have to look at that because the legislation has gone through. We will be thinking about the best way to respond to do that."She also expressed concern that candidates may have a lack of police experience and criticised the decision to hold the polls in November 2012.She said: "I do think there is a problem here because we are talking about elections for people who don't necessarily have policing experience being elected to have considerable power over the police at a cost of over £100m at a time when you could spend that money on more constables."
