A racist prisoner who killed his Asian cellmate was part of a gang that murdered fellow inmates, a public inquiry heard today.The inquiry into the murder of Zahid Mubarek by Robert Stewart at Feltham young offenders' institution was told that two of the killer's friends had also murdered fellow prisoners.A statement from the Mubarek family, read by inquiry team member Patrick O'Connor QC, said: "This was no accident. The evidence will disclose that Robert Stewart was one of a group of murderous associates in other prisons."Stewart's best friend in prison murdered another inmate on the day of the victim's 17th birthday. Another of Stewart's good friends killed his victim on the day of his grandmother's funeral."'We are all evil' Stewart gloated in a later letter to an associate. It is difficult to disagree."The statement added that Stewart had planned to kill his 19-year-old cellmate by obtaining a wooden dagger and breaking off a table leg, which he used to bludgeon his victim to death.Stewart also wrote in a letter the month before the killing that he intended to take extreme measures to get moved from Feltham, including threats to "kill me fuckin' padmate" while dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The letter also made reference to Adolf Hitler and murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.The inquiry also heard that in June 2000, three months after the murder, Stewart wrote to his brother inciting harassment of the Mubarek family and giving their home address.He wrote: "Ya, do you want to get up to any of your phone antics? Do some dodgy orders? I'm not 100% sure but [address], Walthamstow, east London. It's an old friend of ours. Do a 192 check first."In another letter he expressed eager anticipation at receiving morgue photographs of Mubarek's body and promised to pass them on to a friend.Stewart, now 24, is serving a life sentence for the murder.The inquiry, being held in London, is expected to continue until March.
