Your report (Police alarm over rape suspect on Facebook, 31 March) and Zoe Williams's Comment piece (Facebook vigilantes, 1 April) are both potentially misleading. We have never "condemned" the Facebook site nor said it would "wreck chances of prosecution". We did raise some concerns over some inflammatory comments posted on the site and met with the victim's partner to suggest he should carefully moderate posts to ensure they would not affect our investigation. We are always looking for ways to use new technology to bring offenders to justice and GMP was the first force in the country to set up a group on Facebook, which also featured this offence. Zoe Williams suggests the investigation has been "inadequate". The opposite is the case. We have examined dozens of hours of CCTV footage, carried out house-to-house inquiries, visited premises in the area and carried out a full crime scene investigation and forensic search. We also issued two media appeals. This offence took place in GMP's Trafford division. Last year its dedicated rape unit detected 50% of all reported sexual assaults - significantly higher than the overall detection rate for England and Wales, which stands at 30.5%. Rape is a vile and degrading offence. Its effect on victims and those closest to them is seen on a daily basis by my officers and we will use any lawful means we can to see rapists put behind bars. GMP will always thoroughly investigate all rapes and treat victims with dignity, care and respect. I would also urge victims not to be put off coming to us because of potentially misleading media coverage. Peter FahyChief constable, Greater Manchester police
