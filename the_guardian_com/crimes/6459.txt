A nanny who worked for a series of celebrities was jailed for three years yesterday for seriously injuring a 10-week-old boy in her care. Jasmin Schmidt shook the baby, causing an injury to his brain and a broken arm, the Old Bailey heard. The 34-year-old German national had denied any wrongdoing and refused to explain how the child suffered his injuries.Schmidt "should be ashamed" of her actions and her repeated denials, which placed unfair suspicion on the baby's family, the judge, Recorder Jeremy Gold QC, told her. He banned Schmidt from working with children again.The paediatric nurse was found guilty last month on two counts of causing grievous bodily harm to the boy. He had been left in her care at a London flat when his parents, who owned a shop in North Yorkshire and hired Schmidt through an agency, attended an event at London fashion week in September 2002.The following morning the baby's mother found him pale and limp. Schmidt, from Primrose Hill, north London, said only that he had been restless and she had swaddled him in a blanket. The boy, now six, made a full recovery.Schmidt went on to work for a series of celebrities, and came under suspicion again when a well-known British singer accused her of harming her baby daughter. In January Schmidt was cleared after facing trial for allegedly assaulting the singer's baby in 2006 and the baby of a classical musician in 2003.Gold told her that her denial in the current case had caused great worry to the injured boy's family. The court heard that Schmidt had since taken a degree in business studies and had not worked as a nanny for two years.
