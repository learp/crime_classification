Attorney general Dominic Grieve has been determined to take action against newspapers flouting the contempt of court act ever since he came into office.And I've been very supportive of his initiative because, over the years, it was clear that editors had been publishing potentially prejudicial articles.But I wonder about Grieve's wisdom in prosecuting the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail in an action heard yesterday in the high court, in which judgment has been reserved.It concerns the case of Levi Bellfield, the man convicted of abducting and murdering Milly Dowler. After the jury found him guilty, the Mirror and Mail published articles that the trial judge felt made it impossible for the jurors to deliver their verdict on another charge against Bellfield.He was accused of of attempting to abduct an 11-year-old girl, Rachel Cowles, the day before he snatched 13-year-old Milly from a street in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002.But the judge discharged the Old Bailey jury, a decision that upset Rachel and her mother, who felt that justice had not been done in their case. In fact, the Mirror and Mail were part of an "avalanche" of adverse publicity across the media following the guilty verdict against Bellfield over Milly.As David Perry QC, counsel for the attorney general, said yesterday, the trial was halted because of the "totality" of the publicity.But he alleged that the articles in the Mail and Mirror were "given particular prominence" and "clearly and in themselves gave rise to a substantial risk that the course of justice would be seriously impeded".Unsurprisingly, the newspapers believe their publications would not have created a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the case. And I have to say, given the weight of the coverage across the whole media, it is hard to see why they are being held to account.It was, as the Mail's counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, said an "extremely unusual" case because the jurors not only knew Bellfield had previously murdered two people and attempted to murder a third, but they "had just found proved that he had abducted and murdered a fourth".Caplan said: "It is difficult to envisage what other material could have been so prejudicial so as to have created the requisite risk".And the Mirror's counsel, Pushpinder Saini QC, similarly argued that it was hard to see how the paper's coverage had impeded the course of justice.I have to say I find myself wholly in sympathy with the Mail and the Mirror. Indeed, in the latter case, there is a bitter irony because a Mirror reporter, David Collins, played a key role in obtaining evidence that led Bellfield to stand trial in the first place. It was the reason that Collins was named reporter of the year in the British press awards in March this year.I am sympathetic to the plight of Rachel and her family. I am with the attorney general on his desire to prevent papers prejudicing trials. But, in this specific instance, I cannot see how these papers alone were guilty of breaking the law.Nor do I think the rest of the media were wrong either. The discharged jurors knew the man they were dealing with and it cannot be said that the published material would have genuinely surprised them.Incidentally, has anyone taken the trouble to ask them? I doubt it because that would also be a breach of the law.  Source for high court case: PA
