A former boyfriend of the model and socialite Tamara Ecclestone has been jailed for four years for plotting to blackmail her for £200,000.Derek Rose, 33, who dated the daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2002, was involved in a plot in which it was claimed he was approached to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper. Rose was included in an email mentioning the possibility of discussing "a non-release fee" and signing a confidentiality contract.  Tamara Ecclestone arrives at court. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/GettyJudge Andrew Goymer, at Southwark crown court, told him: "This was an audacious attempt to obtain a large sum of money."Rose, of Camden, north London, was found guilty of the charge on Monday.The court heard that he dated Ecclestone when she was 17, before changing his name by deed poll from Jonathan Ketterman.The blackmail arose from an email sent on 16 November 2011 to Ecclestone's manager after the model had starred in Billion Dollar Girl, a reality TV programme exploring her life as a rich young person, and after she had generated publicity in charity campaigns.It claimed Rose had been offered £200,000 to sell his story to the tabloid press, despite no newspaper having made such an offer.The trial heard that the email had "pernicious" implications and was sent to elicit money from Ecclestone, aged 28.The email said Rose had been asked by television shows, radio programmes and a major tabloid to talk about their relationship.The judge said that 10 years ago, Rose was in a relationship with Ecclestone, which ended acrimoniously."You felt extremely hurt, and within a few days of writing a bitter message, you were selling your story to a tabloid newspaper, and that speaks volumes about your true character."For nearly a decade, he had no contact with her."She came to your attention again in November 2011 when she was the subject of a television series. The email that you sent on 16 November in which you threatened to reveal personal details was not the product of a broken heart. All that was long in the past."The judge added: "It was nothing more than a cynical and greedy attempt to extract a large sum of money."No doubt you thought that £200,000, which is a large sum to most people, would be small change to somebody with the amount of money that she and her family are reputed to have. You also thought that for this reason they would readily part with it to buy your silence. She did not do this."The judge said that the well known, well connected and well off did not deserve special protection, but the reality was that they were more likely to fall victim to this type of offence."Blackmail is always an unpleasant and vicious offence. It can properly be said to be one of the worst offences that does not involve physical injury because of the fear and insecurity that it produces."The judge said it was true that no money actually changed hands but it was an audacious attempt to obtain a large sum."There is a need to deter this type of offence, which can be relatively easy to commit."The jury failed to reach a verdict on Rose's co-accused Jakir Uddin, 20, of Birmingham, and the prosecution is considering whether to seek a retrial of him.
