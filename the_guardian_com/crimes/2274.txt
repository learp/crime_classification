The daughter of the former British prime minister Tony Blair has been held up at gunpoint in an attempted robbery.The 25-year-old barrister was walking her dog with her boyfriend when the incident took place on Monday night close to her home in Marylebone, central London, according to reports.A spokesman for Tony and Cherie Blair was quoted as saying: "Kathryn was with a group of friends. No one was hurt and nothing was stolen."Police said there were two attempted robberies at gunpoint in the area on Monday. In the first, which took place at around 8pm, a man attempted to hold up a woman. In the second, about 30 minutes later, two men attempted to rob a man and a woman.A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "It is believed that these robberies are linked. On both occasions a firearm was seen but not used â€“ no shots were fired. None of the victims were injured and nothing was stolen during the incidents. Officers from Westminster borough are investigating both incidents. There has been no arrest at this stage."The incident came after Kathryn Blair had spent the weekend celebrating the wedding of her brother Euan, 29, in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire.Since 2010, she has lived in a property bought by her parents close to their own home. She was called to the bar last year by Lincoln's Inn, following in the footsteps of her parents, who joined the same inn in the 1970s.
