Despite a public apology from Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon, the parents of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence today claimed that London's top policeman was unfit to continue in his position. Neville and Doreen Lawrence voiced their opinions shortly after Sir Paul had admitted to the inquiry that he "deeply regretted" failings in bringing their son's "racist murderers" to justice. Sir Paul also recognised the "anger and frustration" of the black community and praised the "courage and dignity of Mr and Mrs Lawrence." Sir Paul accepted that the investigation into Stephen's death was tarnished by accusations of racism. "We have heard what people have been saying and I accept that a central concern is that the Met is racist.  "I acknowledge that we have not done enough to combat racist crime and harassment. The skills and resources that we have applied successfully to other areas have not, as a matter of priority, been applied to racially-motivated crime." However, Sir Paul refused to accept that his force was 'institutionally racist.'  Although he went on to claim that he would do more to build an anti-Racist police force, his apologies and pledges did not satisfy Mr and Mrs Lawrence. Commenting on Sir Paul's claims, Mrs Lawrence said "I believe he is not racist personally, but the idea he accepts there is not racism involved is wrong."  Five years since her son's death they were still in the same position as that in which they had started, she claimed. Mrs Lawrence said a new Commissioner was needed: "we need someone to take radical action." She said she wanted the Commissioner to admit and accept there was wrongdoing on the part of police officers in the investigation of her son's murder.
