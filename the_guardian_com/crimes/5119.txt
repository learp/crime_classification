Police investigating the White House Farm killings, for which Jeremy Bamber was convicted of multiple murders, have been accused of corrupting vital evidence after claims they allowed the crime scene to be used as a training exercise for firearms officers.New analysis of police documents and fingerprint forms of officers who entered the Essex farm on the morning of the shootings – uncovered during an Observer/Guardian Films investigation – indicate that up to 17 officers from firearm support units attended the murder scene, hours after the killings for training purposes.Bamber was convicted of shooting dead five members of his wealthy family, including six-year-old twins in August 1985. The 50-year-old, who is serving a whole life term for the killings but has always maintained his innocence, said the claims follow allegations that the crime scene was restaged.Expert analysis of photographs taken in the aftermath of the shootings suggest bodies in the house may have been moved and the crime scene retouched Bamber's adopted parents, June and Neville were killed along with his sister Sheila Caffell and her young sons, Daniel and Nicholas, in the village of Tolleshunt D'Arcy.The disclosure comes ahead of today's meeting by a committee of experts from the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) who will discuss whether to refer Bamber's case to the court of appeal.A referral would examine the possibility that Bamber, who has spent more than half his life in prison, be the victim of one of the UK's longest miscarriages of justice.Bamber, speaking from HMP Full Sutton in North Yorkshire, said he was horrified that the bodies of his dead family may have been used as "props" by officers on training exercises.He said: "The thought of the police using my dead family as props in a training exercise makes me ill. Where was their respect for the victims?"Where was their professionalism, when dozens of officers were trampling over the scene of crime?"Essex police have always denied restaging or interfering with the crime scene and moving the bodies.Initially, officers deduced that the killings were a murder-suicide in which Sheila – a diagnosed schizophrenic known as Bambi – shot her family before turning the gun on herself. Bamber believes officers originally thought the evidence would only have been used in a coroner's court, as opposed to a murder trial.The new analysis of fingerprint charts indicates far more firearms officers entered the farmhouse than officially admitted, with some arriving almost seven hours after officers first entered the building and found the bodies.An inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson in 1988, found that 26 officers entered White House Farm on the day of murders. In fact, 43 officers entered the scene according to the fingerprint data."Now, it seems they withheld information about the number of officers present at the farm from official inquiries," said Bamber.The Dickinson inquiry did voice misgivings over the number of officers allowed into the farmhouse after the killings.It stated: "Whilst access of the majority of the officers was justified, some should not have been permitted entry. The normal security of a murder scene was not maintained throughout the whole period as it should have been."An Essex police spokesman said they could not comment on the new claims while the CCRC examined the issue. He said: "Essex police continues to be in contact and co-operate with the CCRC in regards to any representations made by Mr Bamber".
