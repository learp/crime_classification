The husband of a Bafta-nominated make-up artist who disappeared last week was today arrested on suspicion of her murder.Diane Chenery-Wickens, 48, who has worked on shows including Dead Ringers, The League Of Gentlemen and Casualty, has been missing since last Thursday.Police said she was last seen by her husband, David, who travelled with her by train from East Grinstead in West Sussex to London to attend a meeting.Today, Sussex police said a 51-year-old man from East Sussex had been arrested on suspicion of her murder and would be interviewed.He was in custody at a police station in Eastbourne, a police spokesman said.Last night the impressionist Jon Culshaw, who worked with Chenery-Wickens on Dead Ringers, said her disappearance was out of character and concerning.He told BBC South East Today: "We knew her really, really well. She has been our make-up artist on our show for about five years."We spend a lot of time together and she is a really, really lovely woman, really organised. It's just really out of character, which makes it all the more concerning and bewildering."You just hope that somewhere there is one of those sensible explanations to this."Once Chenery-Wickens and her husband arrived in London, they were said to have parted in the Shepherd's Bush area with an agreement to meet up again later at a hairdresser's.But she did not turn up for her hair appointment and has not been seen or heard from since.Her husband reported her missing to the Metropolitan police the same night.Chenery-Wickens has worked for more than 20 years on hair and make-up design on some of television's best-known shows.Her work has been seen by millions of viewers on programmes including the BBC's adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice.Her brother Russell Wickens said their parents were "frantic" with worry and urged her to make contact, saying: "We can solve anything."In a statement, Mr Wickens added: "Diane's husband, her family and friends are all extremely worried."Her disappearance is uncharacteristic behaviour and causing us great concern. We urge her to get in touch just to let us know she is safe."In an interview in 2006, Chenery-Wickens said that at school she aspired to become a hairdresser and beauty therapist, and went on to the London College of Fashion.In 2003, she was nominated for a Bafta in the make-up and hair design category for her work on Dead Ringers.
