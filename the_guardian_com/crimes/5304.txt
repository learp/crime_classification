Sara Payne, whose daughter was abducted and murdered by a paedophile, will deliver a withering assessment on the government's attitude to tackling crime in her inaugural report as Gordon Brown's adviser on victims' rights.Payne, the government's first victims' commissioner, will call this week for a major overhaul of the criminal justice system to offer improved justice for victims. Among recommendations in her report, released this Thursday, are the introduction of a more "honest" sentencing system, improved trauma counselling for relatives of murder and manslaughter victims and a fresh approach to how to treat victims. In addition, Payne, whose daughter Sarah was murdered in 2000, will say more police officers are needed to combat antisocial behaviour.Officials at the Ministry of Justice and Crown Prosecution Service are understood to be nervous ahead of Payne's report and her findings will come as an embarrassment to the government, which has made improving the treatment of victims of crime a top priority.Gordon Brown described Payne's appointment last January as a "landmark reform in our justice system" and is believed to have personally approved her appointment.One of the report's principal recommendations is to tackle the confusion surrounding sentencing, with Payne arguing for a more "honest" system. She will say that the current situation creates unnecessary pain for families because they are unable to comprehend that offenders who receive stiff custodial sentences are released in a matter of weeks.Last week judge Nigel Gilmour, QC, allowed a man convicted of assault to walk free and said that even when sentenced to several months in jail, a criminal could often expect to spend around a week as a prisoner. Early-release schemes and decisions by prison governors often mean six-month jail terms are reduced to six weeks and 28-day sentences are waived to ease overcrowding."She is aware that greater transparency in sentencing is required to minimise the suffering of families," said a source close to the report.Mike Dixon, strategic policy director for Victim Support, said: "We hope Sara's report will prove pivotal in shifting the needs of the victim towards the centre of the criminal justice system."Payne, 39, of Hersham, Surrey, also wants the criminal justice system to be reformed so it takes into account the emotional effect of a crime upon a person rather than recording individuals as statistics that denote they are victims of a crime type."For instance, victims of a burglary might, in some instances, be more distressed than victims of a stabbing. The system needs to take that into account," said the source.Sarah was snatched by Roy Whiting in July 2000. Whiting, from Littlehampton, was sentenced to life for her murder.
