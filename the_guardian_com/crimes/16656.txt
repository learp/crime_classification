The Scottish parliament is to dock the pay of the disgraced MSP Bill Walker if he is jailed after being convicted for repeated violent assaults on three former wives and a stepdaughter.Walker has refused to quit as the independent MSP for Dunfermline after being found guilty last month of 23 counts of assault over 30 years, despite cross-party demands for him to step down supported by the first minister, Alex Salmond, and all Holyrood's party leaders.

Photograph: David Cheskin/PAThe former Scottish National party MSP was accused in court of being "violent, domineering, controlling and relentless" with all three of his partners and a stepdaughter from 1967 until 1995.The violence included punching them in the face, leaving one with a black eye, brandishing an air rifle, repeatedly using a saucepan to hit another ex-partner, and putting all his partners through "systematic physical and emotional abuse".The Scottish Lib Dem leader, Willie Rennie, who formerly represented Dunfermline at Westminster, launched a public petition urging Walker to resign. He said that while the pay-docking measures were "constructive and proportionate", Walker still had no place at Holyrood."We must be clear that there can be no letup in our efforts to seek ways to remove Bill Walker from parliament," Rennie said."I have made a personal plea for him to resign. There can be no place for a person convicted on 23 separate counts of domestic abuse in this parliament. People across Scotland are rightly furious that Bill Walker still refuses to leave."Women's rights and anti-domestic violence campaigners further intensified the pressure on Walker by staging a protest outside parliament earlier this week.MSPs will vote next week on proposals to impose a mandatory 90% cut to the Â£58,000 annual pay of any MSP who is sent to jail, on the grounds that a prison term stops them carrying out their parliamentary and constituency duties.The radical measure, agreed after Holyrood's governing body and the presiding officer Tricia Marwick reviewed their limited powers to sanction Walker, is thought be the first time such measures have been introduced in a British legislature.Walker is due to be sentenced on 20 September. But the sheriff court is unable to jail him for more than a year after Scottish prosecutors decided not to send him for trial by jury, despite the scale and persistence of his violence.Prosecutors followed the standard practice of treating each assault as a single offence, none of which was individually strong enough to require a jury trial.The UK's parliamentary rules stipulate that only allow a parliamentarian who is jailed for more than a year can be stripped of their seat at Westminster or any of the devolved legislatures, including Holyrood.That rule is now expected to be challenged at a UK level by a coalition of anti-domestic violence campaigners and women's aid groups, who will press for new laws that would automatically disbar a parliamentarian who is convicted of violence against the person, regardless of the type or length of their sentence.Jenny Kemp, of the Scottish anti-domestic abuse campaign Zero Tolerance, said she was not satisfied that the pay cut was a strong enough sanction. Dunfermline needed to have an MSP able to represent them, which Walker would be unable to do in jail."Mr Walker is not fit for office," Kemp said. "If he is imprisoned his constituents will be left without representation; and the estimated 5,000 women in Dunfermline who've experienced domestic abuse will have no one to voice their needs in parliament."This just isn't good enough. We need legal reform to remove MSPs who commit violent crime, and a step-change in how domestic abuse is prosecuted in Scotland that takes proper account of a catalogue of offences and doesn't treat each one as a minor incident. We want justice for all victims of domestic abuse."In a letter sent to MSPs on Thursday, Marwick said officials had established that under the Scotland Act 1998 which set up the devolved parliament, they were legally able to change the salary scheme for MSPs."Following our consideration this morning, the Scottish parliament corporate body (SPCB) is strongly persuaded by the proposition that any member who is unable to carry out their full range of functions as a result of being imprisoned should not receive their full salary," she said. "From reviewing the core functions of a member as set out in the SPCB paper, we recommend that 90% of salary should be withheld for the duration of imprisonment."The pay cut will not affect any period when an MSP is out of jail on a tag, a curfew order or out on licence in the community. If jailed for 12 months, Walker is likely to be out of prison in a matter of months under Scotland's automatic early release rules.Officials are also looking at the implications of a mandatory pay cut for an MSP's pension payments, though sources said this was a complex area and needed further work.Opposition parties say the case has damaged the standing of Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy first minister, whose constituency office was given detailed allegations about Walker's violence towards his ex-wives in 2008, when he was an SNP councillor in Fife.A family member said Sturgeon's aides said that information was passed onto the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh, run by the party's chief executive, Peter Murrell, who was then Sturgeon's partner and is now her husband.Walker was selected by the SNP to stand in Dunfermline in the 2011 Holyrood elections, winning the seat in Salmond's landslide election victory.
