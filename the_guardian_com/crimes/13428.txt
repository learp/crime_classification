The most senior Asian police officer in the country is in final discussions with the Metropolitan police to settle what it was feared would be a highly damaging race discrimination case.The suspended assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur, had promised to produce evidence that showed racism within the Met went to the top, and the tribunal threatened to be the most damaging race row since the Stephen Lawrence inquiry findings nearly 10 years ago.Ghaffur gave a glimpse of what was to come at a press conference where he appeared in full uniform to accuse the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, of being racist. He was then sent on "gardening leave" until the outcome of any tribunal.Ghaffur singled out Blair as a perpetrator of the discrimination that he claimed had damaged his career. But Ghaffur's lawyers began discussions with the Met before a preliminary tribunal hearing last Monday and the hearing was cancelled. The lawyers have spent the last week discussing details of the settlement, which is expected to be in the region of £250,000. The Guardian has been told that suggestions that Ghaffur was to receive £500,000 were "wide of the mark". Originally, he made a claim for about £1m. A deal is likely to be agreed within days.As part of the settlement there will be no admission of liability from Scotland Yard. A source told the Guardian that discussions would be completed before Blair left the Met on December 1. The advertisement for a new commissioner will be published on Friday and the successful candidate chosen by the spring. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: "Negotiations are continuing."
