Scotland Yard was bracing itself yesterday for a race row after a senior ethnic minority officer failed to win promotion.Chief Superintendent Ali Dizaei was thwarted in his attempt to become a commander, an outcome which senior sources blamed in part, on his book, Not One of US, which is highly critical of the Metropolitan police. The Guardian understands Mr Dizaei may be considering a claim for discrimination against the police for this and an earlier failed attempt at promotion.Mr Dizaei was one of nine candidates for six vacant posts at the rank of commander. The selection was made by the Metropolitan Police Authority which decided to fill only three posts.Mr Dizaei said he was "very disappointed" and would wait for feedback as to why he failed before deciding his next move. Yesterday one senior officer said: "You have to question his judgment in writing it [the book] ... If he hadn't written the book he'd have been promoted."But Len Duvall, chair of the MPA, said: "Our decisions on appointments were based, rationally and fairly, on merit."
