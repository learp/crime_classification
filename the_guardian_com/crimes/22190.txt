Seventeen armed police officers guarded nine men in court today, some of whom are charged with the sectarian murder of a Catholic youth worker Kevin McDaid.Six were charged with murder as well as the attempted murder of Damien Fleming in Coleraine, Co Derry last weekend. Two are also charged with attempted murder and one with affray.Riot police also watched over 70 loyalists who were in the public benches at Ballymena magistrates court to support the accused.On the other side of the court, more police protected friends and family members of Kevin McDaid, including one of his four sons.The 30-minute hearing passed without incident after District Judge Philip Mateer warned that anyone shouting in court would be removed and dealt with.Kevin McDaid died after being beaten by a loyalist mob close to his home in the Somerset Drive area of Coleraine.His neighbour Damien Fleming remains in a critical condition in hospital.The attacks happened after Rangers won the Scottish league title at the weekend when up to 30 loyalists "invaded" a mainly Catholic area of the town.Those charged include:David Craig Cochrane, 18, was charged with murder and attempted murder. His father David James John Cochrane, 47, faces a charge of affray.Ivan Beattie McDowell, 42, was charged with attempted murder.John Thompson, 29, was charged with murder, attempted murder and assault.Frank Simpson Daly, 48, was charged with murder, attempted murder and assaulting Evelyn McDaid and Leona Whittaker.Christopher McDowell, 33, was charged with murder and attempted murder.Aaron Thomas Beech, 23, was charged with attempted murder and assault.Paul Andrew Newman, 40, was charged with murder and attempted murder.John McGrath, 50, was charged with murder, attempted murder and assaulting Evelyn McDaid.The deputy first minister Martin McGuinness and chief constable Sir Hugh Orde are to meet at Stormont to discuss the murder.Meanwhile, a loyalist parade due to take place in Coleraine tomorrow has been voluntarily re-routed away from the murder scene. The Pride of the Bann flute band shortened its planned route so it does not cross the Bann Bridge.Parish priest Father Charles Keeney said the band had made the right decision."I'm delighted that they've taken that decision â€“we all have to be sensitive to the feelings of people that have been bereaved and who are saddened in such a way," he said.The Parades Commission has said it is satisfied with the band's decision to shorten its march."I think it was probably inevitable something had to be done about the parade, because there was no question I think of the parade going the way in which it had originally been filed for," the commission's Roger Poole said.In a statement, the band said it did not think the parade "can rationally be said to have any connection or bearing on recent events".However, it said the decision to change the route was "an appropriate gesture and one which we hope will be taken as a sincere attempt to ease any community tensions".The chief constable has asked the police ombudsman to investigate claims that his officers did not do enough to prevent the fatal attack.
