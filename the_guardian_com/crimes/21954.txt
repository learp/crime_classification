A 16-year-old army cadet was stabbed to death outside a church youth club after he was set upon by a group of 15 teenagers in an unprovoked attack, police said yesterday. Detectives in Liverpool are looking for two boys who are thought to have been the ringleaders of the attack on Joe Lappin. It happened at 8.40pm outside the Shrewsbury House youth club in Everton after a Monday night music club where youngsters learn to play instruments.Joe, who lived three miles from the club in Old Swan, appears to have been waiting with two friends for a lift home from his parents after his first session. A second victim, aged 17, was also stabbed. His condition was described as "not life-threatening". A third teenager suffered minor injuries. There were 50 to 70 teenagers in the club at the time of the stabbing and police appealed for them to come forward with information. Officers said the group approached the three boys and chased them before the attack. Joe's mother, Toni Lappin, speaking at a press conference with her husband, John, by her side, said: "The events of the last 24 hours have left us devastated. We have lost our son and his younger brother and sister have lost the person they looked up to." She added: "As a mother I would appeal to all the mothers of those involved - understand our grief, come forward."Two teenage boys were arrested on suspicion of murder close to the scene. But detectives said the main perpetrators may still be at large. Joe is the second teenager from Old Swan to be killed in recent months. In August, Luke Howard, 16, was stabbed to death at a party.
