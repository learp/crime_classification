A man who was found injured alongside a dead woman in her cottage has been arrested on suspicion of her murder, police said today.Amanda Sorrell, 55, was discovered at her home in the village of Stoke Climsland, near Callington, Cornwall, last week.The 65-year-old suspect, who has not been named, was arrested by police at Derriford hospital, near Plymouth, over the weekend. He had undergone surgery for serious injuries and remains in hospital in a stable condition.A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: "When he is well enough, the suspect will be taken into police custody, but it is not known when this will be at this stage."Police were called to the cottage on 27 September when concern was raised for Sorrell's welfare after she failed to turn up for work at Cornwall county council.The man was found in the same downstairs room as Sorrell's body with what are believed to be self-inflicted injuries. The force has not said how Sorrell died, although it is understood she suffered stab wounds. A postmortem examination was carried out last week but the results have not been released.Colleagues of Sorrell paid tribute to an "incredibly committed, hard-working and very talented" person.Allan Hampshire, the council's head of public health and protection, said: "Amanda has worked for Cornwall council since 1997, firstly as a registrar and then, from 2007, as an area manager within the registration service."She was incredibly committed, hard-working and very talented. Amanda will be deeply missed by everyone in the registration service and by colleagues throughout Cornwall council."
