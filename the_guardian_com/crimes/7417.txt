Boris Johnson today vowed to "eradicate" violence against women in the capital as he outlined his domestic violence strategy.The Conservative mayor promised to take a "united fight to end violence against women in London", including sex trafficking and the growing use of sexual violence as a weapon used by gangs in London.His pledge coincided with the sentencing of John Worboys, the black-cab rapist who was found guilty of a string of attacks against women last month.But critics accused the mayor of failing to honour a manifesto pledge to fund four rape crisis centres in the capital.Johnson said he had the "political will" to revolutionise the way London responds to violence against women as he launched the strategy, The Way Forward – A Call for Action to End Violence Against Women, at a support centre for victims of violence in north London.Scotland Yard is facing a crisis in public confidence after serious mistakes came to light relating to the respective investigations involving Worboys and Kirk Reid, a south London chef who raped and sexually assaulted more than 71 women over eight years.The number of reported rapes in the capital increased by 14.5% last year, while domestic violence incidents rose by 4.4%. Yet only an estimated 10% of women who have been raped or sexually assaulted report it to the police and only 6% of all rape cases end in a conviction.Johnson accused the government of a "piecemeal approach" to protecting women from violence.The mayor, who is also chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, said he wanted to hear about gaps in services. He said: "There are a significant number of women in London whose lives are blighted by the violence of men, something which is wholly unacceptable."Johnson said last year in his mayoral manifesto that he would "act immediately" to provide long-term funding for four rape crisis centres in London. "We would provide funding for these centres by cutting the number of GLA [Greater London authority] spin doctors," he said at the time.Basing his calculations on the cost of London's only rape crisis centre in Croydon, Johnson said last year that securing funding for this centre and three others would require ring-fencing of around £744,000 annually.Johnson says he had allocated £380,000 for this year – just over half the promised funding – and was conducting a review to "establish where those rape crisis centres would be best situated and go forward". But opposition members of the London assembly insist that he has only budgeted £233,000.Joanne McCartney, a Labour member of the London assembly, said: "The mayor is presenting himself as a defender of women's rights but the reality is he's betraying them by breaking another key promise. To be honest it was pretty cheap to suggest that London's urgent need for more rape crisis provision could be solved by sacking a few press officers."Boris needs to learn that when you make promises, Londoners expect you to keep them. We need to see action, not warm words and hot air."Johnson said that rape support centres staffed by civilians were "invaluable" for victims who wanted long-term help and support.But he added: "We can't immediately call into being three rape crisis centres in the way we want because we are not a funding agency," he said.Plans outlined in the strategy include working closely with boroughs to "enhance" frontline service such as rape crisis centres, and working with the Met police to get tough on trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women.Sir Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said: "With our partners, we remain committed to bringing all perpetrators of violence to justice and properly supporting those affected by such crime."
