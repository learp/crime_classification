A driver was stabbed to death yesterday as violence followed a row over a minor car accident in a residential street.The man, who has not yet been named, was driving through Ilford, Essex, on Tuesday evening when his car was clipped by another vehicle. After the incident, both drivers went a few hundred metres along Argyle Road in the town before stopping. Then the argument began. As the victim stepped out of his car he was confronted by several men from the other vehicle, said the police. At one point the man tried to run for help, but he was chased by the men from the other car, a Ford Fiesta, and stabbed, Scotland Yard said. Detective Chief Inspector David Brown, who is leading the murder inquiry, said the attack was "horrific" and happened after a row "over nothing more than a bump in the street". He said: "This man was murdered over what appears to be a very minor road accident and it is essential that we apprehend those responsible as soon as possible." The victim, who is thought to be Kosovan, was beaten, stabbed several times and kicked repeatedly in the head during the assault. "Witnesses said his head was kicked ... like a football. They stabbed him, pushed him down, jumped up and down on him," said a police source. An ambulance arrived within minutes of the attack but the man had already lost consciousness by the time paramedics started treating him. He was taken to King George's hospital in Goodmayes, where he later died. Detectives are hunting three men who were in a blue Ford Fiesta, registration T729 COO. Gian Basi, 74, a resident who lives nearby, told the local paper: "The men who stabbed him just turned around, got back in their car and drove off. It was so quick and brutal. There was barely a scratch on the car." Detectives were last night questioning a 36-year-old man, arrested in connection with the incident.
