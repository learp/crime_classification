Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAThe woman, who was upset by the assault but did not need medical treatment, moved herself and her bike to safety. She contacted police and handed over footage of the incident, which occurred on 1 May. The Metropolitan police released the video to help find the man. The force said on Tuesday evening that a 33-year-old had attended Bethnal Green police station at about 1.30pm and identified himself as the man in the video. He was not arrested but would be interviewed by officers from Tower Hamlets “in due course”, it said in a statement.Paul Kitson from CTC, a cycling charity, and a solicitor with the law firm Slater and Gordon, said: “While the film clip is shocking this is unfortunately not an isolated incident.“In my experience as a cycle injury lawyer, I have come across examples of cyclists being deliberately pushed off their bikes by passengers from passing cars, motorists attempting to push a cyclist into oncoming traffic and even using their vehicle as a weapon. “When a pedestrian deliberately pushes a cyclist off a bike this is a criminal act. The appropriate offence depends upon the extent of the injury.”
