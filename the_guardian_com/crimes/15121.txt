The husband of a nurse who was found dead in the boot of a car has appeared in court accused of her murder.Pierre Legris, 60, attended Bournemouth magistrates court charged with killing 44-year-old Rui Li, who worked at Poole hospital.Legris, who spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the brief hearing, is accused of Li's murder between 22 May and 31 May at his home in Burnham Drive, Bournemouth.As the charges are so serious, the case and any bail application can only be dealt with at a crown court.Neither prosecutor Nicola Reece nor defence solicitor Siobhain Egan spoke during the two-minute hearing. No formal plea was entered and Legris, who was wearing dark blue tracksuit bottoms and a grey T-shirt, was remanded in custody to appear at Winchester crown court on 4 June.Chairman of the bench Alan Belbin told him: "You are being sent for trial to the crown court sitting at Winchester on June 4 at 10am for the offence of murder. You will be attending on that day for a preliminary hearing."Legris's 26-year-old son, Jonathan, also from Bournemouth, has been charged with assisting an offender. He has been released on bail until 17 June, when he will appear at Bournemouth magistrates court.Officers discovered Li's body in a silver Fiat Punto in north Bournemouth on Friday night.Detectives said she moved to the UK from China 10 years ago and had worked at the hospital since 2009. They said she lived "quite a private personal life" and officers were trying to build a picture of her lifestyle.A Dorset police spokesman said: "We still very much want to hear from anyone who may have any information about what happened to Rui Li. In particular, we would like anyone with information about the movements of two vehicles – a silver Fiat Punto with registration plate W887 PDL and a large white Ford Transit van with registration plate Y491 GFT – between May 24 and May 28 to contact police."
