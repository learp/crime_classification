A man was arrested last night after a teenage boy was killed and three others injured in a stabbing in north London.The 15-year old victim died at the scene in West Green Road in Tottenham yesterday afternoon. The three other teenage boys who were wounded were taken to hospital but did not suffer life-threatening injuries, the Metropolitan police said.A Met spokeswoman said a man believed to be in his late 30s had been arrested and taken to a north London police station.She said officers were called to the incident at 3.45pm yesterday following reports of an assault."We found four males aged approximately 14 suffering stab wounds," a force spokesman said.The 15-year-old boy was pronounced dead at the scene.A stretch of West Green Road was sealed off, with emergency vehicles on the scene and forensics officers examining the area.Eyewitness Jean-Pierre Laville, 30, a carpenter, said: "I was in the internet cafe and saw a fight going on between three boys and a man on the pavement across the road."The man was short and stocky. There were punches being thrown and I saw him stabbing – it was very quick."Two of them collapsed on the ground, and he just walked off up the road. He had blood on his face. There were loads of people around, they were just frozen at what had happened."Local resident Tom Bridger, 36, who works as a barman in Hampstead, north London, said: "I came out of my flat at four o'clock to go to the shops and saw a boy lying on a stretcher. Ambulance people and police officers were pumping his chest trying to save him."I've heard there was a fight. Perhaps the boys were from a school which is nearby – the headmaster was there."
