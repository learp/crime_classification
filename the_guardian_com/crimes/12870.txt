A gunman who terrified staff during Britain's biggest jewellery robbery was jailed for 23 years today.Aman Kassaye, who planned and executed the heist at Graff Diamonds in Mayfair, central London, and his three accomplices were found guilty last month.The audacious robbery last summer netted £40m of gems, which have not yet been recovered.Kassaye, of no fixed address, used a professional makeup artist to disguise his appearance and a series of getaway cars to escape across the capital, shooting at anybody who got in his way, Woolwich crown court heard.He was jailed for 16 years for conspiracy to rob, a further five years for possessing a firearm and a further two years for kidnap, a court official said.Petra Ehnar, a shop assistant at the store on New Bond Street, told the jury she was "petrified" when the robbers forced her to empty the store's display cabinets with a gun to her back.She filled a bag with 43 pieces of jewellery including earrings, necklaces and watches worth a total of £40m. One diamond necklace alone was valued at £3.5m.Ehnar, who was forced into the street by the robbers as they fled, was told she would be killed if she did not carry out their demands.Three other men – Solomun Beyene, 25, of Marylebone, London, Clinton Mogg, 43, of Bournemouth, and Thomas Thomas, 46, of Penrhyn Road, Kingston upon Thames – were each jailed for 16 years after also being convicted of conspiracy to rob.Several factors led to the arrest of the gang. As Kassaye and Calderwood raced from the scene in a blue BMW getaway car, they collided with a black cab. In their haste to transfer to a second vehicle, a pay-as-you go mobile phone was left wedged between the driver's seat and handbrake. A loaded sawn-off shotgun and four cartridges were found in the boot.Anonymous numbers stored on the mobile eventually allowed police to track the movements of those found guilty. The gang – said to have been recruited by Ethiopian-born Kassaye, a drug-dealing media studies student who dropped out of St Mary's University College, Twickenham – had used several phones bought in the lead-up to the robbery.Graff Diamonds, owned by the billionaire tycoon Laurence Graff, 72, lost more than £6.6m as a result of the robbery.Experts believe the stolen jewellery has probably been broken up so the stones can be laundered back into the diamond market after being recut.
