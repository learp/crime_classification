Levi Bellfield, the man accused of murdering Milly Dowler, was today accused of trying to blame the schoolgirl's parents for her death.The "ludicrous" theory was revealed to a jury as Bellfield, who denies killing Milly, refused to take the stand at the Old Bailey.Instead, said prosecutor Brian Altman QC, he had tried to put Milly's parents on trial. Milly's mother, Sally Dowler, and her sister, Gemma, left the court in tears as Altman said their lives had been laid bare following the loss of the 13-year-old."The grieving parents are not on trial here. That fact may have been forgotten when they came to give their evidence to you," Altman told the jury.Milly vanished on 21 March 2002 in Station Avenue, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, as she walked home from school. The prosecution alleges that convicted killer Bellfield, who was living in a flat there, abducted and killed her before dumping her body 25 miles away.Bellfield, 43, denies abducting and murdering Milly, and attempting to kidnap 11-year-old Rachel Cowles the day before. The former wheelclamper and bouncer was convicted in 2008 of the murders of Marsha McDonnell, 19, in 2003 and Amelie Delagrange, 22, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004.The court was told that Bellfield had given evidence at his first trial but chose not to in this case.In his closing speech Altman said Bellfield had "ducked the opportunity" to give his side of the story from the witness box because he had no innocent explanation."The reason he has not done so is that he doesn't have an innocent account to give – an account that will stand the test of critical scrutiny," said Altman.The defence had implied that Milly ran away the day she disappeared and had fallen into the arms of her killer somewhere other than Bellfield's "backyard".Mr Dowler had been questioned about porn he had hidden being discovered by Milly some months before, while Mrs Dowler, who taught maths at Milly's school, had been accused of "shutting her eyes" to the situation and not dealing adequately with the effect on her daughter.Altman said: "As I understand it, it is going to be suggested that Milly had run away; she did not want to be in her father's company that day. So she hung around Station Avenue, only to slip away into the arms of someone else. What underpins this theory? The father's lifestyle as well as the aspects of Milly's character."It was after Milly's disappearance and the finding of her body six months later that Mr Dowler's interest in bondage had been revealed to the police and his wife."This evidence is now being used to suggest Bob Dowler contributed to his own daughter's disappearance and her eventual death," said Mr Altman."There was an implication in cross-examination that Sally Dowler had not dealt with the matter properly; that somehow she had contributed to her daughter's disappearance."Why is the defence advancing this ludicrous theory? The defence is desperate to put as much clear water as it can between Bellfield and the prosecution allegation that Milly disappeared in a flash on his doorstep."Altman added: "No one, absolutely no one in this court other than Mr and Mrs Dowler and their daughter Gemma, can possibly know or understand what it is like to have lost a child or sister in dreadful circumstances."Not knowing, month after month, what had become of her – only years later to have their lives laid bare in this court."Altman said Bellfield was the only one on trial but he had, unlike the Dowlers, not "had the courage" to explain himself in the witness box. He said the suggestion that Milly might have run away was a "diversion"."She was an intelligent girl, top set at school, interested in all the topics a 13-year-old girl would and should be," he said.Referring to letters found after Milly's death in which she said she was a disappointment, Altman said parents knew that growing up at that age could be "challenging", but Milly was not a "dark or depressive person".Witnesses had described how Milly was "very close to her family" and had "a very happy life".
