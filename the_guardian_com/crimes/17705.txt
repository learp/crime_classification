Ian Huntley was today given two life sentences after being convicted by an Old Bailey jury of murdering Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.Huntley's co-accused and former girlfriend, Maxine Carr, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail after being found guilty of conspiring with Huntley to pervert the course of justice. She was cleared of two counts of assisting an offender in relation to the murder of the girls.As he handed down the sentences, the trial judge, Mr Justice Moses, told Huntley: "You murdered them both. You were the only person who knows how you murdered them ... In your lies and manipulation up to this very day you have increased the suffering you have caused the two families." Carr, 26, who worked with Huntley's victims as a teaching assistant, admitted lying to protect her lover of three years. She claimed she was unaware of his crime, denying a charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two counts of assisting an offender.Addressing her, the judge said: "You had plenty of opportunity to refuse to persist in a course of lying and deception. You chose not to. If you had the slightest true regard for those girls or their families you would have told the truth." The jury of seven women and five men returned 11-1 majority decisions on the guilty verdicts after 17 hours of deliberation. The parents of the murdered girls, Leslie Chapman, 52, and his wife Sharon, 44, and Nicola Wells, 36, and her husband Kevin, 40, were in court to hear the verdicts.The jurors rejected 29-year-old Huntley's testimony that the schoolgirls died accidentally at his home, 5 College Close, in Soham on August 4 last year.Huntley, the caretaker at Soham Village College at the time of the murders, told the court that the 10-year-olds went inside the college-owned three-bedroom detached house because Holly had a nosebleed.He tried to convince the jury during more than two days in the witness box that Holly had slipped into the bath and drowned, and that he killed Jessica when he placed his hand over her mouth to silence her screams. The jurors knew Huntley had once been charged with raping a teenager - a charge that was later dropped. But it emerged today that he had also been accused of indecently assaulting an 11-year-old and having sex with other schoolgirls in his native Grimsby, allegations that could not be revealed during the course of the trial.Huntley was investigated eight timesVetting inquiry announcedAs the sordid details of Huntley's background began to emerge in the aftermath of the trial, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced an inquiry into how Huntley - with a history of targeting under-age girls - managed to slip through police and local authority vetting to secure a job as a school caretaker.Vetting blunders let Huntley slip through net Indeed, Cambridgeshire detectives investigating the girls' disappearance found out about the rape charge from a call from a member of the public and not from their counterparts at Humberside police, who had been asked to check his background. Later today, the chief constable of Humberside Police, David Westwood, apologised for "weaknesses in the system" and "individual failings" in the way intelligence on Huntley was handled.Such failings have highlighted serious flaws in the way large investigations are run, and are likely to increase support for an FBI-style force that would be brought in to take over the most high profile inquiries.Soham case strengthens call for FBI-style forceGirls' parents speak of reliefNevertheless, the officer who led the Soham murder inquiry welcomed the verdict and praised the efforts of his team and of the victims' families in bringing Huntley and Carr to justice.In a statement given outside the Old Bailey, temporary Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Stevenson said: "As a result of one of the most comprehensive and painstaking investigations ever mounted by Cambridgeshire police, Huntley was pushed further and further into a corner by the power and extent of the evidence against him."Holly's father, Kevin Wells, said the outcome of the trial had provided a "great sense of relief, but no euphoria".He told journalists that the couples had not had a "cessation of their fears" that Huntley would evade justice until they heard today's verdicts.Mr Wells thanked the Cambridgeshire constabulary and the people of Soham for their support during their 16-month ordeal, adding that the Cambridgeshire family liaison officers had made the couples' "journey a wee bit more bearable". He also paid tribute to the "minimal intrusion" they had experienced from the media.Mr Chapman thanked the trial judge, Mr Justice Moses, and the 12 jurors for their part in Huntley and Carr's convictions, describing Huntley as "a time bomb ready to go off ... our girls were just in the wrong place at the wrong time".
