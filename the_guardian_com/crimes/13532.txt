More than five years after the Metropolitan police force was branded "institutionally racist", less than half its staff believe it treats people from different ethnic backgrounds equally.A survey of officers and civilian staff published yesterday revealed that only 49% agreed that it "treats people equally regardless of their ethnicity". The survey also revealed that large numbers of Met officers believe they are under-trained, under-equipped and under-appreciated. Questionnaires were sent to all the Met's 43,359 officers and staff by the Work Foundation for the independent Morris inquiry, led by the former Transport and General union leader Sir Bill Morris, which is looking at professional standards and employment issues including racial bias. A total of 15,616 forms were returned, although the Work Foundation said many more would have been completed had they not been delivered late by the force's internal communications system. After extensive efforts by the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, 45% agreed that "diversity has become part of the culture of the Met rather than something that needs to be consciously thought about". But there was also a belief that the force was focusing too heavily on ethnic diversity rather than discrimination against women, the disabled or gay staff. Only 33% thought the balance was right, while 38% disagreed. The Met said it was not surprised by the results. "However, the results need to be viewed against an organisation where record numbers of people are queuing to join, fewer people than ever are leaving, police sickness is at an all time low and, most importantly, we are delivering across the board in reducing and solving crime," it said.
