An "aimless" teenager who battered his 10-year-old neighbour to death was jailed for life at Liverpool crown court today.Kieron Smith was told he would serve at least 15 years for the murder of Lauren Pilkington-Smith in woodland near their homes in Leigh, Greater Manchester, last July.Mr Justice Mackay told 18-year-old Smith - who was last month found guilty of the killing in a unanimous verdict - that he had abused the trust of his victim, who viewed him as a friend.He said Smith, who dropped out of school at 13, had led an "aimless life" and had taken away "a gem of a girl". The teenager has failed to give any explanation for attacking her. "You led an empty and aimless life and did nothing to fill your days," the judge said. "Therefore, in social and developmental terms you were an immature young man, but you knew full well how to behave, how to behave with younger children, and you knew what you did that day was wicked beyond belief. "Lauren was vulnerable because she would never have dreamt of going into those woods with a person she didn't know and trust. She viewed you as her friend and playmate and you abused that trust and confidence she placed in you."The two-week trial heard Smith had joined Laura and some younger boys for a game of cricket on the night of the murder. He insisted to police that he had gone home for tea after the game, but eyewitness reports of his movements and droplets of Lauren's blood on his trainers gave him away.The trial heard Smith had half-stripped Lauren's body after the murder, stuffing a sock in her mouth and two twigs up her nostrils. There was no evidence of sexual assault, and police believe his motives will remain unexplained.
