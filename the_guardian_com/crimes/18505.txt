The "wealth obsessed" armed robber who murdered city financier John Monckton on his doorstep as he fought to protect his family was given three life sentences at the Old Bailey yesterday.Damien Hanson, 24, was told he will spend at least 36 years in prison after being convicted of murder, attempted murder and robbery. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith told an impassive Hanson that he clearly intended to kill both Mr Monckton and his wife, Homeyra, during the attack in November 2004."By the time you left with your booty both Mr and Mrs Monckton had collapsed and were close to death," he said. "Mr Monckton did not recover."The judge told Hanson - known as "666 Devil's Child" - he could find no mitigating elements to what he had done, "save for your comparative youth".Hanson's accomplice Elliott White, 24, was sentenced to 18 years for his part in the robbery and subsequent attacks.The judge told White: "There is nothing to suggest that if you had not fallen in with a very, very dangerous individual that you would have become involved in such serious offending. But that said, you went into this with your eyes open."White admitted robbery but was convicted of Mr Monckton's manslaughter and of wounding Mrs Monckton with intent. All verdicts were reached at the end of a three-week trial last December.After sentencing, the judge commended the police and the bravery of Mrs Monckton and her daughter Isobel, 10, who witnessed some of the attack. He expressed the hope that "the outcome of this trial will assist them in the rebuilding of their lives".White and Hanson were convicted after their trial heard how in November 2004 they tricked their way into the home of John Monckton, 49, managing director (bonds) of the insurers Legal and General, by pretending to be postal delivery men. Although Mr Monckton immediately realised he had made a mistake and fought to keep the robbers out, he and his wife were overpowered in what was described as "every householder's nightmare".Hanson, the "prime mover" targeted Mrs Monckton after seeing her wearing expensive jewellery in a store in Chelsea. Police found he had been surfing the internet and conducting newspaper research to find wealthy victims.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, has ordered an inquiry into the circumstances that led to Hanson, who has previous convictions for violence, including attempted murder, being released early from jail without adequate supervision.
