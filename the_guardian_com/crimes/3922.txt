The minimum prison sentence for knife killers will be increased from 15 to 25 years, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, said today.Straw's statement followed a review ordered amid public anger at the sentences handed out to the murderers of 16-year-old Ben Kinsella.The justice secretary said he was writing to the Kinsella family to tell them the outcome.He told the Commons that the changes would be discussed in parliament before Christmas."The loss of a loved one in any circumstances is heartbreaking, and even more so when they are the victim of a senseless and appalling murder," he said."It is only right that thugs who carry knives with the intention of using them, potentially to kill should the opportunity arise, go to prison for a long time."Straw said that was why he had ordered the review of the minimum jail term for knife killings."It is why ... I am announcing that anyone who kills using a knife, a knife that they had earmarked for this purpose, should go to jail for a minimum of 25 years," he added."I am determined to do everything in my power to tackle the menace of knife crime on our streets. The government is very clear that, if someone is caught carrying a knife, there will be serious consequences."The review looked at bringing laws for knife killers in line with those for gun killers, who face minimum sentences of 30 years.When the measures announced today become law, judges will use 25 years as the starting point for deciding what sentence to hand down.Ben, the brother of the former EastEnders actor Brooke Kinsella, was murdered in Islington, north London, last summer while out celebrating the end of his GCSEs.His killers, Juress Kika, 19, 18-year-old Michael Alleyne and Jade Braithwaite, 20, were given minimum sentences of 19 years at the Old Bailey in June.Afterwards, the Kinsella family said the terms were "simply not enough".The Islington South and Finsbury Labour MP, Emily Thornberry, welcomed the news on behalf of Ben's parents."On their behalf, and on the behalf of the people of Islington, can I take this opportunity to thank you for your statement today," she told Straw.The justice secretary said that, under the 2003 Criminal Justice Act, there was a minimum starting point tariff for adults of 15 years."There was, in the light of the Kinsella murder and the sentences, understandable concern raised about the fact that this starting point for murders, where people had gone out with a knife with the intention to commit a serious crime, was too low," he added.
