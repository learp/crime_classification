The chief inspector of prisons is to include the case of a man who killed himself while on suicide watch in a review of inmates' treatment at segregation units.Anne Owers, the chief inspector, told Pauline Day in a personal letter that although nothing could bring back her son Paul, she hoped the review, expected later this year, might "save lives in the future". Mr Day, 31, from Basildon, Essex, was found hanged in his cell in October 2002 in the segregation unit of Frankland prison, Durham. He was a police informer serving eight years for robbery and had been on a dirty protest, smearing his cell with his faeces. An inquest jury found last week that he had been driven to take his own life because the staff did nothing to stop other inmates verbally abusing him. Ms Owers said in her letter: "We will follow up the inquest findings, and the Prison Service's response, both in our inspections of individual prisons and in that thematic review. I very much hope that this may save lives in future." Mrs Day said yesterday that she was elated by the letter. "We made our minds up almost from the day Paul died that someone somewhere had to campaign to make everyone... aware that segregation units are prisons within prisons. They are... punishment blocks."
