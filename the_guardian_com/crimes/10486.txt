The parents of an 11-year-old boy knocked down and killed by a mentally ill woman said today they had forgiven her, after she was detained indefinitely in a secure hospital.Hannah Saaf, 28, was high on cannabis and travelling at more than twice the 30mph speed limit when she hit Sam Riddall in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on 1 May.She fled the scene, and a nine-day police hunt ended when officers tracked her down to a field in Somerset. She pleaded guilty in September to causing death by dangerous driving.Sam's father, Martin Riddall, said outside Bristol crown court after the sentencing: "In four days' time, we celebrate Christmas, and it's going to be our first Christmas without our Sam. It is going to be very hard for us indeed, because we still miss him very much."At Christmas, we remember that God sent his son, Jesus, into the world to bring peace. It is the same God that is giving us the strength and helping us to forgive Hannah for the terrible thing she has done to us by killing our son. It's not easy; it's not going to be easy. But with God's help, we know that it is possible."The prosecutor, Robin Shellard, said an accident investigation concluded that Saaf had been driving at 61mph when she hit the brakes. He said the DVLA had revoked Saaf's licence over concerns about her mental health in February, and between February 2008 and April 2009 she had been detained under the Mental Health Act and discharged four times.He went on: "After the crash, Hannah Saaf disappeared. She was located in countryside south of Bristol. At the police station, she sat down and burst into tears and said, 'I've stolen a life.'"The judge, Simon Darwall-Smith, said Saaf would have received "a very substantial custodial sentence" but for her mental state. "You were not permitted to drive at all. You were clearly under the influence of cannabis, and you were doing so while driving twice the speed limit allowed. Finally, you left the scene having killed the victim," he said.
