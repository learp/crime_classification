Efforts to save the lives of victims of the 7/7 bombings were hampered by a shortage of first aid equipment, firefighters said today.The fire crews sent to the tube train bombing at Aldgate station in east London lacked stretchers and ran out of basic medical supplies such as bandages, the inquest for the 52 victims of the attacks heard.One firefighter recalled how he "watched a young man die" before medics reached the devastated carriage.Neil Walker said he believed Richard Ellery was less in need of help than other seriously injured passengers because the 21-year-old shopworker was able to tell him his name.But Ellery, from Ipswich, Suffolk, died shortly afterwards while rescuers were waiting for a stretcher to remove him from the train, the inquest heard.Walker said: "I was pretty shocked about that because I had recently spoken to him. It was quite an awful moment, as you can imagine."Suicide bomber Shehzad Tanweer detonated his device on an eastbound Circle line train at Aldgate at about 8.50am on 7 July 2005, killing Ellery and six others.Walker, who was on duty at Bethnal Green fire station in east London that morning, said he and his colleagues were "very under-equipped", having only small first aid kits containing a "minimal amount" of bandages, which were used up "very, very quickly". He had to use his breathing apparatus, designed for entering smoke-filled buildings, to give oxygen to severely wounded passenger Kira Mason because no resuscitator was available.Also giving evidence at the inquest today was a retired firefighter who launched an attack on the health and safety culture of the fire service.Stephen Foster, who in 2005 was a firefighter at Dockhead fire station in south-east London with 25 years experience, had to wait to go into the tube tunnel at Aldgate because of rules about ensuring the power to the tracks was switched off.He said: "The majority of firefighters have been brought up in a health and safety environment. If we go against that health and safety, we could actually be cutting our own throats, we could be charged. The powers that be that run the fire service set down plans, we don't tend to bend from those plans."There are others, mavericks, of which I would classify myself as one, who just turned around at the end of it and said, 'Oh, stuff this, let's get on and do the job we get paid for'. It wasn't long before I got the hump and walked along the track with my crew."Christopher Coltart, counsel for seven of the bereaved families, asked him: "To what extent did you feel that you were hampered in your actions on that day by the lack of equipment available to you?"Foster replied: "I wouldn't say it would have saved some people."But having the right equipment or having the equipment which should have been available, and having it in your hands to use, may have saved some distress."The co-ordinated attacks on three tube trains and a bus launched on 7 July 2005 by four suicide bombers were the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil.The hearing at the royal courts of justice in central London continues.
