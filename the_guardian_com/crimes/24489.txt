Detectives hunting the killer of the Bristol landscape architect Joanna Yeates are continuing to question a 32-year-old man on suspicion of her murder.Police refused to name the suspect but a search of the flat next to hers, where 32-year architectural engineer Vincent Tabak lives, carried on for a second day. Officers will be able to detain the man until late tomorrow evening after a magistrate today gave them permission.Officers were at another address in Bristol where Tabak is thought to have been staying in recent weeks. Neighbours of Tabak, a Dutch national, and Yeates said they believed he had been spoken to by police early on in the investigation. They believed he may then have left the UK for some time over Christmas and new year.In a separate development Avon and Somerset police refused to comment on reports that DNA samples were recovered from beneath Yeates's clothing. If true, such a finding suggests Yeates, 25, may have been sexually assaulted.Police had previously said that while there was no evidence she had been sexually assaulted, there may have been a sexual motive behind the attack.In recent weeks police have carefully limited the flow of information about the case. The force was alarmed by the media frenzy that followed their first arrest, that of Yeates's landlord Chris Jefferies.Tabak, who works in Bath, was born near Eindhoven and moved into the garden flat next to Yeates after living in a Georgian terraced house in Bath.Yeates went missing on 17 December after leaving a pub in Bristol. Her body was found on a roadside verge on Christmas morning. She had been strangled.
