A man accused of murdering three sex workers in Bradford identified himself in court today as "Crossbow Cannibal".Stephen Griffiths, 40, is accused of killing Suzanne Blamires, Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth, who all went missing in Bradford over the last 10 months.When asked for his name in a five-minute appearance before magistrates, he replied clearly: "Crossbow Cannibal."The clerk at Bradford magistrates court, Amarjit Soor, asked Griffiths for his address. "Here, I guess," he replied.Asked to confirm his date of birth, 24 December 1969, he said: "Yeah."Griffiths, who was unshaven with short dark hair, was handcuffed in the glass-fronted dock and accompanied by three security guards.Wearing a black shirt over a white T-shirt and dark blue jeans, he kept his head bowed throughout the hearing and fidgeted and picked at his hands. No pleas were entered.The charges are that he murdered Blamires, 36, between May 20 and 25 this year; Rushworth, 43, who has been missing since June 2009; and Armitage, 31, who disappeared in April.Several of the victims' family members were in court, accompanied by police family liaison officers, and some of them stared intently at Griffiths throughout the hearing. The Blamires family chose not to attend.The case is being fast-tracked and Griffiths was remanded in custody to appear before Bradford crown court at 2.15pm today.Last night, Blamires' mother, Nicky, 55, described her daughter as bright and articulate. She had attended college and wanted to be a nurse. Unfortunately her daughter "went down the wrong path and did not have the life she was meant to have", she said.Griffiths lived in a third-floor flat in Thornton Road, in the heart of Bradford's red-light district. He attended the private Queen Elizabeth Grammar school in Wakefield and had recently been studying for a PhD in criminology at Bradford University.Officers believe the body parts found earlier this week in the River Aire, at Shipley, all belong to Blamires.They are continuing to search for the bodies of Rushworth and Armitage.Dozens of police teams were at work today at a range of locations across Bradford. Much of the activity is focused on the city's red-light district.Many alleyways and streets in the Sunbridge Road area remained sealed off as officers conducted fingertip searches.Sniffer dogs were being used in a number of locations, and officers have been seen taking away a large number of objects in plastic bags.David Cameron described the Bradford murders as a "terrible shock", adding that problems of street prostitution and drug abuse needed to be dealt with.The prime minister said the issue of decriminalising prostitution should be looked at again but it would not be wise to jump to conclusions."I just hope that the police do everything they can to make sure this case goes to court as fast as possible so people feel they can start to rebuild their lives all over again but I recognise what a terrible shock it is for everyone," he said.
