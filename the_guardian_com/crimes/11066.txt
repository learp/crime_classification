The disgraced former MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce, will be sentenced on Monday, the Crown Prosecution Service has announced. The pair are both facing jail terms at the hearing at Southwark crown court at 2pm.On Thursday a jury found Pryce guilty of perverting the course of justice, by taking speeding points for Huhne in 2003. The former energy secretary had already pleaded guilty to the charge.Perverting the course of justice carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, although the average sentence is around 10 months. Both Huhne, 58, and economist Pryce, 60, have been warned to be under no illusion about what punishment they face.The fallout from the case continued on Friday as Nick Clegg denied that any senior Liberal Democrat figures knew about the points-swapping story before it appeared in the press in May 2011.Emails between Pryce and the Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott, revealed to the jury during the trial, suggested that figures including Clegg's wife, Miriam Gonz치lez Dur치ntez, the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the peer Lord Oakeshott, who is a distant relative of Isabel Oakeshott, knew about the scandal before it became public.In one email, Pryce said she had told Cable and his wife, Rachel, over supper. "They were horrified at the time but VC has probably forgotten it by now. He was v tired that night," Pryce wrote.On Friday, Clegg's office said it had checked with all party figures named in the Pryce emails and established that none of them was told about the speeding points before the story appeared in the press. The party was not aware of any Lib Dem peers who knew about the points, a spokesman added."Vicky Pryce did not talk to anyone in Nick Clegg's office about the speeding points. The first Nick knew of the Vicky Pryce speeding points allegations was from the media."In a statement on Thursday, Gonz치lez Dur치ntez said: "I have never ever been told by Vicky or anybody else about the traffic points story. I got to know about this when everybody else did."A spokesman for Cable said: "Vince and [his wife] Rachel have no recollection of the issue of points being raised with them over the course of dinner with Vicky Pryce on January 28 2011."They have consulted their personal records, which confirm that the issue first came to their attention in May 2011 when the story broke in the press."
