Ofcom has told broadcasters including ITV and the BBC to learn lessons after they aired graphic coverage of soldier Lee Rigby's murder, including warning about the "looping" of explicit mobile phone footage of one of the attackers.The media regulator has officially cleared nine news and current affairs broadcasters – including ITV News, BBC News and Sky News - after investigating almost 700 complaints about coverage of the Woolwich attack in May.Ofcom said that in this case the explicit material was "justified by the context" due to the "significance of the right to freedom of expression in this case because news programming has a duty to inform the public".However, Ofcom also used the 30-page ruling published on Monday to warn broadcasters after becoming concerned about a "few aspects of some news coverage" of the incident during its investigation.The media regulator highlighted concerns over regional news bulletin ITV London Tonight showing a graphic mobile phone sequence of one of the murderers with a machete and blood on his hands four times on a "loop", without audio and without being preceded by a specific warning."We were concerned about the repetition of the same material four times without audio, particularly as this was the first time this material was shown on UK television and no warning had been given beforehand," said Ofcom.The media regulator said it recognised ITV News's desire to make the most of the exclusive and "powerful" material, but also cautioned against the "gratuitous" airing of explicit footage."Ofcom urges news broadcasters always to consider giving explicit warnings before broadcasting challenging material before the watershed, and not repeating potentially offensive material in a way that some may perceive as gratuitous."Ofcom was also concerned by BBC4's 7pm World News Today bulletin, which said that as it opts into footage from BBC World News, the corporation's 24-hour rolling news channel aimed at an international audience, it therefore "cannot be tailored to suit any one time zone in terms of compliance"."Whatever a broadcaster's scheduling arrangements, it must (as the BBC recognises) ensure compliance with the [broadcasting] code at all times," said Ofcom, which added that the BBC4 news programme should also have included an explicit warning before airing the footage."We note that World News Today's compliance procedures have been revised to take into account the need for audience warnings as appropriate when the programme is broadcast," said Ofcom.The media regulator also offered specific guidance to news channel al-Jazeera and radio station LBC.Al-Jazeera News failed to air a warning ahead of broadcasting the Woolwich footage.London radio station LBC also failed to warn listeners before broadcasting a "fairly graphic" account of the killing from an eyewitness.Overall Ofcom cleared nine news broadcasters and programmes – the Iain Dale Show on LBC, ITV's London Tonight, Channel 5 News, ITV News, Channel 4 News, the BBC News Channel, BBC4's World News Today, Sky News and al-Jazeera News."We considered we should take particular note of the significance of the right to freedom of expression in this case because news programming has a duty to inform the public as fully as possible when incidents such as this occur," said Ofcom."We concluded that all of the programmes investigated ensured that the broadcast material that might have caused offence was justified by the context and that the broadcasters therefore applied generally accepted standards."• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
