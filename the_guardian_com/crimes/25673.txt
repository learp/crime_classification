The sisters of murdered Belfast man Robert McCartney today accused the IRA and Sinn Féin of failing to break the "climate of fear" that has prevented his killer from being brought to justice.Speaking after the acquittal of the only man accused of murdering the 33-year-old father of two outside a central Belfast pub three years ago, Catherine McCartney challenged Sinn Féin to "start cooperating with the police" on the case.The political party defended itself saying it had always supported the dead man's family and had urged witnesses to speak to the police.Mr Justice Gillen cleared Terence Malachy Davidson, 51, of murdering McCartney after he allegedly refused to apologise for making a rude gesture to Davidson's wife. He was also acquitted of two counts of affray.The judge at Laganside courthouse, a block away from Magennis's bar where the fight began, cast doubt over the evidence given by a key witness known as 'C'. "I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the witness's evidence was reliable," the judge said. He went on to praise 'witness C' for being "transparently honest".McCartney, 33, was stabbed and beaten to death by a mob of at least 12 men, the majority of them IRA members, outside the city centre bar in January 2005.Brendan Devine, a friend of McCartney, was slashed across his throat and from chest to navel.McCartney's four sisters and fiancée campaigned to bring those responsible to trial. They met the US president, George Bush, at the White House, as part of their international campaign to demand that Sinn Féin members came forward as witnesses.The McCartney sisters stormed out of Belfast crown court before the judge delivered his verdict in protest at the press being giving an early copy of the judgment.Speaking outside the court, Catherine McCartney flanked by her sister Paula said they had "borne a cross for three years and we will continue to bear that cross".'People can still come forward. The police have plenty of intelligence but they lack the evidence to back that up. While the fear still exists we are not going to get justice. In this new dispensation Sinn Féin say they are cooperating with the police but in the case I would like to say there is no evidence of that," she said.Co-accused James McCormick, 39, and Joseph Fitzpatrick, 47, were also found not guilty of affray. Fitzpatrick was acquitted on a further charge of assault.'Witness C', a female driver, told the opening day of the trial that she saw McCartney being chased down a road by a number of men. One of them, who she identified as Davison, made a number of swiping movements at McCartney's chest and then kicked him when he fell to the ground.The judge today cited inconsistencies between how the witness described the alleged attacker's hair and also her inability to identify a weapon.The judge said at the end of his 74-page judgment: "I recognise that the family of Mr McCartney and others who held him dear will be frustrated and disappointed that whoever it was who cut this young man down in the prime of his life has or have not been brought to justice."The judge, who sat without a jury, continued: "However, the memory of Mr McCartney and the rule of law itself would be ill-served by this court failing to observe the high standards of criminal justice and the burden of proof which prevail in courts in Northern Ireland.""The law is not a feather for every wind that blows and the need to ensure that defendants are found guilty only if there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be sacrificed to genuine and justifiable public concern that miscreants should be brought to justice."The judge warned the three acquitted men that they could yet be brought back to court if more evidence emerges."I have no doubt that the investigation into this crime will continue and if new evidence emerges in connection with this murder no one, including for that matter even the accused in this trial, will be beyond the reach of potential prosecution," he said.The judge went in detail through the 19 days of evidence he heard about the events on January 30 2005.None of the defendants entered the witness box during the trial and the judge ignored a suggestion from the Crown that he should draw adverse implications from that.Sinn Féin and the IRA have always denied the sisters' claims that they were preventing witnesses coming forward, although the IRA offered to "shoot" a number of people in connection with McCartney's death.A Sinn Fein spokesman said: "The murder of Robert McCartney was a brutal act which was widely and deservedly condemned. Sinn Fein has consistently supported the McCartney family in their campaign for justice. We have urged people with any information to bring it forward to the PSNI and will continue to do so. "It is clear from both the trial evidence and statements from the police that a large number of witnesses have come forward. This is a criminal matter which needs to be dealt with by the police and the courts."
