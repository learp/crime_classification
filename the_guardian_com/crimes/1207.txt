There will not be a second inquiry into how broadcaster Stuart Hall was able to abuse his victims while working at the BBC, the chairman of the corporation's trust has said.Lord Patten said instead a review by Dame Janet Smith into the Jimmy Savile scandal would also investigate how Hall – who has admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls during the 1960s, 70s and 80s – gained access to his victims.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Patten said the BBC was also likely to face compensation claims from Hall's victimsThe chairman said: "I think to set up a new inquiry, when there is already one which is extremely well-resourced operating, would probably delay arriving at the truth. If we need to do more, we will."Asked by guest presenter Jeremy Vine whether the BBC would be liable to pay compensation to the victims, Patten added: "I imagine so, but that will be a matter for the lawyers and conceivably the courts."I think it would be incredible to be able to do that [estimate the cost of compensation] now because first of all what needs to happen is that we need to be able to get a grip on what happened and of course, in the meantime, co-operate with the police."It's a different case from the Savile case because the main person who is alleged to have committed these crimes – who has committed these crimes, he has owned up to some of them – is actually alive."He also shrugged off criticism from the former BBC director general Greg Dyke, who on Sunday described the chairman of the trust as a "lame duck".Patten added: "If Greg Dyke was doing an interview on flower arranging he would find a way to turn it into an attack on me."It's worth remembering that he presided over the BBC at the last big crisis and as a result we have the present system of governance of the BBC, which has completely changed because of the Greg Dyke business."Hall, who may now face jail, was described as an "opportunistic predator" after he appeared at Preston crown court on Thursday.Judge Anthony Russell QC granted him bail on condition of residence at his home address and no unsupervised contact with children.
