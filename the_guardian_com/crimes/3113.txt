A young mother was recovering yesterday after two men armed with a knife and a wooden club broke into her bedroom at 2am, only to apologise and say they had targeted the wrong house.The pair then left quietly before breaking into the woman's neighbours' home and attacking a young man who was left with head injuries. An underworld feud or quarrel about drugs are among motives being examined for the attack by South Yorkshire police, who cordoned off the scene at Swinton, South Yorkshire, yesterday. Forensic teams are checking both properties while the woman, who has two small children, recovers from severe shock. A police spokesman said the men, both wearing high-visibility work vests, forced open the back door to her house at 2am on Monday and ran upstairs to the bedroom where she was sleeping with the children. One held a knife and the other a crude club made from a wooden plank. "But it soon became obvious that the intruders had got the wrong address and they left, apologising," the spokesman said. "No threats were made, although the woman was left in a distressed state." The men then went next door in Station Street, near the centre of the small town near Rotherham. "Inside the premises a 23-year-old male was assaulted and he required hospital treatment for head injuries," the spokesman said. Other occupants fled unscathed to raise the alarm and the attackers left hastily. Both were white and in their 20s and, in their reflective vests, made no attempt to be inconspicuous. The woman is said by police to have been "absolutely terrified" at the time of the attack but is making a good recovery.
