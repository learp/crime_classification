A retired teacher seeking compensation from a serial rapist who won £7m on the lottery took her battle to the House of Lords yesterday.Iorworth Hoare attacked the 78-year-old, named only as Mrs A, 19 years ago. She tried to sue him after he won the lottery in 2004, but was barred by a law which says that claims for damages must be brought within six years of the attack.Mrs A is seeking compensation for psychiatric injury caused by the "violent and disgusting" attempted rape. She was 59 when Hoare - who had subjected six other women to serious sexual assaults, including rape - attacked her as she walked in Roundhay Park, Leeds, in February 1988.She says she still suffers from nightmares and claims the attack destroyed her self-esteem, wrecked her relationships and ruined her life. Hoare, 58, had not been worth suing until he won £7m on Lotto Extra. He was jailed for life in 1989 and spent 16 years in prison before buying the lottery ticket while on day release. He was released in 2005 and is reported to live in a £700,000 house near Newcastle.Mrs A lost her case in the high court and court of appeal, and was ordered to pay's Hoare's £100,000 legal costs. She received just £5,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.She was not in court yesterday but said in a statement: "I've never doubted that I'm doing the right thing on behalf of myself and hopefully many others." Alan Newman QC, representing Mrs A, told the law lords that no action had been brought earlier because of Hoare's frequent prison sentences, which meant he could never meet any judgment for damages. The hearing continues on Monday.
