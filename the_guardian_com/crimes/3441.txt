The home secretary, John Reid, chaired a crisis meeting on knife crime today at the same time as the funeral of a special constable stabbed to death outside her home was held.The internal Home Office meeting was expected to look, among other things, at the possibility of increasing the maximum sentence for carrying a knife to five years.Under current guidelines governing offensive weapons, judges can sentence offenders to a maximum of four years for possession of a knife in a public place "without lawful authority or excuse".According to newspaper reports, the home secretary is considering strengthening the penalties in a late amendment to the violent crime reduction bill as it goes through the House of Lords.The bill already includes raising the minimum age for buying a knife from 16 to 18 and creating an offence of using another person to "mind a weapon".But a spokesman for the Home Office denied that a decision had been made on increasing sentences and told Guardian Unlimited: "We keep the penalties governing offensive weapons under constant review."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, today accused Mr Reid of deliberately distancing himself from the story about tougher penalties after deliberately placing it in the press.He said: "The approach of spinning a story to the media in the evening to get headlines and then backing away from it in the morning is becoming a John Reid trademark."A Conservative amendment to the violent crime reduction bill, which would have introduced tougher sentences for knife possession, was rejected by the government last year.The Conservatives said the current distinction between a bladed article" such as a kitchen knife, which carries a two-year maximum, and an "offensive weapon" such as a flick-knife, which carries four years, were unhelpful.A spokesman told Guardian Unlimited: "People are carrying kitchen knives in the knowledge that penalties are much lower. If you tighten up the law, that sends a signal that possession of household knives is just as serious as carrying a so-called offensive weapon."The government's crisis meeting comes hours before the funeral of Mrs Patel-Nasri, which will be held in Golders Green, north London, this afternoon.The 29-year-old was stabbed in the leg outside her home in Wembley, north London, three weeks ago today after going to investigate a disturbance.The meeting also comes nine days into a nationwide knife amnesty - the first since 1995 - which will run until June 30. Scotland Yard said 360 weapons have already been handed in.The amnesty has turned the spotlight on knife crime and coincides with a series of stabbings in the UK over the past month.The murder of Mrs Patel-Nasri was followed by the killing of Kiyan Prince, 15, outside his north London school on May 18.On Saturday, Thomas Grant, 19, a university student was stabbed to death onboard a train in Cumbria and on Tuesday Barry Wilson, 29, was murdered on the doorstep of his home in Bristol on Tuesday afternoon.Detectives were today investigating the stabbing of a 19-year-old man in a busy shopping centre in Wood Green, north London, yesterday afternoon.The shop assistant, who has not been named, was stabbed in a staff area on the first floor of Wood Green Shopping City at around 5.15pm yesterday.Shopping centre staff told Guardian Unlimited that the man was stabbed after chasing a shoplifter from the men's clothing store where he worked into one of the corridors leading to delivery areas.The shopping centre was cordoned off overnight but reopened to the public at around 11am this morning. The man is in a stable condition in hospital.Scotland Yard said the attack followed an altercation between the victim and three men. No arrests have been made.An accurate picture of whether knife crime is actually increasing or decreasing is hard to gauge because the Home Office does not collate statistics specifically on knife crime.Instead, incidents are recorded by police on the basis of the charge, such as murder, wounding or grievous bodily harm.Figures from the latest British Crime Survey, based on interviews with the public, show that violent crime overall has declined by 43% since 1995.Senior police officers say there is no evidence to suggest an upsurge in knife crime, though it remains a significant problem.* Anyone with information about the Wood Green stabbing is asked to call the incident room on 020 8345 0806 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
