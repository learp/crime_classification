The jury trying Sion Jenkins for the murder of his teenage foster daughter Billie-Jo was told today that the trial judge would accept a majority verdict.Mr Jenkins, 48, a former deputy head teacher, denies murdering the 13-year-old in February 1997. She was battered over the head at least 10 times with an iron tent peg while painting patio doors at the family home in Hastings, East Sussex. Mr Jenkins, of Lymington, Hampshire, was jailed for life for Billie-Jo's murder following a trial in 1998. A retrial was later ordered following two appeals. Jurors failed to reach a verdict at the retrial at the Old Bailey in July last year, and a second retrial began at the same court three months ago.The jury of six men and six women in the current retrial retired on Monday to consider their verdict. Just after midday the judge, Mr Justice David Clarke, called them back into the courtroom and told them he would accept a 10-2 majority verdict.The trial continues.
