The alleged killer of two French students today admitted setting fire to the bedsit where they died, but claimed said it was only after his children had been threatened.Nigel Farmer told the Old Bailey he was not involved in the murders but was forced to commit the arson attack by the older brother of co-defendant Dano Sonnex.Farmer, 34, told jurors that Bernie Sonnex had in the past admitted killing three other people and getting away with it. "He said to me, 'Have you seen how much blood Dano had on him this morning?'" said Farmer. He claimed he was warned "that could be your kids' blood all over him" if he did not [set fire to the flat]. The conversation was alleged to have taken place in the hours following the murders of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, in New Cross, south London. They were stabbed a total of 244 times in what prosecutors have described as an "orgy of bloodletting" in June last year.Farmer described how he had gone into the flat and been caught up in a fireball after sprinkling petrol around and setting fire to it with a match. He said he was only in there for 30-40 seconds and had not seen the bodies of the students He claimed he was forced to help dump a knife in the Thames before being taken to a petrol station to fill two cans up with petrol. He said he had once overheard Bernie telling someone on the phone that he had killed three people in the past and when he asked him about it he had told him: "I have killed people and got away with every single one of them."Farmer said before handing himself in to police he went to stay with friends, and was terrified. "I hadn't slept for a week," he said. "I was paranoid about Bernie and Dano coming and doing me in."The trial continues tomorrow.
