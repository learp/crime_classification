He died in hospital on Sunday.On Tuesday, Duncan's widow, Claire, issued a statement through police: "We would like to thank all the medical staff at St George's hospital, Tooting, for their enormous efforts in attempting to save Andrew's life."We have had, and still are having, tremendous support from all Andrew's colleagues, family and friends. Our children, Adam, Emma, and myself are truly grateful."Andrew was a fantastic husband, father, son and brother. This is supported by the many tributes which we are still receiving from his family and friends."We are left with a huge void in our lives, but we have some fantastic memories that we will always treasure."Andrew Duncan joined the Metropolitan police in 1990 and became a traffic officer in May 2004.Both the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, and the home secretary, Theresa May, have paid tribute to him.Hogan-Howe said on Sunday: "Andy was a hardworking and courageous policeman. He served the community as both a police officer and as a Scouting volunteer."The night he was injured, he was doing a job that he loved and we all had every right to expect he would return safely to his home and family – tragically that was not the case."We will continue to professionally and objectively investigate this incident under the oversight of Her Majesty's coroner."May will attend a service on Sunday to mark the 10th National Police Memorial Day, which remembers officers who die on duty.
