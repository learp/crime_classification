The goalkeeper hero of Liverpool's Champions League penalty shootout returned home after the match to find his luxury home on Merseyside had been burgled, it emerged yesterday.Pepe Reina, the Spanish player whose two saves on Tuesday night were enough to see his team edge past Chelsea to the final, lost jewellery, personal papers and a home entertainment system in the raid.His grey Porsche Cayenne was also taken and later found burned out in the West Derby area of Liverpool. Reina found a scene of chaos when he returned home shortly before 1am yesterday after celebrating the victory at Anfield.Reina was the toast of Liverpool supporters following the saves, which came after an equaliser by his team-mate Daniel Agger - whose own home in the Wirral, Cheshire, was burgled in September. Reina's wife, Yolanda, and their three-month-old daughter, Grecia, were understood to have been out at the time of the raid.Merseyside police said the thieves had taken a Bang and Olufsen entertainment system as well as rings, other jewellery and irreplaceable family letters and papers. Reina, 25, did not wish to comment yesterday.Burglaries of celebrity players have dogged the north-west of England in recent years. The home of Reina's predecessor, Jerzy Dudek, was burgled last June while he was on holiday in his native Poland. He also lost a Porsche and jewellery, as well as personal memorabilia.Liverpool striker Peter Crouch was targeted at his home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the same month. Everton winger Andy van der Meyde was burgled twice last year. Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney lost memorabilia when his parents' Liverpool home was burgled last July.In December, James Birch, 20, was jailed for two and a half years for the Dudek raid and seven other burglaries at Liverpool and Everton players' homes.
