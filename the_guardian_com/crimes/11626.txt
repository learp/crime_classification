The director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, last night attacked the courts' "continuing love affair with custody" and said the record 70,000 prison population was overwhelming the system."We cannot simply keep building ahead of this thirst for custody," he said last night in the latest of a series of Downing Street seminars. With Tony Blair at his side, Mr Narey said the need to bus people around the country to wherever a bed was available had contributed to four suicides in the past three days. "Persuade the courts to use custody only where custody might work. Simply removing those who get sentences of six months or less would reduce the population at a stroke by 6,500," he told the invited audience of 100 leading figures in the criminal justice system. The prime minister left at the end of the 40 minute speech, and Cherie Booth took a long question and answer session but expressed no personal views of her own. In his speech, Mr Narey said the prison service was managing the record prison population - but only just. Last night and every night 12,800 inmates were being held two to a cell. Part of the reason why prisons were bursting at the seams was judges' and magistrates' "continuing love affair with custody". The charge was rejected by Harry Mawdsley, chairman of the Magistrates Association, who claimed that only 4% of his members' cases ended with a custodial sentence.
