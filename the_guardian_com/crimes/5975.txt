A spiritualist minister was jailed for life today after being found guilty of murdering his makeup artist wife after she discovered he had been having an affair and calling gay chatlines.Sentencing David Chenery-Wickens, 51, to serve a minimum of 18 years, Mr Justice Cooke said the minister had preyed on vulnerable people whom he deceived into parting with money.Chenery-Wickens had repeatedly lied to his wife while he indulged his sexual appetite with other women and men and had been a "drain" on their marriage, which he described as a sham.Chenery-Wickens, of Duddleswell, near Uckfield in East Sussex, was found guilty of killing Diane Chenery-Wickens, his wife of 11 years, after she began to unravel his web of sexual and financial lies. During the six-week trial, he was exposed as a sexual predator and a compulsive liar who had had a string of affairs with several different women throughout his marriage, telling each of them that he was divorced, even though he was still living with his wife.He had managed to keep that part of his life secret. But when Diane Chenery-Wickens, 48, found a revealing phone bill and discovered he had been having an affair and calling gay chatlines, he killed her. The minister dumped her body in woodland in Little Horsted, near Uckfield, where it was discovered in a badly decomposed state by a dog walker four months later.The judge told him at Lewes crown court: "Whether it was a sudden loss of temper or in a controlled rage, you killed her, most probably by strangling her, though it's clear from the evidence that blood was spilt."You then disposed of the body either on that night or on the 23rd of January, knowing it was unlikely that it would be seen for a long time or ever."He described Chenery-Wickens's subsequent actions as an "elaborate charade" and said: "You have lied to all and sundry with ever changing stories and have continued to maintain the most preposterous lies to this jury."After killing his wife, Chenery-Wickens told a series of lies to family, friends and the police. Two days after her death, he told police and relatives that they had travelled together by train from East Grinstead station to London on 24 January last year so she could attend a BBC meeting at Shepherd's Bush.He said he had given her £1,000 in cash to deposit in her account, and had arranged to meet her later that afternoon at a hairdresser's, but she had failed to turn up.CCTV footage later revealed that Chenery-Wickens – who was ordained as a minister in the United Spiritualists in 2002 – had travelled to the capital alone, and the BBC had no record of a planned meeting. He then changed his story, telling police his wife had staged her own disappearance to escape financial and work troubles. He claimed to have sworn an oath of secrecy with his wife that he would not divulge details about her disappearance, which is why he had lied to police.During the trial, the jury heard from five women with whom Chenery-Wickens had conducted affairs.One, Susan Roberts, had been told that his wife was "neurotic" and had been detained in a mental hospital. Another, an opera singer, lent more than £21,000 to Chenery-Wickens, which he never repaid. An alternative therapist, known only as witness A, met Chenery-Wickens at meditation and astrology groups and said that he had told her he was divorcing his wife and they were selling their house – neither of which was true.Detective Chief Inspector Steve Johns, of Sussex police's major crime branch, said there had been many more victims of Chenery-Wickens's lies and seduction, but they had not been called to give evidence for fear of distracting the jury from the murder case.He said: "He was a charlatan who simply preyed on the vulnerable. They came across him at the wrong time at the wrong place. He told them what they wanted to hear."
