A couple who claimed £40,000 in benefits while sailing around the world on a luxury yacht were sent to prison today.Shashi Bacheta, 52, and Jeffrey Cole, 58, admitted 20 charges connected with the elaborate fraud, which took place over almost five years. Bacheta was jailed for 21 months at Swansea crown court, while Cole was jailed for nine months.Bacheta claimed she was so ill she could not even get out of bed, while in reality she was scuba diving in Kenya, swimming with dolphins in the Canary Islands and planning to carry on around the world on her lover's £100,000 yacht, the Kismet.Bacheta, a mother of three, was caught out when investigators tracked down the yacht on an internet blog site called smugmug.com. On the blog was a series of photographs of Bacheta and Cole lounging on the decks of the Kismet.The couple spent almost two years sailing the globe on the 70ft vessel while living off the proceeds of their post office and properties businesses. But they had other sources of income – by the end of the sailing trip she had claimed tens of thousands of pounds in housing benefits, disability living allowances, council tax relief and income support. Cole helped her to obtain some of the benefits, backing up her claims that they were not living together.Bacheta had admitted 16 offences of fraudulently claiming housing and council tax benefit, false accounting and obtaining money transfers by deception from the end of 2002 until the start of last year.Cole, her accomplice, admitted four charges including receiving cash by deception for Bacheta, false accounting and wrongfully obtaining credit.The fraud was exposed after they came across two former police officers in Gran Canaria who were also sailing the world. Months later, Jeffrey Fish, who investigated the couple on behalf of Swansea county council, found mention of Kismet on a blog kept by the retired police officers and a photograph showing Bacheta and Cole looking tanned in the Canaries.Fish said the picture contradicted Bacheta's claims that she was so ill she needed 24-hour care. "The photograph said it all," he said. She had also kept a log of her diving hours while in Mombasa.Bacheta's daughter Anju, 28, was fined £500 after admitting fraudulently claiming several hundred pounds for being her mother's carer.Judge Huw Davies QC gave Cole a lesser jail sentence because of the smaller amount of just over £13,000 he had jointly claimed with Bacheta over the period. The judge told him: "You were at the helm in a very real sense and set off to enjoy not only your own wealth but such money as you managed to get from public funds."When the couple were arrested in January last year after an 18-month Department of Work and Pensions and Swansea council investigation, they were planning a road trip across the US in a Volkswagen camper van.
