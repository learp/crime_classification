A 19-year-old man was today being questioned by detectives in connection with the death of a man who was run over while trying to stop a thief from stealing his car at Liverpool John Lennon airport.The teenager, from the Woolton area of Liverpool, was arrested at around 9pm yesterday, Merseyside police said. "Officers are still actively seeking others who may have been involved in the incident," a spokeswoman added.Michael Howard, 57, died after he was trapped beneath the wheels of his silver Volvo estate, from which he had been unloading luggage at 5.35am yesterday. His wife Elaine, who had got out of the car to fetch a trolley, watched in horror as the tragedy unfolded. Mr and Mrs Howard, from Preston, Lancashire, had been due to fly to the Spanish holiday resort of Malaga at 6.40am. In a statement issued through police, Mrs Howard said: "This was a happy time that we were really looking forward to. The people who have done this had no regard for Michael's safety or anyone else. "Michael was a much-loved husband and father, and we are completely devastated by what has happened." Mr Howard's children, Jonathan, David and Lisa, were comforting their mother at the family's home in the Hesketh Bank area of Preston. Police said that, when Mr Howard went to the boot of the car to unload the cases, a man jumped into the vehicle and tried to drive off.Mr Howard, who worked for Salford-based pharmaceutical company Mawdsley-Brooks, ran to the front of the vehicle to try to stop the theft, but was knocked down. When the Volvo stalled, the carjacker escaped in a waiting maroon Ford Escort which was later found abandoned around a mile from the airport. Mr Howard's neighbour John Hill described him as "a friendly, helpful family man", and added: "He was proud of his family and thought the world of them."
