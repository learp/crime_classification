Two men serving life for three gangland killings that became known as the "Essex boys murder" today lost appeals against their convictions.Michael Steele, 62, of Great Bentley, Essex, and 44-year-old Jack Whomes, of Brockford, Suffolk, were jailed for the 1995 murders of Patrick Tate, Anthony Tucker and Craig Rolfe.Lawyers for the two men argued fresh evidence showed that a crucial witness at their 1998 trial at the Old Bailey had a financial incentive for them to be found guilty.The witness, Darren Nicholls, had entered media arrangements - including a book, television and film deal - under which he would be paid for his story.However, three judges at the Court of Appeal in London today rejected the argument that the jury might have reached a different verdict had it known about the arrangements.The Crown denied allegations of a cover-up over the reliability of the witness, and police witnesses denied allegations they had helped the informant sell his story.Andrew Munday QC, for the Crown, said detailed statements from Nicholls had been taken and recorded in full before he met a reporter and literary agent.He said the fresh evidence that Nicholls had been able to make contacts with the media despite being in protective custody should not cause the court to find that the convictions were unsafe.The three victims were shot dead at point-blank range in a Range Rover on an isolated farm track at Rettendon, Essex, in December 1995. The prosecution said it was a gangland dispute over drugs.Steele and Whomes, along with Peter Corry, of Clacton, Essex, were also found guilty of conspiracy to import cannabis. Appeals by all three against the drug convictions were also dismissed today.Initial appeals by the three men were rejected some years, ago but the case was referred back to the court of appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice.The story of the murders got its "Essex Boys" name after a film, starring Sean Bean, was made about it.
