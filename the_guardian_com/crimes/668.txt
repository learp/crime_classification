Detectives hunting the killer of the American artist Margaret Muller yesterday appealed for the anonymous caller who gave the name of a suspect to ring again.The caller phoned Crimestoppers about three months ago with potentially vital clues and police hope the person will get back in touch in the run-up to the first anniversary of the murder next Tuesday. Detective Chief Superintendent Jon Shatford said: "There is every chance that the individual responsible for this attack has made some form of confession to someone in authority and we would appeal to anyone in the education, health or probation sectors to revisit their records and let us know of any suspicions they may have." Muller, 27, a student at Slade School of Fine Art, was stabbed to death while running in Victoria Park, Hackney, east London. There will be a memorial service in the park next Tuesday at 8.30am.
