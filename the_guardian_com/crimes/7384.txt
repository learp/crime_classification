The jurors reached their verdicts aided by the most technologically advanced prosecution ever mounted in a British court.Jurors usually retire at the end of a case lugging bundles of documents, maps and photographs. But the Soham panel was able to call up many crucial pieces of evidence stored on a single DVD using a laptop computer. The police officers and Crown Prosecution Service solicitors decided at an early stage, when it seemed the case would turn on complex forensic evidence, that they had to find a way of presenting masses of information in as clear a way as possible. They also wanted to ensure that a London jury unfamiliar with Soham was provided with as vivid a picture of the area as possible. Working with West Yorkshire police, acknowledged IT pioneers, Cambridgeshire detectives produced charts which summarised the complicated forensic evidence and detailed maps highlighting important sites in the case such as Soham village college and the spot where the girls' bodies were found. More ambitiously they produced three-dimensional reconstructions showing, for example, exactly how Ian Huntley might have placed the girls' partially burned clothes in the bin at the school. This information, together with the interviews Huntley and Maxine Carr gave to the media after the deaths of Holly and Jessica, were all stored on the single DVD. Before the trial, courtroom one was refurbished so the information on the DVD could be played to the court and also relayed to the media annex. When the jury retired, the judge, Mr Justice Moses, was keen to make sure members could use the DVD. Inquiries such as Hutton have led the way in inform-ation processing and present-ation. During that inquiry, transcripts were sent to participants' laptops. The transcripts and copies of documents were made available to the media and a website has been online for anyone to consult.
