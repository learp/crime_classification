Carl Wareham, 20, was given an Asbo after being involved in 40 incidents between the ages of 14 and 17 in Lytchett Matravers near Poole, Dorset. He was accused of being drunk and disorderly, threatening to neighbours and causing criminal damage. Slammed in the tabloid press as a 'scumbag' who led a gang of hooligans, Wareham was served with an injunction banning him from his home town for five years.He attempted to get the order overturned at the High Court, claiming it was given on the basis of 'hearsay evidence'. He called it 'double punishment' after he had been convicted of theft and driving while disqualified and had already served eight months in prison. But council officials said the Asbo was more than deserved. Glen Harding, the head of legal and democratic services at Purbeck District Council, said: 'Carl Wareham is a violent bully who has no respect for people or their property. He is feared by most people and I'm sure residents are happy they are not going to bump into him on the street.' Wareham said the council used minimal evidence in their case. 'There was only one witness and the rest of evidence was based on phone calls made to the police,' he said. He now lives with his fiancee outside Lytchett Matravers and said the Asbo had done nothing to 'rehabilitate him'. He added: 'I was already sorting myself out before it was imposed; I'd got rid of my old associates and found a new job. The Asbo has put a big strain on my family. Every time I visit my grandmother, who lives just outside Lytchett Matravers, the police come and arrest me because they think I have breached my Asbo.'
