Police searching thousands of safe deposit boxes have recovered an estimated Â£53.5m in cash, much of it stuffed into plastic bags, Scotland Yard said today.Guns, Class A drugs, gold bars, fake passports, child abuse images and 17th century Dutch landscape paintings have also been found after raids on three London centres 10 days ago.More than 6,700 boxes have been opened by the Met police specialist crime command, who believe a "high percentage" are being used by criminal networks. The centres, in Park Lane, central London, Hampstead and Edgware, north London, are owned by Safe Deposit Centres, a company set up 20 years ago by two South Africans who have since become British citizens. Three directors of the company have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences and released on police bail.It was the first swoop of its kind under the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act. There are 10 safe deposit companies in London, all of which are now required to register with the Financial Services Authority under money laundering regulations which came into force last December."It became apparent that the companies targeted could be assisting the activities of organised criminal networks," Scotland Yard said in a statement. "The Met is determined to tackle serious and organised crime at all levels."Police have been inundated with calls from concerned box owners as they try to sort legitimate property from criminal proceeds.
