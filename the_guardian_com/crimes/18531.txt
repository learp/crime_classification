Eight convicted criminals freed from prison after serving sentences for rape and other sexual and violent offences have been charged with serious new crimes in the past year despite being monitored under a government scheme designed to protect the public from high-risk offenders.Their new crimes, which are understood to include rape and other serious sexual offences, will be disclosed in the autumn in a Home Office report on 'Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements', which were introduced four years ago with the aim of improving public safety.Under the system, officials from the police, probation, and prison services are responsible for identifying the most likely re-offenders among convicts due to be freed after serving sentences for serious sexual and violent offences.Specialist public protection panels, made up of staff from the three services and from other government agencies, are then meant to ensure that those identified are carefully watched after their release. In the most high-risk cases, this can involve round-the-clock surveillance by police, tagging and satellite-tracking.The revelation comes as nearly 1,500 people have added their names to a petition organised by Glamour magazine, and highlighted in a campaign by The Observer, calling for justice for rape victims. The campaign was prompted by the tiny conviction rate for sex offences and by concern among women that attacks against them are not investigated and punished properly.A survey conducted by Glamour found that two thirds of women who have been victims of rape were dissatisfied with the way they were treated after the attack, and that only half were happy with the way that their case was investigated. Just 2 per cent said that they were satisfied with the current rape conviction rate.The fact that so many repeat crimes have been committed - which officials privately admit is partly attributable to failures within the system - last night prompted calls for tighter controls on high-risk offenders.Ann Widdecombe, the Conservative MP and former minister for prisons, said: 'The first problem is early release. The highest rates of re-offending are for sex offenders and people are being released who shouldn't be. The other difficulty is that while supervision is generally pretty tight in the initial stages it becomes more lax as time goes on. Both these problems must be addressed.'Harry Fletcher, a spokesman for the National Association of Probation Officers, said he suspected the true re-offending rate was even higher because of the sophistication of some sex offenders at concealing their crimes and insisted that extra investment in public protection was urgently needed.'The system is a good one in principle, but the police and probation services have got to have sufficient resources and sufficient highly skilled staff to undertake surveillance of the highest risk offenders. Clearly, at the moment, they haven't got that,' he said.'I was talking to colleagues in one London borough recently where they had 17 to 20 people they were very worried about, but only two or three of them would be under intensive surveillance. That is not enough.'The units need to double in size because there are more than 2,000 people who are in the high-risk category and it is essential that we have enough people with the skills to assess the risk, to notice changes in behaviour and to be able to protect the public. Around Britain, we need hundreds of extra staff to achieve this.'No details of the precise crimes that the freed convicts have been charged with will be disclosed in the report, although all are connected with 'serious sexual or violent' offences. This definition includes crimes of rape as well as paedophile crimes and other serious sexual assaults.The total of about 80 charges is three times the figure contained in the equivalent report for 2004, which disclosed only 26 such charges. Officials say that one reason for the steep increase is a decision for the first time to include repeat offence statistics for freed convicts classed as being of a 'level two' risk They concede, however, that the number of charges levelled against freed convicts classed as a 'level three' risk - the highest potential danger to the public - has risen by about a quarter.'There has been a lot of progress since the system was set up and public protection is much better than it was, but there is still a lot that needs to be improved,' said one Whitehall official. 'There are significant challenges in dealing with the large numbers of offenders that we have and ensuring both the quality of risk assessments and that they are carried out quickly enough.'Controversy about the release of potentially dangerous offenders has been highlighted by a number of cases in which freed rapists have perpetrated attacks on women. In December last year, Wayne Gaskin, 38, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, who had been freed after convictions for rape and indecent assault, pleaded guilty to raping an 85-year-old woman in an attack described by police as 'thoroughly sickening'.A month earlier, Elroy Simmonds, 26, who received a six year sentence for raping a 45-year-old woman in 1996, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey for murdering an 82-year-old woman, as well as nine robberies and two assaults committed after his release.
