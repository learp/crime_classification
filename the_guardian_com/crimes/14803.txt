Three men have been arrested following the fatal stabbing of an inmate at a privately run prison.Wayne Reid, 44, from Balsall Heath, Birmingham, died after suffering chest injuries in an incident at Rye Hill jail, near Rugby, on Wednesday. Northamptonshire police confirmed that three suspects, aged between 25 and 40, were being held at separate police stations. The Guardian has learned that, since the stabbing, 36 prisoners from Rye Hill, which is run by Global Solutions, have been moved to other prisons. Reid was to have been released next week. He was waiting to give a witness statement to police in connection with the death of another inmate. Last month, Michael Bailey, 23, also from Birmingham, was found hanged in his cell in the segregation unit at the category B jail. He had been on suicide watch and the Prison Service confirmed that he should have been checked every 15 minutes. Bailey's mother, Caroline, was contacted by Reid who told her he had a lot of information about her son's death and was willing to pass it on to the police. He had made arrangements to meet Mrs Bailey shortly after his release. Two prison officers were suspended after Bailey's death, but Global Solutions said that the suspensions were unconnected. Detective Superintendent Larry Ennis, of Northamptonshire police, said: "We are keeping an open mind, but there is no evidence to connect the two incidents." He said police believed the death of Reid to be an "isolated incident".
