The great train robber Ronnie Biggs was taken to hospital from prison today with a suspected broken hip and chest infection after a fall in his cell.Biggs, 79, who has been in poor health after a series of strokes, was serving his sentence at Norwich prison and his family were expecting the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to give the go-ahead for his release on parole within days.Biggs's son, Michael, said his father was found on the floor of his cell thismorning."I think he is OK but obviously very concerned that this is all happening in the week he was hoping to come out of prison," he said.Biggs's family had anticipated that he would be released from jail on Friday this week and had planned for him to be transferred to a nursing home near his son's London home.Biggs was jailed on his return to Britain in 2001 after spending three decades on the run in Australia and Brazil. He was sentenced to 30 years for his part in the robbery of a Glasgow to London mail train in August 1963, in which a 15-strong gang made off with Â£2.6m.During the robbery, which happened after the gang switched a signal, the train's driver, Jack Mills, was struck with an iron bar. After only 15 months in prison, Biggs escaped from Wandsworth prison, south London, by scaling a wall with a rope ladder.Following his return to Britain eight years ago, he was sent to Belmarsh high-security jail in south-east London before being switched to a high-dependency unit at Norwich.A series of strokes have left Biggs unable to speak. He is also being fed by tube and uses a wheelchair. Last week his lawyer said it was "laughable" to suggest his client still posed a risk to society.A parole board panel that recently recommended his early release said he had not undertaken risk-related work and did not regret his offending.
