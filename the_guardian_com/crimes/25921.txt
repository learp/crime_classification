Alan Williams, the Home Office pathologist whose evidence helped jail Sally Clark for the murder of her two baby sons, was strongly criticised by the court of appeal yesterday. His practice of not passing on all test results to other doctors carried "a significant risk of a miscarriage of of justice".Defence doctors and lawyers at Mrs Clark's trial were unaware of the microbiological findings on baby Harry showing staphylococcus aureus infection, which could have been a cause of death. The discovery of the undisclosed findings led the appeal court to overturn Mrs Clark's murder convictions in January and free her from her life sentence. Giving the court's reasons yesterday, Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Mr Justice Holland and Mrs Justice Hallett, said the crown had taken the "right and proper course" in not seeking a retrial. He said: "In any event, we would have taken a great deal of persuading that on the evidence as we now know it to be, any jury could properly have been sure that either or both of these children were murdered." Mrs Clark, 38, a solicitor, was convicted in November 1999 of killing 11-week-old Christopher in 1996 and eight-week-old Harry in 1998. She issued a statement yesterday thanking the judges. The judges criticised Dr Williams for failing to disclose the information, but accepted that he genuinely believed the deaths were not natural. "We do not believe he was knowingly being a party to the putting forward of a false case," Lord Justice Kay said, but added that his explanation for not disclosing the results was "wholly unacceptable".
