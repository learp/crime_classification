A middle class crimewave is sweeping Britain, with undetected and often unreported forgery and fraud costing up to £14bn a year - nearly five times that of burglary.More than 60% of people in England and Wales admitted in a survey that they had padded an insurance claim, paid cash to avoid taxation or kept the money when given too much change. In western Germany, the proportion was even higher, at 70%. Two scientists from the University of Keele told the British Association science festival at Salford yesterday that 70% of Britons questioned felt that they themselves had been ripped off or been made victims by businesses, banks and tradesmen. The "crimes" were committed at the kitchen table, from the home computer, from call centres and office desks, in supermarkets and restaurants. The lesson was that a market society was not inevitably an honest one. "We think that these illegal, unfair and shady practices that are committed by consumers and business alike are very important for our understanding of the morality of our society," said Susanne Karstedt, a criminologist at Keele. "How citizens and consumers and business - small and large scale - act in the marketplace and when they deal with government services or pay their taxes is the bedrock of attitudes which resulted in the Enron scandal and a number of other high level cases." Crimes such as taking something from the office or asking a friend to bend the rules might involve only minor damage, but set up a vicious cycle. For more than a decade insurers and the health services had complained of increasing fraud, retailers had seen themselves as victims of customers who took unfair advantage of generous offers and terms; small tradesmen reported that customers fraudulently tried to make them responsible for damage. Conversely, consumers claimed they were victimised by their insurance companies, were sold useless insurance, were defrauded by small print clauses and were charged for bogus repairs and used parts sold as new. "We ask ourselves: is a predatory society emerging here? What is clear is that tolerance for all this is far higher than zero," Professor Karstedt said. She and colleague Stephen Farrell collected reports from insurers and investigation officers and found that car parking scams cost one borough council £100,000 a month in revenue, and that fraudulent claims in household and motor insurance added up to £1bn a year. Social security scams were defrauding the British taxpayer of more than £570m a year. They quizzed 4,000 people aged 25-65 in England and Wales and western Germany to see how many admitted white collar dishonesty. Germans outstripped the English and Welsh in all but one kind of crime: they were less likely to keep change given in error.
