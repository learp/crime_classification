Two brothers aged 12 and 10 today admitted carrying out a brutal attack on a pair of young boys during which they tortured, robbed and sexually assaulted their victims.The brothers – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were in foster care when they lured their victims, a boy aged nine and his 11-year-old uncle, to semi-wild parkland on the edge of Edlington, a former pit village near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, on 4 April this year.The boys were subjected to what prosecutors at a previous hearing called a "horrific, violent, sustained physical attack" involving bricks, sticks and a noose.The victims also suffered cigarette burns and were forced to perform a series of sexual acts on each other.Today at Sheffield crown court, where their case was sent to be tried in the adult judicial system, the pair admitted grievous bodily harm with intent, robbery, and forcing a child to take part in sexual acts.Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, described the offences as "grave crimes".The two separately admitted one count each of assault in connection with an attack on another 11-year-old boy on 28 March.The grievous bodily harm charge was submitted as an alternative to an earlier attempted murder allegation, which the brothers denied."It has been explained [to the victims' families] that although the offences are not of the same gravity, the maximum sentence for causing grievous bodily harm with the intention so to do is the same for that of attempted murder," Campbell said."Each [family] has understood that the acceptance of these pleas would mean that their sons do not have to give evidence."The maximum sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent is life imprisonment.The crime prompted deep shock in Edlington and nationwide, and evoked comparisons with the 1993 murder of two-year-old James Bulger by Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, who were 10 at the time.It also raised fresh questions for the children's department of Doncaster council, which was taken over by a new Westminster-appointed management team a month before the attack.The takeover was imposed after case reviews were ordered into the deaths of seven babies and children in the area over a five-year period.At the time of the attack, the perpetrators had been living with a foster family in Edlington for several weeks, but critics said they should have been in secure care given previous complaints about the brother's behaviour.The younger victim of the attack was found wandering through Edlington in a traumatised state, with blood on his face and a severe cut on his arm down to the bone.Soon afterwards, the 11-year-old was found, unconscious and partially naked, at the bottom of a ravine.Prosecutors believe part of a sink had been smashed against his head. His injuries were so severe that he was taken to hospital by air ambulance and spent two days on a ventilator.The younger boy told police that he and his uncle had been lured to the Brick Ponds parkland with the promise of seeing dead wild animals.According to testimony from the nine-year-old – which was recounted to a court hearing several days after the crime and has not, until now, been able to be reported – the attackers then robbed them of money and a mobile phone.The case was heard in one of the smaller rooms in the crown court and the judge, Mr Justice Keith, wore a suit rather than wig or robes in an attempt to make the setting less intimidating.The brothers sat in the main section of the court rather than the dock. The older defendant, wearing a dark shirt and tie, and with close-cropped dark hair, spoke clearly and confidently when answering the charges, but at times appeared restless, shuffling in his seat and yawning on a couple of occasions.His considerably smaller and slighter younger brother, also with dark hair and dressed in white shirt and dark tie, answered the charges more hesitantly and appeared at times to have difficulties following the proceedings. At one point his barrister asked for a pause in the case so matters could be explained to the 10-year-old.The judge told them the situation was clearly "very strange for you, and I can tell you it is pretty strange for us lawyers to have boys your age in a court like this."He said the prosecution would outline details of the case at a future sentencing hearing.With the comparisons to the Bulger case have come questions about whether boys so young should appear in an adult court.The age for presumed criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10, much lower than in many other European countries.
