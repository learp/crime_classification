The home secretary, Charles Clarke, has told the Guardian he is to abandon his predecessor's aspiration of pegging the prison population in England and Wales at 80,000. He will also drop plans to put a legal obligation on the judges' sentencing guidelines council to take the size of the prison population - currently 77,000 and rising - into account when laying down the "going rate" for major crimes."I am not convinced that an overall obligation to look at the overall size of the prison population is the right thing to do," Mr Clarke, who succeeded David Blunkett, said. Instead, the home secretary wants to cut Britain's reoffending rates by creating a network of community prisons to ensure that those serving short sentences remain close to their families and communities.He recognises that an overcrowded prison system means that goal will be difficult to achieve but believes a system of community prisons can be set up by restructuring the jail network and by greater use of community punishments for some of those serving short sentences.The new approach will be unveiled tonight by Mr Clarke in a speech to the Prison Reform Trust - his first major statement on penal policy since he became home secretary last December.Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Clarke also dismissed "as a complete horlicks" repeated Sunday newspaper speculation that Tony Blair is unhappy with his performance as home secretary and intends to reshuffle him.He described himself as "tough but not populist", a position he says No 10 is very happy with. Some described Mr Blunkett as populist, so Mr Clarke is signalling a change in style.He also said that he wants to end the remote image of the Home Office. Because of the pressure on his time caused by the terrorist outrages, he admitted he has not yet had the chance to spell out his vision of penal policy, saying today's speech to the Prison Reform Trust will make clear that for a government that puts health and education at the heart of its mission, the prison system does not reflect Labour values. "We don't do enough for the least healthy and the least educated people in the country, who are the people in the criminal justice system, particularly if we know that if you solve issues like literacy and numeracy then you can solve issues like drug abuse and mental health [so] that people are less likely to offend than would otherwise be the case."He said a large proportion of the prison population, including some on remand or serving shorter sentences, need to remain more closely integrated with their communities. "We need to get to a state of affairs where prisoners are able to reintegrate into society through developing their relations with their friends and family. The break in that - and it happens often -is the damaging thing in people's ability to stop reoffending."Families and friends on average travel five hours to visit an inmate and the number of jail visits is dropping. As many as two-thirds of prisoners see their relationships with partners end. Many others lose job or home."We need to work much harder to organise community prisons so that prisoners when they are in prison are in reasonably close geographical proximity to the people who they know and to their future."He added that he was asking some multinational companies to employ a set number of former prisoners, so long as they had acquired the relevant skills. One such deal has already been struck, with Transco, the gas pipelines company.Main aims路 create a network of community prisons so inmates are closer to their families路 abandon the aspiration of pegging the prison population to 80,000路 abandon proposals that sentencing take into account prison overcrowding路 end the remote image of the Home Office
