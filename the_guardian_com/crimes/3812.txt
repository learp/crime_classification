Tony Blair yesterday revealed the government is planning to introduce a number of crime measures next month including an automatic jail sentence for anyone in breach of bail conditions.He will also bring forward measures to take some minor anti-social behaviour offences out of the court system and make them subject to automatic fines.He said: "If you are someone who breaches their bail then prima facie they should be going to prison but these are difficult things. We will build on what is already there and outline these proposals at the end of July."Mr Blair made his remarks at his monthly press conference, arguing that traditional measures to crack down on crime were not sufficient. The proposals will be published in the form of a reply by John Reid to the letter from Mr Blair on his appointment as home secretary asking for a new Home Office strategy by July.Mr Blair claimed the Home Office was operating in a new climate of mass migration and the break down of traditional communities that required new thinking on criminal justice.Other measures are likely to include action to deport foreign criminals and suspected terrorists, even though these measures are circumscribed by European human rights law.Mr Blair argued a fundamental shift was needed from the principles of the criminal justice system drawn up in the 19th and 20th centuries to deal with the threats of the 21st century.He said: "If you want to tackle anti-social behaviour, the ordinary law and order system is not going to tackle it. You are going to have to give summary powers to police on the frontline. And if you want to tackle organised crime, you have to take the Proceeds of Crime Act and strengthen it ... so that for organised criminals, even without convictions, you are able to open up people's bank accounts and seize their assets and force them to prove they came by them lawfully."He added: "There are more prison places, sentences are longer and sentences are tougher but if you took where the public is on this issue, the gap between what they expect and what they get is bigger in this service than anywhere else and we have got to bridge it."Mr Blair also ruled out taking the job of UN secretary general after he retires and refused to comment on suggestions by the leader of the Commons, Jack Straw, that he will stand down well before the next election.
