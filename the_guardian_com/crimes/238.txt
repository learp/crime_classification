Detectives investigating the death of a 20-year-old travel agent who was abducted by a fake taxi and then jumped, or was pushed, to her death have arrested a Greek national.The 27-year-old man was held in Thessaloniki by Greek police who have worked with detectives from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, where Stephanie Hammill was killed on an evening out with her fiancé in November 2003.Police had the name of a Greek suspect on its list since shortly after a black Mercedes was traced to mainland Greece. The car, which was brought to Britain for tests at the Forensic Science Service laboratory in Wetherby, is believed to have been in Wakefield on the night Ms Hammill died.She and her fiancé flagged down what they thought was a taxi after a meal in the city centre. But the dark-coloured saloon sped away before her fiance could get in.Ms Hammill was found dead less than 10 minutes later, after apparently leaping from the car or being pushed out. She landed in the path of a taxi which ran her over, dragging her body for 25 yards.Taxi driver Mohammed Ashiq, 53, was subsequently banned from driving and ordered to do 200 hours of community service by magistrates in Dewsbury. He claimed he thought the impact of her body was just "wind pressure" but he was convicted of failing to stop after the accident and failing to report it to police.The man arrested in Thessaloniki is expected to be escorted to West Yorkshire under a European warrant.The man, who is single and from the Halkidiki area, was interviewed by West Yorkshire detectives in Thessaloniki in June.
