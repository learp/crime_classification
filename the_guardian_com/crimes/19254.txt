Enlisted by fascist Rome, captured in north Africa and then dispatched by Churchill to windswept work on sea defences off the top of Scotland, the 600 Italians plonked at Camp 60, Orkney, during 1942, found la dolce vita was remote indeed. But one among them, painter Domenico Chiocchetti, persuaded his captors to allow him to convert two Nissen huts into an elegant Catholic chapel on these bleak Calvinist isles. He also persuaded his toil-worn fellow prisoners to give up free time – and even some cigarette money – for the project. Corned-beef tins became lightholders, a concrete-clad car exhaust made a font, and the tabernacle was carved from ship-wrecked wood. The glory was Chiocchetti’s Madonna and Child altarpiece, which he supplemented many years later with stations-of-the-cross carvings, three of which have now been stolen. It’s a sad tale, but the chapel stands as proof that no mere theft would have broken Chiocchetti’s spirit.
