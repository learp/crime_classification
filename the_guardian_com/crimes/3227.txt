Tony Blair today launched his flagship third-term social policy, the "respect action plan", which will see a national parenting academy, possible temporary evictions of troublesome families, and greater powers to involve the police on community issues.More than a dozen ministers are launching the plan nationwide, after the PM gave a breakfast time speech in Downing Street and a series of TV interviews to unveil the 40-page programme of incentives and punishments across housing, schooling, the judicial system and parenting.The most controversial measure appears to be a consultation on temporary evictions of so-called neighbours from hell - even if they are homeowners rather than council tenants.Home office minister Hazel Blears - tipped for promotion to the cabinet this week - insisted such evictions would be a "last resort" but added that those removed "would not be given a three-bedroom house", or housing benefit. Critics have suggested such families will end up in state "sin bins."Mr Blair warned that he was not searching for a "golden age" of civility, but added he did not accept poverty was a reason for antisocial behaviour, saying: "In fact, I don't really think that is the case at all. The vast majority of people, including families on low incomes, behave perfectly properly."The key measures of the action plan - which is a cross-departmental effort rather than an all-encompassing new bill - are published by the Home Office today. They include:· Consulting on a new power to evict persistent troublemakers from their homes for three months.· More parenting courses, with more agencies able to impose parenting orders on those parents who refuse to take up help when their children are "out of control".· A "national parenting academy", to train social workers, clinical psychologists, community safety officers and youth justice workers about advising parents. Plus more parenting orders.· Possible nighttime curfews and new, fixed penalty notices rising from £80 to £100, injunctions against antisocial behaviour, and more unpaid community service orders.· Communities are to be given powers to grill the police on their battle with yobs and demand tougher action where they think they have failed. They must hold "face the people" sessions and respond to a "community call to action" within a set deadline.· More money for youth clubs and sports centres, as announced in last year's pre-budget report. · A new national non-emergency number.Mr Blair, launching the scheme with a symbolic removal of some graffiti, said he wanted a "radical new approach to restore the liberty of the law-abiding citizen"."My view is very clear - their freedom to be safe from fear comes first."Saying Britain was fighting 21st century crime with 19th century methods, the PM added: "Traditional thinking will have to be overthrown if we are to get to grips with practical reality."David Cameron, the Conservative leader, counter-attacked with his own "Real Respect" launch in London this lunchtime. He accused Mr Blair of a "series of gimmicks, eye-catching initiatives" - deliberately picking up on the wording of a leak, several years ago, of a memo from Mr Blair demanding more "eye-catching initiatives" on crime.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, appeared to admit on the Today programme that previous government attempts to crack down on antisocial behaviour may have appeared "gimmicky" but insisted "this is a coherent, focused programme of action for every government department".Mr Blair faced ridicule a few years ago when in a speech in Germany he mooted marching drunken louts to cash points for on the spot fines.But with 16 ministers launching today's plan, Downing Street has staked enormous political capital on being seen to take effective action against low-level crime and nuisance neighbours.Ministers heading the initiative today include the education secretary, Ruth Kelly, the health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, and the communities minister, David Milliband, as well as the PM, chancellor and home secretary.In his speech to youth workers and professionals to launch the scheme this morning, Mr Blair said "We need a radical new approach if we are to restore the liberty of the law-abiding citizen."Yes, in theory, that is what is supposed to happen through the traditional court processes. In practice, it doesn't. We are fighting 21st crime with 19th century methods."Again, traditional thinking will have to be overthrown if we are to get to grips with practical reality.But Mr Blair stressed: "Respect cannot, in the end, be conjured through legislation. Government can provide resources and powers."If his father or grandfather were brought forward in time to see the society of the 21st century, they would marvel at the technological advances and new freedoms, said Mr Blair.But he added: "The one thing that would shock them, where they would say society has changed for the worse is in that loss of respect in local communities and on the street.The action plan also suggests new powers to remove anti-social individuals from hospital A&E departments, and create a new offence of obstructing ambulance workers.It also suggests lowering the threshold at which police could seize the proceeds of crime from £5,000 to £1,000.A consultation is currently ongoing on allowing Asbos to be handed out by housing associations and tenants organisations, as well as local authorities.ReactionInitial responses to the government's blueprint were muted. Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of probation union Napo, said: "A strategy based on punishment and coercion is unlikely to succeed. "Early intervention with parents is essential, but is best based on consent. The action plan has massive resource implications for probation, police and social services if it is genuinely to address the problem. "Compulsory parenting orders, and the eviction of extremely difficult families, will not alleviate the real problems that the government has identified."The chief executive of the Children's Society, Bob Reitemeier, said: "The respect action plan fails to offer much more than a cocktail of policies that have already been launched, minor tweaks to existing anti-social behaviour measures, and shock tactics, such as 'shutting and sealing' families out of their own homes. "The promise of high-quality, accessible support and services for all families, that the government has already made, would make the biggest difference, and should be the highest priority across government departments.
