Heather NicholsonNicholson, who was raised in Wales, joined the animal rights movement as a 26-year-old in the mid-1990s when she went to a demo against live animal exports. It was during this period that the former nanny met her future ­husband Gregg Avery. A committed vegan, the 41-year-old once said ­followed the strict dietary requirements because she didn't wish to "contribute to the murder, suffering and exploitation of animals". She worked for the RSPCA before joining Shac in a senior managerial role, for which she was paid £75 a week. In 2006 while awaiting trial for attacking a foxhunting supporter in HMP Bronzefield in Middlesex she told abolitionist online: "I would like to express my love and admiration to everyone of you who cares about what is being done to animals and is doing something about it. Never under estimate how powerful you are and always believe that we will win."Gregg AveryAvery established Shac in 1999 with his current wife Natasha Avery and former wife Heather Nicholson - both committed animal rights activists. The 41-year-old first became involved in ­animal rights protests as a teenager in the 1980s, carrying out raids with the Northern Animal Liberation League. He married Nicholson after they met at a protest against exports at Coventry airport, but divorced her and married fellow animal rights activist Natasha Dallemagne, in 2002. As the de facto leader of Shac, Avery co-ordinates activists around the world. He has served several prison sentences, including time for assaulting a policeman and has been accused of threatening to kill an HLS employee and associating with "hard men" in the animal rights movement. Speaking from prison in 2006 he said: "Animal abuse occurs in every corner of the globe and is happening now. Wherever we find it we must fight it."
