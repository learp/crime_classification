One of the two men jailed for the racist murder of the teenager Stephen Lawrence has dropped his appeal against his conviction, the Judicial Office has confirmed.Gary Dobson was given a life sentence at the Old Bailey in January last year. The second man, David Norris, is continuing his battle against conviction.There will be a hearing in his case at the court of appeal in London. A date has not yet been set.A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office confirmed: "Gary Dobson has abandoned his renewed application to appeal his conviction for the murder of Stephen Lawrence."David Norris's renewed application seeking permission to appeal his conviction will be heard on a date to be fixed."Last summer, applications for permission to appeal by both men were rejected by a single judge who considered the papers from the case.But Dobson and Norris, who are both in their 30s, still had the right to renew their applications before a panel of judges sitting at the court of appeal.The trial judge, Mr Justice Treacy, described the murder as a "terrible and evil crime". He urged police not to "close the file" on catching the rest of the killers after the Old Bailey heard that a gang of five or six white youths set upon the A-level student in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.He said the murder was committed "for no other reason than racial hatred".Treacy told the pair: "A totally innocent 18-year-old youth on the threshold of a promising life was brutally cut down in the street in front of eyewitnesses by a racist, thuggish gang."The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold case team of forensic scientists was called in.
