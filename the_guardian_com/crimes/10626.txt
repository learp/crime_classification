3.01pm GMT15:01We’re going to pause the blog for now. Here’s a summary of what we know:Serious failings at the BBC allowed Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall to sexually abuse nearly 100 people without detection for decades, according to two damning reports. Dame Janet Smith found that despite what had happened with Savile and Hall in previous years, those worked at the BBC were still worried about reporting potential abuse and taking on the broadcaster’s stars.The report ultimately concludes that there is no evidence that the BBC as a corporate body was aware of Savile’s conduct and therefore cannot be convicted of any offence. But the report found a “macho culture” of sexism and sexual harassment and an “atmosphere of fear” led many BBC employees to keep quiet about concerns.BBC director general Tony Hall apologised to the survivors of abuse and accepted Smith’s findings in full. “We will learn the lessons from these terrible times,” he promised.Rona Fairhead, chair of the BBC Trust said: “We need to restore the public’s trust in the BBC.” She said the BBC’s management would “immediately reviews its policies and procedures on child protection, complaints, whistleblowing, and investigations”. The NSPCC will be involved in the review.The BBC “parted company” with Tony Blackburn because the evidence he gave to the inquiry “fell short” of the standards required. Tony Hall said Blackburn’s position became “untenable” after he denied to Smith that he had been interviewed twice over complaints from the mother of Claire McAlpine who committed suicide after claiming she was abused.Blackburn has repeated his threat to sue the BBC. He claimed he was being “hung out to dry”, while he and others accused the corporation of trying to divert attention from Smith’s findings. A lawyer for the victims of Savile and Stuart Hall dismissed Smith’s report as an “an expensive whitewash”. Liz Dux, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon Lawyers, said: “There is real concern that the culture of fear and oppression referred to might have prevented more from speaking out more candidly and still exists today.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.00pm GMT15:00Sandra LavilleThe BBC can take depressing comfort from overwhelming evidence that it was not and is not alone in its failure, writes Sandra Laville.The Church of England, the Catholic church, leading private schools, local authorities in Oxford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Derby, the police service and numerous other institutions in British public life have all exhibited these same traits.When a senior police officer first revealed the scale of Savile’s offending three years ago he noted the entertainer had been “hiding in plain sight” for decades. But the likes of Jimmy Savile, albeit of varying degrees of recidivism, have been hiding in plain sight across many British institutions and within society for years.We have seen how the establishment, from the then archbishop of Canterbury down, wrote letters of support in 1993 for Church of England bishop Peter Ball when he was first accused of sexual abuse – an intervention which might or might not have led to the decision not to prosecute him then.We have witnessed the repeated failures of police and prosecutors to bring Greville Janner to justice while he was alive and we have noted with alarm how the authorities in ordinary British towns such as Rotherham, Oxford and Derby – to name just a few – treated vulnerable young girls as consenting adults and refused to believe their allegations of horrific sexual abuse.If reading Smith’s report is shocking, be prepared to be further shocked in the months and years to come as Judge Lowell Goddard opens public hearings investigating up to 25 British institutions over their failures to tackle child abuse and sexual exploitation.Shocked by the BBC Savile report?

Tony Hall has fallen in my estimation, I think it’s utterly scandalous.” She described Blackburn as “a thoroughly decent, upstanding man”, adding: “I mean, the only crime he’s been capable of as far as I’m concerned is duff jokes and dodgy hair.” Blackburn also accused the BBC of trying to divert attention. In his second statement he said: “Sadly, today’s news agenda should have been about the survivors of abuse carried out within the BBC but, by sacking me, they have managed to take the focus off those who have suffered so much.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.37pm GMT14:37The 1971 allegation, which Tony Blackburn has strenuously denied, was that he “seduced” teenager Claire McAlpine after inviting her back to his flat following a recording of Top Of The Pops, PA reminds us. In an earlier statement, Blackburn said he had been told that the girl’s mother told the BBC, a few weeks after her initial complaint, that Claire had withdrawn the allegation. Blackburn also said Dame Janet’s report made no suggestion that he was guilty of misconduct with the teenager, nor did a coroner’s inquest or a subsequent police inquiry into her death after she took her own life. But Lord Hall said the corporation had “parted company” with Blackburn, referred to as A7 in the report, because of his evidence to the inquiry. Asked why the BBC sacked the DJ, Lord Hall said: “So many survivors and witnesses have honestly and openly co-operated fully and at great personal cost to themselves. “As Dame Janet has said, she’s rejected his evidence, and she has explained very clearly why. “I have to take that extremely seriously. My interpretation of that is that Tony Blackburn fell short of the standards of evidence that such an inquiry demanded. Hall said paragraphs in the report showed Blackburn was interviewed twice by Bill Cotton and Sir Brian Neill over complaints from the mother of Claire McAlpine who committed suicide after claiming she was abused.And yet when interviewed by Dame Janet, Blackburn denied these interviewed had taken place, Hall said. “My view is that given the importance of this investigation and the weight of responsibility of everyone to work fully and frankly with Dame Janet’s review, I felt it was untenable for the BBC to continue its relationship [with Blackburn] because of that.”In Dame Janet’s report, she said: “For the sake of completeness, I should make it clear at this stage that I have not attempted to make any judgment about the allegation involving A7 and Claire McAlpine. “The question does not fall within my terms of reference. My legitimate interest in this matter relates only to what can be inferred about the BBC’s culture and practices from the way in which the matter was investigated by the BBC.” FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.23pm GMT14:23Kevin RawlinsonNews website Exaro was criticised as “irresponsible” for publishing an early draft of Dame Janet Smith’s report, writes Kevin Rawlinson. Smith said the site’s story had led to the identification of people she had agreed should remain anonymous and that its publication was “entirely unjustified”.“Exaro’s decision appears to have been taken for its own commercial gain without any thought for the interests of the many victims of Savile or the integrity of the reporting process,” Smith’s report read.Addressing reporters as she announced the release of her review, Smith said the site had been irresponsible.Exaro ran leaked extracts of a draft of Smith’s BBC-commissioned report into whether the culture and practices of the broadcaster allowed Savile to get away with decades of sexual abuse.It published a series of stories on 20 January revealing many of the criticisms levelled at the BBC in those drafts.

Rantzen told the Guardian: “I am pessimistic. The most recent case of sexual harassment I know about was another broadcaster, an independent broadcaster, but again it was someone who was ‘Talent’, and therefore the young woman felt she couldn’t complain or ask for help.“I think it happens when it’s a banker or a judge, we know this week abishop convicted of terrible offences. Gang leaders in Rotherham.“Power, we know corrupts, but it appears it also prevents those whoare vulnerable from speaking out.”“There are very crucial lessons to be learned and maybe one of thelessons is for parents. Make sure young people don’t get dazzled bythe glitz of fame or fortune, to think the people they’ve admired fromafar are actual trustworthy.”Asked if the BBC’s promises will make a difference, Rantzen said:“We’re all vulnerable to it. It’s in our DNA to admire iconic figuresbut we have to as parents make sure we protect our children, andorganisations that build up people to status of stars have to be awarethat safeguards must be put in place.“It sounds like a dry set of policies but they’re practical and doprotect children and young people.”FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.58pm GMT12:58Here are tables about the abuse by Stuart Hall during his time at the BBC.Age of Hall complainantsAge of Hall complainantsNumber of Hall complainants by decadeNumber of Hall complainants by decadeFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.53pm GMT12:53PA has more reaction from ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen.“Celebrity has cast a spell over everyone” and that youngsters need to be told that “fame isn’t a guarantee of virtue”, it quotes her saying. Rantzen added:  “It’s not new really, you have had demagogues, leaders, monarchs, all sorts of people who have been like magicians and I’m afraid that the media have done this to stars of reality shows, disc jockeys, all sorts of people. “I don’t know quite how you protect people from it. I would suggest that when a child says his or her ambition is to be rich and famous, somebody somewhere needs to point out that sometimes there are feet of clay, and that fame isn’t a guarantee of virtue, goodness, (or) kindness. “The tragedy that someone, somewhere appointed Jimmy Savile to present a programme (Jim’ll Fix It) in which he was supposed to be humane, good, kind, (and) generous to all the children that came near - that is a terrible irony and it must not be repeated.”“I think there have been some good results, both of the revelations about Savile and this report, because I do think that survivors of abuse do feel more able to come forward, talk about what’s happened to them, recognise it was not their fault, and that their disclosures will be investigated.” FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.47pm GMT12:47Here’s video of Tony Hall confirming that the BBC sacked Tony Blackburn.Updatedat 12.47pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose12.46pm GMT12:46  Esther Rantzen Photograph: Guy Bell/REXEsther Rantzen, the former BBC presenter and founder of Childline, said she took her own children to see Savile’s Jim’ll Fix It show despite knowing the rumours about her colleague.“I took my own children to Jim’ll Fix It, I would never have put them at risk if I thought there was a serious danger there,” she told BBC News.
