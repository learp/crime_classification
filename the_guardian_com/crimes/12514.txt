A teenager whose four-month racist campaign led a younger schoolgirl to try to kill herself was sentenced to six months supervision today.The girl's mother said after the hearing he had got off lightly. "[My daughter] thought he walked out with a slap on the wrist. If that's the reaction of a 14-year-old you can imagine the reaction from her mum."Edward Johnson, prosecuting, told Lincoln youth court that the bullying of the 14-year-old happened between last September and January.He said: "The victim, a mixed-race girl, received abuse … at various locations in the school [that] included use of the words nigger, wog and gorilla."Chants were also repeated, including 'white is right', 'kick them out' and 'fight, fight, fight'. This had a significant impact on the 14-year-old victim, who attempted suicide. Clearly the girl suffered significantly."The 15-year-old, who has been moved to another school, was also ordered to carry out 10 hours of indirect reparation – the equivalent of community service. His parents will have to pay £500 compensation and £300 court costs and attend a parenting support session.The teenager was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment after a trial at the court last month. Another 15-year-old boy was found not guilty.The girl's mother said the family had moved to a different area and her daughter was improving, although the effects of the boy's taunts still showed. "She is better than I thought she would be."Inspector Pat Coates, of Lincolnshire police, said: "It was a targeted campaign. Hopefully he has learned a lesson. If this sort of behaviour takes place the police will take it seriously. It also sends a message to the victims: come forward, we can help you."
