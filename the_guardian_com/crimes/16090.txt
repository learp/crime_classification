The widow of a banker murdered on the doorstep of his Highland home yesterday renewed her appeal for information on the anniversary of his death.A year after Alistair Wilson was shot, police are no closer to discovering who killed the bank manager or any motive for the crime. Veronica Wilson, who is not a suspect, opened the door to the man who shot her husband and police revealed yesterday she had been hypnotised in an attempt to shed more light on the crime.Mrs Wilson described her husband's murder as "very, very unreal" and said she could not grieve until his killer was caught.
