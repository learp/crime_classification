The Daily Mail recently responded to the May Day protest by devoting a front page and two inside pages to attacking "legal vultures" - lawyers who offered advice to the demonstrators. It seems that one of the organisations supporting those who were trapped in a police cordon for several hours at Oxford Circus distributed cards (popularly known as "bust cards") giving contact numbers for solicitors willing to advise them. The Mail said that some of the lawyers themselves were handing out cards.The police have a responsibility for maintaining public order and they need the legal authority to take suitable measures to prevent breaches of the peace. At the same time, a balance is required to protect people from unjustified deprivation of their liberty. That protection is guaranteed by article 5 of the European convention on human rights. Whether the police exceeded their powers at Oxford Circus cannot be judged without looking closely at the facts but it is surely obvious that anybody caught up in the police operation is entitled to know whether their rights have been infringed and if so whether they have a remedy.Strangely, the Mail did not react to the news that lawyers were on hand by proclaiming its patriotic pride in the rule of law which defines the rights and duties of both protesters and police. Nor did it salute the public spirit of those independent-minded lawyers ready to put their skills at the service of idealistic, possibly misguided, but almost certainly impecunious citizens confronted by the armed might of the Metropolitan police. Instead it claimed that the lawyers were touting for business and thereby breaking Law Society rules. Furthermore, a reporter following up the offer of help by pretending to be a protester forcibly detained within the cordon claimed that she was advised by one of the recommended lawyers that she could get legal aid to sue the police and might collect thousands in damages. The Mail did not tell us whether the advice was right or wrong. But if the lawyer gave correct advice she can hardly be blamed for telling her client what action the law entitled her to take. At one time it was thought ungentlemanly or unBritish for professional people to advertise their services and the professional bodies prohibited it. Word of mouth recommendation was doubtless sufficient to introduce the propertied and the business classes to suitable advisers but the wider public needs help to find the right lawyer for its particular problems. Should protesters be denied that help? Do those who offer that help deserve to be pilloried? While touting for business is a pejorative expression, it means no more than marketing. The prohibition on advertising by lawyers was dropped many years ago and the largest commercial firms have marketing departments whose sole function is to attract new clients and new business. It is true that some restrictions have been maintained on the most blatant forms of self-promotion but a wide range of sponsorships, promotional publications and direct approaches to potential clients are approved, or at least tolerated, for both barristers and solicitors by their professional organisations. Having been brought up in the previous, rather straight-laced era, I find it hard to suppress my distaste for the commercialisation of the legal profession, but what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I cannot accept that it is wrong to tell protesters or anyone else where they can get legal advice. Whether or not the police were justified in their tactics at Oxford Circus, people deprived of their liberty for whatever reason must be entitled to know whether they have been treated lawfully. There is a wider and even a sinister aspect to the repeated attacks on lawyers by the Mail and others in the media. They undermine the goal of equality before the law. Observe that the attacks are largely directed at those who, with increasing difficulty, represent the powerless. These lawyers are not, with very few exceptions, among those who are properly criticised for making too much money for doing too little of value to the community. Tony Blair has good reason to put reform of the legal profession near the top of his agenda, but his purpose, I hope and believe, is to improve and equalise access to justice. Certainly, that is the tendency of those reforms which have already been initiated: the development of a human rights culture stimulated by the Human Rights Act, and the embryonic Community Legal Service. Defending lawyers is an uphill struggle. Public cynicism is deeply ingrained. But those who cherish our historic commitment to democracy and the rule of law must surely acknowledge that the lawyer has a vital role in monitoring the exercise of power and challenging its abuse. The presence of lawyers at May Day and other protests benefits us all.Â• Geoffrey Bindman is a solicitor specialising in human rights g.bindman@ucl.ac.uk
