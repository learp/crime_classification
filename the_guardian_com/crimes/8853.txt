A father who killed his 11-week-old son by squeezing him and dropping him on the floor in a fit of anger was yesterday sentenced to life in prison, and will serve a minimum of 11 years.Craig Goddard, 24, from Toll Bar, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, admitted killing Alfie Goddard after "snapping" in May 2008 when he was unable to settle the baby. Alfie died in Sheffield Children's hospital two days later from a brain injury. A postmortem examination concluded his death was the result of injuries caused two days earlier.His mother, Lindsay Harris, 19, admitted perverting the course of justice after repeatedly telling police she found the baby at the bottom of the stairs. She was given 12 months' detention, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 150 hours of community service.Simon Jackson QC, for the prosecution, told Sheffield crown court Alfie had suffered injuries consistent with "squeezing by vigorous shaking followed by the child impacting on the floor".Jackson said Goddard had initially given differing accounts of what had happened. In one interview Goddard told police his son had fallen after he had blacked out at the top of the stairs. In another he told police: "I just got frustrated, I didn't mean to hurt him. I've just got this anger thing, I didn't mean to hurt him. I just lost my temper."Peter Kelson QC said in mitigation: "This is not a tragedy that could have been anticipated with the best intentions of social services or anybody else. It was a case of a parent doing the best he could, losing his temper at a difficult time."A serious case review into the death is due to be published as part of an inquiry into the deaths of seven children while under the care of Doncaster council's children's services department from 2004.
