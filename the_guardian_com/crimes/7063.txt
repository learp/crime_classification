A mental health trust was criticised today after two patients killed people over the same weekend after being released by psychiatric specialists, a report said.Thomas Wright, 56, stabbed his wife 77 times with a kitchen knife at their home in Tooting, south London, on February 17 2006.His GP had urgently referred him to south-west London and St George's mental health trust's local community mental health team a fortnight earlier, but he was not seen.One day later, paranoid schizophrenic Sean Perry, 32, a patient of the same trust, killed a fitness instructor in a random attack in Tooting.Separate inquiries into the two killings published today criticised failings in the care given to the two men. Perry was twice a patient at the trust's Springfield hospital in Tooting but was discharged in June 2005. His family warned repeatedly that he was refusing to take anti-psychotic drugs and urged doctors to readmit him.But he was allowed to remain in the community and, on the night of February 18 2006, he killed Matthew Carter, 22, who was walking home from a friend's house.Perry admitted manslaughter at the Old Bailey and in July 2006 was detained indefinitely at Broadmoor maximum security hospital.The independent report into the killing revealed that he assaulted a community psychiatric nurse in April 2005, but was not prosecuted.The authors said they were "concerned" that witness statements were only taken three months after this incident, which they noted was "particularly serious" and caused "acute injury".They said the failure to bring charges could have been a missed opportunity to tackle Perry's problems. "We found that a prosecution might have been beneficial for the treatment of SP (Sean Perry) for a number of reasons, including that it might have encouraged him to address his condition and engage with treatment," they wrote. The inquiry found that Perry was "known to be capable of great violence" and to present a "significant risk" to others when acutely psychotic.But he was not referred for a forensic assessment because the community care staff looking after him believed this would have been of limited value - something the authors described as a "lost opportunity".There was also an "over-reliance" by health workers on using Perry's mother to monitor his progress despite her being "not adequately equipped" for this role.The report singled out for criticism Neil Hickman, Perry's care coordinator in the trust's specialist "early intervention service".The authors said: "Neil Hickman was unduly focused on the wishes and desires of SP and his family rather than on the risks he posed when unwell."They also said Hickman's failure to ensure a face-to-face mental health assessment of Perry was carried out in February 2006 was a "professional misjudgment".The report made 19 recommendations for the NHS trust, the local council and the community mental health team that looked after Perry.Welcoming the report, Peter Houghton, chief executive of the south-west London and St George's health trust, expressed his sympathy to the bereaved family.He said that since the attacks by Sean Perry and Thomas Wright, the trust's mental health early intervention service has trebled in size, risk assessment has improved, and staff had been given more training. He added: "These terrible events are always an opportunity to learn about how we improve our services and how we must try to stop these kind of events happening in the future."
