A rail boss was today sentenced to nine years in prison for the manslaughter of four maintenance workers who died when a runaway wagon ploughed into them at about 40mph.Mark Connolly, 44, had deliberately dismantled the brakes on two of his wagons in order to save money.One of the wagons - fully laden with 16 tons of steel rail track - ran away down a steep slope and hit a group of rail workers near Tebay, Cumbria, two years ago.The wagon, weighing a total of 19 tons, came out of the morning darkness and hit the group as they worked on the west coast main line.Colin Buckley, 49, and Darren Burgess, 30, of Carnforth, Lancashire, Chris Waters, 53, of Morecambe, Lancashire, and Gary Tindall, 46, of Tebay, died almost instantly.Mr Justice Holland told Connolly that by deliberately disconnecting the hydraulic brakes he had caused the deaths of the four men.Jailing him at Newcastle crown court, the judge said: "The result was immediate and long-term. Immediate carnage, four men killed, four men seriously injured. Long-term, families of the four dead men suffered from the stress and anxiety that result from the loss of a loved one."Connolly, of Coedana, Llanerchymedd, Anglesey, received a nine-year sentence for each of the four counts of manslaughter, to run concurrently. No separate penalty was imposed for the three counts of breaching health and safety laws.The father-of-two had denied all charges but was convicted after a two-month trial.Co-accused Roy Kennett, 29, was jailed for two years after being convicted of four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence and one count of breaching health and safety laws.The wagon had broken free from its moorings and careered down a three-mile slope, picking up speed, before it reached the workers. Those who died failed to hear cries of warning because they were wearing earplugs.The trial heard that Connolly, who ran MAC Machinery Services, had dismantled a faulty brake system rather than pay to have it repaired.He disconnected the brakes on two wagons because of faulty hydraulic systems. Then he deliberately filled brake fluid cables with ball bearings to give the impression to onlookers that they were mechanically sound.At the time one witness likened the tragedy to "death coming out of the darkness". After realising what had happened Connolly was heard to say "I'm in the shit for this".Connolly was also found guilty yesterday of three counts of breaching health and safety laws. The jury yesterday found Kennett, of Maidstone, Kent, guilty of one count of breaching safety laws.The defendants, who denied all the charges, will be sentenced later.The circumstances of the offence led the Crown Prosecution Service to charge Connolly with manslaughter by gross negligence, rather than his company with corporate manslaughter.A CPS spokeswoman said it was the "deliberate act" that led to individual charges, rather than the traditional corporate manslaughter charge, as nobody within a company would have foreseen his actions - as opposed to a prosecution for the Hatfield or Potter's Bar crashes, in which companies were accused of being liable.
