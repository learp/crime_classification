Jade Goody's husband, Jack Tweed, was jailed for 12 weeks at Harlow magistrates court today for an assault on a taxi driver.Tweed, 21, whose wife died from cancer last month, was found guilty at Epping magistrates court last month of attacking Stephen Wilkins in Epping, Essex, last May.Chairwoman of the magistrates, Margaret Webb, told Tweed the bench had considered his "change in personal circumstances" in passing the sentence."We have borne in mind the recent change in your personal circumstances and have reflected this in the length of the sentence, which would otherwise have been 18 weeks," she said.Before being handcuffed and led to the cells of the court, Tweed was told he would spend half of his sentence behind bars before being freed on licence.He was ordered to pay prosecution costs of £455 and £200 to Mr Wilkins.The conviction was the second time in six months that Tweed had been found guilty of assault.In September, he was given an 18-month jail sentence by a judge at Chelmsford crown court for hitting a 16-year-old boy with a golf club. Tweed denied the assault.He was released from prison on licence in January and had to wear a monitoring tag and observe a curfew.The curfew was relaxed to allow Tweed to spend his wedding night with Goody in February after a ceremony in Hatfield Heath, Essex.The former Big Brother contestant died barely two months later following a well-publicised battle with cancer. She was buried on 4 April.Tweed's lawyer, Tania Panagiotopoulou, mitigating, told the court today he had matured since the offence."Mr Tweed is 21. He was 20 at the time of this offence that took place 11 months ago. There has been no re-offending since that date," she said.She said Tweed "has had to mature, and mature very quickly, in the last few months"."To say that he is a changed man since May 2008 is perhaps an understatement. He has endured with dignity and maturity very difficult personal circumstances that have been well documented."He is a widower at the age of 21. His previous routine of going out with his friends and getting drunk, like he did in May – all that has been replaced."The court was told references in support of Tweed had been provided by his father, his uncle and a representative from his old school.A Marie Curie nurse and a doctor who treated Goody before her death also wrote to the court in support of Tweed.Panagiotopoulou urged the magistrates not to impose an immediate jail term. She said: "He appreciates that his past offending behaviour has let people down to a huge extent – people that matter to him."He is extremely regretful."Tweed, who wore a grey suit with open-collared white shirt, carried an overnight bag to court.
