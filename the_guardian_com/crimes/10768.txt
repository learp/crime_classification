The Conservatives today announced they would recruit an extra 40,000 police officers for England and Wales if they won the next general election.Oliver Letwin, the shadow home secretary, said: "This radical policy will have an enormous impact on the fight against crime.""An effective system of neighbourhood policing is vital to reclaiming our streets for the honest citizen," Mr Letwin added. "If we tackle criminality and disorder effectively, we need far more police officers than are currently being proposed by the government."The Conservatives claim the proposal will not require an increase in taxation as it will be funded by the £1.4bn to £1.7bn a year they believe they would save by scrapping the existing asylum process and replacing it with a quota-based system.Under their proposal, 40,000 officers will be recruited over an eight-year period. By the end of the first term of a Conservative government, according to their plans, there would be an extra 20,000 officers, at a cost of £980m a year.In an interview with Guardian Unlimited in January, Mr Letwin outlined his view that Britain needed to emulated American cities like New York by increasing police numbers. He told the site: "My view, based on my experience of American cities, is that you won't actually control crime on the streets until you have a large number of police officers on the streets, available to be quickly at the scene of crime."
