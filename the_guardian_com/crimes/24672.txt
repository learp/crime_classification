We've heard of the silent majority and the moral majority, but what about the criminal majority? The "respectable" middle classes may not rob banks, burgle houses or mug people in the street but they're up to their necks in law-breaking.According to a study published today, almost two-thirds of the people surveyed regularly engage in "crimes of everyday life" - such as fiddling insurance claims, pilfering from their employers, falsely claiming benefit, paying cash in hand to avoid VAT, falsely claiming refunds when not entitled to them, or failing to disclose faults when selling secondhand goods.The report concludes: "The 'law-abiding majority' which politicians like to address is a chimera ... The law-abiding majority not only do not abide by the law, they also do not believe in the value of laws and rules, shrugging them off in pursuit of their interests and desires."So come on, own up. When did you last break the law, and why did you feel it was OK to do so?
