Police investigating the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy in Bury, Greater Manchester, today arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of murder.Officers searching for Joe Geeling, who vanished on his way home from school yesterday, found a body in Whitehead Park, Bury, at 11am today. An hour later, a 14-year-old boy who attends to the same school as the missing youngster was arrested, Superintendent Peter Scofield, of Greater Manchester police, said. Supt Scofield said he could not yet confirm the identity of the body, but said the arrest had been made "following the line of inquiries" into Joe's disappearance.He said the suspect lived near the scene of the discovery, adding that an attempt had been made to conceal the body. Joe had been suffering from cystic fibrosis and required daily medical treatment for the condition. Police said he normally walked home from St Gabriel's School with a friend, but could have been alone yesterday because the friend was not in class. The park where the body was found is to the north-west of St Gabriel's, in the opposite direction to Joe's home. However, police said pupils reported seeing Joe around halfway between his school and home, about a mile south-east of St Gabriel's, at just after 4pm yesterday.
