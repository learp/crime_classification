A man wrongly identified by the Daily Mail as a suspect in the Ipswich prostitute murders has been found dead at his home.Gareth Huw Roberts was pictured in the paper and mistakenly named as Steve Wright, the man charged with the five Suffolk murders.Mr Roberts was found dead along with another man at his home in Pwllheli, north Wales. Both men are believed to be in their 40s.North Wales police said the deaths were being treated as "unexplained" but not suspicious at this stage. Post mortem examinations were taking place today following the discovery yesterday morning.Mr Roberts' picture appeared in the Daily Mail on December 21. The error arose because both Mr Roberts and Steve Wright had worked as stewards on the QE2 and were pictured in the same photograph.The newspaper printed a formal apology to Mr Roberts the following day and agreed to pay compensation. The paper said the picture had been supplied by a "normally reliable news agency"."Mr Roberts has no connection to the inquiry," the Mail added. "We apologise to Mr Roberts and his family for our error and any embarrassment caused."John White, who lived at the flat with Mr Roberts, said he had known him for 24 years."Gareth had worked with me at a hotel in Llandudno where I was the manager and he was head waiter," he told the north Wales paper the Daily Post. "It's a hell of a shock."· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
