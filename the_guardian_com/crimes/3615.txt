There was an "altercation" in which the victim was fatally injured.A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. The attack happened just yards from where 21-year-old Shaun Chambers was stabbed to death in September.The latest attack happened on Sunday afternoon at a block of flats in Walworth, south-east London.The Metropolitan police and London ambulance service were called to Latimer House, Beaconsfield Road, at 4.20pm, where the victim, from Peckham, south-east London, was subsequently pronounced dead.A postmortemwas taking place today at Greenwich mortuary.Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner, leading the investigation, said: "My thoughts go out to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless killing. That it should happen at this time of year is all the more tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers."There is no evidence to suggest that this attack was gang-related and Dogan did not have any history of gang activity."I know there will also be local speculation about the fact that this murder took place on the same spot that Shaun Chambers was killed on 26 September, but I would like to make clear that there is no link between the incidents aside from the location."Anybody with information is asked to call the incident room on 020 8358 0200 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.The boy and woman who were arrested remain in custody at a south London police station.
