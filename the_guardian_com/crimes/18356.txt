Two men are to stand trial accused of plotting to "assault and murder" the Celtic manager Neil Lennon and other prominent people in a sectarian parcel-bombing campaign.Trevor Muirhead, 43, and Neil McKenzie, 42, are alleged to have sent the suspect devices to Lennon, the Celtic lawyer and QC Paul McBride, Trish Godman, the former deputy presiding officer of the Scottish parliament earlier this year, and an Irish republican group in Glasgow.The prosecution alleges that the improvised explosive devices (IED) used a potentially lethal combination of nails, an explosive substance or petrol and that both men embarked on a sectarian conspiracy. The devices could have caused "severe injury and death".The pair are accused of buying the ingredients for the bombs – nails, envelopes, plastic travel bottles, digital watches and other items – at shops near their homes in Stevenson, Ayrshire, including a branch of B&Q.They are also accused of acquiring cream peroxide containing triacetone triperoxide (TATP), after inducing another man to buy it.The two men also face an alternative charge contrary to the Explosive Substances Act of "unlawfully and maliciously conspiring" to endanger life or cause serious injury. All the charges are said to have been aggravated by religious prejudice.In several other charges, they are accused of sending an item to Lennon in early March at Celtic's home ground with the intention of inducing him to believe that it would "explode or ignite".The men are further accused of threatening to plant an IED outside a police station in May knowing the bomb allegations were being investigated, of trying to destroy evidence and possessing the peroxide chemical with the intent to endanger life.Both men pleaded not guilty. Their trial is due to start in November.
