A fourth man has been charged with the murder of Mary-Ann Leneghan after two teenagers yesterday appeared in court accused of killing the 16-year-old from Reading.Llewellyn Adams, 23, of Balham, south London, was charged with murder, attempted murder and kidnap in connection with the attacks on Mary-Ann and her 18-year-old friend. Earlier, Adrian Thomas, 19, of Battersea, south London, and Indrit Krasniqi, 18, from Chiswick, west London, spoke only to confirm their names and give their addresses during a 30-minute hearing at Reading magistrates court. They were also charged with murder, kidnap and attempting to murder Mary-Ann's female friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons. They were remanded in custody to appear before Reading crown court on Thursday. On Saturday Jamaile Morally, 21, of Balham, was also remanded in custody and will appear before the crown court on Thursday charged with Mary-Ann's murder, the attempted murder and kidnap of her friend and an additional charge of raping her friend. Mary-Ann and her friend were abducted on May 6 from a car park in Reading. They were beaten and sexually abused before being left in the nearby Prospect Park. Mary-Ann died from a stab wound to the neck but her friend survived despite being shot in the head and raised the alarm early on May 7 when she flagged down a motorist. Thames Valley police said they were examining a car seized in London to determine whether it was the vehicle used in the abduction. A total of 13 people have since been questioned, including the four men who have been charged. One man remains in police custody but two women and a man arrested in London on Friday have been released on police bail, as have a woman arrested in the West Midlands on Wednesday, a man arrested in London on Monday and three men arrested in Reading last Saturday morning.
