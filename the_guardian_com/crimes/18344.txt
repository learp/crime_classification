A group of men accused of planning a huge suicide terror attack tried to fund it with £20,000 from a payday lender and posed as self-employed traders to try to raise £33,000 in business loans, a court heard.The trial at Woolwich crown court has already heard that the alleged leaders, Ashik Ali, 27, Irfan Naseer, 31, and Irfan Khalid, 27, all from Birmingham, raised at least £12,000 by posing as Muslim Aid charity street collectors. It was told that they applied for the loans after losing more than £9,000 of that money playing the foreign currency markets.At the time, the three are alleged to have been planning and fundraising for a series of suicide bombs that could have been bigger than the 7 July 2005 attacks.While they were being watched by police officers as they travelled around Birmingham in September last year, Khalid is recorded as having described the group as "suicide bombers driving around ready to take on England", the jury heard.Rahim Ahmed, an associate who lost the group money in bad foreign currency trading, applied online for £20,000 from Yes Loans on 15 September last year, claiming he was a £1,100-a-month self-employed optical glazer who needed it to pay for a wedding. He was refused.Naseer, Khalid and Ali deny engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts Naseer is accused on five counts, Khalid on four and Ali on three, all between Christmas Day 2010 and 19 September last year.
