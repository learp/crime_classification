Police numbers have stopped falling for the first time since 1993 and stand at 124,163, according to Home Office figures published yesterday.The figures show that the Metropolitan police has continued to face a severe recruitment problem, having suffering a net loss of 1,253 officers between March and September, but that London's problems are not typical of the rest of the country. The Home Office statistical bulletin also shows that the recruitment of people from ethnic minority communities to the police has begun to increase since the implementation of the Macpherson report on the Stephen Lawrence case. An extra 314 black and Asian officers were recruited between March and September, bringing the total number to 3,070 - a rise of 11%. More than half of them joined the Met. In all, 26 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales have seen their strength increase this year, the 3,271 recruits who joined outnumbering for the first time for several years the 2,884 who retired or resigned. Recruitment has risen sharply this year - the previous six months brought only 2,120 new recruits - as a result of the introduction of a new national crime fighting fund that will finance a further 9,000 recruits over the next three years. The overall strength recorded on September 30 was just seven officers fewer than the figure for March 31. Moreover, it is believed that the number of serving officers, particularly constables, increased further in October and November. The police minister, Charles Clarke, said the figures showed that the fall in police numbers in London was not an indication of what was happening across the country. New London weighting allowances, which increased the starting salary in the capital to Â£23,000, special housing initiatives, and now talks about providing a free travelcard for every officer were all being used to tackle the problem.
