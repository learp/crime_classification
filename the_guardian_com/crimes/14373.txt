A man playing cricket with his son died as the pair were pelted with sticks and stones by a mob of youngsters, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. The jeering group was made up of children aged between 10 and 13, it was alleged.Five youths deny Ernest Norton's manslaughter in February last year, and violent disorder. Mr Norton, 67, suffered a heart attack and died after collapsing at outdoor tennis courts at Erith leisure centre, south-east London.David Fisher QC, prosecuting, said Mr Norton was playing cricket with his 17-year-old son, James, when a group of 15 youths gathered at the fence and began shouting abuse. "As the abuse worsened, the group began throwing stones and pieces of wood at father and son."Ernest Norton was struck at least twice on the head by these missiles. One of the stones hit him on the left side of his face causing a fracture to his cheekbone."He collapsed and suffered a heart attack. He received medical attention at the scene but was pronounced dead later that afternoon."The mob, allegedly including the defendants, ran away.Mr Fisher added: "This was a completely unnecessary, pointless and random attack by these five defendants. They are jointly responsible for this attack and jointly responsible for his death."Mr Norton underwent a triple bypass operation in 1977 but had a "fit and active lifestyle", Mr Fisher said. He was in good health on the Sunday when he died, but "the stress and trauma of abuse and a physical attack would make him vulnerable to a heart attack".The defendants, brothers aged 12 and 13, one boy aged 13, and two 14-year-olds, sat in the dock with their parents.The hearing involves some of the youngest defendants to appear at the Old Bailey. The trial continues.
