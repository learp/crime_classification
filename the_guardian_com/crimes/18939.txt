A teenage rioter, accused of being part of a mob of masked looters, smashed his way into one of London's top restaurants and robbed terrified diners during last summer's riots, a court has heard.Ali Abdul-Waga, 19, was part of a group which stormed the two Michelin-starred the Ledbury restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, forcing customers onto the floor and demanding they hand over jewellery and mobile phones, it was alleged.The attack was part of a "campaign of disorder", in which a moped was burned, passengers forced off two buses and searched for valuables, a shopkeeper was assaulted and a taxi driver robbed of his mobile, a jury at Inner London crown court was told.Staff at the Ledbury tried to bolt the door and barricade themselves in but a group forced their way inside on 8 August last year. CCTV footage showed staff trying to defend customers with kitchen tools as the gang, some armed with baseball bats and bottles, ransacked the dining room.Earlier a Gala Casino, an Office shoe store and a restaurant called the Bumpkin had been looted, the court heard.Ben Kelleher, prosecuting, said the attack occurred two days after the start of the disorder which began in London on Saturday 6 August.On the night, young men, "who covered themselves up with hoods and masks" gathered in the Queensway, Notting Hill area from 8pm onwards, and things became "extreme" by 10.30pm, he said. Seventeen people had since been prosecuted, the court heard.CCTV footage showed looters dropping off some of the items they had taken at a nearby hostel before turning their attentions to the Ledbury, which was last year placed 34th in the S. Pellegrino top restaurants in the world list.Kelleher said the fear in customer's minds was clear in footage shown to jurors as the group smashed their way in shouting : "Get on the floor, we want your property," he said.Customers were forced to kneel in a corner before being robbed. Staff came forward and "put up a bit of a fight, very bravely, and managed to get the attackers to leave the premises," he said. Customers were then ushered to the safety of a celler and offered a complimentary drink. Abdul-Waga, of Paddington, west London, denies two counts of robbery including robbing staff and customers at the Ledbury, one of violent disorder and conspiracy to commit burglary.Three co-defendants Nasir Muhsen, 18, of Willesden Green, north-west London, Dean Burke, 19, of Paddington, west London, and Caleb Williams, 22, of no fixed address, are not charged with robbing the Ledbury but face charges of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and burglary, which they deny.The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, continues.
