The wife of a Pakistani politician murdered in north London appealed for help to catch his killer today.Imran Farooq, 50, died on Friday from stab wounds and head injuries after he was attacked outside his home in Edgware. Police believe the killing of Farooq, a prominent member of the Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) party, may have been politically motivated.His widow, Shumaila Imran, 42, said the death of the "dedicated family man" had left her and others in "shock and disbelief". Speaking at New Scotland Yard, she said "someone, somewhere" holds important information about the murder.She added: "I want to make my own personal appeal for help in catching the people who killed my husband, Dr Imran Farooq."Dr Imran Farooq was a dedicated family man, a loving father and a loving husband. His murder a week ago has devastated me and left our family in a state of shock and disbelief. My husband was on his way home from work when he was set upon and attacked."I want to appeal today for anyone who has any information about the attack on Imran to come forward and tell the police what they know. Someone, somewhere knows something about my husband's murder."Mrs Imran, who has two young sons, was supported by a relative as she spoke to media from Britain and Pakistan.She said: "It does not matter how insignificant this information may seem to you â€“ it could be absolutely vital to the police investigation."I would like to thank everyone who has supported me and my family and sent us their best wishes and condolences."I would also like to thank the police for their help and support during this very difficult time."Farooq was found with fatal injuries outside his home before 5pm last Thursday.Witnesses said they saw two men of Asian origin fighting.Farooq was living in exile after fleeing his homeland 11 years ago following death threats.His murder sparked violence in Karachi, where vehicles and shops were set alight despite a call for 10 days of peaceful mourning.Political allies said Farooq had many enemies because of his outspoken comments but did not have a bodyguard.The investigation is being handled by detectives from Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command.This signalled that investigators believe the crime is political, but senior officers said they were keeping an open mind.Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Basu, borough commander for Barnet, said officers would return to the scene tonight to speak to motorists and other potential witnesses.Police have also published thousands of appeal posters and leaflets in Urdu and Gujarati.Basu said: "Dr Farooq's murder shocked the Edgware, Pakistani and Muslim communities and I would like to reassure everyone that detectives are doing all they possibly can to catch those responsible."The MQM is one of Pakistan's major parties, the largest in the coalition governing Karachi and an important member of the federal government in Islamabad.Independent observers accuse the party of being involved in illegal activities and hundreds of its supporters have been killed in the past 20 years in gang warfare.
