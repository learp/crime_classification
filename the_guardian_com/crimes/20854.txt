Tony Blair promised to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. His successor Gordon Brown may be about to out-tough him. Louise Casey, the former head of the government's Respect unit, has drawn up a series of radical measures to fight crime. Plans to make people serving community sentences wear visible jackets identifying that they are criminals and the possible publication of posters and websites with pictures of offenders are likely to be the most controversial of the plans.Alongside the Guardian story on the paper's front page is a picture of people kneeling in orange GuantaÂ´namo-style boiler suits with their hands behind their heads. It sends a shiver down the spine until you realise it relates to a separate article about protests against George Bush in London. Even if the criminals are more likely to be forced to wear high visibility bibs - according to the Mail - rather than orange boiler suits, the plans are unlikely to go down well with civil liberties' groups still fuming over attempts to extend the period terror suspects can be held without trial. Not that Casey will care about anything like that. The woman who the Times says is known as the Asbo Queen once said: "Sometimes I wish ... some of the people who write letters to the Guardian could just see it from the point of view of the people in the communities." Are the proposals an effective way to address concerns that offenders' rights outweigh those of the law-abiding public? Or is this just a misguided attempt to appear to be tough on criminals?This is an extended extract from the Wrap, our daily digest of the papers
