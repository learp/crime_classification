A stolen bus caused chaos on a 30-mile rampage yesterday, crashing into a shop and several vehicles including a police car before one of its tyres was spiked by a stinger device on the M1.A man and woman in their 20s were arrested after the single-decker Arriva bus travelled more than three miles on its remaining tyres and a wheel hub, careering into the motorway's central reservation several times, before sliding to a halt.The bus was stolen in the centre of Wakefield at 4.20pm on Sunday, when it was standing empty. West Yorkshire police are investigating whether it was hotwired or started normally when Arriva staff were busy elsewhere.It charted an erratic course out of the town before weaving through parts of Dewsbury, Batley and Horbury. After a spate of emergency calls, pursuit was taken up by police cars and the West Yorkshire force helicopter.A police spokesman said the stingers were deployed on the M1 slip road at junction 39 when the bus turned on to the motorway because of the pursuit. Police had earlier closed the section north of the junction and there was no traffic as the bus swerved erratically before stopping near junction 41."We managed to stop the motorway and allowed members of the public to get off," said the spokesman. "The bus collided with the barriers on several occasions and basically the driver managed to destroy the front of it."No one was injured in the episode and police are questioning a woman aged 20 and a man aged 26. The motorway was closed for several hours to allow the removal of the bus and a trail of debris between the two junctions.
