Police are digging up the garden of a jailed paedophile after receiving an anonymous letter about the fate of two children who went missing more than 30 years ago, it emerged last night.Officers from the Metropolitan police began searching the grounds of the uninhabited house in Croydon, south London, following the tip-off, a police spokesman said.The Sun reported that Leslie Ford-Thrussell lived at the house before he was jailed for 12 years in 2004 for assaulting children aged 13 and under.The 72-year-old landscape gardener reportedly admitted seven counts of taking and making obscene images and was convicted of 37 crimes, including rape and indecent assault, between 1986 and 2003.The letter alleged that Ford-Thrussell had murdered two children and buried their bodies in the back garden of the semi-detached home, the newspaper said.A Scotland Yard spokesman said last night: "I can confirm that police are conducting a search at the premises in Walton Green in New Addington as part of an investigation which follows an allegation made anonymously to police that there were human remains buried on the site."He said inquiries were continuing.
