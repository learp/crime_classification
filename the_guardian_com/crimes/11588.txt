Police hunting criminals are increasingly seeking information from electronically stored travel records, such as those created by users of the popular Oyster card in London.Figures disclosed today show a huge leap in police requests to Transport for London, which operates the Oyster cards used to travel on buses, trains and the underground.Just seven information requests were made by police in the whole of 2004, compared with 61 requests made in January this year alone.Overall, police have requested to see journey information 243 times, and been given it 229 times, according to figures obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request, the Press Association reported.Some civil liberties campaigners are opposed to systems such as Oyster, which is used by more than 5 million people, fearing the growth of a "Big Brother" surveillance society.Today a Metropolitan police spokeswoman said requests to access Oyster information were a "straightforward investigative tool".She said officers decided on a "case-by-case" basis whether they needed the information to help them trace an individual's movements.A TfL spokesman said that with 5 million Oyster card users, 65 requests for information per month was a small proportion.The spokesman said: "Transport for London complies fully with the Data Protection Act. Information on individual travel is kept for a maximum of eight weeks and is only used for customer service purposes, to check charges for particular journeys or for refund inquiries."A very few authorised individuals can access this data and there is no bulk disclosure of personal data to third parties for any commercial purposes. There is no bulk disclosure of personal data to any law enforcement agency. If information is disclosed, it is always done so in accordance with the Data Protection Act after a case-by-case evaluation."Police requests must be made under Association of Chief Police Officers guidance."Introduced in 2003, Oyster cards rely on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology embedded in silicon chips and antennas which transmit information to a receiver, for example in a barrier at a tube station.When hit by a radio signal, an electrical charge is generated in the card which is enough to transmit information. The technology was first used during the second world war in bugging devices.Details of where the card has been swiped are kept on a database and could show someone's journey across London's transport network. But authorities could not, for example, locate someone with an Oyster card when it was away from a receiver.Police use of travel records was highlighted recently in the hunt for those responsible for the death of the City lawyer Tom ap Rhys Pryce in January. The 31-year-old was stabbed to death just yards from his home in Willesden, north-west London, as he walked home from Kensal Green tube station.The investigation focused on one particular man the day after the killing when he attempted to use the dead man's Oyster card at the same station.Each card has a unique identification number and users can access details online of their travel over the previous eight weeks. Last month it emerged that people were using the information to track their partners' movements.Oyster supporters, including London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, argue it is a cheaper and more efficient method of buying tickets.
