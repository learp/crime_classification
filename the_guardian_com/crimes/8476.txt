A plumber standing trial after he tweeted and blogged claims about his wife's alleged affair said his case had "big legal implications".Ian Puddick, 41, set up a series of websites to vent his anger over his wife's alleged 10-year relationship with her boss at a reinsurance advice firm.Speaking outside City of Westminster magistrates' court in London ahead of his trial for harassment, he claimed the case involved "an appalling abuse of power"."It is a very, very interesting story. I wish it was happening to somebody else and not me," he said."But there are obviously big legal implications for the press and for the public. I've stood my ground."Puddick, a plumber from east London, is accused of forcing the unidentified director to resign from his post as a result of his claims about the alleged affair.Lawyers believe the three-day hearing could help define the limits of free expression online.Puddick, who is now back with his wife, will enter a not guilty plea and claims police spent Â£1m investigating allegations against him.His legal team, led by Michael Wolkind QC, will examine the actions of the City of London police, who sent its serious crimes unit to raid his home and office in search of evidence.The prosecution claims the plumber's actions forced the director to leave his position due to stress.The case is being followed by legal and media experts as the battle to regulate what is disseminated through websites and on Twitter is waged in the courts.Recent cases involving injunctions have also raised questions over freedom of speech and the regulation of the internet.
