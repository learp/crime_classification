No one has been jailed for selling a knife to an under-16 for almost a decade, figures revealed yesterday. Home Office statistics showed the last time a prison sentence was handed down for the offence was in 1997.Only nine people were convicted of selling a knife to an under-16 in 2004, the lowest figure for three years, the data showed. Six of those escaped with a fine.Apart from the nine convictions for selling knives to minors, only one other person had been convicted under the Knives Act 1997, for the offence of unlawful marketing of knives.The figures were given in a Home Office parliamentary written answer at the end of last year but have come to light as concern escalates about knife crime.The first UK knife amnesty for 10 years was launched last week as Britain's most senior police officer called for the introduction of mandatory prison sentences for those caught illicitly carrying knives.The calls came after a 15-year-old, Kiyan Prince, was stabbed to death outside his school in north-west London earlier this month. On Friday another teenage boy was taken to hospital after being stabbed at his school in Birmingham.A Home Office spokesman said: "Sentencing is a matter for the courts. The maximum sentence for selling a knife to an under-16 is two years' imprisonment, and we are raising the age limit to 18 under the violent crime reduction bill."He added: "We want to send a very strong message through our amnesty campaign that the street is no place to carry a knife."We want to extend that message to retailers who need to ensure they don't break the law by selling knives and bladed weapons to young people under 16."But Liberal Democrat MP Richard Younger-Ross, who asked the questions, said: "Raising the age limit is pointless unless you're going to prosecute people for selling these weapons, which the government are not doing."We need to crack down on people selling knives and people carrying knives, increasing the sentence for both offences."He added: "I was very surprised that these figures were so low."Just nine people sentenced in the year, even though government figures show 2% of children aged between 11 and 15 admit to carrying a knife for 'defensive purposes', which amounts to 58,000 children."
