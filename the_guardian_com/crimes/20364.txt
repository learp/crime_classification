Police have arrested two people in connection with an attack on a 93-year-old woman who was severely beaten in her own home.Emma Winnall is believed to have been assaulted in her bed at her home in Moseley, Birmingham, between 9pm on 30 April and 9am the following morning, when she was found by her carer.West Midlands police said on Thursday that a woman, 56, and a 28-year-old man were arrested at their home in the Hall Green area of Birmingham just before 6.30am on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to a police station in the West Midlands.The force said the dawn arrests were made after routine police inquiries and were not a result of information from the public.A spokesman said Winnall, who suffered horrific injuries including a fractured skull and a partially severed finger as well as a broken arm and wrist, remains in a stable condition in hospital.Despite the developments, police urged anyone with any information to contact West Midlands police on 101.A reward of up to Â£5,000 has been offered by the independent charity Crimestoppers for anyone who contacts them on 0800 555 111 or via their website and provides information which leads to the arrest and conviction of Winnall's attacker.Last week Winnall's daughter issued an emotional appeal for information.Joyce Blencoe said: "It's broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum in hospital manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came."To see your mum viciously beaten and covered in blood is the most horrific nightmare."At the same media conference, Detective Chief Inspector Sab Johal said the "horrific" attack was a "unique offence".Police have previously said the motive for the attack remains unclear, and they believe nothing was stolen.
