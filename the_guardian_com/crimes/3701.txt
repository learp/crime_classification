A 16-year-old boy has drowned after he was thrown into a lake by a gang who pelted him with rocks to stop him climbing out of the water.Shane Owoo died after an argument with a group of men who are believed to have pushed him into Lunt Pool in Bilston, Wolverhampton. As West Midlands police began a murder investigation yesterday, a friend described how the teenager tried to pull himself from the water, but was beaten back.Kevin Smith, 17, said the argument began on Saturday when Shane was accused of stealing a bicycle. "One of these lads grabbed Shane and threw him into the water. He started to climb out but to stop him from doing so they were throwing rocks, stones, anything they could find."Police searched the flooded clay pit for four hours on Saturday afternoon before calling in divers who eventually recovered the teenager's body yesterday morning.West Midlands police have arrested three men in their early 20s in connection with the death, and appealed last night for witnesses to come forward.
