A teenager stalked by a predatory killer as she walked home at night made a dash for safety, only for him to mow her down, drive over her and reverse over her again before speeding off and leaving her for dead, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Levi Bellfield's alleged attack on Kate Sheedy, 18, lasted little more than a minute. But it left her with life-threatening injuries, including a collapsed lung and terrible internal damage to her stomach and liver.Ms Sheedy, who was head girl at Gumley House convent school in Twickenham, had just got off a bus on her way home after a celebration with schoolfriends on May 28 2004, the jury was told.She had her keys out, ready to let herself in to the home she shared with her mother, Eileen, and sister, when she became suspicious of a car parked with its engine running but without lights.Brian Altman, prosecuting, said that Ms Sheedy thought the car was going to drive off but it "without warning and quite deliberately performed a U-turn" and drove directly at her."It struck her and drove over her but that did not suffice" said Mr Altman. "It then reversed over her before moving off at speed in the direction from which she had come."She spent three weeks in hospital, two of them in intensive care. She had to have surgery on her liver and back.The car, according to Ms Sheedy, was a white Toyota Previa with blacked out windows. Mr Altman told the court CCTV footage from a nearby pub captured the people carrier drive past the bus as Ms Sheedy got off and then pull over - the same behaviour exhibited by a car which followed another alleged victim Marsha McDonnell in 2003.Bellfield, a former nightclub bouncer who ran a wheelclamping business, drove such a car at the time of the attack, the jury was told.He is alleged to have driven around the streets of west London following buses to target lone young women and kill them.Yesterday, Dominique and Claude-Francois Delagrange, the parents of Amelie, 22, a French student allegedly murdered by Bellfield two months after he attacked Ms Sheedy, arrived in court from Hanvoile in Normandy.There were "similarities of fact and system" between the attacks, the court heard.Mr Altman said Bellfield's alleged attack on hairdresser Irma Dragoshi, 34, in December 2003, proved his capacity for violent behaviour towards women.Bellfield, from West Drayton, west London, denies murdering Ms Delagrange and another woman, Marsha McDonnell.He also denies the attempted murder of Ms Sheedy, the attempted murder of Ms Dragoshi and causing her grievous bodily harm with intent and the kidnap and false imprisonment of Anna-Maria Rennie in October 2003.The trial continues.
