Rupert Saunders, 36, a city banker from Tooting in south London, owned the 26ft (8m) yacht, Ouzo, with his brother Jamie. On the evening of August 20, he set out from Bembridge on the Isle of Wight, where his family has a home, en route to Devon to take part in the Dartmouth regatta. Also onboard were his friends James Meaby and Jason Downer.The Ouzo was 24 years old but well maintained and equipped. Saunders took the Ouzo out 20-30 times a year and had sailed on other yachts up to 49ft (15m) in length.He was a trained skipper, yachtmaster and maritime radio operator and was said to be very safety conscious, ensuring nobody drank alcohol aboard the boat and insisting lifejackets were worn even below decks.He met Meaby at university and Downer at school. All were experienced sailors, enjoyed skiing and were fans of the London Harlequins rugby team.Jason Downer, 35, a city banker from Broadstairs in Kent, was a friend and yachting companion of the Saunders family and had sailed on board Ouzo many times. He was also trained as a skipper and raced a 38ft (11.5m) yacht. He lived in London but visited his girlfriend in Dorset most weekends. James Meaby, 36, a sales manager from Tooting in south London, was also a friend and yachting companion of the Saunders. He had also sailed on board Ouzo many times and raced yachts. He had overcome his initial fear of the sea and gone on to complete the same skipper training as Downer. All three men had taken part in the Dartmouth regatta in previous years.
