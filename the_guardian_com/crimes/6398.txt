The public would support reforming the penalty for murder to make life imprisonment the maximum sentence rather than mandatory, a group of penal reformers argue in a report to be published this week.The Homicide Review Advisory Group claims that, "with appropriate education … an already receptive public mind could develop in the general direction long favoured by legal experts and the judiciary".One of the legal experts behind the report is the writer Sir Louis Blom-Cooper. When he first became a barrister, almost 60 years ago, all murderers were hanged. Now 85, he campaigned first for the abolition of capital punishment and – once that was achieved in the 1960s – an end to the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.His short paper takes the case for reform as read, while recognising that no government will change the law while it believes that this would be unacceptable to public opinion.That has been the position of every government in power since the death penalty was abolished.Earlier this year, the justice minister, Lord McNally, told parliament that the coalition had no plans to change the law, while hinting that the Liberal Democrats would have supported reform if it had been up to them.Blom-Cooper's paper does not even argue that public opinion is yet on his side. It says that a fully representative opinion poll would be too expensive for the academic research bodies to fund.So it relies instead on research published last year by the Nuffield Foundation which found no evidence of widespread public support for automatically sentencing all convicted murderers to life imprisonment.Blom-Cooper and his colleagues accept that this research is not sufficient "to overturn at a stroke established views which rely on long-held beliefs about public opinion".However, they argue, the Nuffield findings "seriously challenge some political and policy positions so long as those involved are prepared to take an evidence-based approach to emotive policy issues".The Blom-Cooper paper recognises that a publicity campaign could help change public opinion. But that would require "very considerable effort and resources".On the other hand, the media "have potential for maintaining the status quo" by not pushing for reform. That is because "readers and viewers tend to absorb messages which reinforce their current beliefs and ignore dissonant messages".It would be very tempting to use this column to launch a campaign for reform. The arguments are overwhelmingly in favour: murder varies in gravity from a mass attack by terrorists to hastening the death of a terminally ill relative.It is wrong in principle to pass the same sentence in both such cases and it is misleading to give people the impression that those sentenced to life imprisonment will necessarily spend the rest of their lives behind bars.If life sentences were no longer mandatory, they could and would still be imposed in the most serious cases. Those serving fixed-term sentences would still be subject to supervision once released on parole. We would no longer need to maintain increasingly artificial distinctions between murder and manslaughter.I am happy to explain this to anyone who cares to listen. But I'm not persuaded that I should be campaigning against a widely held belief that all murderers deserve life imprisonment. If people take comfort from believing in an illusion, is it my job to persuade them that they are wrong?Public Opinion and the Penalty for Murder, Report of the Homicide Review Advisory Group on the Mandatory Sentence of Life Imprisonment for Murder (HomRAG), Waterside Press, £7.99
