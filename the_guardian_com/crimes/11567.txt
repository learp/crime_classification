The government was yesterday challenged to give MPs a vote on police pay amid signs that a Labour rebellion on the issue is starting to spiral out of control.Up to 20,000 police are due to march outside the Home Office next Wednesday, with another demonstration planned for the Redditch constituency of the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, this month.Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, yesterday urged Smith to give MPs a vote on the issue, and is putting private pressure on the Conservative whips to use one of their opposition day debates this week to embarrass the government.A total of 205 MPs have put their name to a motion calling for the police to be given their full pay award.Of this number 109 are Labour MPs, many of whom have been struck by the number of emails from the public and police. It is understood that two previous home secretaries, Charles Clarke and John Reid, are surprised that Smith sought the permission of the chancellor, Alistair Darling, before settling the award.Gordon Brown is insisting he will not relent on his tough line, and is hoping that talks on a two- or three-year deal could find a way out of what is looking like a serious political challenge to the government's authority. Smith has suggested the two- or three-year award would no longer be linked to the private sector pay index but to a public sector average.Faced by outrage from some Labour MPs during Home Office questions, she insisted the offer was based on fairness.The government's determination to hold the line was strengthened by local government unions tabling a demand for a 6% rise, or 50p an hour. The demand was immediately rejected by the Local Government Association. Brian Baldwin, chair of the local government employers, said: "It must be borne in mind that if the pay settlement is set too high then local authorities will have to make unpleasant choices between cutting frontline services and laying off staff, neither of which either the unions or the employers want to see."The Police Federation, representing rank and file police in England and Wales, is due to meet Smith on Wednesday.Smith withheld three months' back pay, reducing the increase from 2.5% to 1.9%. It has been estimated that the staging shaves £30m to £40m off police budgets and, in the view of Home Office minister Tony McNulty, would save 800 jobs. Backbenchers are angry that police community support officers funded by local government have received the full 2.5%.The atmosphere between government and police may worsen with the publication of a report this month by Ronnie Flanagan, the former Northern Ireland chief constable, into future efficiency. It will be followed by a green paper in the spring likely to promise that the police will be freed of Whitehall intervention where they are shown to be efficient.
