The distinctive, long-barrelled Smith and Wesson revolver used in the shooting of Rhys was probably manufactured in 1915 for the British army and intended for use in the first world war, rather than the Liverpool streets.It was designed to fire 0.455in cartridges but has at some point been modified to accept longer 0.45in colt cartridges. Inevitably, considering its age, it is said to be in poor condition.Mark Robinson, a forensics expert who examined the weapon, told Liverpool crown court: "I found it to be in working order but in pretty poor external condition. Lots of the original finish was corroded."A YouTube video called Crocky Edz was shown to the jury. In it, a Smith and Wesson revolver, which may have been the murder weapon, was shown. In the clip, masked youngsters also displayed sawn-off shotguns, revolvers and a Soviet, self-loading pistol.Merseyside police say they are not aware of the revolver being used in any other gangland killings.
