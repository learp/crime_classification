A helpline for reporting petty crimes and antisocial behaviour would be set up under Tory plans for New York-style policing in London.The 333 number would aim to take pressure off the emergency services, following research showing that nearly three-quarters of calls to Britain's 999 service were not real emergencies. Steve Norris, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, argues that petty crimes such as graffiti and vandalism are pushed to the bottom of the list by police but that combating them could make Londoners feel safer.Norris will travel to New York tomorrow for talks on tackling crime, including a meeting with Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor whose 'zero tolerance' policing helped slash mugging rates and clean up New York's streets. 'It is not down to the police alone to tackle crime. Having a single number, like 333, to report things like vandalism and graffiti would get everyone in the community involved in the fight against crime,' said Norris. Recent research has shown that the 999 number is being increasingly misused. Callers have rung asking for football scores or the number of a late night chemist, or when they cannot get through to their local police station. Home Office plans to introduce an equivalent of the 311 non-emergency service used in the United States stalled after phone chiefs were unable to supply a number.
