Thieves stole a prosthetic hand belonging to a disabled biker after he left it gripped on to his handlebar, it emerged today.Jack Baker, 19, lost his right arm when he was badly injured in a head-on crash with a bus in Bristol in May. He later had a prosthetic hand fitted so that he could continue riding a specially adapted motorbike.But the hand, which costs £450 to replace, was taken when he left it attached to his 400cc Suzuki DR-Z400SM while he was visiting his girlfriend in the Knowle area of the city last week. "It was the first time I had left my hand on the bike," he said. "I thought I was only going to be 10 minutes but I ended up staying for two hours."I came out and found the hand was gone. I thought it was my girlfriend's parents messing about but they said it wasn't them."I went for a look around but I couldn't see my hand anywhere. There were no kids about and no one to ask if they had seen it."I ended up jumping on my bike and going home. It's frustrating because my hand is no good to anyone else. I never thought anyone would take it." Luckily, the mechanic had already ordered another hand for racing, which he now uses for everyday uses."I went to the hospital and they said I couldn't have another one unless I paid £450, which seemed a lot," he explained."I had ordered a hand for racing just a few weeks before it got nicked because I thought it would be useful to have a spare."But I still need my old hand back. It was better quality and will last a lot longer."
