The home secretary, John Reid, is to highlight research today showing that the great majority of young offenders who go off the rails in their early years but mend their ways can live as successful a life by the age of 50 as anyone else.The findings, from the Cambridge University study in delinquent development, suggest that the most prolific criminals start early and have long criminal careers, but effective early intervention programmes - targeted especially at those under 10 - can cut crime and pay for themselves several times over.Mr Reid, who is to visit a London jail, is to tell prisoners that it may seem a hard choice to leave a life of crime on release when that may be all they have known."I know how hard it can sometimes be to stop the engrained habits of a lifetime even if they are damaging you or the ones you love," he is expected to say."But I'm willing to bet that deep down you know it's the right thing to do. And, a bit like smoking, it's never too late to give up."If you want proof just look at a study the Home Office is publishing which shows that even if you go off the rails in your early years, the great majority of people are living a successful life by the age of 50."Official figures on reconviction rates later this week are expected to show that more than 60% of adult offenders go on to commit further crimes after serving a prison sentence.Mr Reid is also to preview legislation expected in the Queen's speech next week to end the probation service's monopoly and create a "vibrant market" in the provision of courses and programmes for offenders by boosting the contribution of the voluntary sector and private companies.The home secretary will argue that the probation service is not working as well as it should and is in need of rejuvenation to tackle the rate of reoffending.However, he will make it clear that it is now time to allow others to do the job as well. "There is only so much that internal reform of the probation service can achieve. While individual probation officers are committed, professional and hard working, none of them can be experts at everything," he will say."There is no need for all of these jobs to be done by the same agency."We need to match appropriate skills to appropriate tasks to free up professional probation officers to focus on the most serious criminals in the community."The Cambridge research is based on the careers of 411 men who were first studied at the age of eight in 1961 and were living in an inner-city area of south London.The study found that 41% of them had criminal convictions, other than for motoring offences, between the ages of 10 and 50.The average criminal conviction career lasted from 19 to 28 and included five convictions.A small proportion - 7% - were chronic offenders between the ages of 14 and 35 and accounted for half of all the offences recorded in the study.The Cambridge criminologists say that early intervention programmes which tackled the most important childhood risk factors - criminality in the family, poverty, impulsiveness, poor parenting and low school attainment - would have wide-ranging benefits.
