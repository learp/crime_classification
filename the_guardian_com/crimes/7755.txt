Police investigating the disappearance of a baby snatched from his father's car 13 years ago have appealed for a man with an African accent who recently contacted them to come forward.Detectives say the man phoned the incident room in October and left a message on the answering machine saying five-month-old Ames Glover had been flown to Ghana. Ames was snatched from a locked blue Ford Sierra in South Road, Southall, in west London, on February 5 1990 while his father Paul withdrew money. He had been dressed in a blue and yellow coat, light green rompersuit and a blue and yellow hat. Inquiries proved fruitless and the case was reviewed in 2002. Suspicion fell on Mr Glover and he was arrested but later released without charge. The child's mother, Shanike Ondaatjie, 35, appealed for information in October, on what would have been her son's 14th birthday. Police are offering a Â£10,000 reward for information and would like anyone with any information to contact them on 020-8284 8561.
