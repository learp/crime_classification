Nobody likes antisocial behaviour - least of all the government. With an almost religious zeal, Tony Blair has crusaded to rid the streets of offenders and bring back the notion of "respect" to communities.Seven years on, more than 7,000 Asbos - Anti Social Behaviour Orders - have been issued, and the former Home Office minister Hazel Blears says she is "extremely encouraged that they continue to be used".But look beneath the statistics, and a different picture emerges.The British Institute for Brain Injured Children (the BIBIC) estimates that a third of all Asbos are given to children or young people with learning difficulties, ADHD, or other behavioural problems.Charities like the BIBIC believe those with "hidden" disabilities are easy prey. They point to cases like the teenager with Aspergers syndrome (a form of autism) who was told not to stare over his neighbours' fence, or the 14-year-old with the development age of seven, who has been given a curfew and tagged."Many of these children have a cognitive understanding below the legal age that an Asbo can be given, so they are in effect being set up to fail," says Vivienne Streeter, the BIBIC's family services director.The charity launched a campaign last year entitled Ain't Misbehavin to highlight their increasing concerns.Other voluntary sector organisations have followed their initiative. The National Autistic Society is monitoring the use of Asbos and the union representing family court and probation staff, Napo, is compiling a dossier of cases.Asbos can be applied for by the police (including the British transport police), local authorities and social landlords, against anyone whose behaviour causes alarm, distress or harassment. Most are imposed by magistrates' courts after civil proceedings, and may be made on the basis of hearsay evidence.Whether an individual deliberately intends to commit an antisocial act is not taken into account. Yet many people with neurological or developmental problems cannot conform to expected standards of behaviour; they do not have the faculties to do so. Their behaviour may be antisocial, but it is not necessarily deliberate.The NAS lobbied the government prior to the 2003 Antisocial Behaviour Act to include the issue of intent and says it is "disappointed" that it is not a consideration.Although it is not a criminal offence, non-compliance of an antisocial order can ultimately lead to a prison sentence.Home Office figures show that four in 10 Asbos have been breached; campaigners argue that this proves the system is failing.Asbo Concern, a coalition of individuals and organisations set up last year is calling for a wholesale government review of the use of Asbos. "Instead of getting the help and support they need, many vulnerable people are actually being stigmatised by the current policies. The system is not working," says group spokesman, Andrew Mackie.The Home Office disagrees and points to the enthusiastic take up rate of Asbos, with Ms Blears saying it "sends out a clear message to those people who persist in this behaviour that action will be taken against them".While the numbers of Asbos issued are shown on a geographical basis (with Greater Manchester taking the lead) no figures are collated centrally regarding individual circumstances.The government simply does not know - or, perhaps, does not want to know - how many of these "antisocial youths" have other problems."The data is not being collected, and from our discussions with members of the police and youth offending teams it is rapidly becoming a serious issue," says Ms Streeter.The Home office says guidance has been issued on dealing with vulnerable people who commit antisocial behaviour and Asbos are just one of a range of tools available.But charities remain unconvinced. Asbos, they say, are being used too readily with no regard for individual circumstance. They want to see more support for families under stress, and better training schemes to teach workers about hidden disabilities."This issue is escalating as a result of the zero-tolerance approach and it is time the Home Office opened its eyes to this training need, as without it, it is storing up a huge problem for society in the future," concludes Ms Streeter.Tomorrow, the Antisocial Behaviour Unit will take centre stage at a conference to update local government and social landlords on current Asbo policy. In a seminar entitled Bigger, Better, Bolder: The Latest Home Office Guidance on Asbos, the government will take the opportunity to trumpet the "success story" so far. Amid the din, charities fear their voices are not being heard.Â· Tackling Anti -Social Behaviour and Promoting Respect Policy and Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities and Registered Social Landlords, May 9 2006, London
