A coroner said yesterday it was a tragedy that it had taken six deaths before life-saving reforms were introduced at a women's prison in Wilmslow, Cheshire.Nicholas Rheinberg, the Cheshire coroner, was speaking at the end of the inquest into the death of Julie Bernadette Walsh, 39, from Liverpool, who was the latest of six women to die in Styal prison in 12 months. The jury found that Ms Walsh had died in August 2003 after swallowing a lethal dose of an antidepressant. The medicine had been stolen by another inmate from a drug trolley left unattended by a nurse. Four other women had drunk from the 500ml bottle but recovered after hospital treatment. In a narrative verdict the jury said Ms Walsh's death was "an unintentional consequence" of drinking the medicine. "The contributory factor to her death was the failure of the nurse to secure the medication on the trolley." Mr Rheinberg said in 2001 he had written to the prison to support a doctor's request for a detoxification unit at the jail. Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, issued a similar call a year later. "Most of the recommendations made by the Prison Service have been implemented," Mr Rheinberg said. "It is a tragedy that it has taken six deaths to produce that." Deborah Coles, co-director of Inquest, which works with relatives of people who die in custody, called for a judicial inquiry into issues raised by the deaths.
