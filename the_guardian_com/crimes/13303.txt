A coroner took the highly unusual step yesterday of asking two high court judges to quash his accidental death verdict on an Oxford University rower who died in Spain during a training session on the Ebro river in freak weather. The South Manchester coroner, John Pollard, asked the judges to direct that a fresh inquest be held into the death of 21-year-old Leo Blockley, a post-graduate maths student, after the emergence of credible evidence relating to safety issues at the time of the death in December 2000.Lord Justice Maurice Kay, sitting with Mr Justice Moses, said all sides had consented to a new inquiry. A storm hit the rowers and one of two motorised boats with coaching staff accompanying them suffered a problem. Mr Blockley and colleagues went to help, but their boat filled with water as two large waves hit it. He tried to swim to a jetty 200 metres away, but underestimated the strength of the current. His body was found a month later, eight miles further down the Ebro.
