A killer who stabbed a young father in the heart as he was on his way to see his newborn son was jailed for life at the Old Bailey today.Amateur boxer John "King" Abbey, 26, was with his three-year-old daughter when he was attacked at a bus stop by Charles Acquaah in January.He died an hour later at the Mayday hospital in Croydon, south London – where his partner had given birth earlier that day.Acquaah, 22, of Croydon, was told he would have to serve a minimum of 15 years in jail after being found guilty of murder. Judge Stephen Kramer told him: "You armed yourself with a knife in case you saw him. You put it up your left sleeve."On January 29, you took out the knife and deliberately stabbed him in the chest and through the heart." The murder left Abbey's children without a father, said the judge.The judge said he was satisfied that the two men had been friends who had arrived in Britain from Ghana and then fallen out.Abbey's partner, Natra Abokar, 29, said in a statement that she feared for the future of the son born on the day of his father's death. "On every birthday, the past – and King's death – will come up like a terrible nightmare," she said.Of her daughter, she said: "She saw her daddy killed in front of her own eyes. She saw a man she knew as her daddy's friend hurt and kill him."The court heard that the little girl had told her mother that "Junior" – as Acquaah was known – "put the knife in daddy's chest".Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said there had been trouble between the two men in the months leading up to Abbey's death, and the murder was an "act of pure revenge". They had met by chance at the bus stop in London Road, Croydon, when an argument broke out.Abbey boxed for Ghana in the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and remained in the UK afterwards. He was short of money and got a job with a recycling centre, using his friend Acquaah's details.Acquaah had allowed him to have his wages paid into his bank account, but Abbey changed the arrangement after finding some of the money was missing. Acquaah then made allegations against him and threatened to kill him.Abbey was forced to resign from the job, said Altman.Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons said outside court that it was a "sad and shocking case", and described the killer as "heartless and spiteful".
