The teenage killers of Damilola Taylor are openly bragging about their crime, according to the parents of the murdered boy.In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Gloria and Richard Taylor said their 10-year-old son was fatally stabbed in Peckham, south-east London, because he would not join local gangs or pay money to them, and that a climate of fear on the estate is preventing witnesses from going to the police.Damilola's parents said they understand the difficulties the police face, but are frustrated that his killers are still at large. Mr Taylor said: "These boys are on the streets openly. They are still causing trouble, still terrorising people. They are murderers, they attacked him with intent to hurt or kill him. We have lost our child, the whole family is suffering and they are still out there.'Mrs Taylor believes that potential witnesses are too scared to talk, even when being interviewed by the police. "When you find a parent whose son knows something they won't say anything more," she said. "Realising the gravity of the crime, people should be courageous and speak to the police."The Taylor family is still terrorised by Damilola's death. "Gloria has nightmares. None of us sleep. We keep seeing him as if he is still here. It is so much harder because of the way he died," said Mr Taylor.
