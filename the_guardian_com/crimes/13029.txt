Police have admitted that they made a mistake in arresting the Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe today on suspicion of driving while disqualified. The 26-year-old was held for more than five hours at a police station in Harlow, Essex during the early hours of the morning.Essex police later admitted the arrest had been based on "inaccurate" information held on a computer and that the player was released as soon as the error came to light.Defoe, of Cuffley, Hertfordshire, was convicted of speeding earlier this month by a district judge sitting in Chelmsford, Essex. He was disqualified from driving but the disqualification was suspended pending an appeal. Defoe denied any offence."My client was unlawfully arrested and detained in custody for more than five hours at Harlow police station," said Nick Freeman, Defoe's solicitor. "This was despite the police being informed that Mr Defoe was not subject to any relevant period of disqualification as it had been suspended."There seems to be a total disconnect between the courts, DVLA and police, resulting in my client having to endure not only the humiliation of arrest, but also being incarcerated in custody like a common criminal."Despite being told Mr Defoe was not breaking the law and calling for his immediate release, the police would not agree to freeing him until they could clarify the position with the courts at 9am."Then, to add insult to injury, once released at just after 9am, the police refused to give Mr Defoe his car back until he produced his documents. They also refused to return the keys, which were on the same bunch as his house keys, causing Mr Defoe extreme difficulties, not least because he had to return home and pack for a pre-season tour of Asia with his football club."A spokesman for Essex police said: "The arrest of a man from Hertfordshire on suspicion of disqualified driving was based on information held on the police national computer."Following inquiries, officers discovered that the information was inaccurate and released the 26-year-old man without charge. The inputting error was made by police staff at Essex police and was an oversight as a result of a pending court appeal."If the motorist wishes to make a complaint, then he is advised to contact our professional standards department."Defoe's legal team said the player would appeal and argue that police paperwork was invalid because it had been handled by an unauthorised person.
