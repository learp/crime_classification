Psychiatrists were exonerated by an independent inquiry yesterday for discharging Anthony Hardy from a mental hospital leaving him free to murder two prostitutes and consign their body parts to dustbins near his north London home.The inquiry found that Hardy, described by the media as the Camden Ripper, could not have been detained longer in a mental hospital in spite of staff concerns that he was a danger to the public.Ministers are preparing a mental health bill to allow detention of people with a dangerous personality disorder who have not committed a serious crime. But the inquiry found that Hardy's disorder was untreatable, raising doubts about whether people like him should be incarcerated permanently by the NHS.The report said Hardy was detained in a mental health unit in Muswell Hill, north London, after damaging a neighbour's flat. Psychiatrists thought they had treated him successfully for "bipolar affective disorder" and recommended his discharge in November 2002. Six weeks later he killed and mutilated two prostitutes.He pleaded guilty to those murders and that of another woman whom he killed before entering the hospital unit.The inquiry found no evidence of negligence and said his mental illness had not contributed to the murders. The inquiry chairman, Robert Robinson, acknowledged that the report provided no comfort to people wanting reassurance that such events would not happen again.Hardy is serving a life sentence in Broadmoor hospital, diagnosed with an untreatable personality disorder. The Muswell Hill unit had no way of detecting this condition and even if they had they had no power to detain him for an untreatable condition, Mr Robinson said.Erville Millar, chief executive of Camden and Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust, said: "The mental health system is not the best place for these people to be dealt with."Marjorie Wallace, of the charity Sane, said: "He was not mad enough to be detained under the Mental Health Act and not bad enough to be held indefinitely in prison. His human rights took precedence over the rights of vulnerable women to whom he posed a danger."
