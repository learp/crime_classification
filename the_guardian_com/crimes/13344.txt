A Royal Navy chief petty officer who was jailed for five years for the rape of a female colleague on board a warship at sea had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal yesterday.Three judges ruled that the conviction of Phillip Coates had been unsafe. Mr Coates was the first sailor to be convicted of the rape of a female colleague since women navy personnel have been allowed to go to sea.Following the conviction in March he was dismissed from the service and stripped of good conduct badges by a court martial at HMS Nelson, Portsmouth.Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett had told Mr Coates that he had been found guilty on evidence provided by his victim, who said in a statement that she had kissed him after a barbeque but had made it clear she did not want sex.Alan Large, defending, said at the time that Mr Coates, who was of previous "impeccable" character, would no longer be able to continue his career as a medical assistant and said his future was "bleak".Handing down the ruling yesterday, Sir Igor Judge described the case as "problematic". He said the complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had made four statements. In the first the "essential allegation" was that they had intercourse because the victim gave up trying to say no.The second and third statements suggested a lack of any memory of the circumstances in which the alleged intercourse took place, and a fourth statement suggested that intercourse took place despite a continuous struggle.The victim, who is in her 20s, could only recall "images" and "gut feelings" about what had happened until she attended a therapy session with a psychologist almost two months later.Sir Igor said: "Both the first and fourth statements involve allegations of rape, but there are significant differences in the circumstances in which it allegedly occurred."He explained that Mr Coates had been convicted on the basis of the first statement, but the Crown's case had been based on the fourth statement."This appellant was convicted of rape on the basis of an account of the incident which the complainant herself disavowed in her evidence and which did not represent the Crown's case against him. This is highly unusual," he said.The 30-year-old, from Devon, was not at the court to hear the ruling by Sir Igor Judge, Mr Justice Pitchford and Mr Justice Flaux.Speaking outside the court, a Royal Navy spokesman said: "As his conviction has been quashed, Chief Petty Officer Coates will immediately be reinstated into the navy and we will await guidance from the court on any ruling about a possible retrial."Any decision on whether Mr Coates should face a second trial would have to be made by the court of appeal.
