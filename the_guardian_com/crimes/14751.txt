Tony Blair insisted at PMQs today that the Home Office had seen "huge progress" despite the analysis from his own home secretary that parts of it were "dysfunctional" and not fit for purpose.Conservatives and Liberal Democrats joined forces to throw back at the prime minister his own praise for the department, after John Reid's damning criticisms yesterday.Barracking of the PM's defence was so loud that the Speaker at one point threatened to suspend the sitting.The Conservative leader, David Cameron, called the failures over the deportation of foreign prisoners and the employment of illegal immigrants as cleaners "a typical week in the Labour Home Office" and demanded Mr Blair take personal control over the department.Mr Cameron claimed that, after nine years and four home secretaries, the department was a "shambles."The Lib Dem leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, added to the pressure, saying that Mr Blair previously boasted of how well the Home Office was doing - who was right, he asked, the PM or the home secretary?Mr Blair, with Dr Reid sat beside him on the frontbench, accepted that "much more needs to be done" on immigration and asylum and added he was very happy to take personal responsibility - but counterattacked by reeling off a list of criminal justice measures voted against by the Tories.Mr Cameron quoted Mr Blair back at himself, saying that in 2004 the PM had claimed the Home Office had been "transformed".He called it a "typical week" for the Home Office since it had emerged that 85 foreign criminals who had committed serious crime were still at large, hundreds of people had escaped from open prisons and "illegal immigrants are allowed to clean the office of the department that's meant to remove them".And - echoing criticism at yesterday's home affairs select committee - Mr Cameron brought up the emergency reshuffle at the Home Office this week, complaining that if departing immigration minister Tony McNulty was judged not fit to hold that brief, he should not take his new post as police minister.Mr Blair, appearing to be on the back foot, said that asylum claims were now below 1997 levels, were being processed faster, and failed asylum seekers sent back to their home countries.The PM said Labour had inherited a system from the Conservatives where asylum applications took 22 months to decide and failed asylum seekers were not deported.But that led to the best joke of the weekly session, as Mr Cameron complained that next Mr Blair would be "blaming Sir Robert Peel" for his problems.
