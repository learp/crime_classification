While West Yorkshire police were carrying out their biggest missing person investigation since the Yorkshire Ripper, Shannon Matthews' family was involved in a series of claims and counter-claims:· Shannon's mother, Karen, 32, who lives with Craig Meehan, said someone she knew had abducted her daughter. "It makes me think I can't trust the people who are really close to me any more. The family don't feel safe any more - it has broken the family apart." She said the reason was "to hurt her".· Shannon's uncle, Martin Matthews, 42, claimed the child had pleaded to stay with him because she was "in trouble" with her stepfather for swearing during a row. "I told her to go back. I regret it now. The next day she vanished."· Shannon's grandmother, June Matthews, added: "Karen was a great mum before she took Craig in. Those kids were loved and cared for. Since he arrived, they've had a terrible time."· Shannon's stepfather, Craig Meehan, 22, denied any wrongdoing: "Anyone round here will tell you I love these kids. I know they're not mine but they might as well be. I buy the food and pay all the bills. I bring the money in [...] and all of it goes on the children and Karen."· Shannon's natural father, Leon Rose, 29, defended him. "They got on well. I was not around for some years and he has been a real dad to her. If there had been any problems I am sure she would have told me. I've always thought he was a decent guy."
