A young woman has been shot in east Belfast after a gang forced their way into her home, according to a local councillor.The 24-year-old victim is recovering in hospital from injuries to her lower body after the attack, which happened at about 10.40pm on Wednesday night on Lord Street Mews, a cul-de-sac off the Beersbridge Road.It is understood she was shot five times in the stomach, hips and knees.East Belfast Ulster Unionist party councillor Jim Rodgers said it was believed a number of men called at the woman's home, forced their way in and shooting her.He said: "[It's] absolutely unbelievable what is happening. There's too many people taking the law into their own hands, acting as judge, jury and executioner."Rodgers's remarks suggest loyalist paramilitary involvement, which would be highly unusual as terror groups normally target young men they accuse of "anti-social behaviour" in areas they control.The dominant paramilitary group in the area where the woman was shot is the east battalion of the Ulster Volunteer Force, which has been active in organising violent loyalist protests over the city hall union flag controversy since the start of this year.Judith Cochrane, Alliance party assembly member for East Belfast, also condemned the attack.She said: "There is no place on our streets for gun violence. A life could have been lost last night. My thoughts at this time are with the woman who was shot. I hope she will be able to make a full recovery from her injuries."The people responsible are dangerous individuals who have no regards for the lives of other people. They must be urgently apprehended by the police to face justice before the courts. If anybody has any information about this attack then I would urge them to contact the police."
