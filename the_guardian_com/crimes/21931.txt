A secret international website described as a "one-stop shop" for online fraudsters buying and selling stolen credit card details has been shut down after a series of raids around the globe, police said yesterday.Nearly 60 people, including 11 in Britain, have been arrested in connection with the DarkMarket forum, which operated for almost three years selling personal data such as online banking details, as well as allowing criminals to exchange information about how to commit fraud. The site, which could only be accessed by invitation, sold passwords to social networking and online email sites and electronic hardware. It was closed down on Thursday night after undercover FBI officers infiltrated it and spent nearly two years identifying the key users. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), which led the UK arm of the operation, called DarkMarket "one of the most pernicious online criminal forums in the world".A man was recently convicted of buying £250,000 of personal data on the site in only six weeks, it said, estimating that the information could have been used to commit £10m of identity fraud.The FBI estimated the scale of potential fraud and loss from the site's activities at more than £40m. It had 2,500 registered members at its peak. The British arrests, of men aged between their late teens and late 50s, were made in Leicester, Manchester, Humberside, South Yorkshire and London. Five took place in the past week while the others were within the past 18 months. Others were held in Germany, Turkey and the US. Some suspects remain at large.
