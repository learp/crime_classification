A teenage girl arrested today following a "happy slapping" assault on a 16-year-old schoolgirl was released on bail, police said.Becky Smith was beaten unconscious on May 9 near her home in Blackley, Manchester. Her attackers filmed the assault on a mobile phone and the video recording was then circulated around her school. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said that a 16-year-old girl, also from Blackley, was arrested on suspicion of assault. She was bailed this afternoon until June 21, pending further inquiries. Becky was ambushed by a gang of teenagers at the junction of Fortrose Avenue and Sandyhill Road in Blackley at 7.15pm as she walked home from a friend's house. She suffered serious head injuries and temporary paralysis and spent two days at North Manchester general hospital before going home. Becky's brother Craig, 13, was shown the video by a fellow pupil at Plant Hill high school in Blackley. Becky is now terrified of going back to school and is set to take her GCSEs on her own as she attempts to win a place at college to study drama. Her mother, Georgina Smith, 39, branded the attack "horrendous" and "sickening". Happy slapping was first reported in London six months ago, but is now a nationwide phenomenon. It usually involves children slapping other children or passersby and recording the attacks on their mobiles. Videos of the attacks are then exchanged between phones and posted on the internet. Some schools have banned mobile phones in an attempt to stamp out the craze, but pupils at Plant Hill high are still allowed to use them. A school spokesman said: "This is a police matter which happened outside school and we are supporting the police with their inquiries."
