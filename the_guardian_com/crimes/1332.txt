The leader of the English Defence League, Stephen Lennon, is believed to have been released from jail, nine days before the anti-Islamist group plans to hold a demonstration in Manchester city centre.The EDL's official website announced on Thursday that Lennon, who is also known as Tommy Robinson, has been released from prison. He was jailed for 10 months in January for having entered the United States using someone else's passport.Authorities only realised Lennon was not travelling on his own passport when he arrived in New York. However, he entered the US illegally, despite being asked to attend an interview with authorities, and travelled back to the UK the following day using his own passport – under the name of Paul Harris, his given name at birth.It is understood that Lennon had appealed against his sentence, and would be released on the condition that he is electronically tagged.Lennon's release comes as Manchester city council and Greater Manchester police prepare for an EDL demonstration on 2 March and a counter-protest organised by Unite Against Fascism (UAF). The EDL announced the date of the demonstration on its Facebook page on Christmas Eve, with almost 500 users saying they would attend.The demonstration coincides with UAF's national conference in London, meaning many key members from the anti-fascist organisation will be absent from the counter-demonstration.A UAF statement read: "The EDL is a racist group promoting hatred and intolerance. Its leadership includes hardcore fascists and BNP members. The EDL's hatred and bigotry against Muslims is as unacceptable as any other form of racism. There is no place for the EDL in Manchester's multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-faith community."The statement was backed by 18 councillors from the north-west and a number of trade unionists, including Manchester and Salford NUJ and Sue Bond, vice-president of the Public and Commercial Services Union.Councillor Daniel Gillard, a Labour member for Withington ward in south Manchester, said: "Unite Against Fascism's counter demonstration will be a celebratory affirmation of our commitment to our minority communities, including in particular our friends, brothers and sisters in the Islamic community who have made, and continue to make, immeasurably positive contributions to our way of life."UAF is also campaigning for police to divert the EDL demonstration away from Albert Square in Manchester, the site of the city's town hall and a location they regard as symbolising the centre of multicultural Manchester."Their message of hatred and division is both unwelcome and irrelevant in a city that has campaigned and championed the rights of all its people for generations – regardless of race, religion, disability and sexual orientation," said Gillard.GMP said there would be "an increased police presence in the city centre and surrounding areas to manage the demonstration" on 2 March. Forty-eight arrests were made the last time EDL held a demonstration in Manchester.On Thursday, one EDL supporter, Marcus Ward, was jailed for 11 years for attacking two men with a cut-throat razor after a rally in Bolton. On trial at Manchester's Minshull Street crown court, the jury was told how Ward attacked a pub landlord in Middleton, north Manchester, in 2010 after he had asked EDL supporters to leave the pub due to their behaviour.Ward punched and kicked the landlord in the face and attacked two men with the razor when they attempted to intervene. He eventually handed himself in to police last September, two years after the attack.
