Police in Greater Manchester say they are making good progress in their year-long inquiry into poisoning at Stepping Hill hospital that led to the deaths of seven patients.More than 800 staff members at the hospital in Stockport have been interviewed since the investigation into saline contamination began. In total, 22 patients were poisoned and seven died between 1 June and 15 July 2011.The investigation into the contamination of saline products, which were tainted with insulin, has been lengthy and complex, the force has said.Two people have been arrested. Nurse Rebecca Leighton was cleared of any wrongdoing after all the charges against her were dropped. A 46-year-old nurse, Victorino Chua, remains on police bail until September. He was arrested on suspicion of murdering three patients and causing grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to 18 others.The investigation began after the deaths of two patients at the hospital, 44-year-old Tracey Arden on 7 July, 2011, and Arnold Lancaster, 71, four days later. Hospital staff called in police after they discovered a batch of saline drips had been tampered with.As the inquiry developed, police began to investigate the deaths of Derek Weaver, 83, Bill Dickson, 82, Linda McDonagh, 60, Jack Beeley, 73, and Beryl Hope, 70.A further 20 patients who experienced hypoglycaemic episodes at the hospital are not believed to be victims of the poisoner. The police said ultimately a file of evidence will be prepared and will be heard before a jury or the coroner, who will rule on the causes of death "and how, if it all, the insulin from contaminated products contributed to their death".Police said detectives were investigating, reviewing and analysing each of the hundreds of interactions all 22 patients had with a member of staff or visitor during their time at Stepping Hill.The police team has also gathered information relating to more than 2,300 people including patients, hospital staff and visitors. Officers have spoken to 800 members of staff, taken 650 statements and gathered 3,000 exhibits.In a statement released on Tuesday, Detective Superintendent Simon Barraclough said: "We have set ourselves the task of understanding and proving how each person was poisoned, how and if this caused or contributed to their deaths and obviously who is responsible."To that end we are making good progress, but it won't be until the very end of the criminal or coronial process that these questions will be properly answered."Ultimately our aim is to ensure justice for all victims."The sheer size and complexity of this investigation is reflected in the number of inquiries that we have done, those still to do and the specialism surrounding all medical evidence and the invaluable and necessary involvement of the various experts who are supporting and assisting us."He said he wanted to take the opportunity to thank the staff at Stepping Hill as the past 12 months have been "extremely difficult and challenging for them, but they have offered us their full and unwavering support throughout". He added that it was important to note that since police were alerted last July "no other products have been contaminated."Specialist medical tests have been carried out to examine the drugs present in the victims' bodies after death, while they were treated, and evidence of natural disease. There have been clinical reviews of the patients' general health and medical history and measurement of the insulin administered.Judith Morris, the director of nursing and midwifery at Stockport NHS foundation trust, said the trust was continuing to work closely with police. She said staff were determined that "this criminal and malicious intent does not overshadow the hospital's long-standing record of good care," adding that the "deplorable act of deliberate contamination does not reflect on the good care provided by our skilled and dedicated staff".Morris said additional security measures remained in place. They include CCTV, two nurses for the preparation of IV drugs on wards and two members of staff required for access to treatment rooms. She said providing safe and high-quality care to patients "remains our highest priority".
