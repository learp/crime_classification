If you were to choose a member of your jewellery gang to don women's clothes to act as a decoy, Vasile Bogdan wouldn't seem the obvious choice. Even if the stubbly boxer's jaw didn't give the game away, the eyebrows probably would.And yet the 35-year-old Romanian national did dress up in somewhat elaborate drag on a number of occasions to gain access to jewellery stores which were then robbed by fellow gang members, who seized a combined £600,000 of goods.Bogdan was jailed for 10 years on Thursday for his role in the robberies.He was caught in January this year after being chased by the owner of the final jewellery store targeted, in Bethnal Green, east London. Metropolitan police detectives then linked him to four earlier raids within two months, in all of which he had gained access to the shops by dressing up.  Bogdan pictured in police custody.

There were two raids in December, one of which saw the gang take £350,000 of jewellery. After a foiled attempted robbery in Birmingham the gang carried out the raid in Bethnal Green, where Bogdan was caught. The other robbers, numbering up to 10 people, are still being hunted.Bodgan pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery on Tuesday.Detective Inspector Ralf Kirchel said the gang's technique worked, which was why they repeated it. He said: "They are clearly highly organised and put preparation and planning into each offence. We know that Bogdan came into the UK on 23 January, from Hungary. Our investigation is ongoing and does have links to other countries; we will do everything we can to track down the rest of this gang."
