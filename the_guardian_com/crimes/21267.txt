David Cameron has chaired the first meeting of the social policy review launched in the wake of the riots earlier this month.The prime minister announced in the aftermath of the disturbances that an internal review of every government policy would take place to ensure they were bold enough to fix a "broken society".Ministers from the Home Office, the work and pensions department and the communities and local government department are taking part in the review, which is expected to last until October.A Downing Street spokeswoman said it would look at whether current government plans and programmes are "big enough and bold enough to deliver the change the country now wants to see".The spokeswoman said the policy review would "see whether it addresses the demands that were made by the public in the wake of the public disorder. It's to do that check on where we are in terms of existing policy development and whether it continues to meet the demands that have been made."The meeting set out the process of the review, which will look at the wide range of issues around what the government terms the "broken society".The spokeswoman added: "It looks at the whole set of issues regarding broken society; it could be schools, family policy, parenting, communities, human rights, health and safety, cultural, legal, bureaucratic problems, services the government provides and how they are delivered and the signals that government sends about the kind of behaviours that are encouraged and rewarded."The internal review is separate from the independent panel on the riots set up by deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, which will look at the impact of the riots on communities.The makeup of the panel is still under discussion. The review chaired by Cameron will also run in parallel with the review of gang culture led by Theresa May, the home secretary, and Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pension secretary.The prime minister's meeting was held on the same day that the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was due to call on the "reckless" government to "learn from the riots" by dropping plans to reduce police force budgets by 20% over four years.He will warn during a visit to Lewisham, one of the London boroughs hit by rioting earlier this month, that police funding cuts will "weaken the forces of law and order on our streets" at a time when there is widespread concern over safety in communities. The Labour leader will also criticise the coalition's plans to introduce elected police commissioners while pushing ahead with the funding cuts."If there is one lesson we should all learn from the riots, it is that it was crucial to have our police bravely standing between home and shops on the one hand – and lawlessness on the other," the Labour leader will say."The Conservatives are talking tough but their words are hollow. They are speaking hollow words when, rather than making sensible savings that protect frontline services, this government is insisting that it will press ahead with cuts that go too far and too fast."They are speaking hollow words when this government insists on spending £100m to create a new tier of politicians through elected police chiefs at the same time as cutting the number of officers on the street. And they are speaking hollow words when David Cameron pledges the Treasury will stand behind policing costs during the riots but has done no such thing, leaving forces across the country with the prospect of making even deeper cuts than they are currently planning."Earlier this year, Theresa May insisted the average reductions for forces' grants in cash terms would be 4% in the first year, 5% in the second, 2% in the third and 1% in the fourth. She said pay freezes and a reduction in red tape would mean the impact of the reforms would be "less severe" than people feared.But Miliband is pledging to force a vote in the Commons on the funding cuts, which he claims will reduce police numbers across England and Wales by more than 16,000.He will add: "The police themselves and the people they protect are desperately worried. They want to see action – not hollow words – and that's why we are calling on the government to think again on cutting the number of officers patrolling our streets."
