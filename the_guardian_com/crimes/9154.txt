Members of the public were duped into donating thousands of pounds to fund a massive suicide terror attack planned for Britain, a court heard on Tuesday.Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali, both 27, were among a group of men who posed as collectors from the Muslim Aid (MA) charity, complete with T-shirts and high-visibility tabards, to carry out street collections and door-to-door pleas for cash in Birmingham and Leicester last year, their trial at Woolwich crown court heard.But the charity received just a fraction of the Ramadan collection cash in August last year, with the vast majority being kept to finance the plot, the jury was told.Notes police found suggested that they collected £12,100 but the court was told they also lost £9,149.39 of their gains by using it to trade in foreign currency over four weeks.The court previously heard that the men, two of whom are alleged to have received terror training in Pakistan, planned to detonate a series of suicide bombs in an attack that could have been bigger than the 7 July 2005 atrocities.The jury heard that Ali registered two accounts on eBay's online charity website "half in jest" in September 2006, with the user names "terrorshop" and "shopterror", using the email address be_terror@yahoo.co.uk.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said that eBay closed down one of the accounts in October 2006."The second account remains active, but, like the first, has never been used," he said. "However, both reveal his mindset even then, even if the usernames he chose were registered half in jest."He said the men wore MA T-shirts and tabards to "beguile the public into believing this was legitimate charity collecting, when it wasn't"."That money was stolen and … was not intended by the defendants to be used for any other legitimate purpose other than terrorism," he said.Altman said the collections took place soon after Naseer and Khalid returned from terror training in the Taliban and al-Qaida stronghold of Waziristan in Pakistan at the end of July last year.The charity had a licence for a single day's collecting, and it received £1,584 from the group at the end of August, the court heard, a fairly typical amount for a day's collection.In reality, the prosecution claimed, they illegally collected cash over a sustained period, posing as Muslim Aid volunteers without its knowledge.They donated £900 to the Madrasah-e-Ashraful Uloom school in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, and kept the rest.All the men are accused of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, which they deny.Naseer is accused of five counts of the offence, Khalid four and Ali three, all between Christmas Day 2010 and 19 September last year.For Naseer, from Sparkhill, Khalid, from Sparkbrook, and Ali, from Balsall Heath, all in Birmingham, this is alleged to have included planning a bombing campaign, collecting money for terrorism and recruiting others for terrorism.Naseer and Khalid are also accused of travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, and it is alleged that Naseer also helped others to travel to the country for the same purpose.The men talked about putting sharp blades on the front of a truck and "running" into people, the court heard.Recorded speaking on 10 September, they discussed an idea for a weapon that had been published in an outlawed extremist online magazine called Inspire under the headline "The Ultimate Mowing Machine".It was an article the prosecution said the defendants were clearly aware of.Naseer said: "So Ashik, it feel like I've been driving a monster truck, you know."Khalid said: "Yeah and do what AQ [al Qaida] said, put that blades at the front of it and trample on everyone."He continued later: "Just drive it into people in [a] crowded area."The men also discussed what would happen to their bodies after they had been killed in a suicide attack, the court heard.In what the prosecution called a "very telling exchange", they discussed where they would be buried in Birmingham while being watched by surveillance officers driving through the Small Heath area of Birmingham on 11 September last year.Khalid said: ""Nah, I'm just thinking … most likely it'll be Handsworth [cemetery], if there's a body left."Naseer replied: "One thing, one thing, remember, once that once you done, it doesn't matter where you get buried, innit."Altman said: "The exchange puts beyond doubt that they were planning a suicide attack."Khalid and Naseer also talked about people "getting killed" in their local area and how no one would go there any more because it would be a "little war zone", the court heard.In another conversation Khalid described westerners as evil, saying: "All I'm saying is look how much hatred they have for Islam. That does make you go mad."The men were recorded taking a large flatscreen television to their flat, on which to watch violent videos.They were also heard boasting that they had been contacted by a potential "investor" who they hoped might give them up to £10,000.A Dawah charity shop was going to be used as a cover to recruit more people to their cause and they planned to set up charity stalls selling cakes and perfume in Coventry, Leicester and Walsall.Naseer was recorded talking about the September 11 al-Qaida bombers and how they increased their iman [faith] by "doing 10 [chapters of the Qur'an] a day", while talking to an associate.The trial continues.
