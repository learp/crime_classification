Viewers of television detective shows would have more chance of solving crimes than some incompetent officers, according to one of the country's most senior policemen. Mike Todd, chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said he could not believe the lack of skill shown by some officers when they were interviewing suspects. He also criticised the increasing number of speeding fines being imposed, which he believes is alienating otherwise law-abiding citizens. But Mr Todd, 46, who took over the force in October, reserved his most controversial comments for some officers' lack of skill and leadership. Incensed by the pitifully low detection rate for burglaries in some of his divisions, Mr Todd listened to three interviews of suspects by his officers. He said: "Some of them would have been better off being interviewed by someone who has watched The Bill or Inspector Morse. I went absolutely mad - disbelief is not an understatement. But we have since come up with a package of training for officers." Officers had failed to ask basic questions, inquire about other possible offences or show standard interrogation skills, Mr Todd said in an in terview in today's Independent. Since taking over, he said his main aim had been to improve the force's crime-fighting record. Greater Manchester has one of the country's worst detection rates, with only about 16% of offences being solved, and it failed in the past year to achieve six out of the government's nine key performance targets. "I have concerns about some of the skill levels," he said. "Some people spend most of their time serving the computer - they come on to their shift and have a list of about 14 jobs that they have to do. You have to get out of the office and be proactive."
