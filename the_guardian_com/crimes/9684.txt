Close friends of murdered student Marsha McDonnell fought back tears last night as they spoke of losing a much-loved companion who regularly rubbed shoulders with pop stars and dreamt of a career in music.Marsha, 19, had met such celebrities as Oasis and the Foo Fighters through her father, who works in the industry. Kylie Minogue is among the stars who sent flowers to her family after she was found bludgeoned to death 100 yards from her home in Hampton, west London, early last Tuesday. Lucy Packman, 18, said her friend was 'too good for this world' and told how Marsha had invited her to the cinema on the night she died. She said: 'Marsha said "Give me a call later if you want to come", but I didn't.' Ashley Clifford, 19, said: 'She was always starting trends - she was the first person at school to wear high heels and I thought she was so cool. She even had buffalo boots like the Spice Girls.' Another friend, Laura Scott, 18, added: 'She was always dying her hair - ginger, blonde, brown, black, you name it. Once we dyed our hair red. I did Marsha's and she ended up with a red scalp. She was really bubbly and making jokes and doing crazy things.' The insight into the murdered woman's life came as police admitted they had so far failed to find any motive for the killing, which took place in a well-lit suburb. They now believe her killer could be a mentally disturbed stranger, or that the teenager may have been the victim of an attempted sex attack or a failed robbery. She was attacked from behind, and probably never saw her killer, who clubbed her three times over the head with a blunt instrument, possibly a hammer. Police said the attack was 'not frenzied'. Instead there were three 'quite deliberate blows' to the head. A police source said: 'This is an extremely unusual case. There is nothing in her private life to suggest it was someone she knew.'
