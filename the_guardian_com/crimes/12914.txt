It was a tough and tender package, but only the tough section got leaked. Ministers will no doubt be pleased by yesterday's headlines: "Blunkett wants to lock up child bail bandits" (Times) or "Courts to lock up child robbers" (Guardian). A local election approaches, there is widespread concern over the rise of mobile-phone thefts, and police chiefs are restless. Under attack for their low detection rates, the police have been on a diversionary exercise for months. Sir John Stevens, Metropolitan police commissioner, has been banging on about the rise in street crime exacerbated by young robbers getting bail seven or eight times in a row, although he has never given numbers. Like a Daily Mail editorial on a bad day, ministers have concluded the government must act.They have plenty of constructive ideas, but only leaked the unconstructive. Until now, David Blunkett has resisted knee-jerk reactions. He supported the Youth Justice Board's move to cap custodial places. Of course, some young people do require a secure place, but not many. There are already too many young people being locked up inappropriately. Variations in sentences between courts are already unacceptable, ranging from one in 43 offences to one in two. Now even more will be remanded, as the categories for refusing bail are widened. All this is in denial of the many community-based programmes - more than a dozen different types - that ministers have sensibly developed. We know how counter-productive a local authority secure place can be. Even worse are the prison department's young offender institutions (YOIs). Yet yesterday's decision means more older teenagers will be bumped out of secure units into YOIs, to make way for even younger teenagers in the units. Remember the Lord Chief Justice stopped the Bulger killers suffering such a transfer. Just think how much better the Â£150,000 annual running cost of each secure cell could be spent in the community.
