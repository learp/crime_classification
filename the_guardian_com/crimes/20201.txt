The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, today announced a series of measures to tackle knife crime as the government set out its strategy for cracking down on violent offences over the next three years. Police will immediately be provided with 100 portable metal-detecting knife arches and 400 "search wands" as the government tries to tackle the carrying of weapons, amid a spate of high-profile murders. New controls to deal with deactivated firearms will also be introduced.More arches and scanners will be made available over the course of the next year and there will be a presumption that anyone caught carrying a knife will be prosecuted, with tougher sentences encouraged.The plan also outlines controversial powers allowing parents limited access to the sex offenders register. A pilot scheme in four police force areas – Cleveland, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire and Warwickshire – will allow increased disclosure of child sex offenders' convictions to certain members of the public.Smith said that the government had set "tough targets" for the police and given police and local authorities "more local decision-making powers to find solutions to local priorities"."I am today pledging that, by 2011, we will have reduced serious violent crime, including gun- and gang-related violence, knife crime, sexual and domestic violence and improved the criminal justice response to these offences," she said.A £1m campaign will challenge the "glamour" and other factors which lead young people to carry knives, and workshops will educate more than a million youngsters on the dangers of weapons.The government will invest £20m to support multi-agency work to manage and identify people at risk of committing serious violent crimes as well as providing support for victims. Covert surveillance will be enhanced to identify key gang members and special measures to protect witnesses, including live links and anonymity while giving evidence, will be strengthened. The Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings will be implemented to ensure minimum standards and rights for all identified victims of human trafficking. And the number of sexual assault referral centres for victims of sexual violence is being more than doubled. The government will work with industry to tackle offensive content on the internet and the representation of violence in video games, films and other media.A strategy will also be developed to tackle so-called "honour killings".The shadow home secretary, David Davis, accused the government of being "lax" on binge-drinking and drugs and said that Smith was "belatedly papering over the cracks of an enormous problem of the government's own making". "Tinkering with targets and publicity campaigns are a drop in the ocean of the serious and sustained action required to reverse the tragic scourge of violence on our streets," he said.The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, welcomed the focus on reducing the amount of violent crime, "which has doubled under Labour", but called for "action rather than just words". "Better enforcement of current laws could easily be aided by scrapping the unnecessary and ineffective ID cards scheme and spending the money on putting more police on our streets," he said.
