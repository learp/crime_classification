An Oxfordshire-based barrister has been disbarred after dodging thousands of pounds in railway fares, following a hearing at the Bar Standards Board. Peter Barnett, 45, avoided paying the correct fare for two years from 2012 by claiming he commuted into central London from Wembley in north-west London instead of his home in Thame, Oxfordshire.He was confronted by a suspicious ticket inspector at Marylebone station in November 2014. He ran away from the inspector but handed himself in the following day.He was convicted of six charges of fraud by false representation at the City of London magistrates court last September.During his trial the prosecution alleged he avoided nearly £20,000 in fares but a judge later accepted Barnett’s claim that he evaded only £5,892.70 based on the price of a weekly ticket.Australian-born Barnett has now been disbarred following a hearing at the Bar Standards Board. He was called to the bar at Lincoln’s Inn in London in 2007, but has never held a practising certificate as a barrister in England and Wales.A BSB spokesperson said: “Dishonest conduct is incompatible with membership of the bar. The tribunal’s decision to disbar Dr Barnett reflects this.”Barnett avoided prison when a 16-week jail term was suspended, but he was banned from his profession for 12 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.The Oxford graduate and Rhodes scholar, who had a previous caution for an identical offence, was ordered to pay back £5,892.70 to Chiltern Railways. He was also ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.At the time of the trial Judge Ola Omotosho told him: “It is a shame really, because you had it all and it remains unclear why you acted so badly.“You’ve let yourself down and you’ve also let your family down – especially in your chosen profession as a lawyer.”Defending him at the time, Angus Bunyan said Barnett had been forced to quit his job as a result of the proceedings and was unemployable as a lawyer.“And the real tragedy is that a man with real intellectual gifts as a lawyer and then in the financial service industry, he’s aware this cuts both ways.“As for as his legal career, it’s over. What he hopes to do is complete his sentence and go into charity work – that’s occupied so much of his time in the last 20 years.” Barnett founded an African children’s charity. He was a director of the thinktank the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at “promoting prosperity”, but his directorship was terminated in March last year.
