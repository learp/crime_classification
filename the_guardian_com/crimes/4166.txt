The mother of Mark Duggan has admitted her son "may not have been an angel" but said police should have arrested him and bought him before a jury instead of shooting him dead.The inquest into the shooting that was the trigger for the 2011 riots across England heard from Pamela Duggan, who said she still hoped in vain that her first-born child would walk through the door.A police marksman shot Duggan dead in August 2011 in Tottenham, north London. When armed officers forced the minicab Duggan was travelling in to stop, police believed that he was part of one of the most violent gangs in Europe and had taken possession of a gun.Pamela Duggan's statement was read to the inquest jury: "Mark may not have been an angel, but I do not believe he should have died in the way he did."If he was involved in any wrongdoing, he should have been brought to justice and punished. He should not have been shot and killed."The officers involved in this case have to account publicly for their actions. I will accept no less. I want to know why my son was shot dead rather than arrested."The inquest has heard from the police that Duggan was believed to be a member of a Tottenham gang called TMD, which intelligence said was increasingly linked to guns in and around nightclubs.Duggan had minor convictions but police suspected he was involved in much more serious and violent crime.Mrs Duggan said after the killing of her 29-year-old son, that his father, Bruno, was so grief-stricken that he gave up his battle against cancer and died 11 months after the shooting."When Mark died, Bruno stopped talking and would not say anything to anybody except: 'They killed my son, they killed my boy.'"I believe it completely finished Bruno, and he didn't have the will or the strength to fight the cancer. He just gave up."Mrs Duggan's statement, which was read by her barrister, continued: "As a mother you think you're going to go before your child, you never think your child will go before you. No mother deserves to bury their child. I am so confused and I don't understand why this has happened to me and my family."After Duggan was shot, the family believed he had been taken to hospital, and media reports suggested that an Asian man had been shot.When she discovered her son had been killed, Mrs Duggan said she went into total shock and was prescribed Valium, anti-depressants and sleeping tablets by her GP."They have helped a little, although I still find myself waiting for Mark to walk through the door," she told the inquest, sitting in central London.The jury also heard that a senior police officer was told Duggan had been shot after he came towards officers firing a gun. Detective Superintendent Fiona Mallon said police had not wanted to take Duggan's life.The jury has already heard that no gun residue was found on Duggan, and neither his DNA nor his fingerprints were found on a gun encased in a sock that was recovered by police 10 to 20 feet from where he fell.The inquest continues.
