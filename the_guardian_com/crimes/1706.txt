Beat bobbies should be armed with electric shock 'stun guns' to combat an alarming rise in assaults on officers, the Police Federation will demand this week.The use of so-called Tasers is currently strictly limited to trained firearms officers, with use of the devices - which deliver a 50,000 volt shock - still highly controversial.But Jan Berry, chair of the Police Federation, said it was time to step up the defence of ordinary officers in what will be seen as a halfway house between a US-style armed force and Britain's consensual policing tradition. Although the Tasers are designed to be non-lethal, they have been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the United States.In a startling admission, Berry also claimed the drive to meet targets for recruiting more black and Asian officers risked lowering standards - and confessed that she believed her own first promotion as a young woman was for politically correct reasons not merit.Rank and file officers will vote this week at the federation's annual conference on whether all officers should have access to Tasers.'Sometimes you get people thrashing out at you where batons and that type of thing are just not enough,' said Berry. 'We know that more officers are being assaulted and I think we have got to protect them. We have got to give them the capability of taking control of situations, give them the training and give them the equipment.'She said the device, which works by firing two electrode darts which remain attached to the gun, would be a last resort: 'You are not exactly saying "Should I use CS gas or should I use a Taser?" It's going to be "Should I use Taser or do I need a gun"?'But with a shortage of armed police - there are fewer than 6,000 trained firearms officers, compared with up to 9,000 which the Association of Chief Police Officers calculates are necessary - Tasers would offer proper back-up, she said. 'Say you are a patrol officer and you need the armed response vehicle or the firearms team to take control, and you get an estimated arrival time of 45 minutes - you need something.'The conference will also debate whether affirmative action - actively promoting black or female recruits over rivals, currently illegal - is now necessary.Berry said while more effort should be made to hire black and female officers she opposed affirmative action, citing her own experience of early promotion.'I was totally unprepared for that - I wasn't mature enough to be a sergeant,' she said. 'In 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act had just come in: in 1977, I got promoted to sergeant. They were very keen to demonstrate that more women were getting on in the service.'I survived, but I was very reliant on an awful lot of other people and it really was unfair. It's very demeaning if you are promoted as a token.'Berry, now a chief inspector, said she believed she subsequently 'proved my worth' and rose on merit. But she added: 'There is no doubt that national standards are changed to reflect the numbers that we need to recruit. That is a very dangerous thing.'The pass mark for recruits in 'written communications' had, she said, been lowered from 50 per cent to 40 per cent, with recruits who scored near the new pass mark then struggling in training.Recent complaints that white applicants to the Metropolitan Police were forced to wait in order to fast-track black recruits were repeated in other forces, she added, including Avon and Somerset and Greater Manchester.'The principle of the targets was probably right but it can't be right that for some forces the target is achievable without any effort, for others a fair amount of effort, but there are some where it's totally impossible,' she said.Her comments follow criticism of the police's record on diversity from the recent Morris inquiry on the Met and the Commission for Racial Equality.Hazel Blears, the policing minister, said Tasers should be used only by trained firearms officers. 'Tasers are a pretty powerful weapon - the judgment required to decide whether or not to use it ought to be similar to the training and discretion that trained firearms officers exercise,' she added.However Berry said pilots had shown even the appearance of a Taser was a powerful deterrent. 'When you take aim the red light that shows where the thing might land doesn't half focus people's minds - very often you don't have to discharge it.'Critics say the Taser may prove fatal for people with heart conditions. But its US manufacturers insist it is safe.
