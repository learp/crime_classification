An elderly couple who bought a pink-flowering perennial to brighten up their garden found their home and street targeted by the police and a gang of armed drug users after the innocent-looking plant began to give off a scent similar to cannabis. Ivor and Margaret Wiltshire, 77 and 79, bought a pot of moss phlox from a garden centre and were delighted when the plant began to spread vigorously through their front and back gardens. But it also began to give off a curious aroma, which came to the attention of Avon and Somerset police. The force helicopter was used to try to find the suspected cannabis factory but infra-red cameras, used to trace heat sources associated with drug factories, detected nothing. Still, after the Wiltshires went on holiday last month, officers swooped on their suburban house near Bristol. Mr Wiltshire said: "When we got home they had smashed in the front door and the porch door and the loft was left open. They knew everything about us but they still went ahead. A couple of pensioners hiding a cannabis factory - you couldn't make it up." The source of the aroma was finally sniffed out by a police officer who crawled around the garden on her hands and knees. Mr Wiltshire said he had been told by neighbours about the scent but because of an operation he could not smell it. "My wife doesn't know what cannabis smells like." The couple have now ripped the plant out, which is good news for next-door neighbour David Difford.A week before the police raid a knife-wielding gang wearing Halloween masks broke into his house, believing he had cannabis hidden away. "I looked out the window and saw this gang wearing masks, with a ladder against the house, smashing the windows," he said. "They were shouting 'Give us the weed, man, we know you've got the grass.' We haven't been able to sleep properly since."Avon and Somerset police said they have offered compensation to the Wiltshires and have apologised.
