A disabled man who tried to meet a 13-year-old girl for sex and brought a morning-after pill with him to stop her getting pregnant has been jailed for three and a half years.Kenneth Walker, who is profoundly deaf, became the sixth man to be jailed after being caught out by the paedophile hunters Dark Justice, a two-man operation based in Newcastle.The 37-year-old travelled more than 150 miles from his home in Nottingham to Newcastle in April hoping to meet “Roxy”.Newcastle crown court heard how he had a blanket, a bottle of vodka, two cans of cider, baby wipes, condoms and a morning-after pill. He also had a teddy bear with him.He did not realise he had fallen for a sting by Dark Justice, who posed as the teenager online, and police arrested him after he got off a bus.Jonathan Devlin, prosecuting, said: “He was effectively trapped by two witnesses who posed as a 13-year-old girl on the internet and engaged in conversation with the defendant.“At all times it is the prosecution case that the defendant was fully aware of the age of the person with whom he thought he was communicating.”Walker made contact with “Roxy” on an online chatlog, and she quickly told him she was “13, almost 14”.Conversation moved to the Whatsapp messenger service and within six minutes he turned the conversation to sex. He sent her photos including one of him performing a sex act, the court heard.Walker arranged a meeting and travelled to Tyneside on 17 April, where he was arrested.He told police “provided she consented to sex, he thought that was all right”, Devlin said.Jeff Taylor, defending, said Walker, who needed a sign-language interpreter for the hearing, was not a predatory paedophile and had gone online to meet adult women.He also said Walker had suffered a sad life, with his mother and siblings dying in a fire when he was seven, and his father had a fatal heart attack when the boy was 10. He has been in custody since his arrest and has been isolated in prison due to his profound deafness, Taylor said.“I think it is fair to say he is deeply remorseful,” Taylor said.Walker, of Colesbourne Road, Clifton, Nottingham, previously admitted attempting to meet a child after sexual grooming.Recorder Jamie Hill QC was not persuaded to suspend the jail sentence.The judge said the offence “spreads alarm and disgust in all right-thinking people”.He added: “It is said on your behalf you are not a predatory paedophile. Well, you have no previous convictions but when the opportunity was put in your way, you very rapidly seized it and set to act upon it.”He was jailed for three and a half years and put on the Sex Offender Register indefinitely.Outside court, Dark Justice said: “We are very pleased with the sentence. It just goes to show what we are doing is working and it is time people started taking us seriously. We are not going anywhere.”
