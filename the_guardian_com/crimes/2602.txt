A gamekeeper has been fined Â£5,500 for deliberately poisoning birds of prey in what has been described as Scotland's worst wildlife crime.Stephen Muir, 38, had admitted placing poisoned bait, pheasants and rabbits laced with pellets, on the Barns Estate at Kirkton Manor in the Borders, with the intention of killing the wild birds, including 16 buzzards, and a goshawk. Campaigners, who had hoped Mr Muir would become the first person to be jailed north of the border for crimes against wildlife, said they were disappointed at the sentence. Amendments to the Criminal Justice Act, which received Royal Assent in spring last year, introduced jail terms for those found guilty of cruelty to animals, bringing Scottish law into line with England and Wales. Peebles Sheriff Court had heard how Mr Muir claimed he had laced the bait to attract buzzards, which he said were attacking pheasants and partridges on the estate. His solicitor said Mr Muir expressed "very deep regret" for his actions. A spokesman for the estate said they had been completely unaware of Muir's actions, and were disappointed. Muir has been suspended from his job, which he had held for 17 years, pending a disciplinary inquiry on the estate. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was concerned that he may be allowed to keep his job. "What ought to happen here is someone going to jail, because they are not stopping doing it," he said. "This is not an unusual case. The only unusual thing is the amount of birds killed. I see [serious poisonings] every single year. "In 20 years, only two gamekeepers have been sacked for this type of offence. I think that's appalling. If anyone else was to commit a serious criminal offence they would be sacked immediately."
