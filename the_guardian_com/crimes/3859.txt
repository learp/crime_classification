The police need a nationally recognised brand or logo such as the old blue lamp or a policeman's helmet and local forces should use modern marketing methods including spin doctors to help reduce the public's fear of crime, according to a Home Office study published yesterday.The report, by the inspector of constabulary, says it will take more than uniformed officers on the beat to cut the public's growing fear of crime, and that too often the only sight people get of the police is a car speeding by with sirens blaring. The study, Open All Hours, says that although crime has actually fallen in seven of the last eight years, including a 43% reduction in burglary, public fear of crime has grown. A more visible, accessible and familiar police service is needed. Its proposals include having police officers patrol singly rather than in pairs; requiring the 46,000 officers with "back room" roles to do a regular four hours a month on patrol; and ensuring that all staff wear a uniform unless there is a good reason not to. At present about 56% of police officers patrol the streets. The report says the police need a recognisable, national brand. There is little evidence that people know all the cap badges, logos, crests and liveries used by different forces. The Home Office and police chiefs are to thrash out exactly what the national police logo should be, but they will examine successful images of the past, such as the blue lamp. The report also suggests that local forces should appoint spin doctors, who will be a contact point for the media and will be charged with "the promotion of stories and publicity messages that will enhance public reassurance". At the same time "staff need to be 'on message', fully informed about campaigns and communications strategies." It acknowledges that such developments would only supplement efforts to improve the visibility of street patrols, including the new civilian corps proposed in this week's police reform white paper.
