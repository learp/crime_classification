Police hunting the killer of an Oxford academic arrested a 42-year-old man last night. He was detained in Faringdon, Oxfordshire, in connection with the murder of Barbara Johnston.Police found Dr Johnston's body at her flat in the quiet suburbs of north Oxford early last Thursday. The medical researcher, a specialist in children's respiratory diseases, had been strangled and stabbed 49 times.Johnston, 55, had lived in New Zealand for 23 years before returning to live in the flat last September. The police forced the front door after her parents, who live in the Midlands, raised concerns for her safety.Detective Chief Inspector Steve Tolmie described the murder as a 'shocking attack'. 'It is important that anyone who has any information gets in touch with police immediately,' Tolmie said. With no sign of any forced entry or anything taken from the flat, detectives believe that Johnston may have opened the door to her killer.Tolmie said the investigation would include investigations into whether Johnston had been in contact with people through the internet.
