New council inspectors will be given the power to dock benefits from unruly tenants under a controversial government plan unveiled today.Welfare campaigners have reacted with anger to ministers' decision to press ahead with the idea of restricting housing benefit to only well-behaved tenants.A consultation paper released by the work and pensions minister, Andrew Smith, today sets out two options for implementing the idea.Under the first, which is based on a private members bill introduced last year by the former welfare minister, Frank Field, benefit would be cut to anyone found guilty in court of antisocial behaviour.Under the second option, which is more draconian and favoured by the government, local "antisocial behaviour coordinators" would have the power to dock benefit without going to court. The paper said that ministers prefer this option because it "offers a quicker and more decisive response to antisocial behaviour before it has a chance to become established." Both options would require a change in the law to make the entitlement to housing benefit "conditional on the socially responsible behaviour of the claimants themselves".The paper listed what the government considers the sort of neighbour nuisance that would lead to reductions in benefit.It included "rubbish, and worse, thrown into gardens and pushed through letterboxes."Also listed are: "Incessant loud music; continual shouting and screaming; graffiti and other wanton damage; threats of violence; deliberate damage to cars; and intimidation in the streets by gangs of young people and other drunken and rowdy behaviour."The paper tried to anticipate the accusation that the measures will increase social exclusion by restricting benefit to poor households.It stated: "Social exclusion does not just affect the poor and marginalised in our society. It also affects people who find their lives restricted or blighted by the behaviour of other people."Launching the paper Mr Smith said: "The government sympathises with those who question whether it is right for the state to support the housing costs of people whose behaviour brings misery to the lives of individuals and communities."The aim of a housing benefit sanction would be to provide a workable measure that could be applied swiftly and fairly in response to such behaviour."Adam Sampson, Director of Shelter said: "These proposals will simply create more problems. We need a more balanced solution - one that challenges and prevents antisocial behaviour and does not simply exacerbate poverty and make more people homeless.""Housing benefit is there to help people pay for their homes and stop them becoming homeless. It is not an effective tool to prevent antisocial behaviour."Liz Phelps, policy officer at Citizens Advice, the representative body for citizens advice bureaux, said the measures would fail to tackle unruly behaviour and lead to hardship and homelessness."Housing benefit plays a vital role for low income families to pay the rent and avoid homelessness. Cutting benefit is not the right way to tackle antisocial behaviour, it will just result in more people losing their homes," she said.
