Listening to Jack Straw's statement to parliament on the Dano Sonnex case, I could not help reflecting on the contention that he – and his henchpeople in the National Offender Management Service Agency (Noms) – continues to maintain that resources were not the issue because of the amount of money they have poured into it.Reading the responsible and dignified statement made last week by David Scott, the highly regarded and widely respected chief probation officer for London whom they had forced to resign over the case, I also could not help reflecting on where the decency agenda, that Jack Straw and Phil Wheatley, the chief executive of Noms, are so keen to preach on, was. Neither had had the decency or common courtesy – let alone exercised the leadership that should be expected of them – to see Scott and explain their reasoning, leaving that sad duty to a subordinate.What this government seems to ignore is the simple fact that people are people, not commodities. That means that the most effective tool when leading or trying to influence them is other people. If you want to influence people to live useful and law-abiding lives, you have got to recruit, train, resource and lead other people to do just that.Instead, the government quotes the amount of money it has made available every time any of its practices are questioned. When you ask where the money has gone, you find that it is not on improving the numbers of trained probation officers and their ability to do their jobs, but on increasing bureaucracy, including expensive management consultancies.At the same time, ministers insist on pursuing impractical ideas – such as the idea that you do not empower probation officers but rather purchase probation services. Government has been resolute in ignoring advice, evident by the contempt with which its "consultative" process is currently regarded, because everyone knows that if you don't agree with a minister's views, you will be ignored.Brown, when chancellor decreed for cost-saving rather than practical reasons that Ofsted was to take over the inspection of children's services. Already, the Baby P case has shown the madness of that approach, because the inspection of schools requires totally different knowledge and procedures than the inspection of how children are cared for in the community.Jack Straw has done away with the professional heads of the operational prison and probation services, as part of the evolution of the Noms monster into an agency with 4,270 civil servants. How can any operational service of that size function without a professional head?Worse still is that if you try to merge the prison service, with its professional responsibility for caring for those sentenced to custody, and the probation service, with its responsibility for caring for those sentenced in the community working in close concert with the courts and the police, probation will be swallowed up because of the higher public profile of prisons. True to form and forecast, both the Noms chief executive and his offender manager (deputy) are from the prison service and, in addition to there being no director of the national probation service, there is no probation officer in any of the senior posts in Noms.When I asked who was now responsible for giving professional probation advice to ministers, I was told that the recently introduced district offender managers (Doms) – each with a headquarters – were responsible for "operational direction". Only three of these Doms have actually managed offenders, one a probation officer, and operational direction can be an entirely paper exercise. But it will result in nothing without professional leadership, which is what Noms denies at its peril.I feel that, while undoubtedly all was not well in parts of the London Probation operation, to lay all the blame for the Sonnex disaster at its head, an inexperienced probation officer and an unnamed police officer, is wholly inadequate and indeed wrongly based.David Scott was blamed for not spending his entire budget, but could not implement his three-year strategy because his actual yearly allocation invariably came very late, and rules governing its expenditure were changed so much so that his auditors described his trying to come in on budget as trying to land a jumbo on a postage stamp.While he was desperately trying to invest in more staff, he was told that all this was subject to national contracts. And, most tellingly of all, while a poor, young and inexperienced probation officer was struggling with 127 individual cases, the already grossly inflated Noms was expanding its staff to number 4,270.After all this, an extraordinary statement by a leader about a subordinate in public when he himself was at least part responsible. Wheatley, now also the professional head of the probation service, said on Channel 4 News that if David Scott had not resigned he would have been subject to a "performance capability". I return the compliment.If Jack Straw and Phil Wheatley do not resign, they should also be subject to a performance capability for what the Sonnex verdict exposes of the damage they have done to the probation service.The service – which for a century was the envy of other countries because of its rehabilitative success, but whose ethos now begins with punishment – was better off when it was an operational service with its own professional head. It is time that this ill-thought through venture was ended or, not only will there be more similar cases, but there will be no one left in the probation service to manage them.
