The driver of an articulated lorry who is accused of killing a family of six may have been using a laptop computer to search for directions as he headed down the motorway, a court heard yesterday.David and Michelle Statham, of Llandudno, north Wales, and their four children - Reece, 13, Jay, nine, Mason, 20 months, and 10-week-old Ellouise - were killed instantly in the crash on the M6 at Sandbach, Cheshire, last October.Paulo Jorge Nogueira da Silva, 46, was driving with "gross inattention" to the road when his 40 tonne vehicle smashed into the Statham family's Toyota Previa, Chester crown court was told.The jury heard that Da Silva, who was delivering fruit juice to Morrison's, could have been using his laptop to find directions to the supermarket chain's distribution centre in Northwich, Cheshire, after hearing that the M6 had been closed due to an accident.Although Da Silva, a Portuguese national who lives in Murcia, Spain, insisted the computer was turned off and on the passenger seat, police investigators found the device to be on the cab's console with its screen facing the driver, Andrew Thomas QC, prosecuting, told the court."He knew that the motorway was shut and he was going to have to come off at an earlier junction," Thomas said. "How was he going to work out a new route? What he used was a laptop computer with a global positioning system device fitted to it."Da Silva denies six charges of causing death by dangerous driving and six alternative charges of causing death by careless driving.The jury heard that Mrs Statham, 33, a financial adviser, was driving home on October 20 after the family had spent the weekend with her parents. Ellouise was in the front passenger seat while Mr Statham, 38, a chef, and Mason were in the middle row. The two older boys were in the back row of seats. The people carrier had stopped at the end of a long queue of traffic on the northbound carriageway of the motorway."As the Statham family came behind a large container lorry, which was at the back of the queuing traffic, their car was struck from behind by another lorry," Thomas said. "The Stathams' car was crushed between the two trucks. The front of the car was forced underneath the rear of the lorry ahead of them and the passenger compartment was compressed."The lorry which hit their car from behind was driven by Paulo da Silva. He had not seen the queuing traffic ahead because he was not paying attention to his driving."The case continues.
