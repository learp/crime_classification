Despite their belief that Mehmet Goren had killed his daughter by late March 1999, two months after she disappeared, it would be a decade before police were able to charge him – and his brothers, Ali and Cuma – with her murder.The complex investigation was hampered not only by the "honour" code that silenced family members, but also because Tulay's body has never been found – one of only a handful of such cases the Metropolitan police have dealt with.When arrested on suspicion of murder on 23 March 1999, along with her husband, Tulay's mother, Hanim, retracted a statement she had initially given saying Tulay had run away and told police she believed Mehmet had "disappeared" their daughter. A year later, police felt they had enough evidence to charge him, but the Crown Prosecution Service said it could not rule out the possibility that the 15-year-old was alive somewhere, so a decision was taken not to go ahead.Officers then hit a brick wall. The Goren family members went silent, either through fear or guilt, there was no forensic evidence and, at that time, there was little understanding of "honour" crimes.Although it was never formally closed, there was little movement on the inquiry until 2007.However, "honour-based" violence in the Kurdish community was by then on the Metropolitan police's radar. In late 2003, a Kurdish father, Abdulla Yones, had been successfully prosecuted for slitting his 16-year-old daughter Heshu's throat for dating the wrong man, and in June 2007, after a three-month trial, the father and uncle of Banaz Mahmod, 20, were found guilty of murdering her in an "honour killing" for her choice of boyfriend.Police understanding of honour-based crimes had "grown massively" since 1999, according to Detective Inspector Dave Corby, who led the inquiry. They decided to look at Tulay's case again.In addition to the new perspective gained by treating Tulay's killing as an "honour" crime, the passage of time helped the investigation in several ways, according to detectives:• Changes in the criminal justice system: First, courts now allow hearsay evidence, which previously would have been inadmissible. An account by Tulay's boyfriend, Halil Unal, of her whispered warning to him on 7 January could now be heard by a jury.• Since there had been no verifiable sightings of Tulay in the intervening years, she was now legally dead.On 25 November 2008, after a covert operation to track the Goren brothers, police arrested Mehmet, Ali and Cuma on suspision of murder and conspiracy to murder.In June this year, officers flew to Turkey to consult Professor Aytekin Sir, a psychiatrist and expert on "honour" crimes. Knowing nothing of the details of Tulay's case, he nevertheless described to police a pattern of "honour" killing among rural communities in the east of Turkey that mirrored Tulay's case.Professor Yakin Erturk, a former UN expert on violence against women, and expert witness at the trial, told police that a family council did not actually have to meet.The re-investigation of Tulay's murder also enabled detectives to see the significance of Mehmet's axe attack on Unal on 22 January, two weeks after she vanished. In 2001, Mehmet was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, serving three, for grievous bodily harm against Unal.
