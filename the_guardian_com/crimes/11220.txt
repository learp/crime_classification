A 13-year-old boy and a 19-year-old man were arrested by Merseyside police yesterday after a man's body was found in the embers of a bonfire. The body of 34-year-old Stephen Croft, from Birkenhead, Wirral, was found shortly after 1am yesterday, on grassland near the YMCA in Whetstone Lane, Birkenhead, Wirral. A postmortem examination is being carried out by a Home Office pathologist.More than 100 people had attended the bonfire and fireworks. A senior YMCA staff member said: "It had been a great evening and all our residents were back inside at 11pm as they have a strict curfew. At around 1am, a lad came running in to reception saying there was somebody on the bonfire. Our security guard went outside and saw somebody who looked like they had been thrown or placed on the bonfire. He was badly burned."A spokeswoman for Merseyside police said: "Emergency services were called to the scene at around 1am when a man's body was found with head injuries and having suffered burns. He was found in the embers of the bonfire which had been built earlier in the evening. We are appealing for witnesses. This matter is being treated as an unexplained death and it is not yet a murder investigation."We have now completed initial forensic examination of the scene and we expect to begin speaking to the boy in the coming hours."She described as "nonsense" reports from witnesses which claimed that Mr Croft was attacked by a gang of youths who threw a flaming piece of wood at him.Officers particularly want to speak to people who were in the area between midnight and 1am yesterday. Detectives were keen to piece together the events leading up to the attack. Yesterday around eight police vehicles and a blue and white police tent were covering the site of the bonfire. Forensic tests and house-to-house police inquiries were taking place in the area, near the town centre.
