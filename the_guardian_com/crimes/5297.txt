Three people were yesterday convicted of murdering a teenager who was doused in petrol and then burned alive. Maria Chandler, 40, Jimi-Lee Stewart, 25, and Jonathan Clarke, 20, killed 17-year-old student Simon Everitt in a re-enactment of a scene from the movie Severance. Everitt, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was tied to a tree in woodland in nearby Mautby and then set on fire, Norwich crown court heard. Clarke, Stewart and Everitt had all been involved in a tangled love affair with a woman called Fiona Statham, who was 19 at the time of the murder. Everitt's body was found on June 28 last year.
