Police arrested a 38-year-old man last night in connection with the murder of the millionaire businessman Amarjit Chohan and the disappearance of his family.Mr Chohan's body was found in the sea near Bournemouth pier last month after he and his family had vanished from their home in Heston, west London, in February. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "A 38-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder of Amarjit Chohan. He will be brought to a central London police station for questioning." The spokesman declined to give further details of the arrest or where it took place. Police are known to be looking for Peter Douglas Rees, 38, whom detectives described last week as being a "close associate" of Ken Regan, alias Avery, and William Horncy, alias Smith, who have been named as prime suspects in Mr Chohan's killing. The millionaire's wife, Nancy, 25, their sons Devinder, 19 months, and Ravinder, four months, along with Mrs Chohan's mother Charanjit Kaur, 51, are still missing. Police believe Mr Chohan, 46, was strangled then buried for a time in a field near Stoodleigh, Devon, before his body was dumped in the sea. Mr Regan, 54, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, and Mr Horncy, 50, from the Bournemouth area, were seen boarding a ferry at Dover two weeks ago. It is thought they were travelling under their aliases and may have been attempting to get to Spain.
