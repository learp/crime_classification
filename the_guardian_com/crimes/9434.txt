Government measures to protect trafficked people have backfired, increasing the suffering of victims and undermining attempts to prosecute the criminal gangs who abused them, a coalition of human rights charities claim today.In a damning report on the government's policy of looking after suspected victims of trafficking into prostitution, domestic slavery, cannabis farming and other exploitation, the Anti Trafficking Monitoring Group said Britain was breaking the European convention against trafficking and was even breaching UK law.Children who may have been trafficked are too often treated as criminals and the government has presided over an "on-going scandal" of trafficked children going missing from care, said the group, whose members include Amnesty International, Anti-Slavery International and Unicef. It concluded that the current system is "not fit for purpose".The far-reaching criticism follows a review of 390 cases of suspected trafficking victims handled by UK authorities since Britain adopted the European convention against trafficking in people in April 2009. It requires governments to take measures to protect victims, prevent trafficking, prosecute those responsible and ensure that states combat trafficking through international cooperation. The government estimates that 5,000 trafficked people are currently in the UK."There is a fundamental misunderstanding that trafficking is an immigration crime when it is in fact a crime of exploitation and forced labour," said Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International. "Children working in cannabis farms are being prosecuted while nothing happens to the people running the show. The authorities are locking up victims who have evidence that could lead to prosecutions."The government's key measure to meet the demands of the European convention has been a national referral mechanism for suspected victims of trafficking, which is intended to allow frontline staff such as police and social workers to refer suspected cases to "competent authorities" at the Home Office's UK Human Trafficking Centre and the UK Border Agency to provide protection and support. But the report's authors claim the UK Border Agency has a tendency to suspect that possible victims may be trying to play the immigration system and too often assesses them as committing immigration crimes rather than being victims of trafficking."In some cases, individuals who have been ill-treated by modern day slave traders have been subject to further violations of their human rights and in some cases, to treatment at the hands of the UK authorities which has impeded their recovery," the report states.It quotes the official response to a woman who claimed she had been trafficked into prostitution to illustrate the suspicion they sometimes face under the national referral mechanism".Her decision notice read: "Your claim to have been forced to sleep with men against your will, that you were 'extremely unhappy' and 'always crying' is considered to be inconsistent with your claim not to have taken advantage of the ample opportunity you had to seek help from the police on the numerous occasions you left the house and the occasion when you took the time to visit the police station. Your credibility has been damaged as a result and it is not accepted that you were trafficked to the UK or forced to work as a prostitute by traffickers as you claim."The report claims: "The national referral mechanism actually deters a significant proportion of the intended beneficiaries from using it and therefore from accessing services and exercising their rights."It found that the system has not facilitated prosecutions of traffickers as was expected and in some instances, it said, the police are concerned that it has undermined them. In the last nine months of 2009, 36 people, 17 of them women, arrested on suspicion of trafficking offences had faced charges in court.Damian Green, the immigration minister, promised to "act where necessary" on the criticisms."Combating human trafficking is a key priority for the new coalition government. It is a brutal form of organised crime with men, women and children being abused in the sex industry, forced labour and domestic servitude," he said.
