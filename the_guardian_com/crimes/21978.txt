Up to 30 top criminals a year will be targeted with new "super-Asbos", ministers revealed today. The move will allow police to act against suspected crimelords without taking them to a criminal trial.The measures, within the Home Office's new serious crime bill, would only be subject to the lower "balance of probabilities" test imposed by the high court, rather than the "beyond reasonable doubt" test of a criminal court.But breaching the orders - similar to the control orders used against suspected terrorists - would then result in a jail sentence of up to five years.The publication of the new bill, flagged up in last year's Queen's speech, came as the Home Office reeled under the double whammy of the investigation into how it failed to process 27,000 files on offences committed by Britons abroad, and the absconding of a terror suspect held under control orders.Vernon Coaker, the junior Home Office minister, said that the super-Asbos would be a major new tool to combat around 30 suspected criminals who currently believe they are "untouchable".He said: "There are people who try to stay remote from crime, who try to encourage crime but never get their hands dirty. We want to ensure that, while our methods are proportionate, we can get to them."People who believe they are beyond the law and untouchable will know that the government is on the side of the ordinary law-abiding majority."The kind of restrictions which will be imposed on criminals include:· Limits on their financial, property or business dealings· their working arrangements· the people they can associate with or communicate with· premises they have access to· travel in the UK or abroad.A court could ban a suspected gangster from owning a mobile phone or from attending a club where police believe criminal activity is taking place or which is known to be a haunt of criminals.Even someone who has not been convicted of a crime could face one of the so-called "gangster Asbos" if police believe they are crooks.The orders will cost about £40,000 to impose.However, a further £40,000 of taxpayers' money could go on Legal Aid costs for those who attempt to fight the orders in the courts.Suspected gangsters could also fight a lengthy legal battle in the appeal courts over the restrictions.Liberty, the human rights lobby group, claimed that the new measures were "part of a dangerous government trend toward punishing individuals despite a lack of evidence of their guilt".Jago Russell, the organisation's policy officer, said: "We used to believe in hard evidence and fair trials in this country. Now we dispense rapid-fire justice as quickly as the government can develop a catchy four-letter acronym for it."These new orders targeted at the 'Mr Bigs' of the criminal world will likely be as unfair and ineffective as Asbos and control orders [for suspected terrorists] before them." The serious crime bill included a range of serious offences which could lead to the orders being imposed, including drug trafficking, prostitution, people trafficking, money laundering, fraud and counterfeiting.But it also detailed environmental crimes, including fly-tipping and "fishing for salmon, trout or freshwater fish with prohibited implements".The bill also included a new offence of "encouraging or assisting another person to commit an offence".Mr Coaker said: "This is in response to what the Law Commission were asking for to try and plug a gap in the law where people assist with a crime but a crime may not actually take place."Anyone who assisted a criminal who planned to commit a crime could be punished with an equivalent sentence, including life imprisonment for murder, the bill said.It also included wide-ranging new powers to allow the public sector and private companies to share information on people suspected of fraud.For example, if someone was believed to be committing bank fraud their details could be passed to government agencies in case they were also involved in tax or benefit fraud, said the minister.However, there will be no compulsion to share the information, and certain personal details would not be involved.
