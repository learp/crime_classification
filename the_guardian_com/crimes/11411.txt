The new Metropolitan Police commissioner is in place, the new head of the National Crime Agency has been selected, elected police and crime commissioners are on their way and the Winsor review into police pay and conditions is ongoing. So far so good for the Tory's policy of changing the face of policing.But one thing is still missing in the list of appointments - the new chair of the Independent Police complaints commission has still to be selected by the Home Secretary. It is more than 18 months since Nick Hardwick left the role and no one can explain clearly - least of all the Home Office - why the post remains vacant. With major independent IPCC inquiries ongoing into a number of controversial deaths after contact with the police - including the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, the armed man whose death sparked the August riots in Tottenham which spread across the country, and at least two deaths after the use of tasars and pepper spray, the IPCC needs strong leadership. But Theresa May, it seems, is having trouble finding the right person for the job. Candidates were interviewed way back in the early summer and we were told that a decision might finally be made by the end of September. What could be the problem? Too much independence in her candidates or too little?
