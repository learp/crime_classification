Sir Christopher Meyer's attempts to correct "myths about the PCC's role in the Sara Cox case" (Letters, June 10) need some correction.The whole problem with the press complaints commission is that it sees its role as limited to seeking conciliation in the form of corrections and apologies to be published by offending newspapers. Having negotiated an apology in Sara Cox's case the PCC had no further role to play even if she had not issued proceedings. To suggest that the PCC acted swiftly in getting an apology agreed within six days is not much of an achievement. In Amanda Holden's similar case against the Daily Star (in which my firm represented Miss Holden) she chose not to go to the PCC because the paper was threatening to publish further paparazzi pictures of her the following day. An injunction was readily granted by the high court to prevent such publication. The eventual settlement included not only an apology but an order for destruction of the images by both the newspaper and the photographer, a permanent ban on further publication and payment of substantial damages and costs, none of which could have been ordered by the PCC. The commission's approach is to take the publication of a correction and apology as compliance with the editor's code of practice no matter how flagrant or deliberate the breach of the terms of the code. It would do better in such cases to insist upon investigation and to make an adjudication so that the editor concerned could be properly censured for flouting the terms of a code to which all newspaper editors subscribe. If Sir Christopher is suggesting that the PCC would have done so in Sara Cox's case but for the fact that she commenced proceedings, will he do so now that the proceedings have concluded and his own description of the publication as "a very serious invasion of privacy"? It would be a good opportunity for him to show that the PCC is not quite as toothless as most of us think. Peter H Crawford Stitt & Co, solicitors
