Engineers are to compete for funds to develop fraud-proof mobile phones to herald the way for their use as electronic wallets.Four out of five phones in use in the UK contain data which can be used by criminals to access bank accounts, steal identity or sell on personal data, yet only four in 10 people lock their mobiles using a PIN. Home Office minister Alan Campbell has called upon existing mobile phone users to, "lock their phones in the same way they would lock their cars and lock their homes." Launching a competition offering Â£400,000 in development money for engineering new ways of preventing fraud, Campbell added: "We are very aware that new technology brings with it new risks of crime but we are very much on the front foot with regard to this. Criminals will always be looking for the next bit of technology and of ways to use that technology to commit crime. What government needs to make sure of is that we have the resources to tackle them."
