He had driven his car to look for this person and, during the course of looking for this person, he crashed into a parked van, causing damage."The police realised that he was drunk and told him he would have to provide a specimen, the court heard. "However he was quite hostile," Mitchell said, and Green was arrested.Green, 30, who appeared in court under his real name of Stephen Manderson, was found to have driven with 52 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35.He said he would take a drink-driver rehabilitation course so that his 12-month disqualification might be cut to nine months. His licence was endorsed for the offence.
