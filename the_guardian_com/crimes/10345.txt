A new offence of obstructing ambulance staff responding to emergencies is in the pipeline as part of clampdown on antisocial behaviour, the health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said today.The move would bring the protection of ambulance staff into line with police officers, as part of the government's drive to widen moves to tackle antisocial behaviour in the home, classroom and local community.Ms Hewitt toured Kings College Hospital in London to promote measures put in place to curb abusive behaviour on NHS premises.She was one of more than a dozen of ministers helping Tony Blair to launch its flagship third-term social policy, the respect action plan, which proposes a national parenting academy, temporary evictions of troublesome families, and greater powers to involve the police in community issues.Ms Hewitt spoke to security staff about the benefits of panic buttons which pinpoint any attacks on staff and enable a rapid response.Government figures show NHS staff suffer more than 100,000 incidents of violent or verbal abuse each year.A clampdown led to 759 prosecutions being brought last year as a result of assaults on NHS staff, compared to just 51 cases the year before.Ms Hewitt said today: "The majority of people know what respect is and how to behave well by being considerate to others. Where respect breaks down antisocial behaviour takes hold."In the NHS we've seen this at firsthand. It is wholly unacceptable that a minority of people - often under the influence of drink and drugs - abuse or attack NHS staff."The respect agenda is about nurturing and, where needed, enforcing a modern culture of respect which the majority of people want." Public sector union Unison welcomed the proposal as "a step in the right direction"."We would like it to be taken further and extend similar protection to other public sector workers who are increasingly vulnerable to attacks from the public and make sure there are tough penalties in place for people that are found guilty of assaults," a Unison spokeswoman said.
