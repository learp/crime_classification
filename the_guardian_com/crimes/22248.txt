A dangerous paedophile who showed "no remorse" for raping two young girls over a 12-year period has been jailed for life.Morris Petch, 50, will spend a minimum of 12 years behind bars after he was branded a "serious risk to the public" by a judge at the high court in Edinburgh.Petch was a key member of a paedophile gang that started abusing the two girls when they were under 10.He had denied any involvement but after a three-day trial earlier this year a jury convicted him of raping both girls.Caroline Dunsmore, 43, of Newhaven, Edinburgh, was sentenced in June to 12 years in jail for her role in the abuse of the girls, one of whom was her daughter Dana Fowley. Ms Fowley, who is now 26, waived her right to anonymity.Petch was a friend of William King, who had orchestrated the abuse of the youngsters. He was married to Dunsmore but died in 1995.Another member of the gang, John O'Flaherty, 50, of Ferryroad, Edinburgh, was sentenced to 13 years.Sentencing Petch today, the judge, Lord Malcolm, told him: "You have been convicted of grave and disgraceful crimes towards young and vulnerable children."It is plain from the assessment carried out on you that you have no remorse for them nor for the damage that you have caused to your victims."Lord Malcolm said Petch was in denial about what he had done and his inability to control his "deviant behaviour".He continued: "It is clear from the material now available to the courts that you are a serious risk to the public."Nothing has been said on your behalf, no doubt because there is nothing that can be said." The judge stressed that Petch, of Buccleuch Street, Edinburgh, would not necessarily be released from prison after 12 years.He told him: "Ultimately, your release date will depend upon the parole board determination as to whether and when it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that you should continue to be confined in prison."Outside court, Ms Fowley welcomed the sentence. She said: "I'm pleased that this particular court case has finally concluded. I am pleased with the sentence the judge has given."
