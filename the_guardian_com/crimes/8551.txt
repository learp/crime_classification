People are being kept in custody for up to five weeks because of a shortage of funding and lack of staff at the probation service in Merseyside, it emerged yesterday.The probation service has 13 staff, and senior north-west circuit judge Sean Duncan said this was insufficient to cope with the increasing number of cases at Liverpool crown court. It takes up to seven weeks to process cases at the court, far longer than is considered satisfactory. A spokesman for the probation service said a new case management system meant the number of requests for reports increased by 48% in January and 55% in February. New legislation on sentencing further increased demand. Last week, a youth in custody had to wait five weeks for his report to be processed. The probation service is aiming to reduce waiting time for reports to two weeks for defendants on remand and three weeks for those on bail.
