Police investigating the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence today arrested three people on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.Scotland Yard said two men and a woman, all in their 40s, were arrested in south London this morning.They have been taken to various police stations where they will be interviewed today.A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "This is one further step as part of a lengthy, ongoing investigation. "This investigation remains vibrant. Officers from the team have been to interview anyone who may have information relating to the murder or the events surrounding it." Scotland Yard said the investigation has not been scaled down but arrests for the murder eight years ago of the black teenager are not thought to be imminent. In February detectives arrested two women, also on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.That time the women were in their 20s, from south-east London, and police believed they held crucial evidence about the identities of Lawrence's killers.Lawrence was stabbed to death by a gang of racists in Eltham, south-east London, on May 7 1993.The five suspects were acquitted of his murder twice: originally on a public prosecution, and then when a private prosecution for the murder failed.Sir William Macpherson's report into the original murder inquiry revealed incompetence and mishandling of the case. It also said the Metropolitan police force was "institutionally racist". The government decided in the summer to revise Britain's ancient double jeopardy law, by allowing senior judges to overturn acquittals and order retrials in murder cases where compelling new evidence has emerged.
