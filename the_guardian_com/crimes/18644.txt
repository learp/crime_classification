Shrien Dewani will discover on Wednesday whether his latest bid to delay his extradition to South Africa to face trial over his wife's death has succeeded.The 33-year-old is suspected of ordering the killing of his new wife Anni, 28, who was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010.On Wednesday at Westminster magistrates court, chief magistrate Howard Riddle is expected to reveal his latest decision as to whether Dewani should be extradited.The businessman has been receiving treatment for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder at psychiatric hospitals near Bristol since his wife's death.Prosecutors claim it would not be "oppressive" to extradite the businessman to face trial, and that there has been a "significant and sustained improvement" in his mental health in recent months.Hugo Keith QC, for the South African government, admitted Dewani was not fit to plead, but argued that this should not stop the extradition process.However, Dewani's defence team has argued that the decision should be delayed for six months to avoid his condition worsening.During a full extradition hearing earlier this month, Professor Nigel Eastman said: "If he goes now, he will be in a poorer state than if he goes in six months' time. If he goes to South Africa and does not improve, he is at risk of being chronically ill and chronically unfit to plead."It emerged during the four-day hearing that while resident at Fromeside and Blaise View mental health units Dewani was allowed to walk home every day, and a camper van was set up in the grounds where he would spend long periods of time.Riddle ruled in 2011 that Dewani should be sent back to South Africa, but an appeal against the decision was successful and he was ordered to look again at the case.So far three men have been convicted over Mrs Dewani's death.Last year, South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her. Prosecutors claimed he was a hitman hired by Dewani to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied.Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was given a 25-year prison sentence.The family of Mrs Dewani will be at the court hearing on Wednesday, her sister Amy Hindocha has said.She told ITV's DayBreak programme that her brother Anish and her parents had travelled to London from their home in Sweden to see the latest court appearance.Speaking of her father, who has been to every court hearing in England and South Africa, she said: "He just wants to know what happened, it's a desire that has taken time away from everything else."Anish Hindocha said: "We hope for the best outcome today. I can somehow see a light where we will get answers."
