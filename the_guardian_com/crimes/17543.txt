British police are struggling to keep up with the volume of online crime, one of the country's most senior police officers said yesterday.Giving evidence to the House of Lords science and technology select committee, Commander Sue Wilkinson of the Metropolitan police said officers would not be able to cope if they had to look into every internet crime that was reported."The scale is such that the police service would fall over if it tried to investigate every case," she said. "I would hate any member of the public to feel that they can't report a crime, but people need to understand that each individual e-crime can't be investigated."The committee, which is investigating internet security, was told the situation was like petty vandalism, where minor cases are left untouched unless a pattern of crimes can be established.There are several ways for people to report online crime such as illegal images, cyberbullying or fraud. But there is no system for investigators to establish patterns of offences, or even decide which agency should look into individual cases.Sharon Lemon, head of online crime at the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, said intelligence indicated there was a sustained growth of the most pernicious sorts of internet crime. "Money-motivated crimes are on the up, but the 'opening the Pentagon doors just because I'm clever' sort is dropping," she said.Financial institutions and retailers have come under pressure to improve internet security following a series of high-profile lapses. Last month the discount retailer TK Maxx revealed that a breach had left millions of customer details open to theft.
