Detectives investigating the murder of a young father who was shot dead last month have named a teenager they want to question in connection with the case.Peter Woodhams, a 22-year-old satellite television engineer and father of one, was shot near his east London home minutes after confronting a group of youths outside a row of shops in Freemasons Road, Canning Town, on August 21.Shortly after the confrontation, which is thought to have involved two or possibly three youths, Mr Woodhams drove the short distance home to Tallis Close, and told his fiancee that there was "trouble outside". He went back outside and was shot in the adjoining Leslie Road. He was able to stagger home but collapsed in front of his fiancee and later died.Scotland Yard appealed for help yesterday to track down Bradley Tucker, 18, in an effort to make a breakthrough in the inquiry. Mr Tucker, who is described as being 5ft 9in with dark brown hair and brown eyes, had been living in nearby Butchers Road and was last seen in Newham on the day of the shooting.Detective Superintendent Vic Rae, of the Metropolitan police's homicide and serious crime command, said police wanted to speak to the man as part of their "ongoing investigation"."We would urge anyone who may know of his whereabouts to contact us immediately," he said. "If members of the public believe they have seen a young man matching Bradley Tucker's description we would ask that they dial 999 and alert police rather than approach him."Soon after Mr Woodhams's death it emerged that he had been stabbed in the neck by a group of youths in January on the same spot as the confrontation which preceded his murder.Jane Bowden, his fiancee, has claimed that the youths waged a campaign of intimidation after the stabbing, which happened after Mr Woodhams confronted them about throwing a stone at his car.Claims that the police failed to properly investigate the earlier attack resulted in the Independent Police Complaints Commission, starting an investigation in August.Miss Bowden, 23, said she constantly phoned police for five weeks but no officer took a statement from her. No one was arrested in connection with the stabbing.The inquiry, led by Peter Orr, senior investigator, is running in parallel with the murder investigation.The Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, was asked to report fully to the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) on how his officers dealt with the incidents in January and August.Police made a public apology to Mr Woodhams's family following criticism of their response to the stabbing. In a statement issued shortly after the shooting, the MPA offered its condolences to the family and said it had asked Sir Ian to "report fully ... on both incidents and investigations relating to Mr Woodhams".The statement went on: "We will want to know how police responded to the earlier stabbing incident in January when Mr Woodhams was allegedly attacked with a knife, and whether the handling of that incident had any bearing on his murder."Aneeta Prem, the MPA member with responsibility for the Newham area, added that the commissioner would be asked for a detailed report into all aspects of the case "so that it is clear how police responded to the earlier stabbing, and what bearing that may or may not have had on Mr Woodhams's murder".
