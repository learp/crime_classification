A teenager who killed a boy after launching an attack in a school gym hall has been jailed for three and a half years.Euan Craig, 14, suffered serious head injuries when he was punched repeatedly at a Glasgow school on 23 May. He died the next day in hospital.The teenager responsible, who cannot be named for legal reasons, landed the blows after being hit accidentally by a sponge ball as they waited for gym class to begin. A number of pupils witnessed the assault.The accused, 15, admitted a charge of culpable homicide at an earlier court hearing.Sitting at the high court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Bracadale ordered the teenager to be detained for three years and six months.The judge heard defence suggestions that detention may not be necessary but ultimately ruled that a custodial term was the only appropriate sentence for the case.Passing sentence, the judge described the consequences of the attack as "catastrophic" and told the court: "The assault was a wholly unnecessary one.""By all accounts, he [Euan] was a popular and well-rounded boy," the judge said."He had his whole life ahead of him. His prospects were good and he had every expectation of going on to leave school, enter higher education and graduate to a worthwhile career."It is clear from a very full victim impact statement placed before me that his untimely death has had a profound effect on the family who are going to have to live with this immeasurable loss."The court heard that Euan and the teenager, who was 14 at the time of the attack, were third-year pupils who knew one another but were not friends.Euan was playing with a sponge ball while waiting for a class to begin when he misjudged a throw to a friend and hit the accused on the side of the face.The accused reacted angrily towards Euan and began punching him.The attacker hit the schoolboy around five times on the left side of his head, despite the victim's repeated apologies and attempts to cover his face.The accused eventually stopped and walked out of the gym, while the victim stated: "It was an accident, I never meant it. The ball was only soft."Moments later Euan slumped to the floor and appeared to suffer a seizure. He was given first aid until ambulance crews arrived and took him to Glasgow's Southern General hospital.The schoolboy was pronounced dead the following day. The cause of death was recorded as head injury.
