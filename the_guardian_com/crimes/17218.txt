An international effort to target cocaine trafficking will begin today with the launch of a new intelligence centre to monitor South American drug smugglers crossing the Atlantic.Using Royal Navy warships and UK narcotics officers, the Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre aims to intercept shipments before they reach Europe.During a six-month trial, officers have already seized almost 11 tonnes of cocaine.The centre, which combines the efforts of officers from seven European countries, was conceived following mounting concern over the continent's growing cocaine consumption.Policing and security minister Vernon Coaker said: 'This will help target cocaine smugglers by sharing intelligence with other countries and co-ordinating rapid air and sea operations, making the best use of law enforcement and military resources to stop attempted drug runs across the Atlantic.'By taking an active role in this innovative drug trafficking centre we are cutting down the pathways used by those serious criminals attempting to infest our country with cocaine.'
