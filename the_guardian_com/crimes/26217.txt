One of Greater Manchester's most senior police officers has stepped into the row over strategy and resources following last week's riots.Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who is heading up Greater Manchester police's (GMP) Shop a Looter campaign, criticised the prime minister and the home secretary in a series of tweets on Sunday night.Shewan said Cameron had not visited Manchester to learn his own lessons on gang violence and antisocial behaviour (ASB) and that Shewan's trips to the US had left him feeling proud about how UK policing was "integrated with communities"."Cameron has not been to GMP to see how we have reduced crime & ASB, tackled gang violence & raised public confidence, he could do worse," he tweeted.A second tweet read: "Been to US twice in last year to look at policing. I have come back feeling proud of where policing is in UK â€“ integrated with communities."His remarks come after Cameron's appointment of US police chief Bill Bratton, who will advise the government on New York-style 'zero tolerance' policing and gang violence.Bratton's appointment has angered many UK officers including the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Sir Hugh Orde. Orde said in an interview over the weekend: "I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them. It seems to me, if you've got 400 gangs, then you're not being very effective.""If you look at the style of policing in the States, and their levels of violence, they are so fundamentally different from here," he added.The chief of West Midlands police, Chris Sims, also put out a statement on Sunday afternoon saying his force would not be "slavishly adopting empty slogans".In his series of tweets sent while on annual leave, Shewan also criticised the home secretary, Theresa May, who last week said she had "ordered" extra police out on the to the streets to deal with looters.May's remarks also angered senior officers as the home secretary is meant to remain operationally separate to police forces and cannot issue orders to officers."With respect I am unsure what the home secretary thinks that she told GMP to do different. She listened but said nothing. Tactics were ours!" said Shewan in a third tweet.Shewan, who is also the ACPO lead for restorative justice, was unavailable for comment on Monday.
