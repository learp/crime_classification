Just four hours later Billie-Jo was murdered.The 35-second video, which was found by police, was made with a borrowed video camera by her 10-year-old foster sister Lottie. It reveals Billie-Jo's ambition to be an actor.Billie-Jo had been living with the Jenkins family for four years. She was placed there by Newham social services after being abandoned by her parents, Bill and Debbie, by the age of seven and spending a year in a children's home.There were problems at first. Billie-Jo ripped the heads off her dolls and tore her new clothes. But over time she blossomed into a feisty, confident and kind teenager with an open character that meant she could not hide her feelings.The family's move from East Ham in London to a rambling Victorian house in the seaside town of Hastings marked the start of a new kind of life for Billie-Jo. There were camping trips in the country, long bike rides along the seafront, horse riding and piano lessons.Her grave is several miles from Hastings, in the City of London cemetery in east London, the area where Billie-Jo was born. Fresh flowers are laid regularly by her natural family.
