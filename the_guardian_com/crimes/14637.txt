The crown prosecution service will no longer provide the media with photos and CCTV footage of criminals or transcripts and tapes of police interviews with suspects and witnesses for use in news broadcasts, under guidelines which emerged yesterday. The type of material thought to be covered by the ban includes the police video of the Soham child killer Ian Huntley and his ex-partner Maxine Carr being interviewed by detectives about the disappearance of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. Other examples are the police video in which detectives repeatedly asked Roy Whiting if had seen the missing schoolgirl Sarah Payne - to which Whiting always answered: "No comment" - and police photos of the storage centre in Brighton where the killer Graham Coutts kept the body of his victim, the music teacher Jane Longhurst. The ban came to light after journalists were refused CCTV footage of the killer Michael Robinson boarding a train the night he murdered the sports student Sara Cameron, from Earsdon, North Tyneside. He was jailed for life at Newcastle crown court last week after admitting the murder and attempted rape of Ms Cameron, 23, after she left a late night Metro train from Newcastle in April 2000. A CPS spokesman said complaints had been received about certain cases, but he declined to say which, or to reveal who had made the complaints. "Requests for prosecution material will go through the relevant chief crown prosecutor for whichever case," he said. "On the whole, unless there are exceptional circumstances, such requests are likely to be declined. "We had received some complaints about prosecution material being handed over. "Our management has sought counsel's advice on this general issue and as a result there is now this guidance." The spokesman confirmed that media organisations had not been consulted. The policy had been approved by the director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, he added.
