The number of black officers in the Metropolitan Police is significantly lower than first thought, after police wrongly tried to claim that white Irish officers were an ethnic minority, it emerged today.The Home Office said that it was "deeply concerned" about a series of errors made by police in the collation of national statistics.The most notable error was the figure released on the supposed increases in ethnic minority officers working in England and Wales.Paul Wiles, director of research development of statistics at the Home Office, said that the Metropolitan Police had originally said that the number of ethnic officers working for the force had increased by 218 between March and September 2000.In fact, the increase was just four, Mr Wiles said. The mistake was made because officers classified as "white Irish" and "other white", such as people from Australia, were included in the total of ethnic minority officers.Mr Wiles said: "I am deeply concerned about these errors. This has been a cock-up."He said that a special task force was now been created, including Home Office statisticians, to ensure that the problem did not happen again.As a result of the blunder, the accurate figure for ethnic minority officers in September 30 2000 was 2,856, 3.6% higher than in March 2000 and not as previously published at 11.4% higher.Home secretary Jack Straw also expressed his concern about the misleading police figures.He said: "I am concerned whenever the figures generated by ourselves or by someone else on our behalf are inaccurate."However, there's no evidence that there was any attempt to mislead the public." Police also made errors when publishing figures on the total number of officers working for the service.The actual number of officers at the end of September was 124,614 and not 124,163 as originally published.Mr Wiles said that this meant that, instead of a national drop of seven officers between March and September 2000 there was an increase of 444 across England and Wales."Therefore, police numbers nationally are going up and not down," Mr Wiles said.The difference in the statistics was due to an error made by Metropolitan Police in collating figures as a number of force boundary changes were made.Related articles16 January: Violent crime on the rise16 January: Police recruitment figures up by 74%11 January: How the fad for phones is fuelling crime11 January: Straw pledges crackdown on street crime18 July: False crime statisticsUseful linksHome OfficeHome Office: crime reduction toolkits
