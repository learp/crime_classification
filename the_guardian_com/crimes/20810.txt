A judge today gave the singer Pete Doherty a final warning that he would be sent to jail if he did not make a real effort to battle his drug addiction.The Babyshambles frontman told West London magistrates court that he was trying to address the problem, even offering to show the position of an implant in his stomach intended to help him beat the habit.Doherty, 28, has admitted driving illegally while in possession of crack, heroin, ketamine and cannabis. He will be sentenced on September 4, following the preparation of pre-sentence reports.The judge, Davinder Lachlar, who last month issued an arrest warrant for Doherty shortly before he arrived for a hearing two-and-a-half hours late, told the singer today that a jail term was inevitable if he did not clean up his lifestyle."What I have in mind is to adjourn the matter for four weeks to assess his motivation," she said. "What I have in mind is a community order or prison. If he does not show his motivation, it's prison - as simple as that."At the last hearing, the judge told Doherty he had to undergo a detox programme or go to jail. He has now begun treatment."I see that he did not actually do the detox until the end of the month. It's early days, to put it mildly," the judge noted.The singer's lawyer, Sean Curran, told the court that Doherty was "certainly looking a lot better today" than at his last court appearance.Doherty, whose mother was with him in court today, was arrested on May 5 after his Jaguar was stopped by police in west London.After today's hearing ended, the singer was driven away from the court building standing upright through the sunroof of a black people carrier, gesturing with his fingers at the waiting photographers.
