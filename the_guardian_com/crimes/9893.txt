A millionaire couple accused of keeping two Indonesian women as slaves in their suburban New York home have been indicted on "slavery" charges.The women, prosecutors said, were beaten, had scalding water thrown on them, were forced to repeatedly climb stairs as punishment and slept on mats in the kitchen.They were also allegedly fed so little they had to steal food and, in one case, one of the women was forced to eat 25 hot chillies in a single sitting.The couple, Varsha Mahender Sabhnani, 35, and her husband, Mahender Murlidhar Sabhnani, 51, were arrested last week after one of their servants was found wandering outside a doughnut shop, wearing only trousers and a towel.The woman apparently fled when she took the rubbish out the night before.An indictment handed out last night formally charged the couple with two counts of forced labour and added two counts of harbouring illegal residents.The Sabhnanis, who are naturalised US citizens from India, have pleaded not guilty.A magistrate judge set bail at $3.5m (Â£1.76m) and imposed home detention with electronic monitoring.The assistant US attorney Demitri Jones called the allegations "truly a case of modern-day slavery". Charles Ross, a lawyer representing Varsha Sabhnani, said the couple travelled extensively and the two Indonesian women were free to leave whenever they wished.The women, identified in court papers as Samirah and Nona, legally arrived in the US in 2002. The Sabhnanis then confiscated their passports and refused to let them leave their home, authorities said.The women said they were promised payments of $200 and $100 a month, but federal prosecutors said they were never given money directly.They are now being cared for by a charity.
