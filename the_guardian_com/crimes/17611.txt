Troubled soul singer Amy Winehouse has been released on bail after being arrested last night in connection with an investigation into perverting the course of justice.A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: "A 24-year-old woman has been bailed to return to an east London police station on a date in early March pending further inquiries." Winehouse was arrested yesterday after attending an east London police station by appointment.A spokesman for Winehouse said she had not been charged. He said: "She was arrested but that is common practice for someone being interviewed by police."Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, 25, is currently remanded in custody in Pentonville prison, London, on charges of perverting the course of justice. Fielder-Civil was allegedly involved in a fight in a pub in London in June last year, which left barman James King in need of medical treatment. It is alleged that Fielder-Civil, and Michael Brown, 25, later conspired to pervert the course of justice by offering King money to withdraw his accusation and leave the country.Winehouse, the daughter of a north London taxi driver, has seen her burgeoning success matched by an increasingly tumultuous private life. In October she and her husband were held overnight by police in Norway for possession of drugs during a European tour.Winehouse cancelled her remaining UK tour dates following her husband's arrest.Her first album, Frank, was nominated for two Brits and the Mercury Music Prize. It was announced this month that she had been nominated for six Grammy awards for her follow-up album, Back to Black.
