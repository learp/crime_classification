Alan Johnson, the new home secretary, today announced a package of measures designed to revive the use of antisocial behaviour orders to tackle the most extreme cases of intimidation and harassment.In his first major speech on crime, Johnson admitted that a period of intense activity by the government on antisocial behaviour had been followed by "a certain degree of complacency on this issue".The package includes measures to cut delays of up to two years in getting the courts to issue an asbo, making it much easier for problems to be reported and to provide more counselling support for victims.The renewed official interest in asbos follows two years which saw their popularity dwindle. The number of new orders issued was down by 30% and the children's secretary, Ed Balls, said he hoped to live in "the kind of society that puts asbos behind us".Johnson said that it can sometimes take up to two years to secure an asbo, during which time there is no hope of respite for victims of crime, with many victims reporting further persistent harassment, defacement of property and intimidation.The home secretary said he was working with the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to take action in three areas:• Cutting delays by setting maximum waiting times and limiting the number of times cases can be adjourned. Speeding up the process in the worst cases of intimidation by training local authority staff so they can present cases themselves where possible.• Introducing local antisocial behaviour "action squads" to support frontline professionals dealing with severe problems such as underage drinking on an estate or a family that's causing widespread chaos.• Ensuring that victims don't get trapped in a "never-ending circle of phone calls" when they try to report problems by providing website access to local contacts and information. More counselling support for the victims of antisocial behaviour.Figures for asbo numbers have not been published since December 2006, when the number of new orders being issued had dropped by 34% on the year before and breach rates soared to 61% amongst teenagers.A Whitehall evaluation dealt asbos a massive blow when it revealed that they were widely seen as a "badge of honour" by teenagers and even some criminal justice professionals.While Johnson made clear his personal interest in a new drive to tackle antisocial behaviour he said in terms of his general approach to law and order the long term fall in the crime rate did not suggest that "a scattergun of new initiatives" or a new 'radical restructuring' of the criminal justice system would now be justified.This implies that the new home secretary is not particularly interested in adding to the long line of major criminal justice bills that have poured out of the Home Office in the past 15 years."The focus must be on listening to the public, looking at what practical steps need to be taken to make the current system, with all the powers and responsibilities that this government has introduced, respond to their concerns," said the home secretary.He said the encouraging national crime picture however offered little reassurance to those who live in neighbourhoods where threatening behaviour, harassment and intimidation were part of everyday life. "Worry about crime is seriously debilitating. If on some streets or estates, there are people who feel they can't step out after dark to buy a bottle of lemonade because they are fearful of the people they might find hanging around the stairwell or outside the off-licence, it has a profound impact on their life," he said arguing that tackling this fear of crime was as important as dealing with the reality of crime.He also careful to stress his personal interest in reviving the drive the tackle the causes of crime, quoting Tony Blair's famous promise to be 'tough on crime, and tough on the causes of crime'. In his speech at Battersea arts centre, south London, he cited the "startling fact" that while children in care make up only 0.5% of the child population, when they get older, they are 25% of the prison population.He signalled a renewed interest in expanding family intervention projects and alcohol treatment schemes arguing that "being tough on the causes of crime has been in many senses, the raison d'etre of this government over the last 12 years."He argued that the increased investment in the child welfare programme Sure Start, education, housing, health and youth services together with the measures on child poverty had undoubtedly helped to reduce crime and antisocial behaviour. Johnson said in a revival of Tony Blair's early law and rhetoric that protecting people from crime was fundamental to "the things that any progressive government wants to achieve".Points of order• Maximum waiting times and limits on case adjournments to cut delays in issuing asbos• Local action squads to tackle underage drinking and families from hell• Extra counselling support for victims and easier reporting• Expand family intervention projects to tackle causes of antisocial behaviour
