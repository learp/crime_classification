Nineteen foreign women thought to be victims of sex trafficking were found today in a series of raids on suspected brothels.Police believe the raids rescued the largest number of sex trafficking victims in a single operation in recent times.More than 50 officers raided seven addresses in London and the West Midlands at dawn and arrested 12 people, including the suspected "main organiser" of the alleged trafficking network.The women are all thought to have been trafficked from Malaysia. Thirteen of them were found in a suspected brothel in Paddington, London, and six in another address in Birmingham.The suspected ringleader and his female partner were arrested at a hotel in north London shortly after 7am; the pair are thought to be of Vietnamese origin. They were both cautioned and arrested on suspicion of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and conspiracy to control prostitution for gain.Police said the 19 women had been taken to specialist reception centres and immediately given access to a range of support services. The Salvation Army offered to provide them with accommodation.The raids were carried out as part of Operation Pentameter, a national campaign launched in February to help women trafficked into the country and forced into prostitution against their will.This morning's operation was led by the Metropolitan police's specialist clubs and vice unit and followed a five-month intelligence operation into the network's activities.Chief Superintendent Ian Dyson, the head of the unit, said the women would have been subjected to physical threats and intimidation."Some will have been brought in under false pretences, believing they were going to work in legitimate employment," he said. "Others will have come knowing they were going to be working as prostitutes, but all of them will have been exploited."Even those who believed they were coming to work as prostitutes, they will not have freedom of movement or economic freedom as often their passports are held and the money that they earn by the business does not go to them. They are as exploited as those who come here under false pretences."Mr Dyson called for anyone with information about trafficked women to contact the police and said men who used brothels were "fuelling this trade".Funded by the Home Office, Operation Pentameter brings together all 55 of Britain's police forces with the Immigration Service and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency.So far, around 380 brothels and massage parlours have been raided, leading to the seizure of at least £170,000 and arrest of more than 150 people for trafficking-related offences. Before today's raids, a total of 46 sex trafficking victims had been discovered. The alleged victims were mainly aged between 18 and 22, but two were 15 and 17.Officers have heard accounts of women being raped, threatened, stripped of passports and forced into brothels on arrival in the UK.Despite its apparent successes, Operation Pentameter has had its critics, with some alleging that police have also used their inquiries as an excuse to find and deport illegal immigrants.The Guardian  reported on Monday that it had learned that victims of trafficking were being allowed to remain in Britain only if they proved beneficial to the Crown Prosecution Service.Amnesty International has said that even those women who were brought to the country against their will are being deported if they refuse to assist with police investigations. Some of the deported women face branches of the same criminal networks that brought them into Britain when they return to their country of origin.Speaking about the women located in today's raids, Mr Dyson said some of the women would eventually return to Malaysia and that police were working with a charity in that country to help facilitate this. He said: "We hope that some of them will be sufficiently supported to feel comfortable enough to provide us with statements." The women rescued as part of Operation Pentameter originate largely from eastern Europe and the Balkans as well as Thailand, China and Brazil.It emerged this week that research into sex trafficking has revealed a new growing market in young women from South America that is changing the face of Britain's sex trade.Traffickers are being paid as much as £8,000 a victim and police across the country have discovered an increasing number of young women being held in suburban houses.
