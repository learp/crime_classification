The Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs, who cannot speak and is being fed through a tube in his stomach, lost an appeal yesterday against his jail sentence that he claims condemns him to die in prison.Biggs, 73, is serving the remaining 27 years of a 30-year sentence imposed in 1964, but interrupted after only 15 months when he escaped from HMP Wandsworth. He returned voluntarily to the UK in May 2001 after being partially paralysed by strokes. He has been in the hospital wing of Belmarsh jail in south-east London since. Mr Justice Jackson and Mr Justice Silber, presiding over his attempt to launch an appeal against his sentence, dismissed it as "hopeless" and "completely misconceived". His son, Michael Biggs, said his father would go to the European court of human rights to get the ruling overturned. Among the grounds put forward in his claim was the fact that he was dying, and that the CCRC's decision was in effect condemning him to die in jail.
