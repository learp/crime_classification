Eight people have been arrested by police investigating an arson attack that left eight members of the same family dead more than a decade ago.Five children and three adults died in the house fire in Birkby, Huddersfield, in 2002. One man was convicted of murder and two of manslaughter following the attack.West Yorkshire police said eight people had now been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. A spokesman said six men, aged 64, 35, 34, 28, 25 and 16, and two women, aged 55 and 32, were detained and had been bailed.He said: "This remains a live and ongoing enquiry. Anyone with information concerning the incident should contact the non-emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111."The arrests came after officers launched a fresh attempt earlier this year to find Shahid Mohammed, who has been wanted in relation to the fire since he skipped bail in 2003.Three generations of the same family died in the blaze on Osborne Road on 12 May 2002.Nafeesa Aziz, 35, died with her daughters – Tayyaba Bootall, three, Rabiah Bootall, 10, Ateeqa Nawaz, five, Aneesa Nawaz, two, and Najeebah Nawaz, six months.Aziz's brother, Mohammed Ateeq-ur-Rehman, 18, also died in the fire, while their mother, Zaib-un-Nisa, 54, died a week later in hospital.In July 2003, three men from Huddersfield – Shaied Iqbal, Shakiel Shazad Amir and Nazar Hussain – were convicted for their part in the crime.
