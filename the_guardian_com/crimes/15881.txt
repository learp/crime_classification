Haslingden is like any other small mill town in Lancashire. At 7pm on a week night rain streamed down cobbled streets and six 13-year-old girls with their wet fringes plastered to their foreheads stood opposite the 24-hour garage talking about hairstyles. Raindrops poured off their noses on to tracksuit tops zipped up over their chins. They pulled down the zips to suck on a cigarette. They probably didn't notice the words "shitty" and "mortar" carved into the sides of gritstone houses overlooking the valley. They were bored.Haslingden is a beautiful town, but there's nothing to do there if you're 12. The town is half a mile wide and three miles long. It is mostly white working class, with middle-class pockets and an Asian population of 5%. The nearest McDonald's, which opened three years ago, is a 10-minute bus ride, but the bus service isn't great and buses are expensive. The nearest cinema is eight miles up the motorway. You can't get a bus there and back at night, and even if you could, you couldn't afford it. So teenagers go out into the street at night and talk. They start aged 11 and keep doing it until 18, mostly congregating in groups of 20 or 30 in the market place, the park, the cemetery, the patch behind the swimming baths, the car park behind the garage or outside the chip shop. Some smoke, some drink beer. A few sniff solvents, some smoke joints - but for this they disappear into smaller groups. Boys and girls congregate together although the girls sometimes break off in clusters to talk about the boys, and the boys sometimes break off to talk about DVDs. They send text messages. They usually bring some form of wheels: rollerblades, bikes. This year, it's scooters, although the cobbles aren't good for it. Skateboarders hope they get a lift to Accrington where there's a specially designed skate park. The routine is have tea with your parents, leave the house at 6pm, and hang out until 9pm or sometimes later. Anne Bullock, a senior youth worker at the Haslingden youth club, has worked with local teenagers for 15 years, mainly out on in the street at night. She said there was no profile of a single type of teenager outside. Some were wealthy, others weren't, but few carried much cash with them. Some as young as 11 were heavy drinkers, but often their parents would stop by to ask if they were having a good time, before going off to their own entertainment. Other parents knew their children were out and imposed their own curfews, usually 9 or 10pm. Last Saturday, Kerry, 14, left her house at 6:30pm to stand on a pavement for three hours in the biting cold with three friends. They chatted. Her friend made a list of the good and bad points of boys she liked. They put them in rank order. They got bored and went home. When the girls go out at night, up winding streets, past the antique clock shop and bakery with fairy lights in the window, they find a spot to stand in and just gossip "because there's nowhere else, except outside in the street". Kerry wants to be an air hostess. Her favourite subject is maths. Her friend, Zoe, 15, has just finished three English courseworks. She wants to be a hairdresser or a vet. They like pop, garage and Eminem. "We hang out, we doss around and we chat. We have fun. It's a laugh, except it's freezing outside," she said. When it rains, they still go out - "otherwise we'd get bored" - but they stand in covered alleyways, which they don't tell anyone about in case they steal their spot. They don't go to the park with the others because it's dark and it spooks them. But they have chatted in the cemetery. They would never walk around alone at night, so Kerry brings her 13-year-old brother if she's worried. They usually go home at 9:30pm. Some of their friends stay out til 11 or 12. Kerry works part-time in a hairdresser's. "That's good because it keeps me off the streets," she said. Zoe can't find a job. "I did go to the sandwich shop to ask, but it was shut," she said. Kerry, like most Haslingden residents between 11 and 17 lives for Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights, when the youth club, H20, is open from 7:15pm to 9:30pm in a converted pub with designer decor, new snooker table and internet link up. They go there at 5:30pm and "hang out" outside until it opens. "The only good thing about this town is the youth club," said Zoe. "We can hang out with the Asian boys, which we can't do anywhere else because it's against their religion. Apart from the club, there is nothing here. And it's not open on Saturday. We like to go out. We don't want to die of boredom." Any mass of teenagers on the streets is seen as a nuisance to residents. There was recently an exchange of letters in the local newspaper, the Rossendale Free Press, following reports that a handful of teenagers in one part of Haslingden had been running riot on an estate full of pensioners. Some believed that teenagers had set fire to cars. Letters poured in. Steve Roman, district manager of the Lancashire Youth and Community Service, responded by assuring the paper that the majority of young teens who just chat outside at night would respond well to any calls to keep the noise down and move on. His letter was published under the heading, "Respect the yobbos". "Being young is not a crime," said Mr Roman. "Most teenagers resent being stereotyped as hooligans, especially when they are keen for any activities the council can provide." This week, the Queen's speech included plans to impose after-dark curfews on teenagers up to 16. Powers to ban under 10s from public places between 9pm and 6am came into force under the Crime and Disorder Act in 1998, but have never been used in England. In Scotland, the age limit is already 16 and police have powers to question any teenager found on the streets after dark. If no good explanation is given, the teenager is taken home. If there is no one at home, they are kept at the police station until their parents return. The curfew scheme tested in Hamilton, in Lanarkshire, is currently being evaluated, but councillors claim youth crime is down. Generation gap There is debate as to the precise form and time limit of the curfews that will appear in the crime bill early next year. A Home Office spokesman said curfews will relate to areas, not individuals. Police can apply for a curfew order then remove all under 16s from a specific area, regardless of whether they are persistent offenders. This could be after 9pm, or it could be dusk until dawn. Defending the idea, Jack Straw, home secretary, asked: "Why are there youngsters out on the streets at 10pm or 11pm? Where are their parents?" In Haslingden, some teenagers' parents let them meet their friends outside until that time, then drive round and pick them up. Inspector Ewan Cameron, of Lancashire police, says crime does happen amongst young teens on the streets in Haslingden. He prefers to call it "juvenile nuisance", which includes kicking footballs against shop windows, graffiti, skateboarding where they shouldn't, abuse to people who tell them off, bad language in the street. Sometimes the elderly are scared of large groups of teenagers and won't leave the house if they are outside. They are prisoners to the generation gap. But Insp Cameron does not believe in punishing teenagers for being bored: "We can move teenagers on if they cause a nuisance. But I am more interested in working with the council to get facilities in the area to stop boredom. A curfew is short term. The police are good at short term, we just move the problem on, but we don't solve it. We have to think of the future. Quick-solve measures like curfews may just be like sticky plasters." He is currently working on the idea of an under-12s disco. To the Haslingden police, the idea of dusk-dawn curfews seem restrictive. "Measures have to be proportionate to the problem. I would have to be sure we are not interfering with human rights by imposing a curfew. We would have to have good reasons or evidence to send someone home. Curfews might be policeable if they related to small, specific areas. But as a whole borough, it would be inappropriate." The Haslingden teenagers turn ashen at the thought of staying in from dusk at 4:30pm in the winter. "They can stick that idea up their backsides," said one. "I couldn't live like that. I couldn't be stuck inside with my little sister all night. It would be like being locked up." One 16-year-old, who tells stories of smoking joints in the cemetery, said: "When we saw the police, we ran off. Sometimes they moved us on, then we waited five minutes and went back. We have to have a place to hang out. We can't just be stopped from walking down the road. We live round there." Another boy, aged 15, said: "We have needs." Asked what they were, he said: "Astroturf and the internet. I just want somewhere to kick a ball." "I would build a huge building like the youth club and have a weight training room and the internet, then I wouldn't need to stand outside," said Zoe. Further north, in smaller villages in the Ribble Valley, like Gregson Lane, the nearest youth club is eight miles away, with no bus service. Paul Smith, of the local tenants' group, deals with residents' complaints about teenagers being out in the street. "I don't see how curfews can be enforced. A lot of the teenage graffiti around here is actually directed at the police. But I would much rather the effort was put into organising facilities for these teenagers. It's not their fault they are bored. But sometimes trying to organise facilities is so complicated it's like banging your head against a brick wall." Â• The names of teenagers have been changed
