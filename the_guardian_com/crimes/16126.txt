A murder hunt involving 60 police officers was launched yesterday after a man and woman were found dead, following an apparently motiveless attack.The couple were discovered by a "local resident", who called police to a house on the Berryfield Park estate, in the Wiltshire market town of Melksham, shortly after 1.30am yesterday. Although post-mortem examinations were continuing last night, it is thought that the pair, both believed to be in their 60s, were stabbed to death. Police have yet to find the murder weapon. Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Howlett, the head of Wiltshire CID, refused to say whether burglary was being considered as a motive. "Quite clearly burglary would be an obvious thing to look for, for signs of forced entry. That search is being undertaken painstakingly," he said. He called on the people of Melksham, which has not suffered a murder in seven years, to come forward with any information, saying: "To be successful in this investigation we really do need the help of local people here in Melksham. It's a particularly tight little estate. I am absolutely certain that a resident would have seen movement in and around that address." However, he urged the town not to panic, saying: "I have no reason to believe that there is necessarily a serial killer or anything as dramatic as that on the loose."
