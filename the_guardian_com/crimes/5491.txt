The shooting by police of a 53-year-old man in a Cornish village early yesterday is under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Police were called to a "domestic incident" at a detached house in Lewannick, four miles from Launceston, late on Monday. Four and a half hours later, the man was dead. It was the third time in 10 years Devon and Cornwall police have shot a man dead in an operation. The force referred the incident to the IPCC, whose senior investigator John Cummins arrived in the village yesterday. It was difficult to give a timescale for the investigation, he said. This was the first fatal police shooting to be investigated by the new IPCC, which replaced the Police Complaints Authority on April 1, Mr Cummins said. Dozens of police were called to the house following a report of threats of violence. Police negotiators were at the scene of the incident. "Emergency treatment was administered at the scene, but the man later died in Derriford hospital, Plymouth," said a spokesman. Villagers said the dead man moved to Cornwall from Kent about 18 months ago. It is understood he worked in Launceston and had an extended family in the village.
