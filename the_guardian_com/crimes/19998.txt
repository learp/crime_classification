Vague descriptions in criminal profiles which are frequently used by detectives to trace suspects often trick officers in exactly the same way that bogus fortune-tellers and astrologers deceive their clients, psychologists revealed yesterday.Most big criminal investigations now involve psychologists who, like the television character Cracker, draw up a profile of the offender. But research presented yesterday suggested many profiles were so vague that they could apply to any number of suspects. Perhaps more worryingly, in experiments police officers seemed to mould whatever information was supplied in a profile to fit in with what was definitely known about an offender. The researchers called for more guidance to be given to police on how they should use such profiles. The starting point for the research, revealed at the conference of investigative psychology at Liverpool University, was the long-accepted theory that people tend to accept vague and ambiguous personality descriptions as uniquely applicable to themselves, not realising the description could be applied to almost anyone. Astrologers and fortune-tellers are often accused of using this tendency to make their predictions believed. Psychologists know the trait as the "Barnum effect" after PT Barnum's claim that his circus had "a little something for everyone". Experts from Liverpool and Liverpool Hope universities wanted to find out if the Barnum effect could be applied to police officers using criminal profiles.
