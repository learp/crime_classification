There's an interesting judgment due in the High Court on the vexed issue of rare birds' eggs which has regularly brought old-fashioned 'cabinet of curios' attitudes into conflict with modern conservation.A collector of long-ago preserved eggs is almost certain to have his conviction quashed for owning trophies collected between the passing of the Protection of Birds Act in 1954 and 1981. They suddenly turned into illegal possessions under an amendment made in 2004 to the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act.This introduced a retrospective ban on eggs collected legally between the 1954 and 1981 acts, including a time which even this writer recalls when 'bird-nesting', or searching for the homes of common species, was part of both boyhood and learning about the natural world. Few if any would accept the practice now, any more than catching and killing butterflies and moths in the world of superb and easy-to-use digital photography; but it was part of the grounding of many famous past naturalists whose work has done more good than harm to the animal kingdom.Historic egg-collecting also had a particular northern slant, notably at Bempton cliffs between Filey and Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast, where the exploits of the 'climmer' egg collectors made David Attenborough's recent excitement at similar Arctic goings-on seem a bit exaggerated and out-of-date. You can read more about them here, including their help in salvaging a German U-boat generator from a wreck beneath the cliffs and using it to power a small factory and a row of local terrace houses.

After his home in South Shields was raided in 2006, the father-of-six lost his job as an asbestos removal supervisor and says that he suffered 'years of upset.'My expert legal colleague Owen Bowcott describes the case in detail here, from the use of a battering ram to break into the Dodsworths' home, to Dodsworth's previous wildlife convictions. The final act is now expected imminently, with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs accepting that the 2004 amendment is unlawful and offering no case against papers lodged by Dodsworth's solicitor Nigel Barnes.But the battle over wild birds' eggs and those who continue to defy the (legal) law goes onBarnes says of this case: The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds continued to investigate people and had a willingness to enforce a law that had the hallmarks of being unintended.But the RSPB counters: It is a difficult situation but we have to recognise that egg collecting poses a serious threat. I don't not think we can be viewed as too eager to prosecute when some birds are close to extinction.So the argument continues. Meanwhile Dodsworth has been given 400 of his eggs back and is now asking police to return the rest.
