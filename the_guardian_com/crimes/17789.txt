Criminals are evading the police by picking up tips from television crime programmes such as CSI, The Bill and Waking the Dead.Car thieves in Manchester have been leaving cigarette butts picked up from the street in order to throw police off their trails by making it difficult for forensic scientists to work out who was in the car.Others have started wearing plastic gloves during burglaries, and some rapists are using condoms to avoid leaving any DNA evidence.This has led to some forensic scientists becoming reluctant to cooperate with the media because they fear giving away tips for criminals to use to avoid capture, New Scientist reports.But criminals trying to outwit forensic science is scarcely new. In 1988, the world's first ase involving DNA almost failed because the murderer persuaded a friend to submit a sample on his behalf. Only when the stand-in bragged about the cover-up was a DNA match made.
