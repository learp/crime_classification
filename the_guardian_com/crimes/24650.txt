The man accused of murdering schoolgirl April Jones told police that he "could have burned the body", a court has heard. .Mark Bridger, 47, also said he would have been "lynched" if he had been seen taking the five-year-old out of his car, Mold crown court heard.The jury in Bridger's trial were hearing transcripts of his police interviews for a third day, read to the court by Paul Hobson, prosecuting, and the interviewing officer, DC Louise Thomas.Hobson also read a statement from detention officer Stephen Carr, who said Bridger spoke to him about how he was trying to remember what he had done with April's body.A former abattoir worker, Bridger says he accidentally killed the child when he ran her over and accepts that he must have got rid of her body but says he cannot remember how he did it, because he was drunk and panicking.Carr said that Bridger, who was once a firefighter with the London Fire Brigade, told him how he would have "laid her to rest" for the body to be found, and that he might have covered it with a tarpaulin.Carr said: "Then he went on to say that he could have burned the body but, from his firefighter training, he informed me that burning flesh smells like pork. He said the flesh would smell and his clothing would smell and that he would remember having set a fire."The jury heard that Bridger had told an interviewing police officer he could not remember how he had disposed of April's body but that he did not think he would have taken her out of the car, as someone would have seen him.Bridger told police: "They would have lynched me. They would have got hold of me."But he told the police that, if he had been seen, it would have "proved then what I want to prove to you â€“ that I crushed her and I gave her as much medical attention as I could".April, who had cerebral palsy, vanished while playing on her bike with her best friend near their homes on Machynlleth's Bryn-Y-Gog estate on 1 October last year.Bridger, from Ceinws, denies abducting and murdering the schoolgirl in a "sexually motivated" attack.April's body has never been found, despite the biggest search operation in British policing history.The trial continues.
