A 13-year-old boy and a 19-year-old man were arrested yesterday after a double stabbing in east London left one teenager dead and another fighting for his life. Detectives believe a large group of youths was involved in the attack in the foyer of a block of flats in Leytonstone, east London. The attack comes at the end of a week in which the Home Office announced tougher penalties for knife crime.The two victims are thought to have staggered a short distance from where the attack took place, before a passer-by called police just before 8pm on Friday. Paul Erhahon, 14, died in hospital shortly afterwards. His 15-year-old friend, who has not been named, remains in a critical condition.Erhahon went to Kingsford Community School, as did a previous stabbing victim, Adam Regis, 15, nephew of athlete John Regis. Adam Regis was killed last month with a single wound to the heart as he returned from a cinema in east London.Knife crime forms seven per cent of violent crime in England and Wales. Last week, it become an offence to use someone to carry or hide a weapon on another person's behalf, while the maximum sentence for possession of a knife has been doubled to four years.
