Police demanded a news blackout about Raoul Moat's personal life due to fears such coverage would provoke him to kill more people, it emerged today.Northumbria police warned reporters on Thursday that Moat had threatened to kill a member of the public for every piece of inaccurate information published about him.The warning came as the force said Moat's threats, which were previously aimed at the police, had widened and the public might now be in danger. Journalists were thought to be among the potential targets.Moat was eventually cornered by police late last night and fatally shot himself just after 1am today following a six-hour standoff with armed officers.His threats to the public had been made in a four-hour message on a voice recorder, which police found in a tent on secluded land at Wagtail Farm, near Rothbury.In the message Moat said he was not going to be like the Cumbrian gunman Derrick Bird and shoot "old ladies".Concerned that reports could anger Moat and trigger further violence, police requested a news blackout relating to his private life.During a press briefing, officers said they had taken advice from psychologists who believed Moat's "rules have changed" and any reporting of his private life could endanger the public.The written request from the temporary chief constable, Sue Sim, for a voluntary news blackout said: "Any publicity regarding Mr Moat's private life, including information from family, friends and associates, could increase that threat."We have no alternative but to request that a news blackout be implemented under the voluntary agreement between the Association of Chief Police Officers and the media."Police also asked for stories already published about Moat's personal life to be removed from news websites.Comments made by Moat's mother, Josephine Healey, who had had little contact with Moat over the past 18 years, that her son "would be better off dead" are thought to have been among the remarks which upset him.Northumbria police were yesterday forced to apologise after an officer read out a card from two children which described Moat as "a nutter".Neighbourhood inspector Sue Peart read the card during a police briefing shown live on television. She had tried to use the message to demonstrate to her fellow officers that the public appreciated their efforts to catch Moat.Police requested a news blackout earlier in the investigation to prevent the press reporting that Moat had boasted in a letter that he had taken hostages.That blackout was lifted on Tuesday morning after the two men thought to be Moat's hostages were found safe.Karl Ness, 26, from Dudley in North Tyneside, and Qhuram Awan, 23, from Blyth in Northumberland, were later charged with conspiracy to commit murder and possessing a firearm with intent. They were remanded in custody at a court hearing on Thursday.
