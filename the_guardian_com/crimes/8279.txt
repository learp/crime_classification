An NHS worker who played an integral role in a fraud that diverted more than half a million pounds from a leading cancer hospital has been jailed for four years.Stacey Tipler exploited her job in the accounts department at the Royal Marsden NHS trust to alter payment details in a scam that resulted in £642,000 meant for cancer drugs being diverted from the London clinic and spent in part on shopping sprees and mortgage payments.For several months after December 2011, Tipler, 32, substituted account numbers of pharmaceutical firms who were due payment with the details of men recruited by her partner and the ringleader of the plot, Scott Chaplin. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years.Passing sentence at Southwark crown court on Tuesday, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said Chaplin was the "main instigator" but Tipler was invaluable to the scam, which he said could have been catastrophic for the hospital's patients.He told her: "It could only have been you who could have come up with the sophisticated and ingenious methods to ensure that your fraud went undetected."I am satisfied that it was not you who had the idea to defraud the hospital. It is my judgment that on your own this fraud would not have been committed."That said, once the idea was there … the position of trust you held made you invaluable in achieving the fraud."The skill which you showed in trying to ensure the fraud would go undiscovered was very great and very dishonest. It was a very clever but dishonest fraud."The money was funnelled to the group of associates and mostly withdrawn as cash in a money-laundering operation before the lion's share was passed back to Chaplin.The couple maintained a "cash reserve" to meet their bills and mortgage payments.They are also understood to have spent several thousand pounds on a deposit for a venue in Surrey for their proposed wedding, although the nuptials did not take place.Those receiving the siphoned-off money retained some for themselves, using it to make mortgage payments or go on shopping sprees at luxury designers Gucci and Louis Vuitton. One spent £200 at the London Parachute School.At one point a drugs firm threatened to stop supplying the hospital with medication after failing to receive payment because of the scam, the court heard.Some money was recovered but the hospital remains £310,000 out of pocket.The Royal Marsden is a prominent hospital for cancer care, with past patients including the reality TV star Jade Goody and the actress Susannah York.Tipler, a mother of two from Carshalton, Surrey, who worked at the trust for 10 years, was found guilty after a trial of conspiracy to defraud.Chaplin, 33, also from Carshalton, was convicted of the same charge and a count of conspiracy to money-launder.
