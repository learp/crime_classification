A series of violent robberies carried out by a career mugger who targeted rich women was "in a league of its own", a judge said today.Daniel Mykoo, 29, often aided by his brother Matthew, 27, targeted women, including the fashion designer Nicole Farhi, in wealthy London suburbs such as Hampstead and Chelsea.Daniel Mykoo admitted carrying out 84 robberies, stealing more than £1m in luxury jewellery and cash, according to police.One of the pair would strangle their victims – who included a judge's wife, a BBC news reporter and a 84-year-old woman – while the other stripped them of their valuables, Wood Green crown court heard.The brothers, described by police as "two highly dangerous career criminals", carried out a series of attacks starting in 1999.Matthew, from Brent, north London, was convicted of seven robberies, having previously admitted two attacks. He was cleared of eight attacks, including the attack on Farhi.Daniel, of Fulham, pleaded guilty to 19 robberies prior to his brother's trial earlier this year but asked for a further 65 robberies to be taken into consideration when he is sentenced tomorrow.Judge Nicholas Browne QC said Daniel faced a life sentence or indefinite term for public protection. As he heard mitigation, the Judge said: "Look at the whole pattern of strangulation robberies by this defendant. It's in a league of its own, isn't it?"The pair, thought to be two of the most persistent robbers in the London area, used stolen cars to track their victims for hours before attacking them, police said.They teamed up for eight muggings, robbing 19 lone women and one 60-year-old man in a prolific spell between March and June last year and using the money to fund their £12,000-a-month crack habit, the court heard.Farhi was attacked outside her Hampstead home in April last year. Gripping her throat and covering her eyes, Mykoo stole her Rolex watch and a diamond ring worth £8,000 as well as a substantial amount of cash.Describing the attack, she told the court she believed she was going to die. "One hand came on to my eyes and the other on to my throat. He squeezed and I fainted. I fell on top of him, and I remember my last thought before I fell was, 'How stupid to die in front of my house.'"The BBC news reporter Sangita Myska was attacked by Daniel Mykoo outside her home in Belsize Park, north London. When one of her rings would not come off, one of the attackers had said, "Take the finger off then," she told the court.In an impact statement, she said: "To this day, I can't stand men walking behind me and have to duck into doorways and round corners just to get away."Fiona Lindblom, a judge's wife who was attacked on her doorstep in west London described being "violently sick" for three days after she was attacked.John Carmichael, prosecuting, said: "It was discovered that they had been prolific muggers and robbers throughout London. They – and Daniel in particular – appear to be some of the most persistent robbers in the London area, certainly in recent memory.""[The robberies] were carried out in a cynical and violent fashion. There was a degree of violence which had left physical injuries and, perhaps more significantly, trauma and psychological injuries."Matthew Mykoo has three previous convictions for robbery, and has previously served seven and a half years in prison for holding a shopkeeper at knifepoint.Daniel Mykoo has two previous convictions for robbery as well as convictions for burglary, drugs, motoring offences and violence.Sarah Vine, speaking for Matthew Mykoo, who will be sentenced for nine robberies, said: "There is considerable distance between Matthew Mykoo and his brother. He accepts that his behaviour in committing these offences was inexcusably appalling and that it must have had the most horrific consequences for his victims and their peace of mind."
