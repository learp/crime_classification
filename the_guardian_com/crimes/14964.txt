The convicted rapist and child murderer Peter Tobin drugged and murdered an 18-year-old school-leaver before burying her in his back garden next to the body of another teenager he had killed, it was alleged at Chelmsford crown court today.Tobin, 63, murdered Dinah McNicol after picking her up as she was hitch-hiking home from a music festival in August 1991, the court was told. Her body was found 16 years later, buried in the garden of 50 Irvine Drive, in Margate, Kent, where Tobin was living at the time of McNicol's disappearance.  Peter Tobin pleaded not guilty to murdering 18-year-old Dinah McNicol.

Tobin has already been convicted of Hamilton's murder and is serving a life sentence.He denies killing McNicol. A trial on the same charge in June this year was halted after Tobin became ill.The jury of three women and nine men would hear evidence that traces of amitriptyline, a sedative drug, which Tobin was being prescribed at the time of the murder, had been found in her body, William Clegg QC, prosecuting, said. Vicky Hamilton had also been drugged with amitriptyline.Clegg said the earlier conviction was relevant "as it demonstrates a propensity to abduct young girls, administer the drug amitryptiline to them, murder them and bury their bodies in rubbish sacks. There cannot be many people in this world who share those propensities".Tobin was also convicted in 1994 of rape and buggery of a 14-year-old girl and indecent assault on another, after he had drugged both of them with the sedative.McNicol's body was too badly decomposed to show evidence of rape, the court heard but, said Clegg, "there was clearly a sexual motive behind the abduction and murder of Dinah".Tobin's fingerprints had also been found on three of the bags in which McNicol's body had been wrapped, Clegg said, adding that the jury would hear from David Martin, Tobin's neighbour at the time, who had seen him digging the hole into which McNicol's body was placed. "Having seen how deep the hole was Mr Martin joked to the defendant that he was digging to Australia," said Clegg.Tobin, dressed in a black shirt and dark trousers, sat behind a screen, a few feet from McNicol's elderly father Ian, and other family members.McNicol, a bright school leaver who loved to travel, was last seen on 5 August 1991, when she left the music festival in Liphook, Hampshire, to hitchhike to her home near Chelmsford with David Tremlett, a man she had met at the festival. They accepted a lift from a man who dropped Tremlett off first at Junction 8 of the M25, Clegg said, leaving McNicol alone in the front seat with the driver."We will seek to prove that that driver was in fact this defendant and that he not only abducted Dinah but murdered her."Clegg said that in August 1991 Tobin had an arrangement with his then estranged wife Cathy Wilson that he would travel to Portsmouth, where she lived, on a Friday to collect their young son Daniel, and return on Monday to drop him off after spending the weekend with him in Margate. His return journey would have brought him past the spot where Tremlett and McNicol were picked up, he said.The jury were told that on turning 19 in June 1991, Dinah had been awarded Â£2,700 as compensation for the death of her mother in a car accident, and that as someone who was "frugal with money", she was keeping the money for her future education.In the days following her disappearance large sums of money were withdrawn from ATMs on the south coast. The first withdrawal was in Margate, Clegg said, "just a short distance from where this defendant then lived". Other withdrawals were from banks in nearby Ramsgate, in Brighton, where Tobin had previously lived on and off over a period of 20 years, and in Portsmouth."The only three towns in England known to have been associated to this defendant at the time were the towns where her bank card was used to steal money from her account after her abduction."The case continues.
