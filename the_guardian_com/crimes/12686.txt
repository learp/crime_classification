With conviction rates for rape at an all-time low of only 5% of reported cases, it is extremely disappointing to read that judges are hostile to current proposed reforms (Judges try to block rape trial reforms, January 23).These modest changes, however, are unlikely to make much difference to the crisis of impunity we face in the UK.Cultural attitudes and prejudices need challenging if, as an Amnesty International opinion poll showed in 2005, a third of the public blame a woman herself for being raped if she has been "flirtatious".We also know from research that the police and other justice system personnel overestimate false reporting of rape.How can judges claim they are "objective" when your report informs us that they believe some women subject themselves to an investigation, forensic examination and a rape trial because they are "particularly good at faking distress"?Prof Liz KellyEnd Violence Against WomenThe Council of Circuit Judges claims that using expert evidence in some cases to challenge rape myths is "unnecessary and inappropriate". So, when a defence lawyer tries to argue in a rape trial that such things as a complainant delaying reporting to the police, or lack of emotion, are reactions inconsistent with a genuine allegation of rape, can these judges please explain what the prosecution is supposed to do to counteract the use of such myths by the defence?One might have thought judges would want justice in their courts, not a process influenced by factually inaccurate societal myths.
