Prison reformers are calling for more community-based sentences after new Home Office figures showed one in three women in prison was there for shoplifting.The statistics have prompted pleas from Smart Justice for more lenient sentencing for women who do not pose any public danger. Lucie Russell, Smart Justice director, said: "It is appalling that so many women who pose no danger to the public are being locked up." The figures show that 80% of women in prison for shoplifting will reoffend within two years of their release. Ms Russell wants backing for schemes such as one in Milton Keynes, where the Retail Theft Initiative makes offenders face up to the their actions within the community, rather than in prison. Reconviction rates have dropped to just 3%. "Simply throwing these women in jail isn't preventing crime in the long run," she said. The Statistics on Women and the Criminal Justice System show that the women prison population rose by 173% between 1992 and 2002. In 2002, when 8,800 women were jailed, 2,740 of them had been convicted of shoplifting.
