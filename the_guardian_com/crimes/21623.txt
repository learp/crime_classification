A problem family who abused a mother and her disabled daughter who were later found dead in a burning car remain a persistent nuisance on the street where they lived, an inquest heard today.Fiona Pilkington, 38, was in such despair at seeing her children being abused by the family that she set light to her car in a layby near her home in Barwell, Leicestershire, on 23 October 2007, while she and her 18-year-old daughter, Francecca Hardwick, known as Frankie, sat inside, the inquest heard.An inquest at Loughborough town hall heard that Pilkington, her daughter and her son Anthony, now 19, had suffered years of abuse at the hands of a gang of youths. The 16-strong gang would often pelt their house with flour, eggs and stones, and Anthony was attacked with an iron bar and locked in a shed at knifepoint.Letters and meetings with parents ended problems with four families, but one family remained a menace and were still living on the Pilkingtons' street, Bardon Road, despite court efforts to evict them, the inquest heard.Roy Grantham, the council's community safety manager, said: "Throughout this tragic case this family still continue to cause trouble to this day." The family was not named at the hearing.The persecution had been going on for almost 10 years, but council workers in charge of tackling antisocial behaviour in the town did not record the case until almost seven years after it was first reported to police, the inquest heard.Even after Hinckley and Boswell borough council learned of the situation, nine months before her death, it did not realise Pilkington had two children with learning difficulties, something described as a primary motivation for the harassment.Grantham told the inquest that the situation would have been dealt with more urgently had his team known they were dealing with a possible hate crime. "We would have treated this as a higher priority," he said.The bodies of Pilkington and her daughter were found in her Austin Maestro in a layby in November 2007. The inquest has been told that the family had been, in the words of the coroner, Olivia Davison, "under siege" in their semi-detached home from youths as young as 10. They taunted Francecca and Anthony, who is severely dyslexic, as well as Pilkington, a single mother, and attacked the house with stones, flour and eggs. Police were contacted 33 times in seven years, the inquest heard.Under questioning from the coroner, Grantham said the council had tried to learn from the case. "I still think we need to improve information sharing," he said. "I think this case has really knocked public confidence in the council."The inquest continues.
