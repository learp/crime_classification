A former soap opera star who admitted driving the getaway car in a gangland shooting has been cleared of murder, it can now be reported. Brian Regan, 53, who played Terry Sullivan in Channel 4's Brookside, was found not guilty at Liverpool crown court of the killing of nightclub doorman Bahman Faraji, 44.Regan was convicted of perverting the course of justice by lying to police in the early stages of the murder investigation and disposing of a pair of gloves he had worn on the night of the killing.Regan, who was on bail for supplying cocaine when the murder took place in February 2011, was jailed on 25 January for four years 10 months. The facts of the case can be revealed after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies lifted reporting restrictions put in place to avoid prejudicing the trial of another defendant, Jason Gabbana.Gabbana, 29, was found guilty of murder by an 11-1 majority at Liverpool crown court yesterday for ordering the killing of Faraji.The victim, accused by Gabbana's defence of drug dealing and running an illegal protection racket, was gunned down at close range after he was lured to the Belgrave pub in Aigburth, Liverpool.Regan admitted driving gunman Edward Heffey to and from the scene of the hit but told the jury he did not know his passenger was carrying a sawn-off shotgun and planning to kill Faraji.Regan was hooked on cocaine and began dealing the drug to fund his habit following the demise of his showbiz career, the court was told. He had denied murder along with Heffey, 40, Lee Dodson, 42, and Simon Smart, 32. Following a three-month trial, verdicts were returned on 24 January.Brookside, set in Liverpool, began on the launch night of Channel 4, on 2 November 1982, and ran for 21 years until November 2003. Regan joined Brookside in episode six and his character was at the centre of some of the close's most dramatic storylines until his final appearance in 1997.He said he was appearing in Brookside when he began taking cocaine but never used the drug while he was working. Leaving the programme had a "dramatic" effect on his life and income, he said.Smart, who lured Faraji to the pub, and Heffey were convicted of murder by 11-1 majorities. Dodson, who was Regan's best friend and cocaine supplier, was found not guilty of arranging for Regan to drive the getaway car.After he admitted driving the gunman, the court ordered security to be stepped up around Regan and security guards sat between him and the rest of the defendants. He was designated a "vulnerable prisoner" and held in an isolation wing in jail.
