The fourth damning prison inspection report in three weeks, published today, shows that the overcrowding crisis is not only having a damaging effect on life inside inner-city prisons. The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, says an unannounced inspection of Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight last October showed it was less safe and doing less rehabilitation work than it had been two years previously, because of severe staff shortages and rising inmate numbers. Owers reveals that many black and minority ethnic prisoners believe Parkhurst is "institutionally racist", having at the time of inspection no race relations liaison officer, a race relations management team that had not met for 11 months, and no information on racial incidents in the previous six months. Although Parkhurst is supposed to be a training prison for inmates serving long sentences, inspectors found that more than half were locked up during the day. There had been a series of disturbances and crisis management had taken precedence over constructive work, the report says. However, a newly-appointed governor, Steve Metcalf, is said to be making progress. Â· The Parkhurst report is at: www.homeoffice.gov.uk/justice/prisons/inspprisons
