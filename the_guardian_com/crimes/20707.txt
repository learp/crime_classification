Two men were today found guilty of the savage murder of two French students who were tied up inside their London flat, tortured and left with 244 stab wounds.Prosecutors described the attacks in June last year by Dano Sonnex, 23, from Peckham, and Nigel Farmer, 34, of no fixed address, as "an orgy of bloodletting". The bodies of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, were only found after an explosion at the flat in New Cross, south-east London, which had been set on fire.It can now be disclosed that at the time of the murders, Sonnex was out on parole under probation supervision after serving an eight-year sentence for violence and robbery.The justice secretary, Jack Straw, has already apologised in person to the families of the two French students and accepted the resignation of London's chief probation officer, David Scott, in February over the "grave failings" in the handling of the case. Official internal probation and police inquiry reports published alongside the verdicts today identify a series of "grave errors" and "serious management failings" by probation staff, the police and nearly every other part of the criminal justice system.Straw said that as justice secretary he took full responsibility for the failings of the probation service."Sonnex could and should have been in custody at the time he committed these murders," he said. "It was the consequence of very serious failures across the criminal justice system that he had not been arrested and incarcerated some weeks before."He said that while risk could never be eliminated entirely there was clear evidence of poor judgment and failures to act promptly by the agencies responsible for managing Sonnex.In a statement, Scottsaid he accepted that London probation was "partly to blame for allowing the crimes to take place" but said ministers and other criminal justice agencies had lessons to learn as well.The supervision of Sonnex was left in the hands of a newly qualified probation officer who was struggling with a caseload of 127 offenders in the understaffed Lewisham probation office where nobody had more than two years' experience.Among the blunders was the failure to identify Sonnex as a high-risk offender, that it took 33 days for a warrant to be issued to send him back to prison, that the courts mistakenly released him on bail and that even then the police failed to go and look for him until the day of the murders.The Old Bailey jury was told that both of the accused were habitual users of drugs, including crack cocaine, and Sonnex had a long history of violence. During the trial they each blamed the other for the killings.Sonnex had been jailed for wounding with intent and robbery in 2003 and released on licence in February last year. He was subsequently arrested for handling stolen goods and had his licence revoked. Sonnex told the court he was back in custody for "four or five weeks tops". The victims had been working at Imperial College London as part of a student exchange.Sonnex, 23, admitted entering their property where, he alleged, Farmer was holding down Bonomo and pushing his head into a pillow. Sonnex claimed that he was told to do the same to Ferez.He alleged that he had been outside the flat keeping a lookout when Farmer called for his help. He said he went inside and tied up the other victim, Ferez, on the instructions of Farmer.Sonnex told the court that he left the flat with a bank card for which he had obtained the pin. He was wearing Ferez's glasses in an attempt to disguise himself.When he returned to the scene, he claimed, he was given another bank card and pin by Farmer. When the card was retained by the cash machine, he went back to the flat to find that the two men had been stabbed to death, he told the court.On the eve of the killings, it was alleged, the defendants had been taking drugs in the toilets of a club when Farmer was robbed at knifepoint. Sonnex said the burglaries were an attempt to recover the money stolen from them.Sonnex admitted one count of burglary, which Farmer denied. Both pleaded not guilty to murder, arson, false imprisonment and trying to pervert the course of justice.Farmer chewed gum impassively as he listened to the jury foreman say that he had been found guilty on all six charges by a majority of 11 to one. Despite Farmer's admission he set fire to the house, one juror found him not guilty of arson.Sonnex's face was fixed in a frown that he cast downwards, only intermittently lifting it to look at the jury. As he was led from the dock he stared at Laurent Bonomo's father and shrugged his shoulders before going down to the cells.In his statement released at the end of the case, Scott said that "probation risks becoming a Cinderella service unless urgent attention is paid to its workload, over which it has few effective controls, as well as to its absence from key decision-making about policy and resources."He said that the murders occurred on his watch as head of London probation filled him with utter regret: "I took full responsibility for the performance of the staff that I led, and tendered my resignation as soon as it was clear that failings in the probation service were partly to blame for allowing the crimes to take place."Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation union, said that blaming individuals avoided the acceptance of political responsibility: "Ministers should either fund the criminal justice system and allow probation officers to do their job properly or stop claiming they are protecting the public. Probation did receive additional funds over the last decade but it did not result in extra probation officers."Phil Wheatley, the director-general of National Offender Management Service, which runs prisons and probation said: "A well managed probation service would not have placed that officer in that position. She was supervised by an acting senior without proper back-up. That is why these serious failures took place. This should not have happened."Since the Sonnex case, an extra 60 new probation officers have been drafted into London with a further 80 to be recruited this year. An urgent healthcheck is being undertaken by the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, on the rest of London probation.Only three years after the similar Monckton murder case caused a national outcry, probation chiefs insist that work with high-risk offenders in specialist probation public protection units across the capital have improved, but the failure in this case where Sonnex was wrongly categorised as a medium-risk offender, shows little improvement in general probation work in London.
