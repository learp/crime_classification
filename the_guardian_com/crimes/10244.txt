Liverpool's new striker Robbie Keane has become the seventh footballer at the club to be burgled while playing in an international match.Keane and his wife, Claudine, 25, had been living in a hotel penthouse suite while they search for a suitable house on Merseyside following his Â£20m transfer from Tottenham. The penthouse was burgled while Keane was playing with the Republic of Ireland, it emerged yesterday.It is believed a watch and jewellery belonging to Keane's wife were among the items stolen. A spokeswoman for Merseyside police said: "We can confirm that we are investigating a theft at a city centre hotel which was reported to us on August 29 this year. I can't confirm the identity of the victim, but we don't believe it is linked with the others. It is almost like a spur of the moment thing and doesn't look like a pre-planned operation."Last December the club's captain, Steven Gerrard, became the sixth victim. His home was robbed by four men in balaclavas while his wife and young daughters were in the house as his team won 4-0 against Marseille in a Champions League match.Most of the incidents have occurred while the players have been in Europe for Champions League matches. Dirk Kuyt, Jerzy Dudek, Pepe Reina, Daniel Agger and Peter Crouch have all been burgled. Merseyside police confirmed last year they were linking the six previous incidents involving Liverpool players. The club put in place extra security for its stars and Keane is the first to be targeted since Gerrard's home was raided.
