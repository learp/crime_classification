 Police today carried out a series of drug raids across London and the home counties as they targeted a £100m cocaine ring.More than 30 homes and businesses were searched and 22 people arrested. Police seized over 100kg of drugs, believed to be cocaine worth £5.5m, plus cash and firearms.Officers used a mechanical digger to smash into the heavily fortified £3m home of one of the suspected leaders of the ring in Hayes, west London. It was reported that the resident is a 53-year-old Egyptian man suspected of laundering up to £4m a week.More than 500 officers simultaneously raided properties in and around the capital at dawn this morning. Warrants are believed to have been issued to search properties in Europe.The raids followed a six-month surveillance and information-gathering operation by Scotland Yard's special intelligence section.Detectives said the operation had targeted one of UK's largest cocaine and cannabis rings, and specifically several suspected "top tier and key players" involved in trafficking drugs around the UK.Detective Superintendent Steve Richardson, who organised the operation, said the raids were the final step in dismantling the network. More than 10 people had been arrested before today.He said: "Today's operation has been hugely successful. We have targeted the key players in a serious and organised criminal network, culminating in a huge blow to the illegal drugs industry in the UK."These criminals have been living the lives of wealthy businessmen through criminal activity and today we have put a stop to this."Richardson said the gang laundered more than £100m of drug money through foreign exchange bureaux and other financial businesses, as well as a taxi business that handled up to £4m every week.Members became so successful at selling drugs, they would exchange suitcases full of €500 notes. The cash was taken to Europe and invested in properties and bank accounts.Police said they had taken action to freeze bank accounts and access to properties across mainland Europe.
