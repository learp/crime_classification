A row has broken out over rules banning prisoners from being paid for media work.Paying prisoners for articles published in the mainstream press has proved controversial: In 2002, the Press Complaints Commission adjudicated against the Guardian for paying John Williams, for his account of life in prison with fellow inmate Jeffrey Archer, the Conservative peer.In the same year, Matthew Williams, currently serving time at HMP Dovegate, Staffordshire, successfully appealed to the prison ombudsman after he was prevented from sending a radio play out of prison.He challenged the censorship powers of "standing order 5", which forbids prisoners from benefiting financially from the broadcast media by arguing that prisoners "should be encouraged to earn a legitimate income from their skills, as a genuine lawful career would aid prisoner rehabilitation."The prison ombudsman agreed the restriction on payment had no merit and that, if prisoners can make a living from their artistic talents, this must be in the interests of resettlement and rehabilitation, and hence public safetyIt sent a recommendation to Phil Wheatley, the director general of the Prison Service, in August 2002, that the ruling be amended accordingly.In the latest edition of the free prison magazine, Prison Report, Matthew Williams claims the Prison Service has failed to change the ruling on paying prisoners for articles published in the public realm, despite the recommendation from the prison ombudsman to do so.Both the ombudsman's office and Mr Williams insist they received respective letters confirming the recommendation would be implemented.Rhian Evans, the deputy prison ombudsman, said: "We issued a report in August 2002 in which we recommended that the instruction be amended to allow payment."The Prison Service accepted the recommendation but, notwithstanding our requests for progress reports, the recommendation has not yet been implemented. "But the Prison Service denied ever making such an agreement. In a statement issued to Guardian Unlimited it said: "The Prison Service has never agreed to amend SO5 to allow prisoners to receive payments for articles."The Prison Service is currently looking at the rules and regulations around prisoners writing features and articles for publication."The issue came to light the day ahead of the launch of an accredited journalism course for prisoners set up by the National Union of Journalists.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
