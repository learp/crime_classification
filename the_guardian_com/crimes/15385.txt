The former boyfriend of Jayden Parkinson has been jailed for at least 20 years for her murder.Ben Blakeley, 22, a former binman, drug user and petty criminal, strangled the 17-year-old the day after she told him she was expecting his child and hid her body nearby.He later crammed her remains into a suitcase and hired a taxi to take him to a cemetery in Oxfordshire, where he buried her body in his uncle's grave.As a teenager Blakeley told a member of staff at the children's home where he lived that if he ever had to dispose of a body he would hide it in an old grave so the body parts would get mixed up, confusing any DNA tests.At his sentencing hearing at Oxford crown court, Jayden's mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, said in a statement read out in court that the teenager was not just her daughter, but also her best friend.Shrewsbury added that she could not stop picturing the "evil" that was done to her by Blakeley.Jayden's sister, Sharday George, said Blakeley had torn her family and the community apart.During his trial Blakeley was shown to be controlling and violent. He tried to take control of proceedings at his sentencing by at one stage walking out of the dock, leading to a pause in the hearing.It emerged that Blakeley has a string of convictions for offences including violence and possession of drugs.Matthew Walsh, prosecuting, said aggravating features for the murder included Jayden's vulnerability and her suspected pregnancy.Richard Benson QC, for Blakeley, said he had written to the vicar of the church where he buried Jayden's body to apologise for what he did. Benson argued that the killing had not been premeditated and claimed Blakeley believed Jayden, who had broken up with his client, had a new boyfriend.Jailing Blakeley for life, Judge Patrick Eccles QC told him he had murdered Jayden in a "jealous rage". He described Blakeley's decision to bury her in his uncle's grave as "twisted".Blakeley was a serial abuser of his girlfriends, including Jayden. He controlled them, not allowing them to socialise with anyone else, and confiscated their phones. He also punched, kicked and bit them.Jayden went to the police about Blakeley shortly before she was killed after he threatened to post explicit videos and photos of her on social network sites.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining how officers dealt with the case.A serious case review and domestic homicide review have also been launched. One area the reviews will focus on is the care Jayden received in a hostel for young homeless people in Oxford, part-funded by the county council, where she was staying at the time of her death.
