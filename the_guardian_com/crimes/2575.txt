Police are hunting a suspect who set off up to 200 fireworks in a Bolton shop, injuring a 15-month-old boy.The man, wearing a Scream-type mask, threw a box containing a lit industrial firework onto the floor of the convenience store before running off.The firework set off scores of small rockets that flew around the shop spewing coloured smoke and sparks at about 9.30pm on Monday.The shopkeeper managed to kick the firework into the shop porch where it continued to explode.The man was unhurt but his 15-month-old son was taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.Police believe the firework was a Fantasia 218. Officers want to hear from any retailers who may have sold it."This was one of the worst incidents I have ever seen of someone abusing a lit firework and endangering lives," said Inspector Tony Kenyon."This was not a small firework. It could be described as an industrial-style firework with up to 200 repeat rounds so the risk of endangering life was very high."It was a very dangerous prank and resulted in a young baby having to go to hospital. Thankfully the injuries were not severe but it could have been tragic."The incident happened at the California Wines shop on Tonge Moor Road, Bolton, Greater Manchester.
