The Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard claimed today he had been acting in self-defence when he punched a man in a row over music.The England international told Liverpool crown court that he punched Marcus McGee three times during a clash at a bar in Southport.He said that he had struck the man "to defend myself", fearing he was about to be hit by McGee. Gerrard, 29, who denies affray, said that, at the time, he was unaware one of his friends, John Doran, had landed the first blow, elbowing McGee in the face."I thought he was going to hit me," Gerrard said."He was on his way forward to me and his behaviour had changed from when I was having a discussion with him. I didn't know why."Asked how he felt now, the footballer added: "I am certainly mistaken in thinking he was coming towards me to throw punches at me. Now I know, obviously, he had been struck, reacted and thought the strike was by me and he came into me and that's when I reacted."I am sorry about the whole incident."Gerrard denied that he had lost control on the night of the fight.He had been drinking at the Lounge Inn in Southport to celebrate a 5-1 victory over Newcastle earlier that day. The footballer had been drinking Budweiser and a sweet liqueur drink called a Jammy Donut shot, estimating his level of drunkenness as seven out of 10. Gerrard remained calm and quietly spoken as he gave evidence, repeatedly sipping a glass of water as he stood in the witness box."It was very difficult at the time to explain to the police why I did throw the first blows. But it was because I was arguing and I felt as if Marcus was coming forward to hit me."He told the jury he had been used to people "mithering" him and he was usually able to smooth things over.Gerrard said he suffered "a lot of mither" at traffic lights, shopping centres, bars and restaurants and the comments can be "derogatory or insulting".He admitted calling McGee "a prick" to one of his friends when he refused to change the music.During the conversation with McGee, 34, he claimed the man swore at him, saying: "You are not putting no fucking music on here."Gerrard said a member of staff at the bar had given him permission to choose music from a CD player that his alleged victim was operating.A card that controlled the music was snatched from his hand by McGee, he said."I couldn't understand why the guy had such a problem with me, why he was so aggressive," he said.Gerrard said that when he went over to speak to McGee for a second time, he had no intention of having a fight but wanted to "smooth things over".Gerrard told the court he had a conviction for drink-driving when he was 19 but had not been in any other trouble with the police.Gerrard welled up with tears as a statement from Liverpool legend KennyDalglish was read out. Dalglish described Gerrard as "not the archetypal footballer. He does not like to move in movie star circles."He described him as "quiet" and "very private." Despite his wealth, Dalglish said, Gerrard has "never forgotten his roots.""He is a very respectful man who has always behaved to senior players in a respectful way," Dalglish said. "He is a very humble man."Dalglish, who had earlier met Gerrard on the night of the incident, said he had been with a group of boys who were "normal, polite, eating sushi and enjoying themselves".The footballer said Gerrard had become involved in his wife Marina's charity for breast cancer and had been a guest of honour at a Hillsborough memorial match.William Bygroves, the chaplain at Liverpool football club, said in a statement he had known Gerrard since he was a youth. "I have seen him mature into a kind, mature, generous, community minded family man."The chaplain said Gerrard had shown interest in those less fortunate than himself.Bygroves said Gerrard was always generous when meeting children at Alder Hey children's hospital and had worked on an anti-racism campaign with Gee Walker, the mother of murder victim Anthony Walker.He described Gerrard as a warm-hearted genuine person.Cross-examined by David Turner QC, for the prosecution, Gerrard was asked to show the jury how he hit McGee. He gently lifted his right arm to demonstrate the uppercut.Asked by Turner if he was sickened by what he did, Gerrard replied: "I am certainly sorry."The jurors are expected to be sent out to consider their verdict tomorrow.
