  Gareth Williams's body was found at his flat in Pimlico in August 2010. Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAScotland Yard has reopened the prospect of criminal charges over the death of the MI6 spy Gareth Williams.Lawyers for the force tried to block a coroner from publishing video footage that could be key to a prosecution.Investigations into the discovery of Williams's body in a sports holdall in his bath had drawn a 21-month blank for detectives. But at the opening of an inquest into the spy's death, the lawyer Vincent Williams said charges were still a "real possibility".He said a "careful line must be struck between open justice" at the inquest and a criminal investigation. When asked why materials should not go into the public domain, the lawyer said: "It is because there is a live complex ongoing investigation taking place."It is because there may be criminal proceedings further down the line that the commissioner feels that the pattern of disclosure â€¦ has to be done with some care."The coroner, Fiona Wilcox, said the death was "highly controversial". Four intelligence agents were granted anonymity at the inquest, and Wilcox said there was a real risk of harm to national security and international relations if some of those giving evidence were exposed. The only confirmed member of GCHQ who can be named is Stephen Gale.The naked and decomposing body of Williams, 31, was found in a large North Face holdall, sealed by a padlock, in the bath of his home in Pimlico, west London, in August 2010. The discovery sparked a painstaking investigation, worldwide media attention and several outlandish conspiracy theories.Wilcox expressed sympathy to Williams's family, who have said they fear that "some agency specialising in the dark arts" will leave them with no way of knowing how and why he died.
