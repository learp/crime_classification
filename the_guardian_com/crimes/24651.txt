It was lunchtime in Harrow, London, and the locals, as they do, were taking a quiet drink, reflecting peaceably about the greatness of Muhammad Ali and Mick Channon. As the cigarette smoke wound its way idly towards the ceiling of the Tythe Farm Hotel, and beer mugs rose towards waiting Harrovian lips, in walks this puma.It was not an unaccompanied puma. Its owner, Mr John Goodman, was with it, and Mr Goodman had come for a drink. The puma (the police gave its specification as "12 months old, three feet six inches long without tail, two feet six inches high"), had other ideas, and proceeded to rampage around a little. In the words of the police, it went berserk.Tables were overturned, chairs flew about, frightened customers headed for the alcoves.The police were called, and upon arrival ordered Mr Goodman to restrain his puma. This proved not too easy, but eventually Mr Goodman persuaded his puma to accompany him to his car, a hired Morris Marina, which was parked in the hotel car park.The puma got into the car - Mr Goodman didn't. The Marina and puma contents were towed to Harrow police station. Mr Goodman was also towed to the police station, where be will be charged with being drunk and incapable. He will appear in court this morning.The puma, far from incapable and still rampaging in the Marina, now parked outside police station, was not charged. Instead the men who know about pumas, the London Zoo, were summoned to cope with the large cat. They took it away to their zoo, where it now is, mixing with feline friends but missing the warm atmosphere of the typical English pub.The charge against Mr Goodman, a packer who lives in Harrow, does not relate to the puma. Scotland Yard said last night: "As far as we know there's nothing illegal about keeping a puma. He acquired it legally from a breeder"
