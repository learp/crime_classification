The parents of Rhys Jones, the 11-year-old boy shot dead in Liverpool four weeks ago, made a new appeal today for witnesses to come forward, saying they could not find "peace" until his killer is caught."Four weeks ago we were just a normal, happy family. All that changed on that Wednesday night," Rhys's father, Stephen, told a press conference with Merseyside police.Rhys was shot dead on August 22 in a pub car park a few hundred metres from the family home in Croxteth Park while walking home from football practice.Witnesses said he was shot by a teenage gunman on a bicycle. Police believe it might have been a case of mistaken identityDetective Superintendent Dave Kelly said the force was committed to a "tireless" effort to find the killer, adding that the case had affected him deeply."No one should be allowed to pick up a gun and take the life of an innocent child, and ruin the life of his family," he said.Det Supt Kelly said he was particularly keen to speak again with one caller to police who appeared to have information about the killer's identity, and to a woman seen driving a red car near the park at the time of the murder.Rhys's parents said this week would be especially difficult for them, as their son would have turned 12 tomorrow."The only reason we are here today, the only reason, is that we need help, we need witnesses to come forwards," his mother, Melanie, said, her voice breaking."We need the person who killed our son to be caught and brought to justice, to bring us a bit of peace."It was announced earlier today that a new Â£1.5m community centre in Croxteth Park will be named after Rhys."We want to build something in memory of Rhys and something for kids on the estate to use," said Dave Saville, chairman of the local residents' association.
