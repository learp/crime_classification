Police officers should be given the power to punish youngsters committing antisocial behaviour with the modern equivalent of swift "a clip around the ear" by getting them to do community work, the Tories said today.Chris Grayling, the shadow home secretary, said that he wanted to create a system of "instant community punishments for serious acts of antisocial behaviour" that would not involve youngsters getting a criminal record.In a speech in London, Grayling said: "The 21st century 'clip around the ear' is designed to punish not criminalise."We need to make sure that our system delivers punishments at 12 to stop crimes at 16."Grayling said the events in Doncaster this week, where two boys aged 10 and 11 have been charged with attempted murder, illustrated why the Conservatives had been warning about Britain being a "broken society".He went on: "Changing what we have called the broken society will be a long and difficult process. But one step we can take quickly is to go to war on antisocial behaviour. Because the minor criminality committed by young teenagers so often leads to worse if it goes unchecked."Grayling, who said he did not want to go back to the days when police officers were allowed to administer a real clip around the ear, said that Labour had tried to deal with this problem by creating antisocial behaviour orders but that obtaining an Asbo was too time-consuming and bureaucratic.In February Grayling floated the idea of allowing the police to use "grounding orders" to impose a curfew on young troublemakers for up to a month. Today he said he would like to take the idea further, by allowing the police to impose community punishments through a similar process."If you kick down someone's fence, and you are caught, then you should expect to give up the next few weekends to community work. And your family should expect to pay for the damage," Grayling said.Grayling admitted the plan still needed "a lot of work" and he was unable to give any details as to how it might operate. He suggested that magistrates could be involved in approving the punishments, but as members of the local community and not as members of the judiciary because Grayling wants a system that allows young troublemakers to be punished without them acquiring a criminal record.In a previous speech Grayling spoke about concentrating less on rights and more on wrongs and today he defended that position."In some parts of our society, 'my rights' has become an alibi for bad behaviour," Grayling said."It's time that children realised that they can be told to stop it by a teacher or a policeman and that, sometimes, they just have to do what they are told. Young people have to learn that when an adult makes a decision they have to listen."
