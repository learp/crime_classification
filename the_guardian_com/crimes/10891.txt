Two City workers face fines and a ban from the Square Mile after they used inside information to make more than £85,000 from spread betting on shares.Robin Chhabra, a former research ­analyst at Evolution, and his friend Sameer Patel, an investment manager at General Motors Asset Management, were found by a City tribunal to have colluded in using confidential information to make quick profits.Their punishment is yet to be decided because they had been disputing a finding by the Financial Services Authority that they had committed market abuse. However, the financial services and markets tribunal, which rules on disputes between the FSA and individuals and firms facing regulatory action, upheld the FSA's case.Margaret Cole, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime, said: "Chhabra and Patel's behaviour fell far short of that expected of approved persons. By repeatedly giving Patel privileged information, Chhabra breached the trust of his clients and his employer."Patel exploited this information to try to make a quick profit at the expense of other investors. Market abuse is a serious matter and the FSA will continue to pursue and take action against anyone who believes they can make easy money off the back of confidential information."The tribunal will hold a new hearing on the "penalties and prohibition orders" against the two men, both aged 38. They have known each other for more than 20 years, acting as each other's best man, and between 20 April and 3 August 2004 had 165 "telephone contacts".Patel, who was using his own money to trade, made £85,541 after placing spread bets on ebookers and Eidos shares following tips from Chhabra, who received inside information at Evolution where he covered 20 stocks.Some of the gains were made when the companies issued profits warnings during the middle of the trading day – an unusual occurrence, rather than 7am – the tribunal was told by the FSA.The FSA told the tribunal: "An unscheduled intra-day profits warning was rare and the probability that on two occasions in nine weeks Mr Chhabra knew about such markets and Mr Patel placed successful sell bets on the same day without knowing about such warnings was infinitesimal."Chhabra argued that the FSA's case was circumstantial and did not satisfy the burden of proof that was required, while Patel argued that there was no "cogent evidence" he had behaved in a "reprehensible manner".The tribunal noted: "With their good characters they were less likely to behave badly. There was no evidence before us of any financial motive for Mr Chabbra to disclose the inside information or for Mr Patel to place bets in reliance on it."
