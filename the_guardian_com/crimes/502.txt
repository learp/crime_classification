Spending on terrorism was broken down as £63m on police activity and £24m on technical and operational support.Mr Blunkett said later the Budget provided key investment for the police.He said: "The Budget settlement was excellent news for all those facing the challenge of street crime and anti-social behaviour together with those working on counter-terrorism and security measures with £180m of new government money and £100m from the criminal justice reserve. "By adding to this with other Home Office money, we are ensuring vital funds are going to the drive against street crime and terrorism, while providing for a range of options to tackle young criminals, from tagging and tough community supervision through to custody." The home secretary said over £60m would go to the Metropolitan Police and more than £40m to other forces.He said: "This means more officers and greater presence in the community fighting street crime, throughout the 10 forces taking part in the street crime reduction programme." "I am sure this spending package will enhance the work of our police officers and all those involved in the criminal justice system," he added.
