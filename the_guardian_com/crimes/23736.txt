Lawyers representing Harry Redknapp, his former chairman at Portsmouth, Milan Mandaric, and the south coast club's former chief executive Peter Storrie have appeared at a court hearing over tax evasion charges against the trio.Redknapp and Mandaric are jointly accused of two counts of cheating the public revenue and Storrie has been charged separately with tax evasion.Legal representatives for the three men, who are all on bail and who all strongly deny any wrongdoing, were told to be ready for a further directions hearing at Southwark crown court in London on 28 May. None appeared in person.Storrie has already been given a court date of 16 May 2011 and it is understood that the three men could yet be tried together, subject to legal argument.Redknapp, now Tottenham's manager, and Mandaric, now chairman of Leicester City, are charged with evading tax and national insurance contributions due between 1 April 2002 and 28 November 2007.Storrie, who has stepped down from his post as chief executive but is still working for Portsmouth's administrator on a consultancy basis, is alleged to have cheated the public revenue between 1 July 2003 and 28 November 2007 over a signing-on fee to the midfielder Amdy Faye when he was signed from Auxerre.He is accused of arranging for the fee to Faye to be paid via the bank account of an agent, Willie McKay, in order to "conceal its true nature and purpose".His actions allegedly caused "a failure on the part of the club to operate PAYE and account for income tax and national insurance contributions in respect of that fee".The charges against Redknapp and Mandaric concern two payments, totalling $295,000 [Â£191,000], from the former Portsmouth chairman to his then manager via a bank account in Monaco that are alleged to have evaded tax and national insurance contributions due between 1 April 2002 and 28 November 2007.
