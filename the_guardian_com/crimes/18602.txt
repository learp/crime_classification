Chris Langham, the award-winning comedy actor imprisoned for downloading graphic images of child abuse, walked free from jail yesterday after being granted a four-month reduction in his sentence.The 58-year-old, who starred in the BBC satire The Thick of It, was sentenced to 10 months in prison in September after being found guilty of 15 counts of making an indecent photograph of a child.Yesterday judges at the court of appeal in London cut his jail term to six months, meaning the actor, who was due to be released in December, was freed from prison last night.Dame Heather Steel said the court had taken into account Langham's claims that he had downloaded the videos as research for a character in the TV show Help.She said the court regarded his explanations as "highly improbable", but added that it could not reject his claims that he was not a paedophile.She said: "The major ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive ... and that Langham's motivation for downloading the indecent images was not one of sexual gratification."Steel said the court had considered the submissions made on Langham's behalf with care and with particular reference to the trial judge's sentencing remarks when he said there was nothing to indicate Langham was "a sexual predator in the sense that it is ordinarily used".During the original trial Langham had denied he was a paedophile but did admit downloading the images. He was cleared on separate charges of sexual abuse against a child.Langham's counsel, David Whitehouse QC, said yesterday: "He was not looking at it for erotic reasons. He was writing about child abuse with admirable motives. He was looking at the images to do that the better."Steel ruled that a custodial sentence had been inevitable. However, she said that because of the mitigation the court had decided to allow his appeal to the "limited extent" of imposing a new sentence of six months.Child welfare organisations last night said it was important to remember that everyone who looked at abusive images of children was contributing to their suffering. "We must never forget that Chris Langham committed a very serious offence," said Diane Sutton from the NSPCC. "Behind most images is an abused child and these children will suffer for many years knowing that offenders will pore over images of their abuse."Langham, from Golford, near Cranbrook, Kent, was not in court, but he was released last night. He will remain on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
