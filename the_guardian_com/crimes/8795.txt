Blood was just pouring out of him â€“ it was shocking."Another witness, Alexandra Koohi, said she heard shouting and then about an hour later shots were fired. She added: "I heard lots of shouting outside the kebab shop, then an hour later I was in my bedroom and I heard two shots."I looked out of my window and the guy was lying on the floor and there was blood everywhere."
