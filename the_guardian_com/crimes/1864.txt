Muslim businessmen have put up a Â£10,000 reward to help catch a man who sexually assaulted an asylum-seeker and her baby. The attack happened when the 33-year-old Algerian woman took her one-year-old son out in his pram in Glasgow and was confronted by a group of at least four white males who threw stones at them.One man then exposed himself and sexually assaulted the woman before assaulting her son and attempting to perform an indecent act on the child.'This was a sexually motivated assault not just on a woman but her young baby, and it didn't take long for people to come together and say they wanted to do something,' said Osama Saeed, a Scottish spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain.He added that, while the Muslim community had been subjected to a growing number of crimes, 'this attack reached a new low'.
