A top Scotland Yard police officer pleaded not guilty today to charges linked to a scuffle in a restaurant.Ali Dizaei, 47, a Metropolitan police commander, is accused of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice.He formally denied the two charges during a 20-minute hearing at Southwark crown court in central London. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC adjourned the case until 9 October and said a two-week trial may begin on 30 November.Dizaei entered the dock to confirm his name and enter the not guilty pleas. He was accompanied in court by a large number of supporters, including members of the Metropolitan Black Police Association.The prosecution follows an investigation by officials from the Independent Police Complaints Commission after an incident outside the Persian Yas restaurant in Kensington, west London, on 18 July last year.Dizaei, who was wearing his uniform, arrested businessman Waad al-Baghdadi after a row involving the mouthpiece of a hookah water pipe.The first charge alleges Dizaei was responsible for misconduct in a public office by threatening al-Baghdadi and by "purporting to arrest and detain" him despite knowing he did not have reasonable grounds.The second charge alleges Dizaei perverted the course of justice by falsely claiming in written statements that he "had been a victim of an unprovoked assault" by al-Baghdadi.Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said up to 40 witnesses could be called during the trial, which will be heard by a high court judge.Dizaei, who was represented in court by barrister Matthew Ryder, was released on conditional bail.The officer, who is president of the National Black Police Association and wore one of the organisation's lapel badges, gave his address as care of his solicitor. He left the court without commenting.Dizaei is a leading critic of the police's record on race issues. The allegations against him surfaced at the height of a bitter race row last summer that convulsed the force. Scotland Yard faced accusations of racism from its most senior ethnic minority officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, whose closest adviser was Dizaei.The battle was at times dirty, with Ghaffur's allies leaking details designed to embarrass the then Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, while Ghaffur and Dizaei found allegations about their private lives appearing in tabloid newspapers.
