A boy whose torso was found in the Thames was probably not killed for muti (African medicine), a South African policeman claimed yesterday.Scotland Yard detectives have suggested the boy, whom they have named Adam, may have been the first victim of a muti murder in Britain. But Superintendent Gerard Labuschagne, of the South African police, told a conference at Liverpool University that Adam's death did not bear the hallmarks of a muti killing. He said it was possible he had been the victim of a human sacrifice - but the more likely explanation was that the killer had simply wanted to make it difficult to identify the body. Adam's torso was found in the Thames last year. A postmortem examination revealed he suffered severe trauma to the neck but his limbs and head were removed after death. Dr Labuschagne said: "It's very unlikely it was a muti murder. We don't get victims cut up in that way. We've never had a muti case in South Africa in which the body has been dismembered. "The fact that the head was cut off seems to suggest that someone was trying to hide the boy's identity." British detectives have travelled to South Africa to find out more about muti killings. They do not think Adam was from South Africa.
