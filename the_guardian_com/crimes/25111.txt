For Lois Jenkins and her four daughters yesterday's verdict will bring some measure of closure. Within minutes of the jury's decision, a police officer from the Sussex force contacted Sion Jenkins' ex-wife in Tasmania, where she lives. "We have kept her in touch all the time," said a police source. "We know she wanted to know as soon as possible what that was."In the aftermath of the death of Billie-Jo, the former nurse and social worker told police about her husband's alleged domestic violence towards her. On his conviction in 1998, she divorced him and emigrated to Tasmania with Annie, Charlotte, Esther and Maya.After one failed appeal court case in 1999, the former Mrs Jenkins and her daughter Lottie attended Mr Jenkins' second appeal hearing in London in 2004. Mrs Jenkins appeared on behalf of the prosecution. Lottie, then 20, was called by the defence.Mrs Jenkins has said the realisation that her husband might have killed Billie-Jo, had been "shattering". In the only public statements she has made, she wrote in 2003 of how she had pleaded with her former husband to confess in a letter sent to him after his conviction. "The girls would be relieved of enormous burdens if they felt human beings had the capacity to own up to things."She also addressed the alleged domestic violence she had suffered. "How I wish I had not allowed his 'pillar of the community' presentation to deceive people and how I wish I had faced the shame of owning up to being scared and confused in my own home."
