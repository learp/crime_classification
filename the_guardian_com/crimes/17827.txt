Police investigating the murder of Lee Rigby, the British soldier hacked to death in Woolwich last Wednesday, have made three further arrests.Two men, aged 24 and 28, were detained at an address in south-east London on Saturday, while a 21-year-old man was arrested in the street in Charlton Lane, Greenwich, all on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.Police from the counter-errorism command, supported by specialist firearms officers, used Tasers to detain the 21- and 28-year-old. They did not need hospital treatment.The arrests came as Downing Street confirmed the launch of a new terror task force to crack down on extremism.The group, comprising cabinet ministers and leading police and security service officials, will focus on radical preachers who seek out potential recruits in prisons, schools, colleges and mosques.No 10 said it would monitor trends in radicalisation and tackle "poisonous narratives", focusing on practical measures rather than getting bogged down in theoretical debates about Britishness and cultural values.It will also examine what powers can be used to clamp down on extremist activity including how to tackle hate preachers.The task force – which is expected to meet within weeks – will include the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, the home secretary, Theresa May, the chancellor, George Osborne, other key cabinet ministers, the Met police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, and Andrew Parker, the director general of the security service.The government wants work carried out to ensure religious leaders are not promoting extremist messages and wants mosque committees to be held to account for their choice of imams.Ministers believe religious leaders who promote violence must be confronted "head on", ideally through encouraging condemnation from groups to which those vulnerable to radicalisation may listen.The prime minister has also announced that the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) will carry out an investigation following the disclosure that the two men suspected of murdering Drummer Rigby – identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale, 22 – were known to MI5.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat Lord Carlile, who until 2011 was the independent reviewer of government anti-terror laws, has criticised his party's leader for blocking the so-called "snooper's charter".Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the peer said he was shocked at Clegg's decision to bring a halt to reforms that would have allowed records of internet use to be stored for a year and warned it could come back to haunt him."The veto was a political decision, not one based on the merits. It was contrary to what are certainly the views of the home secretary Theresa May and probably those of the prime minister," he wrote in the newspaper. "The security services and the police clearly felt the need for the new law."The latest arrests in London took place between 6pm and 6.30pm on Saturday, and the three men are being held at a south London police station, Scotland Yard said.Officers were last night searching four addresses in south-east London. Searches have also taken place at three other addresses in south London, one in east London, one in north London and one in Saxilby, Lincolnshire – the former home of Adebolajo.A 29-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder has been released on bail, police said on Saturday night.Two women aged 29 and 31 have been released without charge after they were held on Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, and a number of other people not directly involved with the attack have been charged over malicious comments made on social networking sites.Adebolajo and Adebowale remained in a stable condition in hospital after being shot by police when they charged towards armed officers in Woolwich on Wednesday.The soldier's murder has provoked a backlash of anger across the country, with mosques being attacked and a large increase in anti-Muslim incidents.Authorities in France are also investigating whether an attack on a French soldier, who was stabbed in the neck in a busy shopping area near Paris on Saturday, was linked the murder of Drummer Rigby.Up to 2,000 people took part in a EDL march in Newcastle on Saturday, which had been planned before Wednesday's attack.EDL supporters sang "RIP Lee Rigby" as they marched through the city, waving union flags and chanting "Whose streets? Our streets", before holding a minute's silence for the murdered soldier.Police said there were no major incidents, with a small number of arrests related to alcohol and public order offences. Three people were held before the march for allegedly making racist tweets.The BNP has been accused of cynically exploiting the killing to further its "own poisonous ends" after the far-right group announced it would be demonstrating in Woolwich next Saturday.But while there have been widespread tensions, near the spot of Drummer Rigby's murder people showed solidarity on Saturday as they comforted one another and left floral tributes, adding to the thousands of bouquets already there.Along with the floral tributes at the corner of John Wilson Street and Artillery Place, where the attack took place, many hundreds more have been left outside the entrance to Woolwich barracks a few hundred yards away, where Drummer Rigby was based.A book of condolence has been opened at Woolwich town hall, where opening hours have been extended over the bank holiday weekend to allow the public to pay their respects.A service dedicated to the solider will be held at St Peter the Apostle Roman Catholic church in Woolwich on Sunday, while prayers will also be said at Woolwich's St Mary Magdalene parish church.Donations to the Help for Heroes charity through the JustGiving page linked to the RIP Woolwich Soldier Facebook tribute page topped £102,000 on Sunday. Almost £19,000 has also been raised on the official Help for Heroes JustGiving page.
