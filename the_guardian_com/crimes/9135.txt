Ministers are reconsidering proposals to clarify the law on consent and alcohol in rape cases after an appeal court judgment yesterday which said the change was unnecessary.Proposals to create a new statutory definition of capacity to consent had been put on hold after opposition from circuit judges. Before deciding whether to go ahead, ministers were awaiting yesterday's judgment in which the appeal court addressed for the first time how the existing law operates in the growing number of cases where women allege they were raped after binge drinking.Yesterday, Sir Igor Judge, president of the Queen's bench division of the high court, said the court's view was that the Sexual Offences Act 2003 "sufficiently addresses the issue of consent in the context of voluntary consumption of alcohol by the complainant".He said problems did not arise from the legal principles, but "lie with infinite circumstances of human behaviour, usually taking place in private without independent evidence, and the consequent difficulties of proving this very serious offence."Sir Igor and two other senior judges issued the guidance while giving their reasons for quashing the conviction of a 25-year-old computer software engineer, Benjamin Bree, for raping a 19-year-old student after a night of binge drinking with friends from Bournemouth University.Ruling on the issue of consent in such cases, Sir Igor said: "If, through drink - or for any other reason - the complainant has temporarily lost her capacity to choose whether to have intercourse on the relevant occasion, she is not consenting, and subject to questions about the defendant's state of mind, if the intercourse takes place, this would be rape."However, where the complainant has voluntarily consumed even substantial quantities of alcohol, but nevertheless remains capable of choosing whether or not to have intercourse, and in drink agrees to do so, this would not be rape.""We should perhaps underline that, as a matter of practical reality, capacity to consent may evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious."Sir Igor said such considerations "underline the fact that it would be unrealistic to endeavour to create some kind of grid system which would enable the answer to these questions to be related to some prescribed level of alcohol consumption".He added: "Experience shows that different individuals have a greater or lesser capacity to cope with alcohol than others and indeed the ability of a single individual to do so may vary from day to day.""The practical reality is that there are some areas of human behaviour which are inapt for detailed legislative structures.""In this context, provisions intended to protect women from sexual assaults might very well be conflated into a system which would provide patronising interference with the right of autonomous adults to make personal decisions for themselves."The government brought forward the proposals for a change in the law after a student, Ruairi Dougal, who had sex with a drunken fellow student, was cleared of rape charges on the basis that "drunken consent is still consent".Sir Igor said that the outcry after the case was based on a misunderstanding. "All that was being said was that when someone who has had a lot to drink is in fact consenting to intercourse, then that is what she is doing, consenting. Equally, if after taking drink, she is not consenting, then by definition intercourse is taking place without her consent."
