Judges must do more to promote public confidence in the legal system by being more willing to explain their work, Lord Chief Justice Lord Woolf said today.One of the key ways in which they could encourage public understanding of the legal system would be by going into schools and inviting children into the courts, he said.Lord Woolf said that the education system had a vital role to play in cutting lawlessness in modern society, suggesting that it was in the classroom not the courthouse that the problem of social disorder - the so-called yob culture - can best be tackled.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "What I believe is critically important is to contribute to public confidence in the system."We circulated our judges ... and got an overwhelming reaction that they felt like I do, that they should be going out to the schools and explaining the role of the courts in society, and the schools should be coming into the courts much more than they do."I think, in the same way as the police are getting much better at going into schools, so we have got a message to give, because we play a very important role in society."The judges do want to do it and I am sure that up and down the country schools will be receptive to this."Judges would have to undertake any such work in their own time, Lord Woolf said.Asked what changes could aid the fight against yobs - identified in the Queen's speech as a key government priority - Lord Woolf said: "Sitting as a judge, all that I wish is that our education system could be better."When I was growing up, I could be disruptive and a nuisance, but my educational system dealt with me - it didn't reject me - and so I was able to grow through that period."I feel that the educational system in this country is all-important and, if we could get that right, so much else would go right."Lord Woolf also defended the Human Rights Act, saying that the public would become more "receptive" to it as it saw its effects being worked out in the courts.An early ruling under the equivalent Act in Scotland, which saw a motorist escape conviction by claiming that it was a breach of human rights to require drivers to confirm whether they were behind the wheel at the time of an offence, was mistaken, he said.The European Convention on Human Rights - which the Act incorporated into British law - was not a technical document that should be read as precisely defining citizens' legal rights, he said.Instead, as the House of Lords had correctly judged in overturning the Scottish decision, it was "about balance and achieving justice, but not at the cost of society".He added: "It is drawn on broad principles, and those broad principles enable the system, I think, to work better than it did before."I think the public are going to become much more receptive to the convention when they see it working in practice."Related storiesThe Queen's speech - full textRelated special reportPolicing crime Useful linksEuropean Convention on Human RightsLord Woolf inquiry internet site
