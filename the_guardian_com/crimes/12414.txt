A leading member of a trafficking gang who helped to smuggle hundreds of Chinese from Malaysia into Britain was jailed for seven years yesterday.Police said Martin Moo, 59, arranged for people to work in restaurants and takeaways across the country. Workers, who responded to adverts placed in Malaysian newspapers, paid up to Â£3,000 each to start a new life in Britain. Moo took a cut of the money and met them at airports before directing them to work in cities such as Birmingham, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Newcastle. Some went to towns and villages in Cumbria, Scotland and Wales. Moo, who used different aliases and lived in modest accommodation in Manchester and Birmingham, was arrested after a two-year, investigation by the national crime squad. He pleaded guilty to 10 charges of facilitation under the 1971 Immigration Act. He will be deported when released from prison. Jailing him at Manchester crown court, Judge Michael Henshall said: "The business you were in is an evil trade and the people who came here would then live in constant fear of being denounced to the authorities. They could easily become victims of unscrupulous employers who would exploit them. "You were a very important part of a large and sophisticated business." Detective Superintendent Nick Lewis said: "It is our belief that Malaysian-based criminals controlled this people-smuggling operation and that Moo was one of the main people working for them in this country." He added: "Moo had extensive contacts throughout the Chinese community in this country and was able to provide employees for takeaways and restaurants in cities, towns and villages. "It is our belief that over 300 illegal immigrants were helped into the country, but it is impossible to quantify with any degree of certainty the true number Moo has helped into this country."
