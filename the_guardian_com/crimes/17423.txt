The cabinet yesterday rubber stamped the main features of the government's programme for the next session of parliament. The Queen's speech, due on November 13, will be dominated by another criminal justice bill.The legislation, reflecting concern at the surge in some types of crime as well as criticism that the courts are too biased in favour of the defendant, will be aimed at streamlining the criminal courts. The right to jury trial will be curtailed in some circumstances, while previous convictions may also be put before the court. More courts will sit later, but there will be moves to encourage courts to hand down more community service orders and fewer jail sentences. Judges will be expected to play a bigger role in managing cases in their courts, and there could be financial penalties for lawyers where trials have to be ajourned. Ministers have still not been given details of any ban on hunting. The minister, Alun Michael, is thought to be finalising the bill, which will be the most controversial of the next session. Although legislation can be introduced even if is not promised in the Queen's speech, Labour backbenchers will be angry and disappointed if there is not a firm commitment. The bill, which Mr Michael has been drafting since taking evidence from both pro- and anti-hunting camps, is expected to place tight restrictions on hunting with dogs, while allowing some forms of hunting to continue.Such a bill would be amended by backbenchers, and the government has indicated it would force an amended bill through parliament. However, there are no plans to announce paving legislation for a euro referendum. If there is no legislation this year, campaigners for the euro will take it as an indication the timetable for a referendum before the next election is slipping. Another measure will enable foundation hospitals to be set up. Critics fear they will lead to a two-tier health service.
