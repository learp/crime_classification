The widespread and systemic failures I have identified predated him becoming chief constable. However they were not identified and continued for a considerable period thereafter. Chief Constable Westwood must take personal responsibility for the continuation of those failures.'Sir Michael Bichard 'The role of any chief constable has to be one in which the public have confidence. It is my responsibility as home secretary to question whether people in Humberside can continue to have that confidence.'David Blunkett 'What matters above all is that the lessons are learned, that the actions are taken to ensure that nothing of this nature can happen again ... I have made a personal commitment to do my utmost to achieve these goals.
