The Yorkshire Ripper probably committed more crimes than the 13 murders and seven attempted murders for which he was convicted, an official report suppressed for nearly 25 years revealed yesterday.Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act also disclosed that the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was furious at the incompetence of the detectives who had failed for five years to catch the Ripper.The report details the series of blunders committed by the detectives who repeatedly let Peter Sutcliffe through their grasp, allowing him to murder more women. Sutcliffe spread terror in northern England for six years, as women were too afraid to go out alone at night. He was eventually caught by chance in January 1981.After he was convicted in April 1981, Lawrence Byford, an inspector of the constabulary, was commissioned by the government to scrutinise the "many criticisms levelled at the police in what was undoubtedly the largest-scale police investigation ever conducted in this country."His 159-page report was completed in December 1981, but the government has insisted since then that it was "not in the public interest" for it to be published. Yesterday, it was released among a batch of files on the Ripper following requests from the Guardian and others.Mr Byford wrote that "between 1969 and the start of the known Ripper crimes in 1975, there is a curious and unexplained lull in Sutcliffe's criminal activities."He added that, having studied the evidence, "it is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on unaccompanied women, which he has not yet admitted, not only in the West Yorkshire and Manchester areas but also in other parts of the country".He also said: "This feeling is reinforced by examining the details of a number of assaults on women since 1969 which, in some ways, clearly fall into the established pattern of Sutcliffe's overall modus operandi."As the number of murders grew, police came under mounting pressure from public and politicians to catch the killer. In November 1980, Mrs Thatcher summoned William Whitelaw, then home secretary, to Downing Street and told him: "The local police have so far failed totally in their inquiries into a series of murders which constituted the most appalling violence against women. It is now a question of public confidence."There were doubts whether the investigation was being conducted as effectively as it might be, and something needed to be done to restore public faith in the performance of the police. Within days, George Oldfield, the officer heading the inquiry, was sacked.Mr Byford's inquiry found that a list had been drawn up of 850 suspect vehicles whose owners had been seen picking up prostitutes, and that in March 1979, Sutcliffe was one of only three car owners on the list who had previously been recorded as a "triple area sighting".The report concluded: "He should have been regarded as a prime suspect for the attack...but was not interviewed due to a lack of appreciation of the information contained in the computer print-out."What emerges from the documents is that police were tantalisingly close to Sutcliffe for years but still failed to act, partly because they still believed the Ripper hoax tapes. In June 1980, Sutcliffe was interviewed for the eleventh time after behaving suspiciously and driving erratically. He was held for drink-driving, but was released after a check with the Ripper major incident room, which told officers Sutcliffe had been "eliminated from the inquiry on handwriting" - presumably a reference to the letters sent by the hoaxer.The police inquiry was seriously sidetracked by the hoaxer, "Wearside Jack", who claimed on tape and in letters to have carried out the murders. As a result of DNA advances, he was recently tracked down. In March at Leeds crown court, John Humble, 50, was jailed for eight years on four counts of perverting the course of justice after pleading guilty.The role of Trevor Birdsall, Sutcliffe's friend, also caused concern. "The failure to take advantage of Birdsall's anonymous letter and his visit to the police station was yet again a stark illustration of the progressive decline in the overall efficiency of the major incident room."
