The Liberal Democrats have criticised the large number of lengthy custodial sentences handed out by the courts in the wake of the English riots last month.A motion passed at the party's conference in Birmingham said sentencing was "a matter for the courts", and should not be influenced by calls from politicians and the media for tougher punishments.Custodial sentences should only be imposed where "no other sentence is justified", the motion said. Non-custodial measures should be encouraged.A Guardian analysis of Ministry of Justice figures has shown that those convicted of burglary, violent disorder and theft during the riots have on average been jailed for much longer than usual.The harsh response to the riots from some Tory frontbenchers – including David Cameron – has been consistently criticised by senior Lib Dems at the conference. On Sunday, the party president, Tim Farron, said Nick Clegg had "stood up against reactionary Tory drivel after the riots".During the debate on the riots motion, Brian Paddick, the former Met police deputy assistant commissioner and Lib Dem candidate for mayor of London, said the police should have responded more effectively to the initial disturbances.He said: "When I was the police commander in 2002 and unfortunately the police shot somebody who was carrying a cigarette lighter, a peaceful protest about that shooting developed into a riot. The police should have known that that was going to happen in Tottenham on that Saturday night."They should have had – and they could have had – sufficient officers who were suitably trained and equipped on hand to deal with that and they should have arrested the perpetrators of the rioting at the time rather than relying on CCTV images afterwards."The motion also criticised moves mooted by Cameron to evict rioters from council housing or remove their benefits. Evictions would "be unfair to innocent family members" and discriminate against those in social housing, and the removal of benefits would "simply create more deprivation and encourage more criminality".It called the idea of closing down social networks such as Twitter and the BlackBerry messaging service during future riots "neither justified nor practical".The motion also criticised cuts to the Connexions careers advice service and the suggested use of curfews in future, and expressed scepticism about another plank of government policy: elected police commissioners.It urged "stronger checks and balances" on such commissioners than are currently set out in legislation, and stressed "the continued separation of politicians and police operational control".Tom Brake, the co-chair of the Lib Dem party committee on home affairs, said: "The motion we have passed today avoids a kneejerk response to last month's disturbances. Complex problems require carefully considered solutions, not soundbites."Liberal Democrats will continue to push for effective evidence-based policies to cut crime and boost rehabilitation. That means tough sentences for serious crimes and tough community sentences for low level offenders."The motion was passed almost unanimously and now becomes party policy – although not coalition policy.
