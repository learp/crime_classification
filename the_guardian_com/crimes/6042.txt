Victims were put at the heart of this year's Queen's speech, as the government unveiled a legislative programme dominated by tough new measures to tackle terrorism and crime.Six Home Office bills were among a raft of new and draft laws being prepared by ministers.Tony Blair also used his last Queen's speech to bring forward legislation on the environment, public services and pensions.Setting out a programme designed to put the rights of vulnerable people at the heart of the law and order system, the government announced a new criminal justice bill. It aims to bolster the powers of the police and probation services to protect the public from violent offenders and antisocial louts.The bill will include measures promised by the home secretary, John Reid, in July to raise the maximum penalty for carrying a knife from two years' imprisonment to four.There are also measures to improve the way offenders are managed; to give law enforcement agencies new powers to combat serious and organised crime and to provide the immigration service with further powers to police the country's borders.Other Home Office legislation aims to provide for trials without a jury in serious fraud cases, and to reform the tribunal service.Older and disabled people will be able to travel free on buses anywhere in England at off-peak times from April 2008 under legislation announced by the Queen today.The child support bill will finally bring down the curtain on the troubled Child Support Agency, which will be replaced with a new, smaller body intended to provide a simpler and more effective way of collecting child maintenance.It will end the requirement that all lone parents with care responsibilities who claim state benefits - mostly mothers - must also submit a claim to receive child maintenance.The government will press ahead with controversial reforms of incapacity benefit tabled in the last parliament. The changes, replacing the old benefit with a tougher Employment and Support Allowance regime, are included in the welfare reform bill, which was introduced into the Commons in July this year and carried over to the new session when it failed to reach the statute book before the end of the parliamentary year.The bill, which applies to the whole of the UK, also introduces changes to housing benefit designed to combat fraud by giving local authorities greater powers to investigate and prosecute.It will also give tenants greater choice and responsibility by making housing benefit payments directly to them rather than to their landlords.The much trailed climate change bill was finally unveiled today, putting the government's long-term goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2050 into statute, along with "appropriate interim targets".It will establish an independent body - the Carbon Committee - to work with the government to reduce emissions over time and across the economy; create enabling powers to put in place new emission-reduction measures and set out improved monitoring and reporting arrangements, including how the government reports to parliament.A national road pricing scheme, with drivers having to pay to use certain routes, moved a step closer today with the announcement of a draft road traffic bill.The bill will look at the scope for developing a national scheme for road pricing and will be published next year.There will be more powers for the mayor of London and local councils in two new bills announced today. The local government bill aims to reduce the amount of "top-down" control from Westminster, and strengthen leadership systems within councils, while the Greater London Authority bill aims to bolster the mayor's leadership in order to "meet future challenges" faced by the capital.
