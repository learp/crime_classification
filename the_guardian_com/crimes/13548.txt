A former nightclub bouncer and binman will appear before magistrates today charged with murdering four people whose bodies were found in North Yorkshire 12 days ago.Mark Richard Hobson, 34, is accused of killing twins Claire and Diane Sanderson, 27, and James Britton, 80, and his 82-year-old wife Joan. The twins' bodies were found at a flat in the village of Camblesforth, near Selby, early on Sunday July 18. Three hours later the bodies of Mr Britton, a retired railway surveyor, and Mrs Britton were discovered by a neighbour at their home in the village of Strensall, near York. Mr Hobson, a divorced father of one, of Camblesforth, will appear before magistrates in Harrogate, where he has been questioned by North Yorkshire police since his arrest on Sunday. The inquiry has been one of the biggest investigations ever mounted by the force. Mr Hobson was arrested by detectives investigating the two double murders, which happened within 25 miles of each other. He was arrested after a week-long manhunt when he went to a petrol station to buy matches. The shopkeeper recognised him and called police.
