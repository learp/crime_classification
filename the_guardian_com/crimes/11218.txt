One of the most senior detectives in the Soham murder hunt took the stand today during Ian Huntley's trial at the Old Bailey.Detective Chief Inspector Andy Hebb spoke with the Soham Village College caretaker at a public meeting on August 15 last year, 11 days after schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman disappeared.The court heard yesterday that the police had left a message on Jessica's mobile phone urging any potential abductor to get in contact, and that Mr Huntley had asked an officer at the meeting how someone would access such a message.That officer introduced Mr Huntley to DCI Hebb. "Mr Huntley asked me how an abductor would be able to get at the message from the police if the phone's battery was dead and, then after a slight pause, he said 'or if it had been thrown away'," DCI Hebb told the court."I said the perpetrator or perpetrators would need to contact the public hotline that had been set up in this inquiry or contact the police in the normal way."Mr Huntley, 29, denies murdering the friends but has admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice.His ex-girlfriend Maxine Carr, 26, a former classroom assistant at the girls' primary school, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two charges of assisting an offender.DCI Hebb said Ms Carr was standing behind Mr Huntley throughout the conversation and added: "As Mr Huntley turned to move away, Maxine Carr came to me and shook my hand and thanked me."Stephen Coward QC, for the defence, suggested that Mr Huntley had asked him a "basic question" that anyone might have asked.The officer agreed, adding: "But nobody did, sir."The next witness to be called was Rebecca Hoggarth, a researcher for Granada TV in Manchester, who spoke to Mr Huntley at his home on August 8.She said she had visited the house with her colleague Samantha Rix, and that both Mr Huntley and Ms Carr were present to ask about the events of Sunday August 4 when the girls had gone missing."He said that he was stood on his doorstep of his house. As I remember, I think he said about 6.15pm. He said he was brushing down the dog because it was dirty and they had been for a walk."She said Mr Huntley told her that the girls stopped to speak to him briefly and had asked about Ms Carr. He said he had responded that she was not doing too well because she had not got the job at the school she wanted.Ms Hoggarth said Ms Carr told her that the girls looked up to her and thought she was "cool", saying that Holly was in tears at the end of term and had given her a card when she had not got the job.She said both Mr Huntley and Ms Carr had said they wished Ms Carr had not been in the bath when the girls called round, as she would have spoken to them for longer.Earlier, trial judge Mr Justice Moses told the jury that the court would not sit tomorrow.He said the case was making good progress through the evidence that needed to be heard but said the lawyers needed a day to discuss its future progress.The trial continues.
