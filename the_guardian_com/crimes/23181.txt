Coming up soon is a date for your diary if you want to hear more about the undercover infiltration of political groups.I am due to speak about our book, Undercover - the true story of Britain's secret police, on Saturday May 10 at the London Radical Bookfair. Entrance is free, and the talk is scheduled to start at 2pm.The fair "will be showcasing the depth and breadth of radical publishing in the UK", according to the organisers.They say there will be lots of stalls where you can browse and buy books. They bill it as "a unique gathering of progressive readers, thinkers and doers, in a celebration of radical publishing and politics".As it happens, our book Undercover has been nominated for a prize, the Bread and Roses Award for Radical Publishing. Paul and I would like to thank the organisers of the award for recognising the book and putting it on the shortlist.There is more background on the award here; it was set up, say the organisers, "to recognise and celebrate excellence in the field of radical political non-fiction."The winner will be announced in the afternoon at the fair. Authors from the shortlist will be speaking at the fair.This is the shortlist for the prize (for citations, see here):* Joe Glenton, Soldier Box: Why I Won't Return to the War on Terror;*  Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, Story of a Death Foretold: The Coup against Salvador Allende, 11 September 1973;* Barry and Saville Kushner, Who Needs the Cuts?: Myths of the Economic Crisis;* Katharine Quarmby, No Place to Call Home: Inside the Real Lives of Gypsies and Travellers:* Andrew Simms, Cancel the Apocalypse: The New Path to Prosperity;* Imogen Tyler, Revolting Subjects: Social Abjection and Resistance in Neoliberal Britain.The fair and the award are organised by the Alliance of Radical Booksellers (ARB), which says it was "formed in 2011 to raise awareness of the radical booktrade".
