  Anthony Hardy, the Camden Ripper. Photograph: PAThe man known as the Camden Ripper should never be released from prison, a high court judge said today.Anthony Hardy was given three life sentences in November 2003 for killing women to "satisfy his depraved and perverted needs".The case returned to court today after changes were made to the law on setting the minimum period a person sentenced to life in prison must serve before being considered for parole.Mr Justice Keith, sitting in London, said: "I have decided that Hardy should never be released from prison. This is one of those exceptionally rare cases in which life should mean life."The judge, who presided over Hardy's trial, then made a "whole life" order.Now 58, Hardy was released from a psychiatric hospital just weeks before he dismembered two of his victims, leaving their body parts in bin bags near his home in Camden, north London.Nine months earlier, officers had discovered the body of a woman in his flat, but her death had been put down to natural causes.Hardy pleaded guilty at his Old Bailey trial in 2003 to murdering Sally White, 31, Elizabeth Valad, 29, and Brigette MacClennan, 34. He had denied their murders but changed his plea within minutes of appearing in the dock.Giving him three life sentences, Keith told him: "Only you know for sure how your victims met their deaths but the unspeakable indignities to which you subjected the bodies of your last two victims in order to satisfy your depraved and perverted needs are in no doubt."No minimum-term tariff was set at the time because changes being made to the law following a European court ruling meant that the home secretary – at that time, David Blunkett – could no longer decide them.Hardy's case joined a list of about 700 that had to go back to court for judges – preferably the trial judges – to set the tariffs.Today Keith echoed the remarks he made when sentencing as he ruled that Hardy must never be released.He said: "The fact is Hardy killed, and killed again, his last two victims at a time when he must have thought that he had got away with the murder of his first."These were truly horrific crimes, made even worse by the indignities to which he subjected the bodies of his last two victims after their death."
