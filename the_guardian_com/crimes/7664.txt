People who kill their partners after years of abuse would be able to use a new defence that they had acted in response to extreme "words and conduct", under government plans to change the law on murder.The proposals from the Ministry of Justice, unveiled today, would also provide a defence for women in domestic violence cases who kill their partners in premeditated attacks. They would be able to rely on a defence of "fear of serious violence" but would not have to show they acted spontaneously. The reforms, triggered by concerns about the different treatment of men and women in cases of domestic violence, would mean the abolition of the 17th century defence of provocation and a more precise medical definition of diminished responsibility. At the centre of the reforms is tackling gender inequality: the view that it is too easy for men to say they killed female partners because of infidelity, or the ending of a relationship, while women with abusive partners find it hard to mount a similar partial defence.Harriet Harman, minister for women, today said: "For centuries the law has allowed men to escape a murder charge in domestic homicide cases by blaming the victim. Ending the provocation defence in cases of "infidelity" is an important law change and will end the culture of excuses. "There is no excuse for domestic violence, let alone taking a life. Whatever happens in a relationship does not justify resorting to violence. So men who kill their wife will have to face a murder charge and will no longer be able to claim 'it's her fault, she provoked me.'"Changing the law will end the injustice of women being killed by their husband and then being blamed. It will end the injustice of the perpetrators making excuses saying it's not my fault - it's hers." Men and women who suffered a "slow burn" of domestic violence over a period of time could also use one of the partial defences under the proposals, overturning the law which requires them to have acted on the spur of the moment. There are concerns, however, that the proposals may allow courts to "go soft" on murder. Nick Herbert, the shadow justice secretary, said: "While we welcome some of these proposals, such as sexual infidelity on the part of the victim no longer constituting grounds for reducing murder to manslaughter, we remain concerned about many elements. "No one should underestimate the impact of domestic violence, but the government's proposed new partial 'slow burn' defence would represent a significant shift in the law. We will study the proposals carefully, but are concerned that no changes should appear to diminish the seriousness of murder, which rightly carries a mandatory life sentence." But Maria Eagle, the justice minister, said the slow burn defence would still have a high threshold. "This is a substantial change," she said. "But we would not want to introduce anything that would allow cold, calculating killers to get away with it."The recognition of the devastating effects of long-term domestic abuse was demonstrated by the case of Kiranjit Ahluwalia, whose conviction for killing her husband was overturned on appeal in 1992. After abuse including having a hot iron held to her face, she attacked him in his sleep by pouring petrol on his feet and setting them alight, but he died and she was charged with murder.Her appeal set a historic precedent - that women who kill as a result of severe domestic violence should not be treated as cold-blooded murderers. Ahluwalia's story showed they could still have a defence, even if they did not kill in response to an immediate act of violence.Today's plans to update Britain's murder laws, which have not been changed since 1957, have been met with approval by members of the legal profession. Ian Kelcey, chair of the Law Society Criminal Law Committee, said: "This review has long been needed, particularly with regard to the provocation defence in domestic abuse cases. "At the moment there is an unhelpful mishmash of statute and common law, so the government's desire to tidy up the lack of clarity that exists around these kind of offences and defences is to be welcomed."But some leading barristers think there are serious flaws in the government's plans. Geoffrey Robertson QC said: "This consultation paper is a grave disappointment to those who want a rational reform for the law of murder. That will only be achieved by abolishing the mandatory life sentence which judges are forced by parliament to impose on crimes of very different degrees of seriousness – from terrorist killings and gangland executions at one extreme to mercy killings at the other. "Overall, the effect of these changes will be to keep people who have killed through loss of temper or self-control in prison for longer than necessary. That is hardly a reform."Under the reforms, the new partial defences would be  Killing in response to a fear of serious violence Killing in response to words and conduct which caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged.The new concept of the "words and conduct" defence could apply, for example, when a rape victim killed his or her attacker after being taunted about what happened. The partial defence could also be used when a mother kills a man after catching him trying to rape her daughter, said a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman. It could also similarly apply when neighbours have been involved in a long-running dispute, leading to one of them killing the other, although the spokeswoman said this would be a "very exceptional" case.The proposals – which have taken more than four years to draw up after two reports from the Law Commission – do not take forward the idea of a US-style scale of first and second murder, which was recommended in the commission's second report in 2006. The Liberal Democrats were also disappointed by this decision to ignore the Law Commission's recommendations, and also accused the government of exaggerating the current use of sexual jealousy as a defence. David Howarth, the Lib Dem justice spokesman, said: "On domestic violence, ministers are guilty of hype. As the government's own research shows, there are no recent examples of men being found not guilty of murder simply because of sexual infidelity."
