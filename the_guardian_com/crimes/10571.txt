A large stone was thrown from a bridge over a motorway into oncoming traffic just days after the husband of a woman seriously injured when a concrete block was thrown onto their car warned of copycat attacks.Gloucestershire police said they are sending a "strong message" out to the person who threw the stone from a bridge on the M5 between junction 12 and 11a.The incident happened at around 2.55am on Saturday as a car travelled northbound.When the car reached the Upton Lane bridge the driver saw a man and as they drove under the bridge a large stone hit the windscreen, causing it to crack.The driver and passenger were "thankfully" not injured, the police said.On Thursday, Steve Manley described how his wife was "covered in blood" after a bucket-sized piece of concrete was dropped on to their vehicle from a bridge on the A12 in Essex on 1 December.Carol Manley, 57, was left with fractures to her face and ribs, and internal injuries.The couple were hit 40 minutes after mother-of-two Lisa Horne, 26, escaped unharmed when a rock the size of a football smashed on to her windscreen from a bridge on the same road.Steve Manley warned that the two attacks – which are both being treated as attempted murder – could prompt a "craze of stupidity".Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, he said: "This could happen again because of some thoughtless people or person that thinks it's fun to throw pieces of concrete at innocent people and try to kill them so they can watch blue lights come flying down the road."Gloucestershire police described the man seen on the M5 as having grey hair, and wearing a red and white coat.Inspector Jason Keates, traffic management and road safety inspector for Gloucestershire, said: "We cannot stress enough how dangerous this despicable and reckless behaviour is."We'd like to urge this offender to think about the devastating consequences his actions could have on both himself and those in the car."We would also warn anyone involved in such behaviour that their actions could not only result in serious damage to vehicles but also serious injury and even death. If that were to happen the culprit could even be charged with murder."
