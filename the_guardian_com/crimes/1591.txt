The boyfriend of a student kicked to death for being a goth is to unveil an exhibition of his paintings to help raise awareness and cash for her foundation.Sophie Lancaster, 20, was repeatedly stamped on and kicked in the head by two youths in August 2007 as she cradled her boyfriend, fellow goth Robert Maltby, who was also assaulted in the incident at a park in Bacup, Lancashire.Maltby has made a partial recovery and will next week launch his collection of 15 canvases named Crimson Iris: The Art of Sophie.Proceeds raised from the paintings, which are on sale for between £350 and £1,000, will go towards the Sophie (Stamp Out Prejudice Hatred and Intolerance Everywhere) Lancaster Foundation.Malby explained how his paintings were designed to evoke feelings of hope, faith and anger, and were inspired partly by Sophie."The collection is a riddle, whereby each one makes individual sense but it is only when they are all together that the story is in some way visible," he said.The paintings, sponsored by Fender's metal guitar brand, Jackson, go on show at Manchester shopping arcade Afflecks Palace from 7 June until the end of the month. Helen Varley, marketing manager of Fender Musical Instruments, said: "Saturday August 11 2007 is a date I remember, sadly due to the vicious assault on two young adults, Robert Maltby and Sophie Lancaster, not because of what they said or did, but simply because of the way they looked."This tragic story shocks me now as much as it did back in 2007, and by supporting Robert's art exhibition, Fender strives to help to change peoples attitudes towards subcultures and raise awareness of the Sophie Lancaster Foundation."Tony Martin, general manager at Afflecks, which has granted free exhibition and sales space, said: "Afflecks has always attracted a melting pot of cultures. It's a hub of diversity where people have always felt comfortable meeting without fear of prejudice."We work hard to maintain Afflecks as a 'haven', where people from all walks of life can come and simply be themselves, so it felt only natural to offer the Sophie Lancaster Foundation the exhibition space for this collection. We welcome anyone who expresses themselves, be it through their appearance or their art."Last November, Lancaster's mother, Sylvia, launched an animated film which re-enacted the brutal assault on her daughter.The film, Sophie: A Dark Angel, was commissioned by make-up brand Ilamasqua which has supported the foundation through the sales of special Sophie black eye pencils and the charity's wristbands. The short film was shown internationally on music channels MTV1 and MTV2.Mrs Lancaster hopes to raise £500,000 to help educate young people about tolerance through interactive workshops in schools.The foundation is working with behavioural experts Huthwaite International to devise the programme which will initially be aimed at the 14 to 16-year-old age group, before it is mapped out to primary schools.Two youths, aged 15 and 16, were sentenced to life imprisonment at Preston crown court in April 2008 for Lancaster's murder. Three other teenage boys were also jailed for the assault on Maltby.
