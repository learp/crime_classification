Portugese police tonight searched a villa close to the apartment where the four-year-old British girl Madeleine McCann went missing, presumed kidnapped, 11 days ago.The house, just 150 yards from the Praia da Luz holiday complex, was sealed off by police while men in white suits and masks began a search inside.Earlier today, the father of Madeleine McCann said the family believed their daughter was safe and being looked after.Gerry McCann said that until there was "concrete evidence to the contrary" the family would not give up hope for their daughter.His wife, Kate, said they could not consider returning home at the moment.In a statement to the press, Mr McCann said the family had brought lawyers to the southern Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz to advise on how to deal with the offers of financial help, which total Â£2.6m."We have visibly felt a burden lifted off our shoulders since lawyers arrived here because it is one less thing that we now have to immediately think about. This has allowed us to concentrate more on own physical and mental wellbeing."We do need to spend more time at this point considering ourselves, our family, for Sean and Amelie [Madeleine's twin brother and sister], and contemplate this situation that we are in."He said the family had taken "tremendous strength from the warmth and spiritual outpouring" about their plight that had been received from people in Portugal and around the world."That has given us great encouragement and hope that we will bring back Madeleine safely." He said the family was "fully supporting" the police investigation into their daughter's disappearance and believed it was "essential" to keep a high media profile.Trauma consultants had helped the family look forward and channel negative thoughts about what might have happened, he said.Madeleine is thought to have been taken from her bed while her parents ate dinner in a restaurant next door.Mrs McCann returned to church yesterday morning in Praia da Luz to pray again for the return of her daughter.Prayers for Madeleine, who turned four on Saturday, were echoed across Portugal, including at the country's holiest shrine in Fatima, where hundreds of thousands of people gathered to mark the 90th anniversary of the moment when three young children had a vision of the Virgin Mary.An English priest yesterday became the latest in a team of people who have flown out to support the McCann family. Father Paul Seddon, the priest who married the McCanns and baptised Madeleine, joined Mrs McCann at mass.Portugal's president, Anibal Cavaco Silva, defended the police investigation."It would be difficult for them to do more than they have done so far," he said.But the family of a Portuguese child who disappeared nine years ago said the country's record for searching for the missing was not good.For Filomena Texeira, whose 11-year-old son Rui Pedro is still missing, the contrast between the resources being poured into looking for Madeleine and those used in the hunt for her own child could not be more stark. She said that just half a dozen officers were allocated to look for her son.
