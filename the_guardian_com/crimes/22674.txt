Police hunting a serial rapist were yesterday given a further 36 hours to continue questioning a married railway worker.Detectives in Kent have until late tonight night to interview Antoni Imiela, 48, on 10 sex attacks on young girls and women in the past year. He was arrested during a police operation on the M20 motorway at 11.30pm on Monday night. A road block had been set up at junction five as part of an investigation into nine rapes and one attempted rape since November last year. As Imiela, who has a son and stepdaughter, was being interviewed by detectives, a police forensic team examined his semi-detached house in the village of Appledore, near Ashford. A Kent police spokeswoman said: "A 48-year-old man remains in custody and is being questioned. There are no further developments at this stage." The attacker has been called the "trophy rapist" because he has often kept an item of clothing from his victims, aged from 10 to 52. He has attacked in London, Kent, Berkshire, Surrey, and Hertfordshire, causing the police to launch Operation Orb, the biggest manhunt since the Yorkshire Ripper. Â· Press Association
