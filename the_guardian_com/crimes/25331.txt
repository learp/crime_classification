Britain's most senior police officers are calling for men who stalk or harass women to be jailed automatically if they ignore court orders in an attempt to prevent tragedies such as last week's murder of a shop assistant in Harvey Nichols.The Association of Chief Police Officers says stalkers should not be given a second chance of freedom if they flout bail conditions or injunctions and that the safety of the female victims of persecution must be paramount.The police demand follows the shooting dead of Clare Bernal, a 22-year-old shop assistant at Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge, who was gunned down in the store on Tuesday by her former boyfriend, Michael Pech.Pech, who then shot himself, had appeared in court twice on charges of harassing Miss Bernal, which he admitted, but had been released on bail despite repeatedly ignoring court orders banning him from approaching her or going to the areas in which she lived and worked.Jim Gamble, the deputy director-general of the National Crime Squad and the spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on stalking, harassment and domestic violence, said: 'In order that we deter people from committing these types of offences, from continuing to harass people to the extent where their quality of life is undermined, we have to have deterrents with teeth.'We have to say if you are in breach of an injunction - and I don't care how small that breach is - that needs to be reflected with some kind of custody, so that the perpetrators understand that it isn't about getting a slap on the wrist, it isn't about getting a final, final warning - it's about an actual consequence each and every time you breach that order. We need to send out a message.'Gamble said that, as well as safeguarding victims, jailing those who flouted bail or other court orders would provide time for offenders to be given a psychological assessment that would make it easier to police them if and when they were released.Gamble said that the Association of Chief Police Officers was already in the process of distributing new guidance to forces across the country on how to deal with cases of harassment and stalking. This included recommendations on how to deal with complaints, how to conduct risk assessments and how best to ensure the safety of the victim. The guidelines also include advice on how to monitor and deter offenders and recommendations on how to gather the most clear-cut evidence and present it to the courts.Meetings with other agencies of the state, including the social services, probation and Crown Prosecution Service, will be held over the coming months to ensure that a similarly strong emphasis on tackling stalking and harassment will be implemented elsewhere.Gamble said that he was concerned that many members of the public, including some of the victims, appeared not to consider harassment to be a crime, but he emphasised that the police were determined to do more to protect women.
