The evidence linking Barry George to the murder of the TV presenter Jill Dando could not be dismissed as "unhappy coincidence", a court heard today.In his closing arguments, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, admitted that the case was not straightforward but said that the prosecution did "not lack any confidence" that George shot the Crimewatch presenter through the head.Dando was killed on the doorstep of her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999. George, 48, denies murder.Laidlaw said there was no DNA evidence and "no obvious candidate for this killing, nobody with anything approaching a rational motive to kill this woman".But he said "things began to fall into place" nearly a year after the murder when George was first asked to provide a statement.A picture of George's movements was built up and a search of his home disclosed an interest in the military and guns, the court heard."The police found that he was a man obsessed or fascinated by celebrities and was particularly interested in female presenters and newscasters," said Laidlaw.George was "evasive" in police interviews, and lied that he had never heard of Jill Dando, the prosecutor told the court."As the inquiry developed, as the picture built, you 12 [jurors] all now understand why it is the prosecution say, and they maintain, that this man in court, Barry George, and no other, murdered Jill Dando," said Laidlaw."When you put the evidence together, when you look collectively at the component parts of it, each arising independently, then all this cannot possibly be explained merely by unhappy coincidence."Laidlaw said the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann was possibly the only case to have received more press attention than Dando's murder.He said identifying the culprit had been "demanding and exacting," with investigators having to fend off the distractions of "countless theories" about what had happened."That is not to say that we lack any confidence in this case or the assertion we make against this defendant that he is Miss Dando's assailant," said Laidlaw."We do not lack any confidence in that assertion."The trial continues.
