Bella Prowse said Edward Erin's actions had "shaken her faith in human nature" in a victim impact statement that was read to the court. Paul Raudnitz, prosecuting, said: "Bella Prowse refers to the enormous and devastating impact on her life in many ways. She feels she has come close to a nervous breakdown through the pregnancy due to Dr Erin's behaviour, due to the concerns over the health of her baby and her own health."The statement was taken in December last year, well before the case came to court for trial. Prowse said the incident had left her feeling unsafe to stay at home. "She was concerned at what she describes as emotional blackmail inflicted on her by Dr Erin and describes feeling unsafe to remain at home in the weeks following discovering she was pregnant," Raudnitz said."She refers to the shock at realising what Dr Erin had done and the potentially damaging effect on the baby being the worst part of the ordeal. She says she had concerns that her son would have health or developmental problems." Prowse said she suffered sleepless nights worrying about the situation and felt isolated and saddened during her pregnancy, particularly at work among Erin's former colleagues."She felt shocked that someone could think they had the right to do this to her, let alone someone she had loved and someone she believed she was in a monogamous relationship with," Raudnitz said. "Finding out Dr Erin was married with children was an additional upset and she says it illustrates how accomplished a liar he was. The whole experience has shaken her faith in human nature."Prowse said she feared that one day she would have to tell her son why she no longer sees his father. "It may be inevitable that her son knows the truth at some point in his life," said Raudnitz, as he summarised the statement before the court.
