Two men are going on trial charged with the murder of Stephen Lawrence at a London bus stop in 1993.Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, will face a jury in a trial at the Old Bailey that will be attended by Stephen's parents, Doreen and Neville Lawrence.The murder of Stephen Lawrence in Eltham, south-east London, is one of the most high-profile unsolved murders in Britain.The 18-year-old was a talented student who dreamt of being an architect. As he and a friend, Duwayne Brooks, waited for a bus on 22 April 1993, they were attacked by a gang of youths who shouted abuse before fatally stabbing Stephen.Before the jury can start hearing the evidence, they must be selected from a panel of potential candidates. Defence and prosecution lawyers may also want to make submissions to the judge without the jury being present.The trial, which starts on Monday, is scheduled to last until mid-December, though arrangements have been made in case it runs into the new year.Dobson and Norris have denied involvement in the murder, which took place when they were teenagers. The case will be heard before Mr Justice Treacy.
