News that we may be about to convert space in our supermarkets into temporary jails came hard on the heels of a motion before the House was that "youth is wasted on the young".A fairly standard debating question you might think, although the "House" in question was HMP Grendon - the only prison in Europe that operates as a therapeutic community, and the debate that was taking place was between the prisoners and a group of final-year undergraduates from my own university, UCE in Birmingham.The debate - which for the last eight years the prisoners have always won - is actually a device to get the two groups to talk to each other, and avoid the "zoo watching" that usually takes place when outsiders visit a jail.Having a debate gave the day a structure but also created a common purpose. It was a manufactured way to allow both the prisoners and the students to discuss issues with each other before and after the debate, and through those discussions help the students to understand what life-sentenced prisoners were actually like - up close, and in the flesh.And what did they discover? Here were some typical comments:• "It was a real eye opener for me - I had a very serious conversation with two prisoners who were in for murder."• "It helped me see through the stereotypical way that prisoners get described."• "One man reminded me of my brother - he could easily have been the person that I was talking to."• "I'm ashamed to admit, I was expecting monsters."The debate at HMP Grendon - which houses prisoners who have been described as "damaged, dangerous and disturbed", with high levels of psychopathy and who have usually been sentenced for crimes of violence, had come only two days after I had spoken to the Howard League for Penal Reform student society at Bristol University. Around 100 students attended, and led by a third-year historian called Duncan Bucknill, they have in the last two years established mentoring schemes with the local youth offending team, launched a very successful lecture series and even have plans to design their own Howard League "hoodies".All of this was music to my ears. As someone who has been involved with penal reform for most of my life I can assure you that it is usually a rather sad and forlorn business.I can think of only a few bright spots in the recent past when I felt that there was a real opportunity for change - such as the early 1990s when the prison population dropped to around 40,000 - but through these two different experiences at different universities I thought something seemed to be genuinely going on here: young people giving up their time to organise a mentoring scheme, and my own students completely transformed by visiting a jail. Are there perhaps lessons that can be applied more generally?It does seem relevant that those people who have had a direct experience of prison are usually at the forefront of wanting to change prison. Think of Nelson Mandela, Vaclav Havel, and of course Winston Churchill, who had been a prisoner of war during the Boer War.The student debaters benefited from the direct experience of going inside and finding a remarkable absence of monsters. This seems to me important, for when these students graduate they will become police or prison officers, join the civil service, or simply go on to have interesting lives in other careers, get married and have children. But they'll remember that debate, and the fact that the prisoners that they found could have been "their brother".Perhaps the lesson should be that no magistrate, judge or politician should be allowed to send someone to prison, or to advocate building more jails until they too have gone inside and experienced prison for themselves.More generally, it was encouraging to think that the next generation of penal reformers are there waiting in the wings, ready to pick up from the adult generation as we stupidly speed headlong towards hyper-incarceration. I do hope that they don't make the same mistakes that we have done - that that experience hasn't been wasted on the young, although I really would like my students to just once win the annual Grendon debate.
