A convicted sex offender was sentenced to a minimum of 21 years in prison today for raping and murdering Polish student Angelika Kluk and hiding her body in a church.A jury at the high court in Edinburgh took three-and-a-half hours to convict Peter Tobin, 60, of the sexually-motivated killing last year.After the verdict, Ms Kluk's sister Aneta shouted "thank you" to the jury.Judge Lord Menzies told Tobin: "What you did to Angelika Kluk was inhuman ... you are, in my view, an evil man."Ms Kluk, 23, suffered severe head injuries from a piece of wood and 16 stab wounds from a knife. Her bound and gagged body was then dumped beneath the floor of St Patrick's Church in the Anderston area of Glasgow.The student from Skoczow near Krakow had been staying at the chapel house attached to the church and working as a cleaner to help finance her studies in Gdansk.Police found her body - which had terrible injuries - on September 29 under the church's floor, near to the confession box.Ms Kluk knew her killer as Pat McLaughlin, a genial handyman who helped out around the church.In fact Peter Tobin had been jailed for 14 years in 1994 for a savage rape and sexual assault on two 14 and 15 year old girls, a case that the trial judge at the time called "the worst I have ever come across".Tobin had been painting a garden shed in the chapel grounds with Ms Kluk the day before she was reported missing.He had denied the attack on Ms Kluk and claimed she had consented to having sex with him. But the prosecution had argued he was responsible for an attack which it described as an "atrocity".Lord Menzies told the killer he had never come across a "more tragic, more terrible" case. The judge said that after Tobin had beaten, raped and killed his victim he dragged her through the church and dumped her like she was "rubbish"."All this shows utter contempt and disdain for the life of an innocent young woman with her whole life ahead of her," the judge said.After his sentencing, Aneta Kluk said in a statement released by Strathclyde police: "My father and I are relieved that the man responsible for Angelika's death is now likely to spend the rest of his days behind bars. We would both like to thank all of the Scottish public for their support during this horrific time."Tobin was also convicted of perverting the course of justice after giving police officers a false name and address and fleeing shortly after the killing. He was eventually arrested at a hospital in London while seeking treatment for cardiac trouble under a false name after Strathclyde police made a public appeal.Tobin receives an automatic life sentence for murder and his 21-year tariff means that he must serve this amount of time before he can seek parole.During the trial, the jury heard of Ms Kulk's complicated love life.The church's former priest, Father Gerry Nugent claimed that he had a short sexual relationship with Ms Kluk in 2005, and admitted he was an alcoholic. Fr Nugent was sacked by the Archbishop of Glasgow before the trial began.The jury of eight women and seven men also heard from married chauffer Martin Macaskill, 40, with whom Ms Kluk had been conducting a passionate affair of a few weeks when she died; Mr Macaskill's wife Anne had been aware of the relationship and was apparently prepared to tolerate it.Tobin's defence QC Donald Findlay had argued in his closing speech that there was evidence to connect the priest in some way with the woman's death.Mr Findlay said Fr Nugent and trial witness Matthew Spark-Egan seemed to have knowledge about where and how Ms Kluk's body was hidden.Giving evidence, Fr Nugent repeatedly told the court: "I know nothing about her death or the circumstances of her death."The judge reminded the jury that neither Fr Nugent nor Mr Spark-Egan were facing charges at this trial.
