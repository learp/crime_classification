Doctors have been advised they can take blood samples from unconscious drivers to help gather evidence against people police suspect of being under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.The British Medical Association has changed its ethical guidance to members because of the "clear public interest" in investigating the causes of crashes. Samples of blood are usually only taken from people without consent for immediate medical purposes and taking them for other reasons could have previously constituted assault. The Police Reform Act has given new powers for officers to ask police surgeons to take samples for future testing in cases where drivers are unable to give permission. Michael Wilks, chairman of the association's ethics committee, said: "In this case we see a clear public interest in having these samples available for testing so we can establish whether drivers have been drinking or taking drugs. "However, the BMA is extremely concerned that the police have received no guidance or training about how to assess capacity." Samples still cannot be tested until drivers are judged competent to give permission for that to go ahead.
