A third man has appeared in court in Birmingham charged with the murder of three friends who were protecting property from looters in a hit-and-run incident.Adam King, 23, from Kings Norton, spoke only to confirm his name and address during a three-minute hearing before district judge Leslie Mottram at Birmingham crown court.Dressed in a blue jumper and jeans, he was remanded in custody accused of murdering Haroon Jahan, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31 early last Wednesday.Two others already charged with the murders – Joshua Donald, 26 from Ladywood, and a 17-year-old from Edgbaston who cannot be named for legal reasons – also appeared by video link from prison where they are being held on remand.The public gallery was full for the hearing, which saw the three remanded in custody to appear at the same court on 9 December for a plea and case management hearing in advance of a full trial.The funerals of the victims will be held on Thursday in Summerfield Park, where around 2,000 people held a peace vigil at the weekend.Their families have invited anyone to pay their respects before a private family burial at Handsworth cemetery.Nazar Ajaib, a cousin of Haroon Jahan, a garage mechanic, said Jahan would be buried alongside Ali and Musavir who jointly ran a car washing business. He said: "Because they died together, we thought it was fitting they should be buried together. We'd welcome everyone along to the service in Summerfield Park, but then it is a private affair at the cemetery."Magistrates in the Midlands sat over the weekend to hear looting cases, with the first sentences handed out for damage and disorder in West Bromwich.A 16-year-old from the town, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given 20 weeks' detention for throwing a petrol bomb at a police car called to an attack on a store.Another 16-year-old from Smethwick was given four weeks' detention for carrying a wheelbrace hidden under his jacket. Three men aged 17, 18, and 22 have been charged with robbing the Shaftesbury casino in West Bromwich and an 18-year-old charged with stealing from Cash Generators.Sixty-eight people appeared before Birmingham magistrates, who remanded 48 in custody, bailed 15 and sentenced five for theft and disorder.Chief Inspector Sally Seeley of West Midlands police said: "We're working around the clock to make sure anyone who brought violence and burglary to the streets of the West Midlands faces the consequences of their actions."Regional courts have arranged extraordinary hearings to deal with the additional prisoners and we're grateful for their support. Collectively we're taking a strong stance to show the type of disorder that broke out in the first few days of last week won't be tolerated."She added that over 70% of those appearing had been jailed or remanded in custody while others were tagged or on curfews.More than 500 people have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in disorder across the West Midlands, leading to 109 charges. More arrests are expected as analysis of CCTV data and police raids continue.Birmingham magistrates began sitting again at 9.30am on Monday, while a mobile screen tours the area showing images of suspects which have also been posted on West Midlands police's online "wanted gallery".Life returned to a semblance of normality at the weekend when more than 12,000 motor racing fans greeted driver Nigel Mansell, a former special constable, who appeared beside Sir Alex Ferguson after West Brom's match against Manchester United.A parade of vintage cars was organised as Mansell, 58, who was brought up in Birmingham, was added to the local Walk of Stars.He said: "We have a fantastic body of police in Birmingham and this country and they deserve to be credited for their hard work. I hope that in this time of terrible adversity some good will come of this and changes will be made to empower police with laws they need to tackle these thugs."
