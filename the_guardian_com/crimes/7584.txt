Proposals to extend the limit for pre-charge detention to 42 days are "constitutionally illiterate" as well as dangerous, critics warned yesterday, because proper parliamentary scrutiny would confuse the roles of MPs and judges.The former attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, warned that such examination by MPs would be difficult, adding: "I think parliamentary scrutiny is hugely important and one of the great things we have in this country. But it isn't necessarily the right way to deal with individual cases, while they are going on."In an interview with the Guardian, he insisted he had seen no evidence for extending detention and said he would have resigned from office if parliament had approved a 42-day limit.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said this week that the power to extend the detention of terrorism suspects beyond 28 days "should only be used where there is a clear operational need related to a particular operation or investigation and should be supported by strong parliamentary and judicial safeguards".The home secretary would have to notify parliament within two days of granting the 42-day limit, with MPs approving the decision within 30 days. But critics argue the police are unlikely to know they want extra time until they draw near to the 28-day limit - meaning, if the home secretary approves, they could hold a suspect for 42 days before MPs had a chance to vote.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, warned: "This extension can be authorised by the home secretary with or without parliamentary approval. Therefore it is a sham of a safeguard."Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, branded the promise of parliamentary oversight a fraud, adding: "This is not just a dangerous proposal, but constitutionally illiterate. It fails to understand the proper distinction between the legislature and the courts. If you had anything like a real debate approving this in relation to an individual case, the suspect would immediately say this had prejudiced his right to a fair trial. It only works if parliamentary approval is a rubber stamp."A Home Office spokeswoman said: "It is vital we don't prejudice prosecutions, but important that the higher limit is subject to full parliamentary scrutiny."The home secretary's statement would include, for example, the fact that a terrorist investigation was ongoing and had given rise to exceptional operational need, that a higher limit was urgently needed to prevent, control or mitigate terrorism, and that it was compatible with human rights legislation ... MPs do have the right to say 'No, we don't believe this is the case'."Leftwing Labour MP John McDonnell told the GMTV Sunday programme that backbenchers were angry, adding: "What Gordon promised was that we'd arrive at a consensus and most of us thought those discussions were still going on."
