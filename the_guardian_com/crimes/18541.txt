Three UK directors of the engineering firm Alstom were arrested in dawn raids by fraud investigators and police officers today over allegations concerning substantial bribes being paid to secure contracts abroad.In one of the biggest co-ordinated operations by the Serious Fraud Office for several years, the men, all of whom are directors of Alstom subsidiary companies in Britain, were seized from their beds at 5am on suspicion of bribery, corruption, money laundering and false accounting.Simultaneous raids occurred at five Alstom offices – in London, Rugby, Ashby de la Zouch, Derby and Knutsford.More than 100 SFO staff and 40 police officers were involved in the operation, codenamed Ruthenium, which included searches at nine sites.The three men were named as Stephen Burgin, 52, Altan Cledwyn-Davies, 51, and Robert Purcell, 44. They were arrested at their homes in Stafford, Telford and Melton Mowbray, respectively, and taken to local police stations where they were questioned by SFO investigators. All three were on the boards of Alstom UK Holdings Ltd, Alstom Ltd and Alstom Network UK Ltd. The three men were all released without charge last night.A spokesman for the SFO said: "It is suspected that bribes have been paid in order to win contracts overseas, and that this has involved associated money-laundering and other offences."The raids come as the SFO has become more vigorous in its attempts to crack down on corrupt payments by British firms.Richard Alderman, the SFO director, said after today'sraids: "The SFO is committed to tackling corruption. We are working closely with other criminal justice organisations across the world and are taking steps to encourage companies to report any suspicions of corruption, either within their own business or by other companies or individuals."Alstom, a French engineering company, which constructs high-speed trains and power stations, was saved from bankruptcy in 2004 when Nicolas Sarkozy, then France's finance minister, organised a state bailout. The firm is already the subject of investigations by the French and Swiss authorities into allegations of bribery and corruption.The SFO has launched its own investigation into Alstom, although it is working closely with the Swiss.Alstom said: "Local managers are being questioned. Alstom has been investigated by the Swiss justice for more than three years on the motive of alleged bribery issues. Within this frame, Alstom's offices in Switzerland and France have already been searched in the past years. Alstom is co-operating with the British authorities."For years the British government has been criticised for failing to prosecute a single company for the offence of paying bribes to foreign politicians and officials. But in the last six months the SFO has notched up what Alderman regards as three successes.Last September the bridge builders Mabey and Johnson became the first large British company to be convicted of foreign bribery. The firm admitted that it had systemically paid bribes around the world to secure export orders, and it was ordered to pay more than £6.5m in penalties.Corrupt payments to ministers and officials in Ghana, Jamaica, Angola, Madagascar, Mozambique, Iraq and Bangladesh were exposed in court.In February, the arms manufacturer BAE agreed to pay almost £300m in penalties for its wrongdoing. The admission ended years of SFO and US department of justice investigations into alleged kickbacks.Today a high court judge, Mr Justice Collins, refused to allow campaigners from the Campaign Against Arms Trade and the anti-corruption group, Corner House, to challenge the legality of the settlement deal with BAE.The campaigners are considering whether to appeal.Last week, the Cheshire-based chemical company Innospec admitted paying bribes to Indonesian officials in order to boost sales of a chemical that had been banned from general sale in Britain.The multinational company also admitted making corrupt payments to prevent a poisonous product, leaded petrol, from being outlawed in the Asian country.
