A 21-year-old man has been arrested over the murder and serious sexual assault of a two-year-old girl found dead in a pool of her own blood, police said today.The child, named by officers this evening as Casey Leigh Mullen, was found at her home in Gipton, Leeds, on Sunday night. A statement from West Yorkshire police said she had died from "compression of the neck", giving no further details.Two other men, aged 19 and 20, who were initially arrested on suspicion of murder have been released without charge.A Leeds City council spokesman said social services had been briefly involved with the family following an incident in 2005.Neighbours today spoke of their shock over the girl's death. "They were just like any normal happy family," 23-year-old Kieran Jackson, who lives two doors away, said. "We are all shocked."Describing the events of Sunday night, Keith Beaumont, 58, said: "There was a lot of commotion going on, and a lot of shouting."There were lads banging at the window, shouting and carrying on. The police and paramedics came and there was an ambulance. They brought the baby out and she was looking very ill. She was a lovely little girl. She was an angel ... she will be very sadly missed."He said the girl's mother, named locally as 21-year-old Samantha Canham, lived with her partner, the girl and a three-year-old boy.Sarah Pringle, 22, said she found the mother screaming hysterically when she went to investigate a disturbance at the house.She told the Sun she had attempted to resuscitate the child, who was bleeding heavily from her ears and nose, while they waited for an ambulance."[The girl's mother] went upstairs and all of a sudden I heard her screaming: 'She's dead, she's dead. Somebody's killed Casey,'" she said."I ran up to the bedroom and found Casey covered in blood. [The mother] picked her up and cradled her while crying uncontrollably. It was horrible. [She] was too shocked to give her mouth-to-mouth, so I did it while we waited for an ambulance."
