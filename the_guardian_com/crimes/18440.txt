Four men were banned from attending football matches for three years today after pleading guilty to shouting indecent chants at the Portsmouth footballer Sol Campbell during a premiership match against Tottenham Hotspur.Eleven men, including three juveniles aged under 15, appeared at Portsmouth magistrates court to face charges of racist and homophobic chanting.The charges relate to abuse aimed at Campbell during a game against Spurs played at Portsmouth's Fratton Park ground on 28 September last year.Richard Gibbs, 36, of Wokingham, Stuart Turner, 34, of Wellington, , Keith Stevens, 54, of Hailsham, East Sussex, and 28-year-old Oliver Sylvester, of Southampton, all admitted indecent chanting.The offensive chants directed against the former Tottenham player were read out in court, and included the lines: "We won't give a fuck if you are hanging from a tree, You are a Judas cunt with HIV." Other chants included the repetition of the words "gay boy".The court was told that not all of the defendants sang all the chants, but variations of them.The four defendants who pleaded guilty were sentenced to a three-year football banning order, fined £370, ordered to pay £120 in costs and £15 towards a victim surcharge fund.Magistrate Susan Waddle said: "There were families present, very young children. We also heard from witnesses who found the behaviour disgusting and embarrassing."No doubt you are upright members of society, but in there you acted like animals, like a herd. "This was well-rehearsed – everyone was in sync, everyone knew the words – it was not something that just happened on the day."Whether or not Mr Campbell was offended, decent members of the public found this very offensive and so did the bench."Anyone who indulges in this disgusting behaviour will be dealt with very severely by the courts."The trial date for the seven other defendants who have pleaded not guilty to the same offences was set for 13 May.
