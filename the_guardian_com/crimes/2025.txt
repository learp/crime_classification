The father of a seven-year-old girl killed in a head-on collision while riding a quad bike was yesterday charged with manslaughter. Elizabeth Cooke died after a crash with a Range Rover on Boxing Day evening last year near her family home in Blackmore, Essex.She and her brother Jack, 10, had been riding the quad bikes, which they had been given for Christmas, behind another Range Rover driven by their father Gary Cooke, 46. While driving down a country lane, Elizabeth's bike collided with a vehicle driven by a 28-year-old woman and heading in the opposite direction.The seven-year-old suffered multiple injuries and died in hospital. Her brother was unhurt. The woman driver was arrested but was later told she would not face charges.A family friend said at the time: "We were in the car with the children's dad and they [the children] were following us. We'd only gone 200 yards when it happened. I was watching them, keeping an eye on them. They both had lights on their bikes. A car came past and I said to Gary [the father]: 'One of the lights has gone, one of them has come off the bike'."Cooke was arrested in January and bailed to return to a police station yesterday, where he was charged with manslaughter by gross neglect. He was bailed to appear before magistrates in Grays, Essex, on July 31. It is illegal for anyone under 16 to ride a quad bike on a public road.
