A youth worker dubbed the Fulham Strangler was given four life sentences at the Old Bailey yesterday for a series of attacks on women.Lee Kilty struck three times over a seven-week period between April and June last year. All his victims were in their 20s and his motive was sexual in each case.Kilty, 21, from Fulham, west London, was told by Judge Gerald Gordon that no other sentence could be passed because of the "need to protect women from serious harm from you".Kilty's first victim was close to death after he strangled her, stripped her, threw her down steps and slammed her head against concrete.He ran off leaving her suffering a brain haemorrhage, restricted sight, severe bruising, cuts and a swollen throat, Michael Worsley, QC, told the court.Kilty admitted attempting to murder and attempting to rape the 26-year-old on April 18.He also admitted attempting to strangle a 29-year-old on June 1 and a 21-year-old six days later with intent to commit a sexual offence.Each woman was on foot when she was seized by the neck from behind and throttled.Kilty was arrested after a witness to the third attack identified him to the police.He had no previous convictions and worked with disabled children in Notting Hill, west London.
