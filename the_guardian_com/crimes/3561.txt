A man accused of killing a family of three in an arson attack has denied lying to police to hide his motive for murder.Carl Mills, 28, came under concerted cross-examination on Monday, as his defence in the triple murder trial came to an end.Homeless alcoholic Mills allegedly set the blaze which killed his teenage partner and his new-born daughter.Grandmother Kim Buckley, 46, her daughter Kayleigh, 17, and six-month-old granddaughter Kimberley all died in the blaze.Mills has been depicted as a chronically jealous and controlling older man who groomed the teenager for sex.He met Kayleigh on Facebook in 2010 when she was 15 and within months moved from Manchester to Cwmbran, South Wales, where she lived.She became pregnant with twins in late 2011 and gave birth to Kimberley prematurely in March last year. The other twin, Angel, was stillborn.Kimberley, born deaf, blind and with lung problems, had been allowed home for the first time on the night of the fire. Mills was by then living in a tent in the front garden of Kayleigh's home having been banned from seeing the baby unsupervised.Jealous and convinced she was having an affair he sent her "a barrage of abusive texts" threatening to burn the house down, the jury has heard. Mills is on trial at Newport crown court, where he denies three counts of murder. Gregory Bull QC, prosecuting, accused Mills of lying to the police in the hours after his arrest.Mills told police he met Kayleigh on the night of the fire and the couple kissed and cuddled and spoke of being in love. He claimed he was happy the baby had been allowed home and spoke of texting Kayleigh that night.Bull accused him of repeatedly lying to the police after Mills admitted speaking with Kayleigh for just "two seconds" on the night of the fire."You were trying to give the police a wholly misleading picture of what was happening on this Monday night. But the texts show the real view of what was happening," Bull said."You were trying to make the police believe that you were being supportive. As we know you were being the opposite of that, challenging the paternity of Kimberley."He added: "The truth is you lied and lied and lied again to the police because you wanted to cover up the dreadful thing you had done." Mills denied that claim.The trial was adjourned until Tuesday, when closing arguments are expected to begin.
