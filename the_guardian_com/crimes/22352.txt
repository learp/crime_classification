The government must ensure that violent men are held responsible for the suicides of their partners, the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith will urge today.He will tell MPs that one British woman in nine suffers physical abuse on a regular basis and that 10 victims of violence kill themselves each week - accounting for around a third of female suicides, according to one study.Mr Duncan Smith will ask ministers to introduce a new offence of liability for suicide. The move follows the Crown Prosecution Service's unsuccessful attempt to prosecute an abusive husband for manslaughter, on the grounds that his violence had caused his wife to kill herself.The court heard that Harcharan Dhaliwal had abused his wife Gurjit for well over a decade and even admitted hitting her on the evening she hanged herself last year.The judge said he sympathised with the prosecution, but dismissed the charges because it could not be proved that Mrs Dhaliwal was suffering from a psychiatric condition when she died.Although she had suffered psychological injury, it did not amount to the "bodily harm" required for a manslaughter conviction.The court of appeal upheld the ruling, but added: "It is very hard not to see some connection between the incident of violence which appears to have taken place shortly before, and her death."Mr Duncan Smith will use a 10-minute rule bill to warn that Britain faces a "national epidemic" of domestic violence, costing it around Â£23bn a year, and must take steps to tackle the issue.He will tell the Commons: "Surely the law should recognise that there are some assaults which taken in isolation may not appear life threatening, yet when combined with a pattern of behaviour over a period of time could result directly in the victim taking their own life."Abuse is not just about the physical effect because someone who is regularly attacked then suffers psychological problems and it is that psychological damage which ultimately can be as harmful, if not more harmful than the individual instances of physical abuse."As the law stands, it is extremely difficult to prosecute abusers for their violence when their victim has committed suicide, because the primary witness is dead.Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: "At Refuge we know that psychological abuse is as damaging, if not more damaging in some cases, than physical violence."Suicides following assaults and bullying are sadly an all too common occurrence - and the law should recognise this phenomenon."Refuge believes it ought to be standard practice for police to investigate suicides where domestic violence has also taken place. What we need now is legislation that can hold a person to account for driving someone to suicide."
