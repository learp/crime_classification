Lawyers for the crown prosecution service will give telephone advice to police throughout the night and at weekends under a pilot scheme launched yesterday aimed at bringing more criminals to justice.Thirteen lawyers based at home will advise on evidence and charging outside office hours through a telephone service, CPS Direct. It will come into play where immediate advice is needed on investigation, evidence or charges. The pilot, in Humberside, West Yorkshire, and Southwark and Lambeth in London, will run to the end of this year. It anticipates new charging arrangements in the criminal justice bill which moves the responsibility for charging suspects from police to crown prosecutors. If the pilot is successful, CPS Direct will be extended across the country next year. The attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith, said: "Criminals don't work nine to five. So nor can the criminal justice system. "CPS Direct will give police access to legal expertise, at the end of a telephone, whenever they need it. It means the CPS can ensure vital scene of crime and transitory evidence is gathered, to make cases watertight and help bring more offenders to justice." Under the criminal justice bill, crown prosecutors will be required to decide charges in most cases, so prosecution advice will have to be available to police 24 hours a day. A pilot study found significant increases in conviction rates and in the percentage of defendants pleading guilty at the first hearing, and a drop in cases which had to be discontinued.
