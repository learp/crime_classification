As confessions go, it was probably longer than most. The revelatory path travelled by serial burglar Stuart Campbell took three days and many miles, and encompassed almost 120 households.Campbell was out on a licence from a lengthy prison sentence for burglary when he was caught breaking into another home and sent swiftly back to jail. Perhaps spurred on by an attack of conscience, or in the spirit of "in for a penny in for a pound", Campbell, 29, decided to use the opportunity to own up to his previous crimes.So police officers picked him up from Winchester prison and he took them on a tour of his old haunts. On his first trip - to Portsmouth - he had a lot to confess. In a journey lasting more than 11 hours, Campbell admitted breaking into dozens of homes.Police officers, seeing their unsolved case files dwindling, must have been pleased. But only a few weeks later there was even better news for them when Campbell asked to see his local force again to get even more off his chest.This road trip encompassed Portsmouth and Havant, Hants, where, in all, Campbell confessed to more than 110 burglaries. Amazingly, he carried out all the raids in five months, averaging a little less than one break-in a day.Campbell made off with cash, bank cards, electrical equipment and jewellery. He even stole a pensioner's bus pass, believing it to be a credit card. In all, police estimate he stole at least Â£20,000 worth of other people's belongings.At Portsmouth crown court last week Campbell admitted eight counts of burglary and asked for 118 similar offences to be taken into consideration. He was jailed for five years.
