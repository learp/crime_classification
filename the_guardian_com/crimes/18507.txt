Ninety-eight foreign criminals released from jail after committing serious offences without being considered for deportation remain at large, the home secretary, John Reid, said today.They include nine who were convicted of the "most serious offences" - one of them had committed murder.Fifty-seven serious offenders went on to commit further crimes following their release. Nineteen of the offences involved violence or a "sexual element", Mr Reid said in a Commons written statement."Progress continues to be made in the operation to deal with the released foreign prisoners. The operation is prioritising the serious cases first," he said.It was the disclosure last month that 1,023 foreign offenders had been released without being considered for deportation which led to the sacking of former home secretary Charles Clarke.Mr Reid said that 179 were now classified as having committed "serious offences" including armed robbery.Of those, 35 had been convicted of the "most serious offences" - murder, manslaughter, rape or child sex offences.Of the four who had committed murder, three were "now within our control", Mr Reid said, while 23 of the other most serious offenders were now "within our control or deported".Eight of the 35 had reoffended since release, although none of the crimes involved violence or a sexual element.Of the the other 144 serious offenders, 55 were under the control of the authorities or have been deported - nine after having reoffended and committed a crime involving violence or a sexual element.A further 40 of the other serious offenders have also reoffended since release - 10 in cases involving violence or a sexual element.Of the total 1,023 offenders, consideration for deportation had now begun in 880 cases with an initial decision to deport in 649.In all, 203 offenders were now under the control of the authorities or had already been removed, Mr Reid said.
