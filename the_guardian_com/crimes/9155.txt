A man today admitted sexually abusing young boys at the Haut de la Garenne care home in Jersey during the 1970s.Michael Aubin was due to be the first person to stand trial following a wide-ranging police investigation into historic child abuse on the island.The trial at the royal court in Jersey had been expected to begin today and last all week, but this morning Aubin admitted two counts of gross indecency and two counts of indecent assault on children under 10 years old.The 46-year-old cleaner, who was born in Jersey and lives in St Denys, Southampton, carried out the attacks while he was a resident at the home in the 1970s.He earlier pleaded not guilty to three further counts of indecent assault and they will be dealt with after Aubin is sentenced on 22 June.During the investigation at Haut de la Garenne police amassed a list of 40 suspects after scores of people came forward claiming they were sexually and physically abused at the home.At least two other people have been charged in connection with the investigation.Stephen Baker, prosecuting, told the court that Aubin had been a resident at the home and, when interviewed by police, had said he was also the victim of abuse.When he was older he in turn "dominated" young children, the court heard.Baker said: "The boys did not resist at the time. It may be that, in Aubin's disturbed mind, he mistook the lack of resistance for compliance."It seems plain that this was a very disturbed young man in his teens. Quite what was going through his mind is impossible to tell. Largely what he did was dominate children in an illegal fashion."Baker said the pleas had been accepted after "detailed discussions" with the police and the victims.He said: "The views of each of the complainants has been sought. Each is in agreement with the position the crown is to take."The police investigation into the home made headlines around the world after officers announced last year they had found the "potential remains of a child" buried under the Victorian building.Around Â£1.5m was spent in excavation work but nine months later police said that of the 170 bone fragments found at the site only three could be human.Two dated back to the 15th century; the other to between 1650 and 1950.None of the suspicious items found at Haut de la Garenne, including "shackles" and "restraints" and a bath allegedly stained with blood, indicated murder, police said.The police stressed, however, that they were still taking very seriously allegations of serious sexual abuse at Haut de la Garenne and at other care institutions on the island.Aubin was remanded in custody.
