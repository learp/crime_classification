The former girlfriend of the comedian and television presenter Justin Lee Collins told a court she endured an abusive relationship with him because he was the love of her life.Giving evidence from behind a screen, Anna Larke denied she had made up claims that Collins abused her physically and mentally in the nine months they were together.She told a jury she had not shown her doctor the bruises she suffered because she had not wanted to get 38-year-old Collins into trouble. "I didn't want to do it to Justin. He was the love of my life," she said.St Albans crown court has heard allegations that Collins forced Larke, also 38, to write a "dossier" detailing all her sexual relationships.He allegedly forced her to sleep facing him and would remonstrate with her if he woke up and she had turned away.Collins, of Kew, west London, is accused of carrying out physical assaults on Larke. The comedian denies harassment.On day two of the trial the jury heard that Collins bought Larke gifts including diamond earrings and a digital camera.She said he had bought some of the gifts because he had abused her cat as well as herself. "I think he felt very guilty about that which is why he furnished me gifts," she said.Under cross-examination by Collins' barrister, Sonia Woodley QC, Larke admitted he had given her the password for his email account after she accused him of flirting with women. She also conceded she had bombarded Collins with text messages after the break-up.Larke said she sent both loving and nasty texts to Collins and had checked him on websites and newspapers to see who he was with following the split.In one text to him she said: "I can't imagine anyone but you. I want you and I miss you. I'm driving my family crazy."But she also told the court she had called Collins a "Z-list celebrity" and told him he was "going nowhere" in texts because she wanted to hurt him.Finishing her cross-examination Woodley accused Larke of being a fantasist. Larke, a public relations worker, replied: "I would suggest I am absolutely not."The trial continues.
