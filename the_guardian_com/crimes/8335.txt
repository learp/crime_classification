No one will face charges over donations to the Conservative party in the cash-for-honours investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday.The announcement brings to an end a prolonged inquiry which began last year into the alleged sale of peerages in return for political donations or loans.While most of the attention focused on senior aides to Tony Blair and donors to the Labour party, police also compiled a second file of evidence relating to allegations against the Conservatives.The CPS yesterday refused to name the Conservative donors who came under suspicion.It would only say that the investigation covered "the nomination of a donor as a working peer and an approach made to the Conservative party by a party donor".The statement went on: "In relation to both of these matters the CPS has decided that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction of any individuals for any offence under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 or for any other offence." Police questioned four major Conservative party donors as part of the inquiry, including two peers, Lord Ashcroft, the party's deputy chairman, and Lord Laidlaw, approved as a working peer in 2004.Lord Laidlaw, said to be Scotland's second richest man, was approved by the House of Lords appointments commission in 2004 after he agreed to give up his tax exile and become resident in the UK.After learning that he was still not a UK resident last April the commission said it would no longer vet nominees for the Lords who were not already resident in the country.The other two donors interviewed by police were the IM Group head, Robert Edmiston, and Johan Eliasch, Swedish owner of the sports equipment firm Head. Mr Edmiston's nomination for a peerage had been blocked by the appointments commission.The CPS said it had consulted independent counsel before reaching the decisions, as it did when taking the decision, announced in July, not to prosecute anyone over donations to the Labour party.
