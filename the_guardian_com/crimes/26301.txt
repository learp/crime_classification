A former nightclub bouncer and binman was formally charged yesterday with two double murders in Yorkshire, which led to a massive nationwide manhunt.Mark Richard Hobson, 34 and a divorced father of one, was remanded in custody by Harrogate magistrates to appear at Leeds crown court next Friday. Lightly bearded and wearing khaki cargo trousers and a light blue Kangol T-shirt, he said nothing during the brief hearing but nodded his head when asked to confirm his name, age and address. He was charged first with murdering Claire Sanderson, 27, on or about Sunday July 11, at the flat in the village of Camblesforth, near Selby, where he lives. He was then charged with the murder of her twin sister Diane in Camblesforth on Saturday July 17. The third and fourth charges were of murdering a retired railway surveyor, James Britton, 80, and his wife Joan, 82, at their home in Strensall village, near York, on Sunday July 18. They were found the same day, a few hours after the twins' bodies were discovered. Mr Hobson stood behind a glass screen in the dock of Court No 1 at Harrogate with his head bowed, staring at the floor, occasionally shaking and fidgeting with his hands. He was brought to the town centre building early and taken in through a back entrance. Police were on duty outside, and part of a neighbouring street was cordoned off for a large number of TV satellite vans and other media vehicles. The court was packed for the five-minute hearing, during which two police officers stood on either side of Mr Hobson. A security officer also stood in the dock by the entrance. There was no application for bail from Mr Hobson's solicitor, Keith Hagarty. After the remand, Mr Hobson was led from the court by the two police officers and a police van escorted by patrol cars left the building soon afterwards.
