The number of inmates studying Open University courses is to double to 1,000 as education funding in the prison service is substantially increased.The service's outgoing director general, Martin Narey, also announced yesterday that he wanted prison officers to refer to inmates by their preferred name rather than always by given name and number. "It is a symbolic thing about treating individuals with respect," he told the Guardian. The moves are part of a package which will see education spending on prisons rise by Â£55m of new money over the next three years. Mr Narey is to become the Home Office's commissioner for correctional services, over seeing the prison and probation services, the youth justice board and parole board. In his farewell speech to the prison service conference, at Harrogate yesterday, he said this commitment to decency would be tested when four "struggling" prisons were performance tested this year. If any of these jails failed, they would be taken over by the private sector. All 139 jails in England and Wales are either to go through such tests, or, if they are satisfactory, be "benchmarked". Mr Narey added: "Decency needs to be at the heart of every one of our places, not because it keeps prison in good order and prisoners contented [or] because it cuts reoffending ... but because morally no other option is conceivable."
