Crime maps detailing the number of offences committed in every neighbourhood have been published online by all 43 police forces in England and Wales, the Home Office said today.The colour-coded maps show the levels of burglary, car crime, robbery and other offences, and include charts showing whether crime is rising or falling.The project is part of the government's attempts to "empower" residents and give local communities more influence over police priorities.Individual forces have been compiling their own maps and posting them online since last summer, when the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced the scheme. The Home Office has now put all the maps together to form an overview of crime in England and Wales, which is available through its website.Speaking at the time of the launch, Smith said the maps would increase public confidence and make the streets safer: "By rolling out up-to-date, interactive crime maps, we can better inform people about crime problems in their area and enable them to have much more of a say in what their local police focus on."In West Yorkshire, the categories of crime included on the maps include anti-social behaviour. In some areas, such as London, the maps allow the public to report non-urgent crimes. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, launched the crime map for the capital last August.The release of the maps follows the publication of a Cabinet Office report that suggested people felt "cut off" from the justice system. The government adviser Louise Casey argued that the maps would help make crime-fighting more visible.British police forces have in recent years increasingly used crime mapping and statistics to help make decisions about resource allocation. Some senior police officers have expressed concerns that making crime maps public could give criminals useful intelligence.Simon Reed, the vice-chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said releasing crime data directly to the public could prove counterproductive and might drive up crime in some areas."For many years we have used crime data to assist intelligence-led policing," he said. "Whilst not wishing to restrict what the public can and cannot know, our concern is that statistics released on a monthly basis may feed local criminal intelligence, leading to crime hotspots, and further exacerbate the public's fear of crime. It is essential that any information is fully explained to the public in order to avoid the negative impact of the perception of crime in their area."The police minister, Vernon Coker, said he hoped the maps would help make the police more accountable. He said: "Every single police force in England and Wales now has crime mapping. This gives comprehensive knowledge about crime patterns and hotspots to communities."By empowering people with this information they are able to engage more with their neighbourhood policing teams. I am sure this will lead to an even more responsive and effective police, thoroughly in tune with people's needs. As a result, crime mapping can help ensure people's voices are heard when police set crime-fighting priorities."The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, said the maps were a "feeble imitation" of a Tory policy. The Conservatives would require police to publish local crime statistics every month on their websites, and to hold quarterly meetings in every neighbourhood."Only the Conservatives will truly empower local people, giving them much more information about crime on their streets," he said.Forces in Wales, and those in the east Midlands, joined forces to put their maps together, allowing residents to see crime levels across a wider area.Neil Rhodes, the Lincolnshire deputy chief constable and Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) spokesman on crime mapping, said: "Not only is this an efficient approach, it also means that if you live close to the edge of a police force area, you can look at crime levels in adjoining areas at the click of a button."For many years, all forces have mapped crimes and incidents to help them focus investigations, analyse hotspots and tackle crime vigorously. The information now on the forces' websites has a different, more community-focused perspective and means the public can now look at crime levels in their community simply by putting their postcode into their local police force's website."
