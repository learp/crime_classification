Successive days of social unrest brought out the worst in people, but they brought out some of the best, too. In Peckham, south London, a pound shop that had been looted was covered in multicoloured messages of affection for the area as well as calls for calm and tolerance. A community theatre group, Peckham Shed, started a tribute wall on a boarded-up store window. Messages included: "Don't destroy my beautiful city", "Diversity + jerk chicken" and "Peckham 4Ever London 4Ever".The plight of Sivaharan Kandiah, a Sri Lankan shopkeeper who lost his livelihood when looters ransacked his store in Hackney, sparked an online drive to help him. A website appeal had raised Â£9,767 by Friday afternoon.There was also a campaign to help rebuild Reeves furniture store, in Croydon, a family business which was burned to the ground within hours, and a donations page to do "something nice" for the Malaysian student Ashraf Haziq, who was robbed as he lay bleeding.Perhaps the most widespread positive public engagement has been #riotcleanup on Twitter. Dan Thompson, a Worthing artist, came up with the idea of community-led clean-ups, with thousands of people arming themselves with brooms and rubber gloves to clear the mess caused by the riots in London. A Facebook page led to 100 people in Liverpool rolling up their sleeves in Wavertree and Toxteth. In Birmingham about 80 people gathered at the Bullring shopping centre, while in Manchester hundreds of "riot wombles" gathered after witnessing the devastation of the city centre.
