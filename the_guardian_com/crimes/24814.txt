A dramatic and sustained fall in car crime over the past 15 years has been a major factor in the 45% drop in the overall rate for crime in England and Wales since 1995, the biggest fall since the second world war.The official police-recorded figures for car crime – which include stolen vehicles as well as thefts from cars and vans – have fallen from more than 1.1m a year in 1997 to 456,000 in 2010.In the 1990s car crime accounted for more than 20% of the overall rate of 5m offences a year. But the success of the car manufacturers in improving security has helped reduced that share to 11% of the 4.1m offences recorded by the police in 2010.The reductions, plus those in burglary, another high volume offence, and domestic violence, have proved the key factors in reducing crime to historic lows.Home Office criminologists say that the introduction of home security measures, such as alarms and window locks, and the fact that car manufacturers now fit immobilisers and other security features as standard have been crucial in reducing crime.But some car insurance firms claim the figures have been artificially suppressed by "misallocating" car theft statistics under house burglary, whenever an offender breaks into a home to steal the car keys.There seems to be a consensus that break-ins to steal keys are making up a greater proportion of burglaries – possibly up to 20%.Home Office figures also show that keys were used in 85% of car thefts where the method of theft was known. Of these, 37% came from burglaries and 18% from the owner leaving the keys in the car.But the 18,600 incidents of car-key theft for 2008 compares with a total of 160,000 cars and vans stolen that year – too small a proportion to make that much difference to the overall trend.
