The student acquitted of raping a fellow student while she was drunk and unconscious, on the grounds that "drunken consent is still consent", insisted last night that she was "fully conscious" during sex.Ruairi Dougal "continues to deny emphatically" that he had sexual intercourse without the 21-year-old Aberystwyth University student's knowledge and consent, his solicitor, David James, said in a statement on his behalf. "Ruairi Dougal has always maintained that the complainant did consent to sexual intercourse at all stages and that she was fully conscious when intercourse occurred," he added.The prosecution against Mr Dougal, 20, collapsed on Wednesday at Swansea crown court after the woman admitted under cross-examination that she could not be sure she had not consented because she was too drunk to remember.The prosecuting counsel, Huw Rees, asked the judge, Mr Justice Roderick Evans, to halt the case, arguing that "drunken consent is still consent". The judge directed the jury to deliver a verdict of not guilty "even if you don't agree".The woman had earlier claimed that she was unconscious and could not remember what had happened on the night last May when the incident happened. Mr Dougal, from Co Donegal in the Irish Republic, a stranger to the woman who was working part-time as a university security guard, was asked to take her back to her hall of residence.She later had a flashback of something happening in the corridor outside her room and went to police. Mr Dougal told police he had consensual sex with her there.The Crown Prosecution Service has asked for a report on the judgment, which has raised fears that rapists might now target "binge-drinking" women safe in the knowledge that they would be unlikely to be brought to justice.Around half of all rape cases involve drink - one reason the rape conviction rate is so low. Only one in 20 reported rapes, and about one in five of those prosecuted, results in a conviction.Juries, who have to decide if the case has been proved "beyond reasonable doubt" are loath to rely on the evidence of someone who was drunk at the time of the incident. In response to concerns of women's groups that too many rapists were getting off, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 strengthened the law by defining consent.To consent, a person has to "agree by choice", and must have the freedom and capacity to make the choice. The act also lays down that if the alleged victim was unconscious or asleep, the burden shifts to the accused to produce evidence of consent. The difficult area, according to Sussex University law professor Jennifer Temkin, an expert on sex offences, is where the alleged victim is not so drunk as to be unconscious but too drunk to be able to consent.The need for someone to "agree by choice" meant such a case should still be allowed to go to the jury, insisted Vera Baird, a criminal QC and Labour MP who helped to get the law changed. "It seems to reverse the burden of proof in some strange way, requiring her to show that she didn't say yes," she said.Both students have now left the university. Bec Corn, president of the students union at Aberystwyth, said she feared the case would stop victims from reporting sexual attacks committed on them when they were drunk.The telling statisticsIn a 2002 study of nearly 1,500 cases, alcohol was involved in 51%.In 32% of cases, both victim and offender had been drinking.Only 20% of reported rapes go to trial.According to British Crime Survey, 47,000 women are raped each year.In 2002, only 21% of rapes of adults which were prosecuted led to conviction.Most cases are dropped at the early stages, and this is often because victims refuse to give evidence.The number of victims aged under 20 is growing.
