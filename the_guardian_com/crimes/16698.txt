More than half of all teenage crime gangs have female members, a new study has found. Some are likely to be involved in serious offences, including drug dealing and murder.The survey comes six months after the deaths of Charlene Ellis and Letisha Shakespeare, who were shot at a New Year's party in Birmingham. Letisha, 17, and Charlene, 18, died in a hail of gunfire between two gangs, the Burger Bar Boys and the Johnson Crew. A few days after the shootings two women were charged with the murder of Burger Bar Boy Yohanne Martin, who was shot in West Bromwich last year. The survey, in conjunction with Channel 4's Dispatches programme, found that 57 per cent of gangs had female members. One was predominantly female, but in most cases the female members were girlfriends or sisters of gang members. The researchers found that 60 per cent of the gangs had been involved in stabbings while a third had been involved in shootings. More than 40 per cent were engaged in drug dealing. Rape and murder each accounted for more than 10 per cent of crimes. The vast majority of members were between nine and 14. Although the sample size was relatively small, the findings support far larger studies into youth gangs, which suggest there are up to 30,000 gang members in England and Wales and the numbers are growing, with victims and perpetrators becoming younger. London, Birmingham and Manchester have the most extreme problems, followed by Liverpool, Leeds and Bradford, while Sheffield, Preston, Bolton and Bristol, are increasingly experiencing gang incidents. The survey, carried out in London, Surrey, Essex, Leicester and Derby, found the most common reason for joining a gang was friendship. The second most important motive was protection. Most gang members had two parents at home, at least one with a full-time job.
