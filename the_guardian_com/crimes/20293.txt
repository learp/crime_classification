Stephen DowningThen a 17-year-old with a reading age of 11, Mr Downing was working as a groundsman and living with his parents near the cemetery, where he says he found Wendy Sewell in a pool of blood. He signed a confession, was charged with her murder and convicted at Nottingham crown court in February 1974. Last year the court of appeal quashed his conviction, accepting he had not been correctly cautioned and informed of his rights. Wendy Sewell The 32-year-old typist lived with her husband David in the village of Middleton-by-Youlgreave. She told colleagues she was stepping out for fresh air and a stroll in the local cemetery, where she was bludgeoned. She was conscious when police arrived but stumbled and hit her head on a gravestone. She died two days later. After her death, Sewell was dubbed "the Bakewell tart" amid allegations that she had a string of boyfriends. Don Hale A former editor of the Matlock Mercury weekly newspaper, Mr Hale took up the Downing case in 1994 and carried out an exhaustive investigation. He was named journalist of the year by What the Papers Say in 2000, and won three other awards in 2001. Writing of the day Mr Downing was released, he said: "When I went to the shop, people were coming up to me, hugging and kissing me and saying, well done. It took me 40 minutes to buy a paper."
