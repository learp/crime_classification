The father of missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann has appealed for the return of a stolen wallet containing "irreplaceable" photographs of his daughter.Gerry McCann's wallet is thought to have been taken by a pickpocket at Waterloo station in London after he flew back to the UK for a series of meetings about the search for Madeleine, abducted from the family's Algarve holiday apartment seven weeks ago.Mr McCann's brother, John, said: "Gerry had his wallet stolen and there were two pictures of Madeleine taken when they lived in Amsterdam."They were taken around two years ago, before the twins were born. The photos meant a lot to Gerry; he had carried them for ages."They are irreplaceable and we are appealing to whoever took them to hand them back."One of the tasks which brought Mr McCann back to the UK was to interview possible candidates to work as manager of the family's campaign to find Madeleine.Mr McCann, his wife Kate and the couple's twins, Sean and Amelie, have remained in the resort of Praia da Luz since Madeleine's disappearance, other than for trips around Europe and to north Africa to appeal for news about their daughter.
