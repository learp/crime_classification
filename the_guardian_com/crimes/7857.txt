An inquest jury today ruled that a police officer who was shot dead during a training exercise in Manchester was unlawfully killed.The jury returned two verdicts of unlawful killing on the officer who shot dead PC Ian Terry, 32, and on another officer who was in charge of the fatal training exercise at a disused warehouse in June 2008.The jurors at Manchester coroner's court were also critical of the Greater Manchester police firearms unit and its training procedures.PC Terry, who was playing the role of a criminal, was not wearing body armour and was struck in the chest by specialist ammunition called Round Irritant Personnel (RIP). He was hit by an armed officer, who was referred to as Chris, during an exercise involving 20 officers.As officers converged on the suspects, Chris, who had at some point taken off the safety catch on his gun, acted "instinctively" and pulled the trigger on his Remington 870 pump action 12-bore shotgun, he told the inquest.Officers were told specifically to keep shotguns aimed downwards at all times but these instructions were routinely flouted, the hearing was told.Chris, who is still a serving police officer and was a friend of PC Terry, is now on restricted duties. He said he was not aware of pulling the trigger but was conscious of the fact he was engaged in a training exercise.He also agreed that in releasing the safety catch on his shotgun before being ready to fire he broke the "golden rule".The case will now be referred back to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider criminal charges. Last year, the attorney general decided against charges but the matter will be reconsidered.The shotgun was supposed to be used to blow out car tyres as officers practised a tactic to catch criminals in traffic.The officers – who were experienced firearms officers on a refresher course – had been repeatedly told never to point shotguns at colleagues and to point them downwards.An officer in charge of the drill, referred to in court under the pseudonym Francis, had introduced a series of changes to make the training more real, including live rounds.Francis never read the training package which – even without the addition of live rounds – had not been authorised by a senior officer as it should have been.Naseem Malik, commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission in the north-west, said her heartfelt sympathies went to Joanne Terry, her two young children, and all PC Terry's family and friends. "His death was a terrible, personal tragedy for them. From what I understand Ian Terry was a loving husband, father, brother and son – and a dedicated and conscientious police officer."The Greater Manchester chief constable, Peter Fahy, said: "Ian Terry was a well liked and highly respected police officer whose death has meant a great loss to the force and his loving family. I would like to personally apologise to Ian's family for GMP's failure to keep him safe on 9 June 2008. I accept that some of our systems and practices were inappropriate and did play a part in Ian's death."
