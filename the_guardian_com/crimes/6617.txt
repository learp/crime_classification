David Blunkett, the home secretary, is expected to outline plans today to increase community accountability of the police and to boost the "official presence" on Britain's streets of patrols by community support officers, street wardens and others.His plan for the "civic renewal" of local communities comes as statistics from the Home Office are expected to confirm that the rise in gun crime in England and Wales has passed its peak, with 10,250 firearm offences recorded between 2002-03.The crime figures, published today, show an annual rise of 3% in gun crime compared with a 35% increase the previous year. Provisional figures showed that gun crime fell between November 2002 and March 2003.The detailed figures are to be published as the new five-year minimum sentence for the possession of an illegal firearm comes into force.Mr Blunkett is expected to develop his "new localist" plans to create democratic structures alongside traditional local authority bodies, including wholly or partially elected strategic policing boards at force level and neighbourhood-level community safety panels.He is also considering fresh funding arrangements for the expanding army of community support officers who are paid less than fully trained uniformed constables but are dedicated to the task of street patrolling.Mr Blunkett is known to be considering a "match funding" scheme so that poorer areas can afford to buy in more street patrols if they choose to in the same way that a wealthy London borough such as Kensington and Chelsea can provide a bigger force of street patrollers from its own resources.Hazel Blears, the police minister, said in an interview with the Guardian this week that Labour was not interested in a return to the traditional idea of random beat patrols but wanted the use of this growing "wider police family" to be targeted on crime hotspots in neighbourhoods.The growing numbers of community support officers, expected to reach 4,000 this year, will be organised by police beat managers based on the local intelligence received.Mr Blunkett's speech is part of a concerted effort this week to flesh out Labour's new localism agenda, including reform of council tax.
