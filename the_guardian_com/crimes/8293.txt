The seven friends who were dining with Kate and Gerry McCann on the night their daughter Madeleine disappeared are to be reinterviewed by British and Portuguese police next week. Leicestershire police said the group - popularly named the "Tapas Seven" after the restaurant in which they were dining when the toddler vanished on May 3 - would be questioned in the presence of Portuguese officers, at the request of the Lisbon authorities. There are no plans to reinterview Mr and Mrs McCann, a spokeswoman said, nor would the purpose of the interviews be revealed. The group - three couples, Matthew and Rachael Oldfield, Fiona and David Payne, Russell O'Brien and Jane Tanner, plus Dianne Webster, Ms Payne's mother - have vociferously defended the McCanns against suggestions that they might have been involved in their daughter's disappearance. Clarence Mitchell, the McCann family spokesman, said that the couple and their friends welcomed the interviews.
