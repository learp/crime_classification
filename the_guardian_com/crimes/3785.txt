The theft had seemed to be going so well.It had been pretty simple to whisk Addy the barn owl from her loving owners' home, and Jason Denton was thinking of the handsome profit he would make in cashing in on the craze for pet owls inspired by the Harry Potter films.However, Denton's plan began to unravel when he found Addy's cage would not fit into his getaway car, a stolen Ford Fiesta.He got rid of the cage and climbed into the passenger seat with the bird on his lap, ordered the driver to speed off - and soon discovered to his cost that owls have very sharp claws indeed.As police - having spotted the stolen Fiesta - gave chase, Denton gritted his teeth as feathers flew but finally had no choice but to wind down the window of the car and let three-year-old Addy fly to freedom.Soon afterwards, the car was abandoned and Denton was found hiding in the bushes. He told police he had taken the owl "as a way of making some money", but had let the bird go when it came distressed during the 65mph car chase.Pet owls have become popular as a result of the Harry Potter books and films, in which the hero has a Snowy Owl named Hedwig.At Plymouth magistrates court, Denton, 23, admitted burglary, theft of the Â£100 owl and aggravated vehicle taking. His case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports, while the getaway car's 20-year-old driver is being dealt with separately.Police found Addy in Mutley Plain, Plymouth, with a fractured leg and a bruised right eye. The owl is still traumatised and is having to sleep with her owner, 45-year-old Andrew Godbeer."We did not realise she had been stolen until the next morning when Andy went to feed her and she was not there," Mr Goodbeer's wife, Lynda, said today."We traced her through the tag on her leg, and at first she was quite traumatised. She now comes indoors at night because her leg needs to be kept warm, and Andy has been sleeping downstairs with the owl on his shoulder."It seems a strange thing to say about an owl, but Addy has become more clingy since she was stolen. She is captive bred, and she likes to be with one or other of us as much as possible."
