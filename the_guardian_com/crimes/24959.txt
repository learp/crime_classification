The wife of a man stabbed to death outside his home told yesterday how his murder had robbed their two young daughters of a loving father.Stevens Nyembo-Ya-Muteba, 40, was knifed in the chest on the doorstep of his flat in east London on Sunday after asking a group of up to 12 teenagers to keep the noise down.In an emotional appeal to the public to help catch the killer, his 29-year-old wife, Veronique, said: "The people who did this have turned my world upside down."I lost the most important person in my life and am left to carry on educating my young children."Mrs Nyembo-Ya-Muteba and her husband had two daughters, Debbie, seven, and Sheridan, four."The first one can understand something but the second one doesn't understand anything. I know they loved their dad and their dad loves them," she said.Sitting next to her mother at Stoke Newington police station in north London, Debbie cried as she said: "I just want my daddy back, I just want my daddy back."Another family member told reporters that Mr Nyembo-Ya-Muteba, who was studying for a BSC in maths and finance at the University of Greenwich, was killed in a "totally unprovoked" attack."Stevens was a lovely and lively guy who was always friendly to everyone," said the victim's cousin Justin Zinda. He was looking forward to completing his degree course at university this year."Mr Nyembo-Ya-Muteba, who was originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, worked at a branch of Tesco in Purfleet, Essex, where, according to his cousin, "he was admired by everyone working there". Mr Zinda added: "This tragic attack on Stevens leaves a woman without a husband and two fragile little girls without a father."Neighbours have said the Hackney council block in which Mr Nyembo-Ya-Muteba died had suffered problems with drug users and prostitutes frequenting the stairwell.Mr and Mrs Nyembo-Ya-Muteba had asked police and the local council to improve security there.Police have said Mr Nyembo-Ya-Muteba managed to force most of the youths to leave but two returned, pulling a knife on the mature student. A neighbour found him bleeding to death on the stairwell. He was pronounced dead at nearby Homerton hospital.DCI John Macdonald, who is leading the investigation, said: "I'm determined to trace all those involved and would urge anyone who saw approximately 10 to 12 youths to contact police."Five teenage boys have so far been arrested in connection with the murder.
