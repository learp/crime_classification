A Bristol teenager being questioned last night by anti-terrorist officers over an alleged bomb plot converted to Islam just weeks ago. Bomb disposal experts conducted a further two controlled explosions at the home of British-born Andrew Ibrahim, 19, while forensics officers continued a search of the property. Local Muslim leaders described Ibrahim as a 'loner' who, after converting to Islam less than two months ago, had yet to make contact with others in the city's Muslim community. Farooq Siddique, spokesman for the Bristol Muslim Cultural Society, said he was concerned about individuals galvanised by foreign websites glorifying terrorism.
