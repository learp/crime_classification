A “high risk” sex offender and his girlfriend who exploited a young girl and incited her to be involved in pornography have been jailed.Michael Kinnear, 48, was given a nine-year extended sentence which will see him serve five years and four months in prison.Preston crown court was told that police found images on his mobile phone of a young girl of primary school age “performing a type of striptease” and in state of undress.His girlfriend Caroline Shaw, 29, claimed that she had been “coerced” into carrying out offences including taking 21 indecent pictures of a child.The young victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told officers that “rude pictures” had been taken of her that made her “feel sad”.Kinnear, of Morecambe, Lancashire, was also convicted of seven counts of possessing indecent images of a child, two of distributing images and one count of the sexual exploitation of a child.Shaw of Heysham, Lancashire, was also convicted of two counts of possessing indecent images and one count of distributing an indecent image of a child. She pleaded guilty to the ill-treatment of a child and was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison.The offences were said to have taken place between October last year and May 2015. Their crimes were discovered when Kinnear, who was often visited unannounced by the dangerous sex offenders unit, attended his house.Following a previous conviction in 2010, he was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for sexual activity with a child under the age of 16 and detaining a child without lawful authority. He was placed on the sex offenders register for seven years but in July 2014 was prosecuted for failing to comply with a sexual offences notification order.Officers asked to see Kinnear’s mobile phone during a visit which revealed “a highly sexualised” WhatsApp conversation asking for pictures to be sent to him. Two pictures, including a Category A image – the most serious level, were found of a child engaged in sexual activity with an adult.Prosecutor Mr Peter Barr told the court that upon his arrest Kinnear said: “I’m aware there are indecent images on my mobile phone.”Whilse in custody and having pleaded guilty to the offences, further investigations of another mobile phone revealed more highly sexualised messages between him and Shaw talking about the abuse of children. Mr Barr said the conversation was “extremely graphic and disturbing” and spoke about raping and killing children.Police also found indecent images on Shaw’s Samsung device when they arrested her.Miss Janet Ironside, testifying for Shaw, told the court that Shaw, who was of previous good character, had been “groomed” by Kinnear. “She was targeted, she was firstly groomed by him herself and exploited,” she said.She added that their relationship between Shaw and Kinnear changed and “different elements were introduced” and she “suspended her own proper judgment”.For Kinnear, Mr Fraser Livesey said the court was dealing with images only, and his client had admitted his offences. He added that Kinnear had suffered beatings while in prison.In passing sentence, Judge Christopher Cornwall said to Shaw: “These photos should never have come into existence, you not only took them but distributed them. In doing what you did you incited her to become involved unwittingly in the ghastly world of pornography.”Both were handed sexual harm prevention orders and notification requirements.
