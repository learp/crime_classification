Sir Stephen Tumim, who as chief inspector of prisons did more than anyone to end the practice of slopping out in British jails, has died while on holiday in the Galapagos Islands. He was 73.Appointed to the job by Douglas Hurd, then home secretary, in 1987, from the relatively obscure post of circuit judge, he soon became a trenchant critic of conditions in English and Welsh prisons.During his succesful campaign to get rid of slopping out he said he often felt more like the chief inspector of plumbing than of prisons.His contract was extended by Kenneth Clarke, but he repeatedly clashed with Michael Howard when he became home secretary.Sir Stephen warned of security failings at Parkhurst and Whitemoor before major escapes took place, and Mr Howard decided not to extend his contract in 1995.
