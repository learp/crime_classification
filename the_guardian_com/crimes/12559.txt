The court of appeal today doubled "unduly lenient" two-year prison sentences imposed on two paedophiles in separate cases for the rape of young girls.Keith Fenn, 25, a window cleaner, was sentenced in June at Oxford crown court by Judge Julian Hall to serve concurrent two-year and 18-month jail sentences. He had pleaded guilty to two charges of rape after attacking a 10-year-old girl in a park.Because of the amount of time he had already spent in prison awaiting sentence, Fenn was due for release on October 19.Simon Foster, 26, a chef, was jailed at Exeter crown court in June by Judge Jeffery Rucker after he admitted a series of sexual offences against a 12-year-old girl, including two counts of rape.The pair met on the internet, then on three occasions on Teignmouth seafront in south Devon. The girl told him she was 15.Fenn, of Blackbird Leys, Oxford, and Foster, of Dartmouth, Devon, were not present for the ruling by Lord Justice Latham, Mr Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Pitchford. The appeal judges were told on behalf of Fenn that he had "genuinely" believed his victim was 16.The increased jail terms were imposed after the government's most senior law officer told the appeal court that the original sentences fell so far outside sentencing guidelines that they would not act as a deterrent to other sex offenders.The attorney general, Lady Scotland, said in a statement today: "I welcome the decision made today by the court of appeal and I am grateful for their lordships' careful consideration of the case."Lady Scotland told the three appeal court judges last week that the original sentences could not be allowed to stand: "The message must be that sexual activity with girls of 10 and 12 will not be tolerated."The attorney general told the judges her concern was that in both cases "too great a discount has been afforded to the offenders by the judges who sentenced them, for the ostensible consent of the victim and the offenders' belief as to the victim's age"."The sentences of two years' imprisonment passed in these cases fall so far outside the Sentencing Guideline Council's eight to 13 years as to be properly regarded as an unduly lenient sentence. Custodial terms of that length do not sufficiently punish the offender for the harm that he has caused, nor protect young girls and it does not deter, as these sentences for this sort of offence must."
