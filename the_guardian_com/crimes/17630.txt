Police are investigating a murder and a suspected suicide in a busy museum in Liverpool. Merseyside police were called to the World Museum yesterday lunchtime after receiving reports that a man had stabbed a woman then fallen 35ft to his death from an internal balcony.Both the man and the woman, who were in their late teens or early 20s, were taken to hospital. It is thought the pair knew each other but they were not known to the police.Superintendent Oz Billings, from Merseyside police, said they died despite the efforts of paramedics and hospital staff. Officers were interviewing witnesses. The police are not ruling out suicide, but they have refused to confirm the theory that the man killed himself after stabbing the woman.A police spokesman said the woman's injuries were not self-inflicted and nobody else was being sought in connection with her death. A weapon has been recovered. A postmortem examination and formal identification are expected today.It is the second time this year that a man has died after a fall in the city centre museum. In May, a 24-year-old university graduate climbed over a balcony on the sixth floor and fell to his death.Alex Dutton was due to face drug charges in court, but the Liverpool coroner, Andr√© Rebello, did not record a verdict of suicide because he said there was no evidence that Mr Dutton had wanted to take his own life.
