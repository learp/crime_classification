A row has broken out among senior police officers and politicians over claims that parts of Britain are operating their own forms of justice as some minority communities take the law into their own hands.The chief inspector of constabulary, Tom Winsor, said some ethnic minority communities are turning their backs on police and rarely, if ever, call them to deal with crimes as serious as murder and sexual assaults against children, instead dealing with them in their own way.Winsor said police were never called to some neighbourhoods because they "administer their own form of justice", adding that this was not carried out by criminal gangs but by "law-abiding people"."There are some communities born under other skies who will not involve police at all," he told the Times. "I am reluctant to name the communities in question but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves."There are cities in the Midlands where the police never go because they are never called. They never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own ... They just have their own form of community justice."Winsor said some chief constables receive "close to zero" calls from some areas, and that police are not afraid to go to such areas, but that they do not know what is going on as communities do not tell them.He said: "They don't know what injustices are being perpetrated ... It's almost a closed book because we can't go there so don't know. It could be anything from low-level crime right up to murder... (honour killings) are the most extreme example. That is murder. There is no honour in it."Winsor compared the situation in some parts of the UK to Northern Ireland during the Troubles, but said the difference now was that it was law-abiding citizens operating their only system of law, rather than criminal gangs.He told the newspaper increased diversity in the police across all ranks could help tackle the situation, though he did not think there was "institutional racism" in the Metropolitan police.But Chris Sims, chief constable of West Midlands police, told the paper there was "no evidence" of crimes being under-reported in the region's minority communities.Sims added: "The experience of West Midlands police's officers and staff who actively work day in day out with our communities could not be more different than suggested by Mr Winsor, assuming he's referring to West Midlands."There is no evidence to suggest that the under reporting of crimes is a significant issue here in the West Midlands and that some communities therefore feel compelled to take the law into their own hands."He added that areas with a high density of minority communities accounted for high volumes of calls to his force.home affairs select committee chairman and Leicester MP Keith Vaz said he was concerned by Winsor's claims. He said: "I have represented an inner city Midlands constituency, which is home to many diverse communities, for 26 years and have not seen any evidence to support the idea of a sub culture of secondary justice."It is hazardous to suggest that some communities have lost faith with the justice system of this country without providing specific evidence."I hope that Mr Winsor will back up his statements in his report. The home affairs select committee will also ask Bob Jones, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, about this matter when he gives evidence to us on Tuesday."
