Forty-eight convicted violent or sex criminals have been charged with a further offence of murder, rape or another serious offence while under the supervision of the probation service in the last year, according to official figures published today.The justice ministry figures also show that the number of registered sex offenders in England and Wales increased by nearly 1,000 in 2008-09 to a total of 32,336.A total of 1,414 registered sex and violent offenders were also returned to prison for breaching the terms of their release licences. A further 68 were sent back to prison for breaching the terms of their sex offences prevention order.But a row broke out today over the figures as the government announced that they had changed the basis on which they were compiled, leaving the impression that the number of offenders charged with murder or other serious offences had fallen from 79 to 48.The figures published today are collated from the annual reports from the multi-agency public protection arrangements (known as Mappas), made up of probation, police and prison staff, in each of the 42 probation areas of England and Wales. Recent cases, including the torture and murder of two French students by Dano Sonnex while under the supervision of the probation service and the murder of Naomi Bryant by Anthony Rice while on licence from a life sentence, have highlighted failings by the criminal justice system in the management of these offenders.Justice minister Maria Eagle said that the risk of further offences being committed by those dealt with by Mappas was "ever present" because they could display extremely dangerous and unpredictable behaviour."That risk can never be eliminated entirely, but the majority of those subject to active Mappa management do not seriously re-offend due to robust and effective managment. The number of those who re-offend seriously has remained around 0.5% for the past four years," she said.But any attempt to compare today's figures with last year's is frustrated by a decision by the justice ministry to change the basis on which the number of serious further offences committed by those on probation has been counted.The 48 further serious offences compares with 79 recorded in 2007/08 but justice ministry officials said that those who had been charged with "wounding with intent to cause GBH" had been excluded from this year's figures.The number of offenders under level 3 supervision – the most intensive – who are referred to in the probation service as the 'critical few', are now being counted as a snapshot on 31 March each year rather than the total number referred during the year. The change has been made to achieve greater consistency.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation union, said: "The government has changed the way in which it collates statistics on violent offenders referred to Mappa.  This could give the impression that there has been a reduction in numbers and therefore less threat to the public.  In reality however the number of violent offenders has almost certainly increased.  The government claims it has changed the way it records in the interests of consistency.  This may be the case but the effect has been total confusion and uncertainty about what the actual trends are."A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:"Figures for total Mappa offenders and for category 2 and 3 offenders should not be compared to last year."For the first time this year, the annual reports show how many Mappa-eligible offenders are in each area on a single day which is the 31 March; ie a snapshot.  Previously only the figure for registered sexual offenders (ie category 1) was a snapshot; the data on the other two categories included all such offenders who had been included in those categories at some point over the course of the year. "These figures now give a more accurate and helpful picture of how many Mappa offenders are in their area at any one time."
