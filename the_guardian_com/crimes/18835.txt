Police in Hull have appealed for calm after an outbreak of racially motivated violence in the city centre involving white men and a number of Iraqis.Twelve people were arrested and about a dozen weapons were seized on Friday night after four white men clashed with eight Iraqis in Pryme Street. The weapons included knives, a sword and a crowbar. The arrests were made 'within seconds' of trouble breaking out,' police said. One of the 12 men arrested has been charged with a public order offence, while the other 11 are being held on suspicion of offences including criminal damage and possession of offensive weapons. Tension has been running high in the city since a 31-year-old Iraqi asylum seeker was alleged to have been deliberately run over in a late night hit-and-run incident last weekend. He suffered severe leg injuries and is being treated in Hull Royal Infirmary. A 29-year-old man from Hull has been released on police bail pending further inquiries. Police have stepped up patrols to prevent further disturbances in the city and race relations officers from Humberside Police have appealed for calm. Officers have ruled out any link between Friday night's violence and the murder of a Somali man last Thursday. The disturbances come a month after clashes in Wrexham, north Wales, involving local residents, asylum seekers and police.
