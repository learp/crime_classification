The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, today told Russia's chief prosecutor that the man accused of murdering Alexander Litvinenko must face trial in Britain.In a face-to-face meeting with chief prosecutor Yuri Chaika in Germany, the government's top lawyer said he expected Russian authorities to cooperate fully with the request.Lord Goldsmith said an official extradition order, telling the Russians to hand over former KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi, would be made shortly.He described the lethal poisoning of the 43-year-old businessman as a "reckless crime" which required "rapid cooperation from the Russian authorities"."I have spoken to the Russian prosecutor general today to stress that this was a most grave and reckless crime, which killed one man and endangered the safety of many others," he said."I have impressed on Mr Chaika that we are seeking and expect constructive and rapid cooperation from the Russian authorities in bringing this suspect before a British court."Lugovoi was charged with Litvinenko's murder on Tuesday. The exiled former Russian spy was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in London in November last year.Lord Goldsmith rejected suggestions made earlier this week that Lugovoi could be put on trial in Russia."This murder was committed on UK soil, the evidence is in the UK, a UK citizen was killed and other people put at risk, and it is therefore right a suspect should face justice in a UK court," he said.
