Pop star Pete Doherty was today ordered to spend 12 months on a drug rehabilitation programme and warned he could face jail if he failed to stick to it.Doherty, 26, who pleaded guilty to seven charges of drug possession at a hearing on January 27, was sentenced at Ealing magistrates court in west London.The chair of the bench, Ann McLaughlin, told Doherty he would be brought back before the court if he broke the community order and sentenced in a different way. "This could include sending you to prison," she explained to the singer.The maximum sentence for possession of class A drugs such as heroin and cocaine is seven years in prison.Doherty was ordered to submit to monthly drugs tests and told to return to Thames magistrates court on March 8 for a review of the order. He was also told to pay costs of Â£129.Wearing a black jacket, a white shirt open at the neck and a crucifix, the Babyshambles frontman and former boyfriend of the model Kate Moss spoke only to confirm his name and address during the hearing.He appeared bleary-eyed and disorientated and frequently glanced towards the back of the court, where about 20 of his fans were sitting in the public gallery.Doherty, who has very publicly wrestled with his addictions for the last three years, was arrested last month when police found a wrap of white powder in his clothing.Arguing for a non-custodial sentence, his lawyer, Sean Curran, told the court that Doherty was "only a harm to himself" and jail would leave him vulnerable to further drug abuse.Mr Curran told the court that Doherty had been born into a very supportive family, achieved excellent GCSEs and A-level results and was a "very articulate and intelligent man".The lawyer said Doherty first realised he could not control his drug habit when the Libertines, the band he formed after leaving school, began to sell hundreds of thousands of records. The band broke up as a consequence of his addiction, the court heard.The charges related to a series of encounters with the police between November and January.In the first of these, the court heard from Bryony Derbyshire, prosecuting, that Doherty was behaving in a "nervous and fidgety manner" on November 30 when police in west London flagged down his car for speeding just before midnight and found heroin and cocaine.Four days later he was stopped in similar circumstances in Hackney, east London, and found to be in possession of small quantities of heroin, morphine, crack cocaine and cannabis.Doherty was again stopped by officers in Whitechapel Road, east London, on January 26 because he "looked dishevelled and seemed to be staring at the floor", Ms Derbyshire said. Police found he was carrying a wrap of heroin in his clothes.Mr Curran said Doherty wanted to repay his fans' "loyalty and support" and was upset he had already disappointed people by having to cancel three sold-out concerts while on remand in Pentonville prison awaiting sentencing.
