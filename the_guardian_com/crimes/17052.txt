The alleged rape of TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson has brought the issue of 'date rape' into new focus. Jonsson says that a vicious attack on her 14 years ago by a man she declines to name led to her spending four days in hospital. She was a young woman at the time and felt unable to bring charges. Crime statistics suggest her reluctance is shared by the vast majority of rape victims. Police believe that fewer than 7 per cent of rapes are reported to them. Of those reports - 8,400 last year - fewer than one in 10 will result in conviction. Such figures explain why so many women have lost confidence in the present law.Government plans to reform the rape laws, which we report today, are long overdue and welcome. First, they acknowledge that most rapes are committed by acquaintances rather than unknown assailants. Second, they apply common sense to a murky area of the law which has made it hard to secure convictions. The proposals will restrict the defence of 'honest belief', which currently enables a defendant to claim he mistakenly thought there was consent to sex even if there is evidence to the contrary. These plans will not lead to couples needing to sign contracts before having sex, as has been claimed. They will, however, require a cultural shift in the popular perception of 'date rape' as somehow not a real crime. And we welcome the drafters' intention to make it difficult for the defence to raise a victim's sexual history in court. This alone will remove a major obstacle to raped women, and men, pressing rape charges. The success of the proposed reforms will ultimately be measured by their ability to secure convictions for a crime that remains a shaming, secret, life-scarring experience for tens of thousands of victims each year.
