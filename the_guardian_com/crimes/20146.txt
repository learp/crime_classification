A 13-year-old boy arrested over an attack that left a football fan fighting for his life in hospital has been bailed. West Midlands police said the youngster, arrested early on Thursday on suspicion of assaulting the Watford supporter Nick Cruwys, was conditionally bailed later the same day.The boy, who was detained at an address in East Park, Wolverhampton, is the second person to have been arrested after an 18-year-old was taken into custody on Wednesday. Both have been bailed until April.Mr Cruwys had travelled to the West Midlands with friends to see his side draw 2-2 with Wolves on Saturday but was set upon while walking back to Wolverhampton railway station.The 44-year-old father of two, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, was tripped and kicked in the head in an unprovoked attack in Little’s Lane shortly after 5pm. He is said to be critical but stable in hospital.An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has since raised more than £27,500. Police have appealed to those involved in the attack to “do the right thing” and hand themselves in.Det Insp Toni Naylor, of West Midlands Police, said: “We are pleased with how the investigation is progressing and the arrest of a second suspect is significant.“But this is not the end of our inquiry, it’s only the beginning. I am now appealing to anyone who was involved in the incident to think about their actions and to do the right thing and contact us or hand themselves in to a local police station.“We will leave no stone unturned to find the people involved and by coming forward you will be in a position to give your side of the story.”The Wolverhampton Express and Star has offered a £1,000 reward to anyone who can provide information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Anyone with information is urged to call Wolverhampton’s Violent Crime Team on 101 or to pass on information anonymously by calling Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
