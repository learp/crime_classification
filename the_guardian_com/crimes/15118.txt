Four former workers from a vegetable packing warehouse in Warwickshire were arrested today in connection with a fire that killed four firefighters in 2007.The three men and one woman, all from Poland, were taken for questioning from addresses in Birmingham, Smethwick and Evesham, Worcestershire, early this morning.A spokeswoman for Warwickshire police said the four were all in their 20s and knew each other but were not related. They were all employees or former employees at the warehouse.The four were arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life.The fire started on 2 November 2007 in a warehouse in Atherstone on Stour, near Stratford-upon-Avon. It was described at the time by the Fire Brigades Union as the "worst night for the fire service in decades".Ashley Stephens, 20, John Averis, 27, and Darren Yates-Badley, 24, were found dead in the remains of the building after days of searching. Their colleague Ian Reid, 44, died in hospital after being caught in the building when the roof collapsed.It was the biggest loss of life for British firefighters since seven were killed in a fire in Glasgow in 1972.The fire raged for over five hours and at its peak flames reached hundreds of feet high. Sixteen fire engines and 80 firefighters were called to the scene.The general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Matt Wrack, said: "If that terrible fire was started deliberately then the whole community and firefighters everywhere will want to see those responsible punished. Arson is a very dangerous crime."We welcome any progress the police are making, but strongly caution against prejudging any of those arrested."Speaking at the time, Warwickshire's chief fire officer, William Brown, said: "This has been the worst night in my 30 years' service."Thousands of firefighters from around the UK joined friends and family for the funerals of all four men.A fire investigation by Warwickshire police and the Health and Safety Executive is continuing.Last year, the inquiry revealed that officers were not given enough information before attending the scene. As a result, an improvement notice was issued by Warwickshire fire and rescue service.The warehouse – one of the biggest vegetable packing plants in Europe – is owned by Wealmoor Ltd.Leena Malde, a director at Wealmoor, said: "This is an ongoing police and health and safety investigation and therefore it would be inappropriate for us to comment. Wealmoor continues to support the investigation and is fully co-operating with the authorities."At the time residents living near the warehouse claimed migrant workers slept in the building because they were unable to get home after long shifts.They described how hundreds of eastern European workers travelled to the warehouse before dawn each day, with many arriving by coach or minibus from Coventry and Warwick to pack vegetables for supermarkets.Wealmoor denied anyone had slept in the building since it bought the business in August 2007.
