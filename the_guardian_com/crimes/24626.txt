A British charity worker who founded and ran several shelters for street children in Bombay was sentenced to six years' imprisonment yesterday, convicted of sexually abusing boys in his care.A retired Royal Navy commander from London who was a regular visitor to the homes was convicted of the same offences, and the Indian manager of the shelters was found guilty of aiding and abetting their crimes.Known as a 'saviour' of street children, Duncan Grant, 61, set up three shelters for homeless children aged eight to 18 in Bombay in the Nineties. He collected money from churches and schools in Britain, claiming in fundraising brochures that the homes were places where deprived children could 'receive medical attention, share...joys and sorrows with others or simply find someone to talk to'. Actress Felicity Kendal was persuaded to become a patron.The reality was that the children were being abused by Grant and a number of foreigners who visited the homes. His co-accused, Lieut-Cmdr Allan Waters, 58, who used to be in charge of sea cadets, made repeated trips to Grant's shelters.Indian child welfare campaigners have expressed growing alarm that the country's often ineffective legal system was encouraging paedophiles to visit India on the assumption that prosecution would be unlikely.In 1996 Grant sold his house in London and moved to Bombay with just a suitcase. He set up the Anchorage hostels for homeless boys in 1996. By 1999 there were around 60 boys staying at his shelters but an official report concluded that the homes were 'ramshackle and filthy, and the children were being beaten indiscriminately'.
