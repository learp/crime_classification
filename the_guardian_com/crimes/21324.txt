Maximum security prisons in England and Wales are less stable, more difficult to run and potentially less safe than nine years ago, the outgoing chief inspector of prisons has warned.Dame Anne Owers says maximum security prisons have been remarkably safe places but this was threatened by growing numbers of young men, often from an inner-city gang culture, serving increasingly long sentences who might feel they have little to lose.In her valedictory Prison Reform Trust lecture in London tonight, she says the instability is being fuelled by increasing gang activity and a small minority of terrorist prisoners which means maximum security jails need sophisticated, continuous management.Previous reports by the chief inspector and independent monitors named Whitemoor, Belmarsh and Full Sutton high-security prisons as vulnerable to a growing gang culture.Owers, charting progress made since 2001 when she became chief inspector, says prisons are brittle but not broken and have generally improved in health, education and resettlement work.She warned the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, that maintaining progress would be a challenge. Whatever sentencing reforms or "rehabilitation revolution" Clarke introduced, the record 85,000 prison population was unlikely to fall noticeably.She haswelcomed Clarke's commitment to end the political game of "my prison system is bigger than your prison system" saying that it was unhelpful and had led to a "orgy of prison building" with 6,000 new places built in the last 2Â½ years. She against the "siren voices" arguing for humane containment with the cash for education, training and offending behaviour programmes stripped out to provide immediate savings."There is no such thing as humane containment," she says. "Containment is for objects, units, and goods, not human beings. Containment is carried out by guards who engage with security and keys, not officers whose task, even if not always achieved, is to engage with people."Cuts to health, education and skills training budgets would have unintended consequences in prisons. How would prison health be funded in an era of budgets devolved to family GPs?"Getting from here to the sunlit uplands of a small, properly resourced prison estate, supported by effective interventions at either side, would be difficult at any time and in present circumstances will be fraught with all kinds of risks, both political and operational," she says. "It will require a bold and co-ordinated approach from government."Owers is to chair a review of the Northern Ireland prison system. She is succeeded by Nick Hardwick, the chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
