The law on murder is to be subject to the most wide-ranging review since the commission that led to the abolition of the death penalty half a century ago, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced today.Mr Blunkett told MPs that a review was necessary to ensure the law is "clear, comprehensive and fair" during a debate on the domestic violence, crime and victims bill this morning.His announcement comes after a Law Commission inquiry concluded two months ago that the law was a "mess" and ripe for reform. It recommended a major overhaul, including a rethink of whether murder should always carry a life sentence, because of "the breadth and depth of discontent" with the current law.Though the review's terms of reference have yet to be announced, it is known that it will be launched next year and include outside organisations as well as the Home Office. It will be the first wholesale re-examination of the subject since the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment from 1949 to 1953, which led to the Homicide Act in 1957.A Home Office spokeswoman said that it would examine "alternatives" to the mandatory life sentence for murder. But she said insisted that "the mandatory life sentence and murder principles are important in making clear the specially serious nature of murder"."The existence of the mandatory life sentence, coupled with the murder principles, is a clear anchor which establishes this," she added."However, this does not stop the review from examining and recommending alternative ways to structure offences of homicide, or looking at issues on the construction of the offence such as the intention of the offender, possible defences and partial defences."
