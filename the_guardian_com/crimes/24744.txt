Tony Blair was accused last night of indulging in "a pre-election gimmick" in promising a specific review of householders' rights of self-defence against burglars - because his attorney general insisted that the current law needed explaining, not changing."We must protect victims and law-abiding citizens," Lord Goldsmith said. "But we have to recognise that others have some rights as well. They don't lose all rights because they're engaged in criminal conduct." He added that the present "reasonable force" doctrine was sufficient. He made his remarks in an interview with the Observer, on a day when the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir John Stevens, endorsed the campaign to relax the law in the householder's favour. Sir John told the Sunday Telegraph: "The fact that a would-be intruder knows a householder can respond without the fear of being prosecuted will undoubtedly deter criminal acts." David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said yesterday: "This confusion demonstrates that the prime minister's changing stance on the law is a pre-election gimmick. Only the Conservatives would change the law to give homeowners greater rights to protect themselves without fear of prosecution."
