Home Office ministers joke that their department is being "split for purpose," but yesterday marked the creation of a continental-style ministry of the interior in all but name.The 200-year-old Home Office, whose motto was "building a safe, just and tolerant society", was at a stroke transformed yesterday into a national security department to allow John Reid as home secretary to "relentlessly focus on security, crime reduction, public protection and strengthening our borders".It is the classic recipe for a French or German interior ministry and encompasses the main domestic elements of the state apparatus. Moving prisons, probation and youth justice to the new justice secretary means that Mr Reid can focus on the threat without worrying about stubborn reoffending rates or being diverted by repeated prison crises.He has won an extra 150 civil servants from the Cabinet Office to join his 300 counter-terrorist experts in a new office for security and counter-terrorism. But most of the security and intelligence functions of permanent secretary Sir Richard Mottram in the Cabinet Office remain intact, though the Cabinet Office and Foreign Office retain important security functions.Little was said yesterday about what may yet prove the most interesting development in the counter-terrorism field: Mr Reid's decision to create a "research, information and communications unit in support of the struggle for ideas and values" in the Home Office.This has echoes of the old Foreign Office information and research department, which countered communist propaganda in the cold war, and is presumably designed to take up the battle against radical Islam. Mr Reid stressed yesterday that no extra money will be needed to create the Ministry of Justice, which will open in six weeks.Moving prisons, probation, criminal law and sentencing to the same department responsible for the judges and courts was widely welcomed by penal reformers yesterday because it appears to remove populist home secretaries from these crucial areas. But the split throws up potential conflicts. While the justice secretary is now in charge of sentencing policy, the home secretary is to keep a "core role" in making decisions because of his responsibilities for public protection and cutting crime.No wonder David Blunkett calls it the Balkanisation of Whitehall.
