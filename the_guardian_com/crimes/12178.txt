Primrose Shipman, the matronly and loyal wife, posed for photographs in a show of family unity yesterday. In a press call outside her home in Mottram, near Hyde, she emerged with her son, David, 20, but refused to answer questions. "It is no comment" is all she would say.Life appeared to go on as normal in the Shipman home. David put out the rubbish and told reporters: "There's no comment now, there will be no comment in the future, there will be no comment at any time." The decision by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, to strip Shipman of his NHS pension casts uncertainty over Mrs Shipman's future. Although Shipman continued to receive his salary of about £50,000 during the trial, that will now end. Mrs Shipman may be forced to sell their house, thought to be worth £90,000, and may have to rely on her children for financial help. During the trial, she told one member of the public that she would be forced to get a job if her husband was sent to prison. In the 33 years of their marriage - Primrose was 17 and five months pregnant at the wedding - she is known to have worked as a childminder and helped out in Shipman's surgery. The youngest of their four children, Samuel, 17, lives at home. The eldest, Sarah, 32, was apparently estranged from the family for several years, but attended the trial periodically. Christopher, 28, works in the south of England. During the trial Mrs Shipman handed out chocolates and joked with court officials. Her husband sent her a poem from his prison cell as he waited to go on trial. Despair featured prominently in it.
