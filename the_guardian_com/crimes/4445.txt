Mobile phone thieves could face up to five years in jail and unlimited fines under emergency legislation published by the government yesterday in an attempt to curb escalating street crime.The Home Office bill will make it an offence to reprogramme a mobile phone's unique identity number, a procedure that makes it impossible for the handset to be traced by the manufacturer. About 700,000 mobile phones were taken last year, many in street attacks. A black market exists in stolen SIM cards and handsets, which can have a resale value of between £10 and £60. The mobile telephones (reprogramming) bill would make it illegal for criminals to tamper with a mobile phone's international equipment identity (IMEI) - with five years in prison and unlimited fines as a deterrent. It would also be illegal to own or supply any of the equipment or computer software needed for reprogramming handsets. Home Office minister John Denham said: "Mobile phone thefts have been a key factor in rising street crime -stolen mobiles are now involved in 50% of all robberies in London. "There is no legitimate reason to reprogramme a mobile phone. "Those doing so run the risk of heavy penalties - penalties they deserve because they are fuelling violent street crime." Tim Godwin, a deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said: "Mobile phones are quickly turned into cash by thieves. This measure will reduce their value to a thief and therefore we strongly support and welcome it."
