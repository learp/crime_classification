The MP Eric Joyce has been charged with two counts of common assault and one count of criminal damage, the Metropolitan police have said.The 54-year-old Falkirk MP will appear at Highbury Corner magistrates court on 30 December.The former Labour party member, who now sits as an independent, has insisted that he was only trying to detain a young vandal during the incident in Camden, north London, on 17 October and made clear that he did not feel he was in the wrong.Writing on his blog following his arrest in October, former army major Joyce said: “I detained a youth in a shop in London. Damage had been done to the store.“I asked the shopkeeper to call the police, and when officers arrived they arrested the youth and informed me that drugs had been recovered from the scene.“The officers also informed me that the youth had immediately made a complaint that I had assaulted him by detaining him. I was questioned by the police and told that because of my identity the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Metropolitan police press office would be informed of the incident.“I understand the Metropolitan police has now made the matter public. I will make no further comment for now, other than to say a) that no alcohol was involved and b) I am not in the habit of summoning the police if I feel that I am in the wrong.”
