An estate agent and her lover were jailed for life yesterday for the murder of their 93-year-old landlady.The pair, who lived in rooms in Bridget Skehan's mansion block flat in Bayswater, London, attacked the retired interior designer after she invited them to join her for a Christmas drink. They may have been hoping to steal the title deeds, Inner London crown court was told. Ms Skehan had given them notice to quit. The court heard that while Ahmed al-Haddad, 24, acted as a look-out, Nimpha Ong, 49, punched and stamped on Ms Skehan before beating her with her walking sticks. They buried her body under rubbish in an outhouse.They ransacked the home but failed to find the deeds or the Â£49,000 life savings she had hidden in a shoebox. Judge Jonathan Van Der Werff said Ong, who has a 12-year-old son, should serve at least 17 years before being considered for parole. Haddad should serve at least 10 years.
