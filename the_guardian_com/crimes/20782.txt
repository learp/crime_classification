The government has promised to balance the law in favour of victims after the high court denied a woman permission to sue Lotto rapist Iorworth Hoare for compensation because her lawsuit was brought more than six years after the attack.Lawyers representing the 76-year-old woman, known as Mrs A, said they would pursue the case to the House of Lords and the European court of justice if necessary, after the judge rejected the lawsuit against Hoare. He also ruled that Mrs A should pay approximately £100,000 towards her attacker's legal costs. Under present guidelines, a victim can only sue an offender up to six years after an offence.But the ruling prompted the Home Office to say that it was considering extending the deadline. A spokesman said: "The government is committed to action to make it easier for victims to claim compensation from offenders who, after their conviction, come into money ..."Hoare, 52, was jailed for life in May 1989 for trying to rape Mrs A in February 1988. He won £7m on the lottery in August 2004 after buying a ticket while on weekend leave from an open prison in Gloucestershire. He was freed on parole in March.
