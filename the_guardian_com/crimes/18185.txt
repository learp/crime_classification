The two young boys viciously attacked at a former quarry area near their homes in Yorkshire on Saturday were today showing signs of improvement in hospital.News that the injured boys were beginning to recover came as police were granted extra time to question two brothers, aged 10 and 11, about the assault.The most severely injured victim, an 11-year-old who was found semi-conscious with head injuries after being battered with a brick, was taken off a ventilator at Sheffield children's hospital earlier today.His nine-year-old friend, who triggered a police hunt when neighbours in Edlington, near Doncaster, found him wandering dazed and covered in blood, had a second operation on knife wounds to his arm at Doncaster Royal Infirmary.Detectives do not expect to interview either victim today, but are continuing to question two boys, aged 10 and 11, who were detained soon after the incident.Magistrates in Doncaster have granted police permission to detain the suspects in custody for a further 24 hours.Officers have stepped up their inquiries in Edlington, a former pit village near Doncaster, where residents expressed disbelief at what happened.The attack took place in an area of flooded former quarries, often used by fishermen and dog walkers.Its victims were described as "normal, football-loving lads" who often went walking or cycling together at the Brick Ponds.The older boy is the uncle of the other, and the pair live close to the strip of semi-wild land from which clay for brickworks in Doncaster was once extracted.Derek Wright, a 70-year-old whose wife, Jean, was the first to come to the aid of the nine-year-old, said: "He kept repeating: 'My uncle, he can't see' and worrying about him."The younger boy remains in a serious but stable condition. South Yorkshire police said his injuries, which include deep knife cuts and cigarette burns, had been life-threatening.Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the boys were "regular lads" who never caused trouble."They both play football. They're always out here. They're always together," she said. "They're not brothers, but they are like brothers."The prime minister, Gordon Brown, condemned the attack as "shocking", but warned people against jumping to conclusions about the wider state of society and child violence.Downing Street issued a statement saying: "In his view, the overwhelming majority [of young people] are well-behaved and have good upbringings, and therefore he would be cautious about reaching any general conclusion about what is a disturbing but singular event."
