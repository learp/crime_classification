The family and supporters of Barry George, the man convicted of murdering the television presenter Jill Dando, said yesterday that they were "hopeful" his conviction would be quashed. The court of appeal reserved its judgment yesterday but indicated that a decision would be made before the end of the month.George, 47, from Fulham, west London, was in court to hear the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, say that he and two other senior judges would reserve their judgment on his appeal against conviction after a hearing which lasted less than two days. Orlando Pownall QC, for the crown, indicated that he would seek a retrial if the appeal was granted.After the hearing, George's sister, Michelle Diskin, said that she was hopeful of a positive outcome. She added that it was unfortunate that George, who has severe learning difficulties, would have to remain in prison while a decision was made. The court can either uphold the conviction, quash it or order a retrial.The appeal has focused on whether evidence of a particle of firearms discharge residue played too great a part in George's conviction at his trial in 2001. The court heard evidence from scientists from the Forensic Science Service, who indicated that it might not have been clear to the jury that this evidence was "neutral" or inconclusive.In his closing argument to the court, William Clegg QC, representing George, asked: "Were the jury inadvertently misled into thinking that the evidential weight of the firearm discharge residue (FDR) was greater than it was? The answer must be yes."
