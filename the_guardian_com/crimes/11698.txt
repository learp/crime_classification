Detectives believe they have found the body of a woman who disappeared after a night out with friends in south Wales, police said today.Kirsty Grabham, a 24-year-old model, was last seen nine days ago when she was picked up by a taxi outside a friend's house in the Port Tennant area of Swansea shortly before 4am after returning from the Play nightclub.A spokesman for South Wales police said: "[Officers] in Swansea investigating the murder of 24-year-old Kirsty Grabham have discovered what is believed to be a body of a woman in the Laleston area of Bridgend. The body has not yet been formally identified and the coroner has been informed. A trained family liaison officer is supporting the family."Police have been granted more time to question a 25-year-old man in connection with Grabham's disappearance. They have traced the taxi driver who picked her up.In an interview with the South Wales Evening Post this weekend, the model's mother, Catherine Broomfield, spoke of her deep concern at the length of time her married daughter had been missing."She would phone me every day without fail because she knew I would worry otherwise. I just want her back," she said. "It is completely out of character for her to vanish like this. When we spoke on the Friday she sounded fine. There was nothing out of the ordinary. I am just devastated. I cannot believe that she has been gone so long."Detective Superintendent Paul Burke said before today's development: "Although we very much hope that Kirsty is still alive, due to the circumstances of her going missing we are now treating her disappearance as a murder."
