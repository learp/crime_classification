A suited-and-booted armed robber wearing a curly blond wig and a trilby has led a smash and grab raid at a jewellers.The smartly dressed thief struck on Thursday at Mappin and Webb in Regent Street in the West End of London, after he was invited into the shop by an unsuspecting security guard.Once inside, he pulled out a handgun and two hooded accomplices smashed display cabinets with claw hammers and stole Cartier watches worth £80,000.The trio then fled – with the man in the trilby, which had a distinctive white band – last seen in Beak Street, and the other two robbers seen running along Kingly Street.This follows a smash-and-grab at the Dorchester hotel earlier this week, but it is understood that police were not linking the two robberies.
