Government plans to "downgrade" the crime of shoplifting are attacked by retailers today as new figures reveal that retail crime has soared by 70% since 2000, despite the industry spending £4.3bn on crime prevention.Crime cost retailers £2.1bn last year and has cost £13.4bn - including prevention - since 2000, says the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) 2006 retail crime survey.Thieves take an average of £149 worth of goods each time, it reveals, arguing that police priorities are elsewhere and "soft" penalties are failing to deter them. As the incidence of shoplifting increases, so does violence against staff, the survey warns. Sixty per cent of violent incidents in stores occur when staff confront shoplifters.Of the cost to retailers last year, £1.43bn was the value of losses from crime and the rest from crime prevention. Shoplifted goods accounted for £767m.The government's sentencing advisory panel has proposed removing prison sentences for persistent shoplifters. The BRC, representing 85% of retailers, has called on the government to reject the proposals, which are out for consultation until the end of next month, and wants the police to make retail crime a higher priority.BRC director general Kevin Hawkins said: "The huge increase in the number of shoplifting incidents is extremely worrying. It is having a very serious financial impact and is putting the safety and wellbeing of staff and customers at risk."The government's failure to plan prison capacity is no excuse for giving a licence to steal ... Shoplifting is an entry-level crime, which leads to more dangerous criminal activities."The issue will be debated at the BRC's annual retail crime conference in London today, where speakers will include police minister Vernon Coaker.
