Shopkeepers Alfred Jeevarajah and his wife, Anne have been jailed for 14 months after falsely claiming another man's lottery win. Anne stole Gwyn Badham-Davies's ticket in July 2011 and told him he had only won £10. Mr Jeevarajah then tried to claim Badham-Davies's £156,659 winning lottery ticket but they were caught after the lottery operator, Camelot, was suspicious and police proved that Jeevarajah had not bought the original ticket.It's time to confess to your fellow Comment is free readers: what is the most dishonest thing you have done?
