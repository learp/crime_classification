The deaths of a model railway enthusiast and his partner were being investigated by police last night amid claims that he had battered the woman to death before setting fire to his "train shed" and killing himself.The body of Malcolm Stride, an associate editor of Model Engineer magazine, was discovered inside the burnt summer house of his home in Burghfield Common, near Reading. The near-lifeless body of his partner, named by neighbours as Rosina Tillyer, was found bludgeoned inside the house.The alarm was raised by neighbours on Friday after they saw smoke billowing from the shed. When police entered the couple's Â£400,000 home they found the woman lying critically injured. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that she was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital where she died several hours later. "There is nothing to suggest that anyone else was involved in these deaths," he added.Neighbour Mike Dillon, 60, said that Stride used the shed to make miniature engines and carriages of the type used at children's fairs. The couple had lived in the village for at least eight years.
