A bill to introduce licensing for gangmasters was given an unopposed second reading in the House of Commons yesterday.Jim Sheridan, the MP for Renfrewshire West, who is sponsoring the private member's bill, said a statutory licensing scheme would be a fitting memorial for the 20 Chinese cockle pickers who died in Morecambe Bay. He said there were "far too many rogue employers" and without further legislation there was "no chance to protect vulnerable workers" and no chance to drive those operating illegally out of business. Under Mr Sheridan's bill, gangmasters operating in the agricultural, fishing, food processing and food packaging sectors, would have to show proof of a licence before they could employ workers. It would be an offence to use unlicensed gangmasters.
