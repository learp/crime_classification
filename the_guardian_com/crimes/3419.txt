Two men have been arrested for the murder of Michael Dosunmu, 15, who was machine-gunned to death in his bedroom in Peckham, south London, Scotland Yard said today.The pair were being held at a south London police station, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.Days after Michael's death, police arrested two men and three youths over his murder. They were later released on bail. At the time detectives said the killing may have been a case of mistaken identity.Michael, a churchgoing schoolboy, was in bed when two gunmen burst into his room and sprayed him with bullets in February.The police said he was killed by a Mac 10 machine gun, known as the "spray and pray", which fires more than a thousand rounds a minute and is a favourite of Yardie-style gangsters.Michael was one of three south London teenagers shot dead in less than a fortnight that month.James Andre Smartt-Ford, 16, of New Malden, was shot in front of hundreds of people at an ice rink in Streatham. A few days later Billy Cox, 15, was shot dead at his home in south-west London.
