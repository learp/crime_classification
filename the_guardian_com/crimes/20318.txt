With his cheap suit hanging limply from his tall frame, Philip McHugh cut a sad figure in the dock of St Albans crown court.Reports on the 52-year-old described him as an educated man, and he took pains to try to throw the police off his trail. But his efforts to plant misleading evidence in the letters he sent were undone by his own carelessness.The first seeds of McHugh's extortion plan were sown in 2005, when his stepson recalled he discussed the possibility of blackmailing a supermarket by suggesting its products were contaminated.It was not until spring last year that, facing mounting debts, severe depression and the decline of his relationship with his Russian wife, McHugh began his campaign of letter writing.Some of his tactics - composing letters with words cut out of newspapers, signing them with a mysterious fake name and demanding Tesco take out an advertisement in the personal column of the Times newspaper - sound as though they were borrowed from a cheap detective thriller.But the man who signed his letters "Arbuthnot, the sign is the spider" used what he thought were more sophisticated tactics, such as planting someone else's hair under the stamp on one of the threatening letters he sent.He also seemed to delight in toying with the authorities, using commemorative postage stamps to send the blackmail demands, including one featuring a cartoon of a laughing policeman.With his practice of taping dead spiders to his letters, McHugh seemed to be trying to create a calling card for himself.After the July bomb hoaxes, police decided to lure McHugh into giving himself away by transferring money into his bank account as he had requested.On four consecutive days in late July last year, McHugh withdrew money from cashpoints in Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley and Carlisle. Although he took pains to conceal his face, he wore distinctive Wellington boots that helped police to identify him on CCTV footage.When officers arrested him at his home in Clitheroe on July 23, they found the Wellingtons and details of the bank account used for the extortion, as well as a book entitled The Black Book of Revenge, which prosecutors said contained tips for anyone wanting to carry out a campaign of extortion.Faced with the weight of evidence against him, McHugh realised he had little hope of escaping conviction and admitted the charges against him in November.
