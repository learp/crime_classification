Crime in England and Wales fell by 9% last year, confounding fears that the recession would fuel an increase in offending.There were an estimated 9.6m crimes in 2009/10, compared with 10.5m in the previous 12 months, according to figures released by the British Crime Survey (BCS).The number of murders fell by 6% to 615, the lowest since 1997, while gun and knife crime also fell. Crimes recorded by the police fell 8% from 4.7m in 2008/09 to 4.3m last year.Both official sets of crime figures – the BCS and police recorded statistics – are now lower than when Labour came to office in 1997.Home Office statisticians had previously warned they expected the economic downturn to push up the crime rate.The risk of becoming a victim of crime last year was 21.5%, according to the BCS, the lowest since the interview-based survey started in 1981 when it was 27.7%. The risk was 23.3% in 2008/09 and reached a peak of 29.7% in 1995.Violent crime in the BCS fell by 1% but the change was said to be not statistically significant. Police-recorded violence against the person fell by 4%. The Home Office said: "Both BCS violence and police recorded violence against the person offences have shown a downward trend since 2006/07."The 9% fall in domestic burglary recorded by the BCS was deemed not to be statistically significant, although the Home Office observed it was broadly in line with the 6% reduction recorded by the police. Theft fell by 28% in the BCS but follows a 25% rise last year and police statistics showed a 3% increase – the first since 2005/06.Police-recorded firearm offences fell 3% fall last year to 7,995 while knife and sharp instrument offences fell by 7% to 33,771. The police provisionally recorded 205 knife and sharp instrument homicides in 2009/10, down from 255 the previous year.There were increases in the number of attempted murders, up 2% to 588, and police-recorded sexual offences, which rose by 6%. But the Home Office warned the latter rise needed to be "interpreted with caution" as initiatives had been taken to enhance the recording of serious sexual offences.The BCS showed that despite the overall reduction in crime, the public thought it was still rising. Two-thirds of people surveyed believed crime had risen nationally in the last few years, and 31% thought crime had increased where they live.The home secretary, Theresa May, welcomed the figures but warned they offered only a "partial picture" and failed to reflect the impact of antisocial behaviour."What matters to people is the crime that happens in their local communities and what is being done about it," she said. "This is why we want the public to know what is really going on in their area and will publish monthly crime information about what is happening on their streets by January next year."We are determined to restore trust in crime statistics and are currently considering how they should be collected and published in future. We are working with the UK Statistics Authority and others to consider this carefully."
