Jurors in the trial of Max Clifford have started an eighth day of deliberation over indecent assault allegations against the high-profile publicist.The jury of six men and four women have been considering 11 counts of indecent assault for around 35 hours at Southwark crown court in London.Jurors were sent out on 15 April at the end of a six-week trial in which Clifford was accused of manipulating seven girls and women into performing sex acts between 1966 and 1984.Clifford, 71, denies the charges. The millionaire publicist arrived at court with several employees of his PR firm, Max Clifford Associates, on Monday morning and sat silently in the dock as the judge, Anthony Leonard, told jurors to resume their deliberations.The jury is down to 10 members after two jurors were separately discharged from the case. They were given a majority direction on Wednesday 23 April, meaning they can give verdicts on which at least nine of them agree.During the trial, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said Clifford was a "master in the art of intimidation", using his celebrity connections to "bully and manipulate" girls and young women into sex acts over a period of nearly 20 years. The PR consultant treated his office as his own "sexual fiefdom" and "playground", taking "what he wanted, when he wanted", she said.Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, told the jury that the allegations against him were "a load of lies" and accused the alleged victims of being "fantasists and opportunists".The alleged offences are said to have taken before Clifford found fame with his links to tabloid stories, including The Sun's Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster front page, the court heard.The alleged assaults are said to have happened in cars and at his New Bond Street offices in central London, jurors have been told.On some occasions, Clifford allegedly told the girls to take off their clothes. On others, he made them perform sex acts on him, and in some cases, he forced himself on them, it is alleged.The women – who do not know each other – came forward to police in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, the court heard.A number of other witnesses, who are not formal complainants, made allegations against Clifford, including one woman who claimed she was 12 when the publicist assaulted her in a jacuzzi in Spain. The alleged incident, said to have happened in 1983, could not be included in the charges as it took place overseas, the jury heard.The court has heard claims that Clifford has a "micro-penis" measuring 2.5 inches when erect, while one woman told the court the publicist's penis was "enormous". A doctor measured Clifford's penis at an "average" 5.25 inches when flaccid, the jury has been told.Leonard has warned jurors to ignore other recent high-profile sex assault cases, which he told them were irrelevant to their considerations.
