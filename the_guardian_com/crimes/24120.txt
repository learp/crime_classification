A prison officer wept as she told a jury she feared she was about to be killed when a gunman demanded she free a prisoner in her custody.Kim Lockwood initially believed it was a training exercise when a man pointed a gun at her head outside West Suffolk hospital, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, a court heard.The incident, on 25 January, led to the escape of Andrew Farndon, who had been jailed for grievous bodily harm after fracturing his victim's skull in a hammer attack.Woolwich crown court heard he had been taken to hospital after suffering a knife wound to his shoulder at Highpoint prison in Stradishall, Suffolk. Farndon's former jailmate Garry Cowan, 44, is accused of possession of a replica handgun with intent to cause fear of violence, and assisting an offender to escape, which he denies.Lockwood said that she felt a gun being pressed against her head moments after stepping out of a taxi used to travel to the hospital.Giving evidence behind a screen, Lockwood said: "As we got out of the car I could obviously feel what I realised was the gun at my head. I was looking at Mr Farndon. He started saying, 'I'm sorry miss, let me go'."Asked by prosecutor Gregory Perrins what she thought was happening, Lockwood replied: "At first, that it was a training thing work had set up … but very quickly it went out of my head."Lockwood told jurors she was ordered by the gunman to release Farndon, who was handcuffed to her at the time.She alerted her colleague Chris Matson, who held the keys to the handcuffs but had remained in the car and was unaware of the events unfolding outside, jurors heard."The gunman said he had 10 seconds to get the cuffs off or he was going to shoot us," Lockwood said. "He [Matson] was struggling to get the keys out because he was shaking at the same time." Asked by the prosecution what she feared may happen, she said: "That I was going to die", before breaking down in tears.After being released, Farndon and the gunman fled the scene, the court heard.Lockwood described the gunman as white, in his late 30s or early 40s, about 5ft 6in and wearing a white glove at the time of the incident.Although initially unable to provide police with a description, she later picked out a man she believed was the gunman from photographs shown to her by officers.Lockwood also recalled later that the man had spoken with a "broad Scottish accent".During cross-examination, defence lawyer Francis McGrath said: "Is it possible you recognised Mr Cowan … and leapt to the conclusion he was the gunman?""No, not all," Lockwood replied."I've got no doubt in my mind at all that the person I picked out was the gunman," she added.Giving evidence, Matson said his priority was to undo the handcuffs to ensure he and Lockwood were no longer in danger."In fear of my life and my colleague Kim's life, my priority was to get the cuffs off," he said.Matson's description of the gunman to police following the incident allowed an efit image of the suspect to be produced, the court heard.The case continues.
