The recession is driving increasing numbers of British workers to crime, according to new research, with fraud by company managers, employees and customers up threefold in the past year.British courts saw cases accounting for more than £1.1bn worth of fraud last year, according to KPMG's forensic fraud barometer, the second highest in the survey's 21-year history.KPMG warned that the level of fraud is likely to rise further, even if the recession eases as the year goes on. The highest level of fraud seen in the survey was in 1995, three years after the state of the British economy forced the pound out of the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday."These figures are bad enough in themselves, but I fear the trend for the next couple of years will be even worse," said Hitesh Patel, fraud investigation partner at KPMG Forensic. "As the global economic downturn takes hold and organisations look ever more closely at their operations it is very likely that more fraud will come to light so that the real impact of the credit crunch on fraud is yet to be fully felt."Already the global economic slowdown has brought to light the multibillion-dollar fraudulent pyramid scheme of Bernard Madoff and a scandal at India's Satyam, whose founder is in jail after confessing last week to a £1bn fraud involving the falsification of asset values.The KPMG barometer, which measures fraud cases coming to court where the charges are for £100,000 or more, shows that half of fraud by value was committed in London and the south east, but the area with the sharpest rise was the Midlands, where fraud amounting to £380m was committed, three times the level in 2007.Fraud by professional gangs remains high – at £806m in 2008 – with the financial services sector a particular target.The government actually saw a significant fall in losses to fraud, down to £207m from £833m in 2007 as a result of its crackdown on VAT fraud schemes that rely upon shipping and re-shipping small high-value consumer devices such as mobile phones. There were £115m of carousel fraud cases last year, down from over £700m in 2007.Fraud by individuals has gone up most dramatically, to more than £300m, three times the amount seen in 2007. Managers accounted for £128m, up from £54m. One senior fraudster was the financial controller of a data firm in Exeter who wrote cheques to himself to pay for three cars including an £84,000 Bentley, ran up credit card bills of some £150,000 and diverted £130,000 of company funds into his wife's business.Fraud by employees last year amounted to £100m, up from £27m, with one Midlands woman stealing £250,000 over a two-year period from the vending company for which she worked, including £70,000 in coins."Internal frauds are becoming more prevalent and should set alarm bells ringing within organisations," Patel said. "In difficult times, they could even become the tipping point between the survival and demise of an organisation."Customers accounted for £65m of fraud on companies, up from £25m in 2007, including one fraudster who applied for a £130,000 mortgage from his prison cell.Accounting frauds were also on the rise in 2008 with 34 cases worth more than £145m, compared with 30 cases worth £22m in 2007. Mortgage fraud cases, which started to show an increase in the first half of 2008, continued to grow in the second half of the year, with 25 cases worth £36m across the year compared with only 10 cases worth £3.7m in 2007. More frauds are likely to emerge as property prices decline."Our restructuring teams are seeing far more cases of fraud," said Philip Davidson, European head of restructuring at KPMG. "For management teams, economic stress leads to personal stress."With falling revenues and often high levels of debt, managers of businesses may be tempted to massage figures to paper over the cracks in the hope that operational changes can be made to improve performance before creditors look more closely. Unfortunately, tweaking the figures can spiral out of control and, by the time the restructuring experts are called in, management are digging themselves further and further into a hole."KPMG plans to increase the number of forensic specialists working with its restructuring teams in order to make sure there was not any fraud involved in the company going under.
