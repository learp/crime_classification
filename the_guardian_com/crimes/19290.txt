Broadcasters including the BBC, ITV and Sky News are understood to have been cleared of breaking TV regulations by airing graphic footage of soldier Lee Rigby's murder.Media regulator Ofcom received nearly 700 complaints about TV news coverage of the Woolwich attack in which Rigby died on 22 May, which included graphic footage filmed by a member of the public on a mobile phone of one of the assailants with blood on his hands.Michael Adelbolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were convicted of murdering Rigby by a jury at the Old Bailey on Thursday.Ofcom has been investigating whether the broadcast of the footage before the 9pm watershed is in breach of the UK broadcasting code.It is understood that Ofcom has cleared all the broadcasters on the basis that showing the footage was in the public interest.In September Ofcom said that it had completed its investigation but was holding back publication of the ruling while the trial of the two assailants was ongoing.According to Ofcom's code, broadcasters must apply "generally accepted standards" meaning that any material they air which might be offensive or explicit must be able to be justified by context, such as whether children are likely to see it.Ofcom received complaints about the Woolwich coverage on 22 May broadcast by ITV News, BBC News, Channel 4 News, 5 News, Sky News and al-Jazeera. There were also two complaints about a BBC1 6pm news bulletin's follow-up coverage on 24 May.About half of the complaints are understood to have been about ITN-produced ITV News, which was the first to broadcast the graphic footage on its 6.30pm bulletin on the day of the murder.In May an ITV News spokesman defended the decision to air the footage as "editorially justified", saying that it was done on a "public interest basis as the material is integral to understanding the horrific incident".A spokesman for the watchdog said: "Ofcom plans to publish the full and detailed outcome of its investigations under the broadcasting code in its regular broadcast bulletin, with the next one due out early in the new year."• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
