A man was found guilty today of failing to ensure the welfare of an animal after his dog was found to be dangerously overweight.Taz, a five-year-old border collie, was taken into the care of Brighton and Hove city council after his owner, Ronald West, ignored repeated orders to improve the animal's diet.At 40kg (88lb), the dog was twice its ideal weight, Brighton magistrates court heard.West, 62, was convicted in his absence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 after he failed to attend court for the hearing.Magistrates heard that the council's animal welfare officers first visited West's flat in Donald Hall Road, Brighton, in December last year after receiving a complaint from another resident.A statement from the visiting senior animal welfare officer, Sue Watson, described the flat as being in a "dreadful state", with dog faeces on the floor of every room and rubbish strewn everywhere.West was told to clean up the flat, exercise Taz and take him to the vet for advice on weight loss and to clip his claws, which were very overgrown.The court heard that, despite further visits from animal welfare and housing officers, Taz appeared to get even fatter.In March, the dog was taken away and put into council kennels.The court heard a transcript of an interview between West and council officers a few days later. Asked how the flat had come to be in such a state and why Taz had become so overweight, he said: "I'll put my hands up and say I'm guilty of [the dog] being overweight. But it wasn't deliberate." "You can be cruel with kindness."He said he fed the animal a tin of dog meat a day, but also gave the dog treats.He also said he used to regularly exercise the dog outdoors, but had become reluctant to do so after it had been attacked by a rottweiler as they walked in a local park.West got Taz the previous April from a friend who had told him he might be put down if an owner could not be found for him."My dog has never suffered. I love that dog," he said. "I'd rather hurt myself than hurt that dog, and I'd rather go without than let that dog go without."Magistrates were told that since being in council kennels, Taz's weight had reduced to just over 30kg, and he was able to walk much more comfortably than before.Sentencing was adjourned. West faces a maximum penalty of Â£5,000, six months' imprisonment, or being disqualified from keeping an animal.Councillor Geoffrey Theobald, cabinet member for environment, said of the verdict: "We hope today's court case will urge people to think twice before getting a dog."All dogs, but particularly border collies like Taz, need a good healthy diet and lots of exercise. Keeping a large dog shut indoors in a small space and overfeeding is a form of cruelty, and while our animal welfare team are happy to offer advice and information to dog owners, they will not hesitate to use the Animal Welfare Act to prosecute those who clearly have no intention of properly looking after their pet."
