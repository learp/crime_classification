A man was photographed brazenly riding a stolen bike down the Mall among thousands of other cyclists after it was taken from a participant in the Prudential RideLondon cycle event, police have revealed.Images of the man riding the Â£2,600 green Trek Madone 4.9 down the road which links Buckingham Palace with Trafalgar Square were taken by official event photographers.In images released by the Metropolitan police he is shown wearing a safety helmet as he rides the bike, which belongs to a 42-year-old man taking part in the event, after it was stolen close to Constitution Hill in nearby Green Park on 3 August.PC Charlotte Brierley, of Scotland Yard's cycle taskforce, said: "The victim was about to take part in the FreeCycle event when his bicycle was stolen."The theft took place in the middle of a very busy event and we are urging people who were there and may have seen anything to come forward."The bike was taken before the event started at 1pm by thieves who cut the lock, police said.The man is seen in the photographs wearing a blue cycle helmet, sunglasses, a blue and white striped T-shirt, beige/grey shorts and blue and white shoes.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "An official RideLondon photographer taking pictures of all riders participating captured the stolen bike, with race numbers still attached, being ridden along the Mall."The victim found the images posted online by official photographers and subsequently passed them on to the cycle taskforce."RideLondon saw up to 50,000 people take to the saddle to enjoy an eight-mile traffic-free route that took in many of London's most famous landmarks.Billed as the UK's largest mass participation cycling festival, it took place a year on from Team GB's gold rush on the road and in the velodrome at the London 2012 Olympic Games.Anyone with information about the theft can contact PC Brierley on 07768 928456 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
