The father of the murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor today called for a moral regeneration of Britain in memory of his 10-year-old son.Richard Taylor said he was deeply hurt by the wall of silence which was surrounding Damilola's fatal stabbing in Peckham, south-east London, as he returned home from an after-school computer class last November. Meanwhile, Damilola's mother, Gloria Taylor, has described how blood poured from her son's mouth as she embraced his body hours after his death. Damilola's family renewed their appeal for information today following a statement from detectives earlier this week that the hunt for those responsible could be over in a matter of days if a vital witness came forward.Mr Taylor blamed a lack of family values and moral discipline for the attack and for a subsequent "culture of hostility" which police say is preventing them from arresting the killers. He said that moral values had broken down in the UK and, while the public had been "very kind" after Damilola's death, he regretted bringing his family to this country. Mr Taylor said the community in Peckham was scared of giving evidence to the police, fearing reprisals from "the gangs that terrorise the area". He said: "I am very much disappointed by this reaction from the community. I know very well that they do have information on who has carried out this heinous act."The parents are irresponsible people, they don't have family values and its because of this that they don't have control over their kids." Mr Taylor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people who withheld information were also "criminals".He added: "People of Nigeria are shocked that a civilised country like the UK still has things like this happening. "We have violent acts going on in Nigeria but not the killing of a young boy like Damilola ... who was hacked down by children of no value." In a television interview to be shown tonight, Ms Taylor wept as she spoke publicly about her ordeal for the first time since his funeral last week."They took me from that spot to the hospital, just about reaching the hospital as they broke the news that he was already dead ... and I couldn't believe it was him," she tells BBC1's Crimewatch UK programme. "Then I pulled him, I pulled him and I put my head on him ... and all that came out from his lips was blood ... splashed over his face and just like a dream to me." Mr Taylor added: "I can't imagine my son dying there, his blood was there. It was a horrifying experience for me." The programme features a reconstruction of Damilola's last-known movements built up from CCTV footage. Fifteen people have so far been arrested in connection with the youngster's death on November 27 last year but no one has been charged. Damilola had only been in Britain for four months, after the family had moved from Nigeria to join Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor said a campaign in memory of Damilola would focus on deprived areas such as Peckham. He called on the government to make "drastic changes" in policy to foster "moral values and family values" especially regarding children carrying dangerous weapons. He said: "Parents are supposed to know that they don't have to rely on the government to bring up their children, it's their responsibility and it's on this that we are going to campaign."
