A former sandwich delivery driver has been found guilty of the rape and murder of 17-year-old Hannah Foster.Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 41, a father of two, was convicted at Winchester crown court today of the A-level student's murder, rape, false imprisonment and kidnap in March 2003. Kohli shook his head slightly as the jury returned its four unanimous verdicts after five and a half hours of deliberations. Hannah's sister Sarah and her mother sobbed and hugged each other while Hannah's father comforted them.During the trial, the court heard that Kohli abducted Hannah as she walked down a street yards from her home in Southampton after spending a night out with friends.Terrified, she called 999 hoping an operator would hear what was happening, but the call was terminated when she did not speak.She was raped in the sandwich delivery van before Kohli strangled her when he feared she might identify him. He dumped her body beside a road in West End, Hampshire, and returned home to his wife and sons.Four days later he fled the country, changing his name and creating a new life for himself in his native India.He was extradited to Britain in July 2007 after a media campaign led by Hannah's parents and Hampshire police. He claimed he was innocent and that he had been abducted, blindfolded and tied up on the night of Hannah's death and forced to have sex with the teenager.During the six-week trial he painted a picture of himself as a victim of a revenge attack orchestrated by a former colleague. Kohli said he owed the colleague Â£16,000 and had had an affair with his wife.
