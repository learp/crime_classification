Eric Joyce, the former Labour MP who now sits as an independent, was arrested earlier this month following what police described as an altercation with two teenagers in a London shop, it emerged on Tuesday.As well as detaining Joyce on suspicion of actual bodily harm (ABH), Scotland Yard said officers arrested a 14-year-old boy at the scene for possession of cannabis.The Metropolitan police said in a statement that police in Camden were called to a convenience store shortly before 10pm on 17 October after reports of a fight.“Upon arrival, officers found a man and two teenage boys involved in an altercation,” the statement added.Both Joyce and the teenager were taken to a central London police station for questioning and have been bailed to a date in early December pending further inquiries.The MP posted a statement on his website on Tuesday in which he said that he had detained a youth in a shop where damage had been done.“I asked the shopkeeper to call the police, and when officers arrived they arrested the youth and informed me that drugs had been recovered from the scene,” he added.“The officers also informed me that the youth had immediately made a complaint that I had assaulted him by detaining him. I was questioned by the police and told that because of my identity the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Metropolitan police press office would be informed of the incident.”Joyce added: “I will make no further comment for now, other than to say a) that no alcohol was involved and b) I am not in the habit of summoning the police if I feel that I am in the wrong.”• This article was amended on 29 October 2014. An earlier version said Joyce had been detained on suspicion of aggravated bodily harm. That has been corrected to actual bodily harm.
