A senior detective faces possible dismissal over his decision to ignore the rules governing the questioning of a suspect, even though his tactics led to the discovery of the bodies of two missing women.The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), described Det Supt Steve Fulcher's extraordinary interview of taxi driver Chris Halliwell on a remote hillside as "catastrophic", and said he should face a charge of gross misconduct.But the mother of one of the women whose makeshift graves were found following the exchange defended him and argued that the law was too biased in favour of suspects.Karen Edwards, who believes she would never have known what happened to her daughter, Becky Godden-Edwards, had Fulcher not broken the rules, said the officer should not be disciplined. "He's my hero and should not be punished," she said. "Everyone I speak to is outraged."Fulcher's troubles began when he ordered the arrest of suspect Halliwell five days into the operation to find 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan, who vanished from a nightclub in Swindon in March 2011.Believing O'Callaghan might still be alive, Fulcher ordered Halliwell to be taken to a hillside for a face-to-face chat. Halliwell was not read his rights or given the chance to have a solicitor at his side.Fulcher accepted he broke the rules but argued he believed O'Callaghan's right to life outweighed Halliwell's entitlement to be questioned lawfully.Halliwell led Fulcher to the spot where he had hidden O'Callaghan's mutilated body, before telling the officer he had killed another woman, Becky Godden-Edwards, some years previously and taking the officer to a field where her body was later found.But because Fulcher had broken the rules, details of his time with Halliwell were not deemed admissible in court.Halliwell was jailed for life for O'Callaghan's sexually-motivated murder, and is serving a minimum of 25 years, but did not face proceedings over Godden-Edwards as the only potential evidence linking him to her was the exchanges between officer and suspect.Though Godden-Edwards's mother is supportive of Fulcher, her father, John Godden, complained to the IPCC that the detective's actions led to the charge against Halliwell for the murder of his daughter being dropped.The IPCC said he had a case to answer for gross misconduct for breaches of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace) and for ignoring force orders over dealings with the media.IPCC deputy chair, Rachel Cerfontyne, said: "This investigation has been a highly unusual one. We will never know what may have happened if the Pace codes had been followed." Describing Fulcher's tactics as "catastrophic", the IPCC report said Pace and its codes of practice were "not optional", adding: "They are a fundamental part of the criminal justice process and exist to ensure the rights of suspects, and therefore the integrity of the whole process, are protected."The IPCC acknowledged Fulcher had supporters, "perhaps most notably Karen Edwards", but said Godden-Edwards's father had a "very different view".Speaking at her home in Swindon, Karen Edwards said without Fulcher's actions she would never have had closure."He's accused of breaching Halliwell's rights, but what about mine? Det Supt Fulcher should be hailed as a hero, not as someone who overstepped the mark," she said. Edwards is campaigning for the rules around Pace to be debated in parliament. "The Pace laws are rightly designed to protect the innocent, but now we are letting the criminals get away with murder."The IPCC also criticised dealings Fulcher had with journalists after Halliwell's arrest, saying he had continued to meet reporters after being told not to.It emerged earlier this year that Fulcher was back at work after a period of suspension. The police refused to give details of what he was doing now.
