The son of a multimillionaire Greek shipping tycoon arranged the torture and murder of a tenant who was getting in the way of a lucrative property deal, the Old Bailey heard today.Thanos Papalexis, 36, was facing the potential collapse of his fledgling property business when he organised the killing of a caretaker in a warehouse he was intending to purchase, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, told the court. The Greek businessman travelled to the United States after the murder and later confessed the killing to a prostitute with whom he was having a relationship, he said.His victim, Charalambos Christodoulides, 55, had been living in the warehouse in Kilburn, north London, for several years. His family reported him missing when he failed to turn up to his sister's house for Sunday lunch in March 2000.Police found Christodoulides's body in a vehicle inspection pit in the warehouse. He had been subjected to a sustained assault, Laidlaw said.Forensic scientists found evidence that Christodoulides had been restrained in a chair, bound and hooded, before being beaten and then strangled to death."The victim was a quiet, simple man who lived an isolated existence and he did not in any sense contribute to the circumstances in which he died," Laidlaw said.Mobile phone evidence showed that Papalexis and two Albanians who worked for him had been at the warehouse from 8am on Friday 10 March and stayed for three hours. Christodoulides was never seen alive again.The crown alleges that the property developer had ordered his two employees – Robert Baxhija, 28, and Ylli Xhelo, 35, both Albanian asylum seekers – to kill Christodoulides so that he could complete the £2m purchase of the disused warehouse. The victim lived in a flat in the property, owned by his brother-in-law, and refused to leave. Police found DNA evidence from all three defendants at the warehouse.Papalexis was in a "perilous financial position" with over £7m in debts from a disastrous property deal, and he was desperate to raise money to save his business, the court heard.The court heard that Papalexis had wanted to turn the warehouse site into luxury flats, but under pressure to make money quickly he drew up a deal to sell it on to a third party that would make him £300,000 overnight.After the killing Papalexis went to the United States, where he was arrested on an extradition warrant in November last year. All three defendants deny murder.The trial continues.
