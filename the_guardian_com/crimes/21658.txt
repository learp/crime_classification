A man spent a night in a police cell after being arrested for dropping an apple core, it was revealed today. A police community support officer attempted to issue Keith Hirst with a Â£50 fixed penalty notice, but he refused to give his name and address. The officer then called for help from a police officer, who arrested Hirst, 54, and took him to Swinton police station in Salford, Greater Manchester. The incident took place on April 21 as Hirst was leaving a post office. He was charged with littering and obstructing an officer, which he denied, and was held in custody until he appeared at Salford magistrates court the following day. The case was adjourned until a further hearing on April 29, when both charges were dismissed. Superintendent Ian Palmer, of Greater Manchester police, said: "Littering is an offence and GMP work tirelessly to ensure the streets are not only safe but also clean. "Officers are expected to challenge anyone seen littering and have powers to deal with this on the street. "It is regrettable that this incident has now been passed to the courts, but it has been done so due to the fact this man repeatedly refused to cooperate with police. "The matter could have been resolved if the man had given officers his details, he would also have been provided with the opportunity to challenge the fixed penalty notice if he felt that it was unfair. "We work closely with the city council and other partners and take a firm stance against all environmental crime."
