This is a transcript of a prepared statement John Darwin made to police on December 6 2007 while being questioned: "I am the above named person and this is my statement: It is my own hand and they are my words. There was never any intention to defraud anyone, or any business. The last clear thing I remember before any of this is a holiday in Norway in the year 2000. I have hazy recollections of being in a kayak, but I cannot remember the accident or anything leading up to it at all. It is, therefore, true to say that I do have some form of amnesia. It was some years later (I am still not sure when) that I turned up at the family home, though I don't know how I got there, and my wife was understandably shocked given that she thought I was dead. I soon realised that monies had been paid out on the basis that I was dead. By consideration of my mortgage agreement I knew that if I now alerted the relevant financial institutions to the fact of my still being alive I would be made bankrupt and still left with a huge amount of debt. I am very sorry for all the mess that this has caused by me not alerting the authorities sooner, but I was trying to protect my family. There is every intention of paying back whatever is owed and that is why I recently returned to London to make those arrangements. I would also like to add that my wife acted under extreme duress. My sons and the rest of the family knew nothing about things which occurred after my memory returned. To stress again, I have limited memory of what occurred between 2000 and the year I regained my memory, which is still unclear. I have read back the above and can confirm that it is true.
