One of two Ukrainian men being held over bomb attacks near three mosques in the West Midlands has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 82-year-old man.West Midlands police said the terror suspect, aged 25, was arrested on Saturday night in relation to "a further act of terrorism".A police spokesman said: "This arrest is in connection with the murder of Mohammed Saleem in Small Heath, Birmingham, on Monday 29 April."Saleem died after being stabbed in the back in Green Lane, Small Heath, as he made his way home from a mosque.Two Ukrainian nationals, aged 25 and 22, were detained by West Midlands police in Small Heath on Thursday by detectives investigating explosions at mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton between 22 June and 12 July. Saleem's family have been informed of the latest development in the inquiry, the police spokesman added.Assistant chief constable Marcus Beale, who is leading the investigation, said: "The murder of Mohammed Saleem now forms part of the wider West Midlands counter-terrorism unit investigation."The stabbing of Saleem, a highly-regarded and well-known figure in the local community, was described by detectives at the time as a "despicable" attack on a defenceless pensioner.A joint family statement read during a press conference at West Midlands police headquarters on 2 May described the victim as "a much-loved and respected community member".The statement read: "We can't express our feelings of sadness and devastation."It's hard to accept that our beloved father and grandfather has been taken from us in such a brutal way."Earlier on Saturday, counter-terrorism officers were granted additional time to question the Ukrainian nationals in connection with the explosions.Westminster magistrates' court granted officers up to seven days to question the men, who were initially detained on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.
