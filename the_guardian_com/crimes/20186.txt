A teenager who was ordered not to wear a hooded top as part of an antisocial behaviour order has been allowed to don it again after a court heard the ban breached his human rights.Under the interim Asbo, the 16-year-old was forbidden from wearing a hoodie or a baseball cap that could obscure his face. He was also prevented from entering certain streets in Portsmouth and barred from associating with named youths.At a second hearing, his solicitor argued that the hoodie ban should be dropped because an item of clothing did not affect whether or not someone committed a crime.William Ashton, representing the teenager, told Portsmouth magistrates court that the headwear ban is "a breach of his right to personal development".The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not attend the hearing.Portsmouth city council, which brought the original case, did not object to the clothing clause being removed from the interim Asbo.District judge John Woollard adjourned the case until the youth could be brought before him to decide whether a full Asbo should be applied.After the case, PC Andy Montague said: "Some people see baseball caps and hoodies as intimidating."Doug Jewell of Liberty, the human rights group, said: "The prime minister's wife and son wear hoodies and anyone accusing them of yobbish behaviour would be laughed at. An item of clothing doesn't commit a crime, it's the person who wears it."In May, a 16-year-old boy from Collyhurst Village, Manchester, became the first person to be banned under Asbo powers from wearing a hoodie. Dale Carroll would face prison if he wore a hoodie or cap in public for a five-year period under the conditions of the Asbo.But last month the high court backed a 15-year-old's claim that Asbo powers which could lead police to forcibly remove him from curfew zones breached his human rights.Â· Angus council in Scotland has approved the creation of a sculpture of a woman wearing a hooded top as a tribute to modern youth culture. Fine arts graduate Des Smith is making the bronze piece."The central idea of the work is to provoke discussion regarding the issues surrounding 'the problem of youth' and an often demonised and scapegoated section of modern society," he said.
