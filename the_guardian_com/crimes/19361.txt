The acclaimed "success" of the Metropolitan police's recruitment drive turned sour last night when it was revealed that all but four of its 218 new ethnic minority recruits were white and so did not count towards its sensitive race equality targets.Scotland Yard insisted the inclusion of Irish, Australian and Canadian recruits in its total figure for ethnic minority officers who joined the force between last March and September was no more than "an administrative error". But the home secretary, Jack Straw, was forced to concede that the drive to recruit more black and Asian officers had suffered a serious setback. He said there was no evidence the Met had tried to deliberately massage the figures. The Met's "error" is the second time in a month that Scotland Yard has had to admit a mathematical blunder over a sensitive political issue. Just before Christmas the Home Office was forced to announce that overall police numbers were going up, not down, because the yard had double counted 451 officers it had seconded to other forces. The mistake made a major difference to the debate over police numbers. This time the mistake stemmed from a decision by the Met to expand the number of ethnic minority groups it recognises within its ranks from nine to 19. Officers from mixed race backgrounds, from Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, those who regard themselves as black British, white Irish and other white groups such as Australian would be recorded separately for its records. But the yard mistakenly included the number of "white Irish" and "white other" in the totals of new ethnic minority recruits it sent to the Home Office. The effect was dramatic. It seemed the Met had been hugely successful in its drive to attract black and Asian recruits in the aftermath of the Stephen Lawrence murder.
