A teenage girl was jailed yesterday for using a mobile phone to film a fatal attack on an ill and drunken man, in a case which has established such so-called "happy slapping" filming as aiding and abetting serious crime.The 15-year-old broke down in tears as she was sentenced to two years' detention and training for what the judge called her "cruel and revolting" part in the violence which led to the death of 29-year-old Gavin Waterhouse in Keighley, West Yorkshire.She was told to film the attack by two drunken friends who were jailed last week for six- and seven-year terms. Leeds crown court heard that she had been handed the mobile by the pair and told "video this", with one of them giving her instructions on how to get a good clear picture.Yesterday the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was told by Judge James Stewart that she had to be made an example of, to deter others. The girl pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter after Waterhouse died alone in his bedsitter from a ruptured spleen.He had painfully made his way home after being punched and kicked repeatedly by the girl's friends, 19-year-old Mark Masters and 17-year-old Sean Thompson, on waste land behind Morrison's supermarket in Keighley.
