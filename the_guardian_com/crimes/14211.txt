The motherBaby P's mother had a lifetime's experience of dealing with social workers. She was brought up in Islington, north London, by a mother who had drink and drug problems. When she was young she was sent to a boarding school where she gained GCSEs, including English and IT. She moved in with Baby P's father when she was 16, but by the time their son was born, their relationship was falling apart. The final straw came when she chose not to take the baby's father to her school reunion, inviting her boyfriend. The court heard that she spent much of her time on the internet. In one email she wrote: "Life is bullshit ... People should stay away from me as I have always messed up everyone who's close to me. I'm a jinx to all I know."The boyfriendThe mother's boyfriend was described by witnesses as "simple" and incapable of writing proper text messages.
