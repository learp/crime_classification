Anti-gang police have made more than 500 arrests and seized weapons including 14 guns, a crossbow and a Samurai sword in a three-day blitz on London's crime network.A total of 515 arrests were made and a "huge" amount of drugs, cash and weapons seized as a result of the raids, spearheaded by the newly formed Trident Gang Crime Command.The crackdown involved almost 5,000 Metropolitan police officers and resulted in 253 people being charged with offences ranging from grievous bodily harm and possession of firearms to violent disorder and assault.A further 186 suspects were bailed pending further investigation, while 17 others received cautions. Eight penalty notices, one final warning and three reprimands were also issued. Forty seven suspects were released with no further action.The seized weapons included 14 guns, 37 knives and blades, CS gas canisters, a crossbow, a Samurai sword, 17 coshes and a dangerous dog. The firearms included a sawn-off shotgun, eight handguns (two semi-automatic), three imitation firearms, a Taser and a gas-powered gun.Detective Chief Superintendent Stuart Cundy, Trident Gang Crime Commander, said: "We are absolutely delighted that the carefully planned three days of operations have yielded such excellent results."The number of arrests and seizures of firearms send a clear message to those who persist in gang violence that we will pursue them relentlessly, using all the options at our disposal. But I would reiterate that we want to prevent young people getting involved in gang offending."We are working with other agencies to offer them routes out, such as the conflict resolution service we can refer people to, as well as other types of assistance from other statutory and voluntary partners."These results give us a valuable basis for moving forward in our intention of reducing gang crime and improving community support for what we want to achieve, namely protecting some of our most vulnerable victims and communities in London."The raids saw police seize drugs including half a kilo of crack cocaine in Southwark and 67 grams of heroin in New Cross, south-east London. Four cannabis factories were also uncovered.In Bexley alone, 50 tennis ball-sized packets of crack, two large compressed cases of skunk cannabis, 1kg of heroin and £10,000 in cash were seized, while in Brent, 668 mature cannabis plants were found. In Wandsworth, crystal meth was seized from a property along with a Taser.Police also recovered £254,000 in cash and more than 25 vehicles, including a £40,000 Mercedes. In the course of the three-day operation, top gang member targets in all 32 boroughs were visited.
