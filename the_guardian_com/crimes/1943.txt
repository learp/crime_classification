A police constable who also worked as a prostitute was jailed for 15 months yesterday after pleading guilty to misconduct in a public office. Victoria Thorne, 29, lived a double life as a uniformed Northumbria police officer while moonlighting as a Â£100-an-hour sex worker, Newcastle crown court heard. Judge John Evans told her: "It is plain that those who thought they knew you are at a loss as to how you came to be involved in such a seedy world." The former officer was in the dock with five other defendants. She joined Northumbria police in 2002 and four years later became a sex worker.
