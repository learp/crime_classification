The most comprehensive map of organised crime gangs in Britain will help police identify links between more than 30,000 individuals involved in the cartels running multibillion-pound criminal industries.Created over the last 12 months by Jon Murphy, Britain's national policing head for organised crime, the data shows for the first time how far from their base the tentacles of many gangs extend.The map provides the most detailed picture possible of the cartels and their links, and reveals that organised crime now reaches the corners of all 43 police force areas in England and Wales."What we now have with our crime mapping of these groups is a comprehensive picture of serious and organised crime, of who these people are, where they live and where outside of their own area their reach extends to. Now we can better co-ordinate our efforts and I believe we can do something about all these gangs," said Murphy."A force will be able to put in the name of one individual and see clearly who he is linked to, what he is involved in and how far across borders he operates."Despite the £6.6m announced today, police know significant new money to bring thousands of Mr Bigs and their footsoldiers to justice is unlikely to be forthcoming. Investigators cannot just rely on large, costly surveillance operations – instead, Murphy said the strategy would be to increase the use of the "Al Capone" approach, targeting organised criminals for other crimes in order to get them off the streets. "We have to be more like Eliot Ness," he said.Homing in on members of criminal cartels for everything from tax evasion to driving while disqualified was now a main part of the strategy to remove individuals from the streets, he said.Police are using the crime map and working with other agencies, including the UK Border Agency, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca) to prioritise the most serious cases and draw up hit lists of gangs across different regions.Murphy said the data revealed more than 4,000 cartels in Britain were involved in drug and human trafficking, counterfeiting, smuggling and piracy.Among the gangs are some that have been around for decades, including the Adams family from north London, whose leader, Terry Adams, is serving seven years for money laundering, and Manchester's Gooch gang, whose leader, Colin Joyce, was jailed for 39 years in April.The 30,000 individuals involved in organised crime were much more loosely organised than significant criminal gangs abroad, such as the Mafia and the Chinese triads, Murphy said.He said many were still operating from within the prison system, others had international connections with countries such as Somalia, while some had young teenagers as members, who used guns and knives to protect their drug business."Organised crime has been a cinderella for too long between the demands and costs of counter-terrorism and the national focus on neighbourhood policing," he said."There's never been the recognition until now on behalf of the government that the harms of organised crime play out in communities in the UK every day. The reality is that a lot of antisocial behaviour, burglary and vehicle crime people suffer in neighbourhoods is probably linked to organised crime."While the fight against terrorism receives £2.5bn a year, rising to £3.5bn in 2010-11, Soca receives about £400m to deal with organised crime.
