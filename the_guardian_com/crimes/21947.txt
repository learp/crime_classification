A man killed his next door neighbour's dog with a hoe following a long-running feud over her pets getting into his garden, a court heard yesterday.Neville Hill struck the border terrier over the head a week after warning Tricia Wales he would kill her dogs if they got into his garden again, Chichester magistrates' court was told.Hill, 48, is said to have told Wales he would become "the neighbour from hell" and make her "life a misery" following a disagreement over a right of way through his back garden.Wales, 60, of Yapton, near Arundel, West Sussex, has brought a private prosecution against Hill, a company director, alleging criminal damage. The blow fractured the dog's skull and it had to be put down.Hill has admitted striking the animal on 21 September last after it strayed on to his property but denies he meant to kill it.Wales's solicitor, Richard Orridge, said relations between his client and the defendant were fine at first when Hill moved in about four years before the incident took place."Unfortunately that deteriorated a short time afterwards with issues arising mainly in connection with Mr Hill's complaints about her dogs barking or getting into his garden and leaving dog mess on his grass," said the lawyer.Orridge said Wales – who lived in the cottage with her 15-year-old son, George, and three border terriers – did her best to secure the hedge that separated their gardens and supervised the dogs whenever they were outside.But a week before the hoe attack, Hill threatened to kill her dogs after one broke into his garden and grabbed one of his chickens.Wales said she and Hill had disagreed over a right of way she was entitled to use through his back garden. She only used it to take her rubbish out but one day found he had erected a gate with a lock.She told the court that when she asked for a key he told her: "I hate you, I want to get rid of you. I want to get away from you as quickly as I can, you and your rats." She said she took rats to refer to her dogs.Wales said she threatened to take him to court if he did not provide her with a key. "He said, 'You're going to regret this. I'm going to be the neighbour from hell. I'm going to make your life a misery.'"Wales said she did not see him again until the following week when she found one of her dogs lying unconscious on her doorstep after returning from the shops."I knew immediately what had happened. I knew the threat had been carried out."She said she carried the dog into the house and cradled it in her arms."Suddenly Hill came in and said, 'That's what I do to rats when they come in my garden.'"Magistrates heard the police were later called after Wales's former partner John Bain, 62, went next door to confront Hill.Hill is alleged to have told him: "I wish I'd killed the fucking lot of them." Bain attacked him, for which he accepted a caution.The animal never regained consciousness and was put down by a vet, who referred the matter to the RSPCA.But the charity said that under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 it would only prosecute if an animal had suffered, whereas the dog was rendered unconscious immediately by the blow, was not aware of its injuries and felt no pain.Hill, who has moved to Walberton, West Sussex, denies a charge of criminal damage.The trial is continuing.
