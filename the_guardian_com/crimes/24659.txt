A record 104 people died while in police custody or in accidents involving police cars last year, according to Home Office figures published yesterday.The number of people from ethnic minorities who died "during or after contact" with the police also rose from seven in 2001-02 to 22 last year. Ministers said the increase from 70 fatalities in 2001-02 to 104 last year was partly due to a new system of recording which meant every fatality that followed even limited contact with the police was now included. Under the old system the figure for 2002-03 would have been 77 - still an all time high. Three people died in police shootings. Forty were the result of traffic accidents during police chases. A further 40 died in custody or soon after being released, including eight in police stations. These included people who became unwell or took their own lives. The remaining 21 fatalities took place during other types of contact.
