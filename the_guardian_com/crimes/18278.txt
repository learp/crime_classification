A memorial to the murdered landscape architect Joanna Yeates could be set up at a "super hospital" where she had been helping to design internal green spaces for patients. North Bristol NHS trust said it would co-operate with BDP – the firm where 25-year-old Yeates and her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, worked – on the idea of a permanent memorial in Southmead, Bristol. Meanwhile, TV crews reconstructing what is known of Yeates' disappearance for BBC's Crimewatch have been using a special effects firm to cover the lane where her body was found on Christmas Day with fake snow.
