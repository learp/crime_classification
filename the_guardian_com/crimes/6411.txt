Police today called off their search of the garden of a convicted paedophile's former home in south London.The search operation began last week after claims that the bodies of people allegedly murdered by 72-year-old Leslie Ford-Thrussell were buried in the garden of the house at Walton Green, Croydon.The Metropolitan police said they would not be returning to the garden.Forensics experts began digging last Monday after claims in the Sun that Ford-Thrussell - jailed for 17 years in 2004 over a string of rapes and indecent assaults - could have buried bodies there up to three decades ago.However, police today released a statement reading: "We carried out a search and are satisfied there are no human remains there."It is believed they were tipped off a year ago when relatives of the home's former occupant Stephen Dedman wrote to its current owners claiming bodies could be buried there. Dedman, who died in the 1980s, had lived in the house before Ford-Thrussell. The Sun claimed Ford-Thrussell had operated a paedophile ring at the house with Dedman, who died in 1985, and a third man who could not be named.After the report, police cordoned off the building and began examining the garden for clues. Missing persons files from the early 1970s showed no outstanding cases that could have corresponded to the alleged murders.
