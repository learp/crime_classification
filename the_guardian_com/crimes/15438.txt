An Irish republican veteran's family have appealed for him to contact detectives over the murder of a Derry man in the city last week, according to police.The police service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said on Monday that close relatives of Kieran McLaughlin, who is wanted in connection with the fatal shooting of Barry McCrory at his flat last Thursday, want him to come forward.McLaughlin is the subject of an all-Ireland man hunt as the PSNI and Garda Síochána seek to track him down. The PSNI took the unusual step last Friday of naming the 58-year-old ex-republican prisoner as the chief suspect in the McCrory murder.The PSNI said people should not approach him.PSNI DCI Ian Harrison said there had been a number of unconfirmed sightings of McLaughlin in Derry."This whole incident has caused a significant degree of concern within the local community, and we have been liaising closely with Mr McLaughlin's family," he said.It has emerged that the murder may be linked to a personal vendetta rather than a murder officially sanctioned by the new IRA even though McLaughlin has been linked with the republican terror group.Meanwhile in Belfast the new IRA has issued death threats against two associates of Kevin Kearney, the man they murdered in the city last week.The father of four, whose body was found inside a lake in Alexandra Park in north Belfast last Wednesday, was buried earlier today.But the new IRA said in a further statement clarifying their role in the murder that two men from the Ardoyne area of north Belfast had 48 hours to leave Northern Ireland or face a "swift response". The dissident republican organisation accused the pair, named in the statement, of being drug dealers and part of a "highly organised criminal network".The PSNI confirmed this evening that they have arrested a 45-year-old man in north Belfast in connection with the Kearney murder.At requiem mass in Holy Family Church on Limestone Road on Monday morning, mourners were told that Kevin Kearney had loved and lived for his children.Father Paul Strain said: "Many words have been said about Kevin, good and bad, true and not so true. Ultimately the only word that really matters is the final word of God."The PSNI have set aside a special phone number for McLaughlin or anyone with information to contact them. The number is 02871 210 775.
