The "aunt" of Shannon Matthews became the latest family member to go to jail today after the huge investigation into the Yorkshire schoolgirl's staged kidnapping.Amanda Hyett was sent to prison for a year for making Â£35,885 in false benefits claims, which came to light when she was arrested on suspicion of helping in the nine-year-old's fake abduction in February 2008.Hyett, who referred to herself as Shannon's aunt, is the sister of Craig Meehan, the former partner of Shannon's mother.The 27-year-old mother-of-two had earlier admitted five counts of making a false statement to obtain benefits, one count of failing to notify a change of circumstances, and one of keeping a wrongful credit. Leeds crown court heard that she had lied about living with her husband, Neil Hyett, a bus driver, to get regular payments of income support and council tax benefit.Hyett was bailed after conviction at a previous hearing but warned that she would probably face jail. The recorder of Leeds, Peter Collier, told her: "This is a serious matter which you have admitted, and the likely sentence is prison."Sentencing her today, he said that he could not pass a suspended sentence because of the length of the fraud, the number of benefits involved and Hyett's lies. But he added that he had limited the term for a year because of mitigating factors, including domestic problems and the fact that "the extra money did not go to fund a lavish lifestyle".Hyett stood in the dock wearing a white blouse and grey and black cardigan, looking straight ahead as sentence was passed. She nodded slightly, as the recorder told her that she would serve half the term, but was otherwise expressionless.She and her husband lived next door to Shannon Matthews on the Dewsbury Moor estate in Dewsbury, and were among the most prominent campaigners during the 25-day national search. They were released without charge in connection with the scam, and later criticised Shannon's mother, Karen, when she was jailed for eight years for organising the plot.Hyett is the sister of Shannon's stepfather, Meehan, 23, a supermarket butcher who was also jailed after a police search in connection with the kidnap found child pornography on his computer. He was rehoused for his own safety after release.The pair's mother, Alice Meehan, 47, was also arrested on suspicion of obstructing police inquiries into Shannon's disappearance, but released without charge. Hyett's uncle, Michael Donovan, 39, is serving eight years for the kidnap, after police found Shannon in his flat at Batley, less than two miles from her home.Today's hearing was told by Craig Hassal, prosecuting, that the fraud began in 2004 when Hyett failed to tell the Benefits Agency that she had restarted her relationship with her husband after a split and was living with him again. She maintained the deception for four years.Hyett's barrister, Garrett Byrne, said in mitigation: "This is not a case of a professional gang planning a sophisticated fraud, but one of a single mother, for a large part of the time, who was intent on feeding her family rather than feeding some excessive lifestyle."He added that Neil Hyett, who left court in tears after the hearing, had compounded the problems."He went as far as to father a child with another woman," said Byrne. "He fully accepts that he can be described as someone who is completely feckless." He added that Amanda Hyett had been "completely taken in" by the Shannon fraud, which had lost her a large part of her previous extended family.Adele Hirst, regional fraud manager for the Department of Work and Pensions, said after the hearing: "Anyone who claims to be single when they're not in order to get money they are not entitled to, shouldn't think they can get away with it. As today's sentence shows, we do track down those guilty of benefit theft, we do bring them to court and they do get sent to prison."
