The home secretary, Alan Johnson, today tried to escalate the political row over "broken Britain" by urging the UK Statistics Authority to censure the Tories for new claims that violent crime has risen since Labour came to power.Johnson dismissed unpublished Conservative-commissioned calculations by the House of Commons library showing violent crime has risen by 44% since 1997 as a "concocted deception".The home secretary wrote to Sir Michael Scholar, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, asking him to intervene to ensure accuracy in the way politicians comment on crime statistics. He said the more authoritative British Crime Survey showed that violent crime had fallen by 41% since 1997.The row deepened as Labour issued a party video in effect accusing the Conservatives of being the "criminal's friend" because of their opposition to the growth of CCTV cameras and retaining DNA of innocent people, and for voting against mandatory sentences for gun crime.Labour highlighted the Conservatives' record on DNA, where they have been voting in the Commons to reduce the time limit for retention of profiles of unconvicted people from six years to three.Scholar reprimanded the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, last month for "misrepresenting data" on crime figures, after he compared levels of violent crime as recorded by the police in recent years with figures from before 2002, when recording methods were overhauled.The latest Conservative figures claim a 44% rise for violent crime, from 618,000 offences in 1998 to 887,000 in 2009, having stripped out 24% of the increase to account for the new recording methods.But Johnson claimed tonight that this was misleading as the 24% figure had come from a National Audit Office study which referred to only one year's impact of the changes in the recording standards. The Home Office made clear at the time that the police violent crime figures were artificially inflated by the recording changes for at least two to three years afterwards.Johnson said: "The Tories have an obligation to tell the true story rather than the pulp fiction version designed to fit in with their PR strategy. The truth for the Conservatives is that, without this deception on crime, the big fat lie about so-called 'broken Britain' collapses."Grayling said tonight the Conservatives would take no lessons on law and order from a government that let 80,000 prisoners out of jail early, leaving them free to commit horrendous crimes. "Gordon Brown's administration has been soft on crime and soft on the causes of crime."Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, agreed that the Tories were wrong to claim that crime had been rising. But he added that Labour was also wrong to take the credit for the fall in crime, arguing that technology and demographics had had more impact than government action.
