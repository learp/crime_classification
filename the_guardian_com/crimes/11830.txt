Six members of a drug smuggling racket that saw £166m worth of cocaine imported into the UK have been jailed. The men were arrested as part of Operation Bayban, a Metropolitan police inquiry into a criminal network involved in the importation and onward supply of more than 500kg of class A drugs.Besnik Berisha, 57, was sentenced to 14 years and three months imprisonment; Xen Mucaj, 39, was jailed for 15 years and nine months; and Akili Ismalaj, also known as Antonios Kontaktsis, 30, was sentenced to 15 years and nine months. Also jailed were Marijn Kolaj, 20, for 10 years and six months, Shpetim Xhamxhiu, 33, for nine years, and Denis Cangu, also known as Emilio Longhi, 23, for seven years and six months.They had all pleaded guilty at Kingston crown court to conspiracy to supply class A drugs. A seventh man, Koui Admir, 27, from Enfield, was sentenced to six months after pleading guilty to money laundering.Berisha imported up to 50kg at a time using his Iveco HGV. He would enter the UK every 10 to 14 days carrying a legitimate load, with the drugs stashed in the cab. During his journey he would meet Kolaj, Xhamxhiu or Mucaj, and hand over the drugs. They would then be taken to addresses in north London for onward distribution, or for mixing with other substances.Berisha, Kolaj and Xhamxhiu were arrested in 9 May last year, and almost 50kg of cocaine and heroin was recovered. A search of a property where Mucaj and Admir were arrested revealed around £10,000 cash and a false UK passport. A search of another property, where Cangu was arrested, turned up 21kg of “mixing agent”, a drug press, scales and other drug-related paraphernalia.The investigation found that Kolaj and Xhamxhiu were travelling to Northampton to supply class A drugs to a criminal network based in Wellingborough. Ismalaj was arranging and facilitating the supply of drugs from within prison, using a smuggled mobile phone.
