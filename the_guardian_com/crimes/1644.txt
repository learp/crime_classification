An international rugby player wept yesterday as he was sentenced for biting a three-year-old boy during playfights.Dominic Feaunati bit the boy on three separate occasions, leaving him with marks on his chest and arms. Feaunati, 26, who represents Samoa in rugby league, was ordered to do 200 hours' community service and pay Â£1,500 compensation to the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Feaunati had told police he caused the marks during horseplay. He said: "We were just play fighting on the carpet and I didn't mean to bite through the skin." Passing sentence at Liverpool crown court, Judge Sean Duncan said: "I accept that when you injured the child, it was not your intention to harm him. "However, I'm satisfied that you were aware that what you were doing was reckless and inappropriate. Clearly the child must have reacted to those bites. "I accept that you were playing with the child and I accept there was robust play. "But a big strong chap like you and a very small child - it is all down to how you behave in play and you know you went too far." Last month Feaunati admitted three counts of assault causing actual bodily harm to the boy in June. The player joined St Helens rugby league club from New Zealand rugby union side Wellington a year ago. St Helens has supported him throughout proceedings.
