Twenty-two pubs and off-licences face fines of up to Â£10,000 and three-month bans from selling alcohol after being caught repeatedly serving underage teenagers, the Home Office disclosed today.The unprecedented penalties follow the latest enforcement campaign, during which police and trading standards officers examined 2,683 premises over a period of 10 weeks.The campaign, which ran across England and Wales from May to July, found that only 15% of pubs and shops were prepared to sell alcohol to teenagers in trials where children requested drink in 9,000 test purchases.Home Office ministers said the results of the campaign could be set against a 20% failure rate last year and a 50% failure rate in 2004, when the annual exercise began.Vernon Coaker, the minister for crime reduction, said the results showed that recent efforts to clamp down on underage sales were beginning to pay off. "I know the industry has made significant efforts in recent years to educate staff and strengthen procedures. It is clear that the Challenge 21 policy, under which all those who appear to be under 21 are asked for identification, is now becoming established as standard practice."The 22 pubs and shops which now face hefty fines and bans were discovered selling alcohol to under-18s at least three times during the sting operation by police and trading standards officers. A further 224 licensed premises were caught twice and could now have their licences reviewed.
