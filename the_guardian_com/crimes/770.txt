A former British boxing champion was fatally shot after asking a group of men to stop smoking, the Old Bailey heard today.James Oyebola, 46, died four days after being shot at a club in Fulham Broadway, west London, in July last year.Oyebola was a successful boxer who won the British heavyweight championship. He won a bronze medal in the 1986 Commonwealth games, losing to Lennox Lewis in the semi-final, the court heard.He was drinking at Chateau 6, owned by a friend, when he was shot in the neck and leg.Kanyanta Mulenga, 23, of Putney, Rene McKoy, 20, of Battersea, Cyle Carth, 18, of Wimbledon, and Dean Francis, 24, of Wandsworth, all south-west London, deny murder and affray.The prosecutor, Jeremy Donne QC, said Oyebola never regained consciousness. "The reason for the killing was particularly senseless. James Oyebola had become involved in a dispute over smoking inside the club."In the course of the confrontation with these four defendants, one of them produced a gun and fired four bullets - two striking the hapless Mr Oyebola."Donne said Oyebola sat in a small courtyard known as the garden bar at the back of the building. "This space has a retracting roof and, even though it can appear to be an open space, it is in fact part of the enclosed premises and therefore subject to the smoking ban that had been recently introduced," Donne said."A number of witnesses assumed he was a bouncer, partly because of his size â€“ six feet nine inches and powerfully built - and partly because he was asking people not to smoke in the garden area."He did so in a perfectly pleasant way and no one took offence."Donne said the defendants were among 50 people at a party in the club.
