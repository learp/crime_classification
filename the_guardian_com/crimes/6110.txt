A newspaper has instructed lawyers to demand that the Metropolitan police withdraw a "chilling" harassment warning against one of its journalists who approached a convicted fraudster for comment as part of an investigation.Gareth Davies, chief reporter on the Croydon Advertiser, was served with a "prevention of harassment notice" by three Metropolitan police officers at the newspaper's office after he contacted Neelam Desai, 33, who is to be sentenced this month after pleading guilty to a series of frauds.The newspaper said that as Davies explained his actions and showed police emails he had sent Desai, one officer told him: "You say you were just doing your job, but that's what the News of the World and the phone hackers said."Human rights and media organisations condemned the police action as an intrusion on press freedom. Kirsty Hughes, CEO at Index on Censorship, said: "This is a very worrying case. A journalist pursuing a serious case through questions and requests to interview is a world away from illegal phone-hacking and yet the police appear to be conflating the two in threatening a harassment case. The police need to show that they fully respect the role and responsibilities of a free media."James Welch, legal director for Liberty, said: "All too often the police seem to hand out harassment notices without adequate investigation or consideration of the validity of complaints."Reporters doing their job properly should try to put allegations to those they write about; the police should be wary of discouraging good journalistic practice with these chilling warnings."The Croydon Advertiser said today it has instructed lawyers to write to the Croydon borough commander, urging that the harassment notice against Davies be withdrawn at the earliest possible opportunity.Its senior editor Glenn Ebrey said: "The idea that Gareth could be criminalised for simply doing his job and trying to, himself, expose possible criminality, is absurd."We will be doing all we can to get this ludicrous notice expunged and hope common sense eventually prevails."Davies, 29, who had contacted Desai for comment on fresh allegations against her, said the "frustrating" experience had left him with an impression some police officers feel like "it's open season for journalists".In addition to the frauds she pleaded guilty to, Desai has also been accused of conning at least three men, while she was on bail for the previous offences, out of thousands of pounds through a complex dating website scam.Davies said it was not until the Croydon Advertiser started to pursue the fresh allegations against Desai that the police took notice – and are now investigating the new claims."They were very efficient investigating me but they've been inefficient investigating very serious allegations," he said.Earlier this month, Desai admitted a string of offences at Croydon Crown Court including fraud, running a business while bankrupt, handling stolen goods and selling bogus iPhones.After the case, the Croydon Advertiser was contacted by a number of victims who said they had been conned while she was on bail.She allegedly set up a fake profile on an Asian marriage website – Shaadi.com – using the photograph of an attractive marketing manager she stole from Facebook to lure men. One 35-year-old from Leicester claims he lost his business after being conned out of £35,500.Davies said he first approached Desai at her home on 4 March to give her a right to reply, and then sent two emails detailing the accusations and "politely" asking her for a comment.Desai initially alleged assault against Davies – but has since retracted the accusations, the paper said. However, she later claimed the emails she received, and the stories written by the paper, were harassment.Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said: "This is a ridiculous misuse of a law originally introduced to deal with stalkers. It is also extremely silly."It is time someone gave the police an injection of common sense. It seems some police officers do not understand that the media is simply a conduit to the public who they are supposed to serve and who have a right to know."If this is a reaction to critical headlines about the police, they have only themselves to blame for increasing public concern about their behaviour."A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "The harassment letter was issued by a local safer neighbourhood team in response to a number of reports from the woman, who felt she was being harassed. The officers did this to ensure that the reporter was fully aware that allegations of harassment were being made against him."The woman first contacted police on 5 March and the most recent 1 April."
