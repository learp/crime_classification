I read with interest about the justice minister scrapping the Titan prisons project (Report, 25 April). Opting for prisons with 1,500 prisoner capacity may be a bit misleading, as there are no prisons built for that capacity at present. Wandsworth prison may hold 1,640 prisoners, but its accommodation is only for about 1,100, hence overcrowding. I believe that the Inspectorate of Prisons uses a benchmark for prisons holding up to 800. Beyond that, it gets more difficult to assess the impact of prisons and their regimes. As for the private sector building and staffing them, I wasn't aware that banks were going to lend such money for what will be a costly project. As the banks are almost nationalised already, the public sector may as well use the taxpayers' money already there and build them themselves. On a final note, if we have the lowest crime figures for 10 years, why has the prison population soared and there is an expectation for it to rise to 96,000 by 2014. If crime figures are falling, it would be a bad investment to build prisons. Perhaps the ministry could make its mind up about crime statistics and an increasing prison population.
