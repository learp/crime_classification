The criminal past of the serial child killer Robert Black has been revealed to a jury in Northern Ireland, where he is accused of kidnapping and murdering a nine-year-old girl 30 years ago.Armagh crown court heard that the Scottish van driver has already been convicted of murdering three girls, abducting a fourth, and attempting to snatch another. Black, 64, whose work in the 1980s took him all over the country in his delivery van, is accused of killing nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy. She was abducted as she cycled to a friend's house in the County Antrim village of Ballinderry in August 1981.Her body was found six days later, floating at a beauty spot known as McKee's Dam 10 miles away near Hillsborough, County Down. She had been sexually assaulted.Black's criminal record could not be disclosed to the jury during the first eight days of his trial for legal reasons.But Toby Hedworth, QC, prosecuting, told the jury yesterday: "The stage in the trial proceedings has been reached when I can tell you."Hedworth revealed that Black had been convicted of murdering three girls in the 1980s – Susan Maxwell, 11, Caroline Hogg, five, and 10-year-old Sarah Harper – and the attempted kidnap of a 15-year-old girl in 1988.Hedworth said the London-based delivery driver's reign of terror ended 1990 when he was arrested near Stow in Scotland with a six-year-old girl gagged, bound and stuffed head first into a sleeping bag in the back of his van. He pleaded guilty to her abduction.Police subsequently linked him with the three murders, the attempted abduction of the 15-year-old, and a series of other offences.He was found guilty on all counts in 1994 at Newcastle upon Tyne crown court. Hedworth said Black's past crimes did not in themselves make him guilty of Jennifer's murder, but claimed that striking similarities between the cases would prove it.He told the jury: "What you certainly must not do is say, 'well, he's done those other ones, he's a thoroughly bad man so we'll find him guilty in this case as well.'"What you have to do is look at what he has been proved to have done in respect of those other girls and see whether it assists you in deciding whether you can be sure that it was Robert Black rather than some other individual who abducted and killed Jennifer Cardy."The prosecution will submit that the similarities between Jennifer's case and those other cases make it clear that they were in fact the work of the same man."Hedworth said Jennifer's disappearance had distinct similarities with the sexual fantasies Black revealed to police in 2005.The trial continues.
