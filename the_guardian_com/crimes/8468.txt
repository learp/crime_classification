A new crime of "adult sexual activity with a child" and a reform of the law on rape are to be included in an overhaul of Britain's laws on sex offences, to be introduced into parliament this year. The new catch-all criminal offence, the first of its kind anywhere in the world, recognises that sexual activity between adults and children is unacceptable, and that some cases are so serious that they warrant a life sentence.Ministers also want to strengthen the law on rape to tackle the appallingly low 9% conviction rate and define consent by setting the prosecution the lower test of proving that the victim had not given their "voluntary and genuine agreement".The government will also tell police and courts to start recording child sex abuse cases immediately so that they appear separately in the official crime figures, ending wild speculation over the extent of the problem.Ministers began this week to thrash out their detailed response to an internal Home Office review of the law on sex offences published in July 2000.The new crime of "adult sexual activity with a child" will replace the seven different sex offences used to prosecute in child sex cases such as indecent assault, intercourse with a girl under 13, gross indecency and buggery. Ministers believe the law is unnecessarily complex with different crimes covering boys and girls, some with different age limits, and with wildly differing penalties and defences.Certain offences, such as unlawful sexual intercouse with a girl under 16 and gross indecency, carry time limits which mean that cases cannot be brought more than 12 months after the time of the offence, making inquiries into child abuse allegations going back many years very difficult.It is expected that the new offence would apply to a man or woman over 18 who was involved in a sexual act with a child under 16. This would ensure that all children under 16 get the same kind of protection. The law would cover those who incited, induced or compelled a child to carry out a sexual act whether on the accused, another person or the child himself.Ministers want to call the new offence "adult sexual activity with a child" rather than "adult sexual abuse of a child" so it might include offences involving no physical contact such as a recent case where a man incited two young girls to undress.The offence would cover an adult who forced a child to witness a sexual act whether it was live or recorded. It would ensure that much heavier penalties were available to courts for child sex offences. It is also expected that the offence would not carry any time limits.The changes in the law on rape will not see the introduction of a lesser offence of "date rape" which ministers believe is just as traumatic as stranger rape. The legal concept of "consent" however is to be clarified and defined as "voluntary and genuine agreement".It would still be for the prosecution to prove that the woman did not consent to sex if the defence said she did, but the law will list examples where such consent is not present. They include where a person was asleep or too affected by alcohol or drugs to give "voluntary and genuine agreement".
