Ministers are urging the courts to put more defendants under a curfew backed by an electronic tagging system instead of remanding them to prison to curb the rapid rise in the jail population. The emergency measure is being taken after the prison population in England and Wales hit an all-time high of 77,774 a fortnight ago - 525 short of capacity.Home Office minister Patricia Scotland told MPs investigating the link between prison overcrowding and deaths in custody yesterday that the increase in the remand population had been particularly sharp, with more people being held in prison before trial and for longer periods.She said that so far this year there had been 66 deaths, a fall of 25% compared with the same period in 2004. One in four inmates was now "doubled up", with two sharing a cell designed for single occupation, which could protect against suicide, Lady Scotland said.Up until now, tagging has mainly been used in the home detention curfew scheme for those getting an early release. So far, 15,000 have been released up to four months early and put under a 12-hour curfew. "At one time the availability of tagging was seen to be patchy, and it was seen to be expensive. It's no longer expensive and it is universally available," Lady Scotland told the Commons home affairs select committee.
