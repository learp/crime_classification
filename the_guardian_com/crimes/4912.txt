A 14-year-old boy is being questioned by police after he allegedly stabbed at least 20 fellow pupils with a medical instrument.Nottinghamshire police said the boy was believed to have used a diabetic pen, which contains a short needle, in the incident at Toot Hill school in Bingham on Wednesday. The school described the instrument as a medical lancet, used to make small incisions. Parents have been informed and advised to get their children tested for infections, although the risk is low, the school said.A spokesman said: "The incident that occurred on 13 June has been dealt with by the school in a prompt and appropriate manner. The investigation of the incident has not yet been completed, but we have established that a 14-year-old boy acquired a medical lancet (8mm in length) and used it to prick around 20 others. The school's first action was to contact the relevant parents and provide appropriate medical advice as ascertained from the Health Protection Agency."The agency emphasises the extremely low health risk associated with incidents of this nature."Police said 26 pupils had had their skin pierced, describing the injuries suffered as "minor".The school urged people to take "a proportionate view of events in order to prevent unnecessary anxiety".The headteacher, John Tomasevic, told the BBC: "From what we can tell at this moment in time – evidently we are still investigating it – it wasn't malicious, it was more in fun and trying to get a reaction."The school said the boy who carried out the attack had been suspended for five days. Police said he was in custody after being arrested and would be questioned by officers on Friday.
