A 22-year-old man has been charged with the murder of missing 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson, Thames Valley police have said.Ben Blakeley, of Christchurch Road, Reading, has also been charged with perverting the course of justice and will appear at Oxford magistrates court on Monday morning.A 17-year-old boy who is being questioned on suspicion of murder remains in police custody.Jayden was last seen on CCTV leaving Didcot Parkway railway station, in south Oxfordshire, at 4.30pm on 3 December.Specialist officers are carrying out searches in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and have asked the public not to carry out their own searches as they say it could endanger their investigations.Jayden had moved out of her family home in Didcot to an homeless hostel in Oxford a few weeks before she vanished.Specialist search teams backed by helicopters and police dogs have been searching for any trace of Jayden. Throughout the weekend, police continued a detailed search of an area of farmland just outside the village of Upton, near Didcot, where they appear to be focusing their efforts on a small patch of woodland near the church.The police's inquiry team has grown to more than 100 officers and Supt Christian Bunt said the existing searches could continue for days.Her mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, posted a message on social media site Facebook saying: "My baby, my princess, my heart is so heavy, baby girl. I just want to see you walk through my door with a 'ta-dar'. I need you little lady, my heart feels so empty without you."Bunt said officers were continuing to sift a grassy area of wasteland in the Lydalls Road area of Didcot. Residential addresses have been searched and a recycling bin was removed for examination.Bunt said Jayden had not used her mobile phone or bank account since going missing, which had led detectives to believe she may have been killed.Police have pieced together her movements in the runup to her disappearance and believe she walked up Oxford's High Street through the town centre, arriving at the train station at 4.07pm, where she boarded a train to Didcot. DCS Andy Murray said police wanted to trace a man seen with a large suitcase in a field in the small village of Upton in the early hours of 9 December. He said: "That suitcase was large, it was heavy, it was difficult to manage and that man was having difficulty removing that suitcase from that area."Murray said the same man was seen in Didcot about half an hour later. He is described as about 20, white, about 5ft 6in, of medium to slim build, with short dark hair.Jayden is white, of slim build, with shoulder-length dark brown hair and brown eyes. When last seen, she was wearing light-blue faded jeans, a brown hooded top with red lettering on it, a black waist-length jacket and dark trainers.
