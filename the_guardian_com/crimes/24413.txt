Charles Kennedy today sought to "debunk" Labour's charge that the Liberal Democrats are "soft on crime" by outlining how the party would tackle antisocial behaviour.The Liberal Democrat leader said antisocial behaviour orders, known as Asbos, should in future be used only "in conjunction with action to tackle the underlying cause of these problems" in a scheme he called Asbo Plus.This would involve the intervention of youth workers to divert offenders into "positive activities", social workers to "encourage families to pull together" and drug workers to tackle substance abuse, as well as the introduction of education and training "for those who are excluded from school or unemployed".In an apparent U-turn, Mr Kennedy said the Lib Dems now supported Asbos, which they voted against last year because of their opposition to dispersal orders, as a means of providing "short-term relief" in many communities."As a sticking plaster, Asbos can work, as can the judicious use of dispersal orders," he said. "But unless there is also a strategy for changing the behaviour of offenders we either push the problem behind closed doors or shunt it from one community to another."Mr Kennedy then attacked the government for being "tough on rhetoric but weak on solutions" with a "piecemeal, kneejerk, headline-chasing" approach focusing on "the symptoms - the criminals - at the expense of sound policies aimed at tackling the disease: crime itself".His comments, at the National Liberal Club, came after the Labour party bombarded the Lib Dems with criticism over their "weak" stance on law and order, particularly during the recent byelection campaigns in Hartlepool, Birmingham and Leicester.Defending his party's "tough liberalism" proposals against "Labour's myths", Mr Kennedy said the government liked to reduce the complex social problem of crime to a "tabloid crusade against yobs". "By attempting to paint the solutions designed to tackle the roots of criminality as 'soft' - as they consistently did in Leicester, Birmingham and Hartlepool - Labour seek to deflect the real debate about how to deal with crime, security, law and order," he said.
