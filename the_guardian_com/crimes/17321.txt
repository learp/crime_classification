One of the killers of the toddler James Bulger is back in prison after breaching the terms of his licence, the government confirmed yesterday.Jon Venables, now 27, has been given a new identity since his release from prison for his part in the 1993 murder which horrified the nation due to the savagery of the crime, the age of the perpetrators, and the age of the victim.Venables and Robert Thompson, both 10 at the time, abducted and murdered James, two, in February 1993.James was taken from a shopping centre in Liverpool and found on a railway line having been beaten with bricks and an iron bar. Venables and Thompson, who were truanting from school, walked James around the streets of Liverpool for more than two miles, stopping occasionally to kick and punch him. They told adults who intervened that he was their brother.Last night, James's mother Denise Fergus, 42, said through a spokesman she believed the public should be told what Venables had done to trigger his recall to prison."Denise has always said she did not believe that it was safe to parole Venables and Thompson at 18, before they had ever spent a day in an adult prison," the spokesman said."She believes this breach of parole shows that she was right … But she believes that she and the public have a right to know what Venables has done and what is to be done with him now he is an adult offender."The Ministry of Justice refused to say what Venables had done to breach his licence. It also refused to confirm or deny whether it involved an act of violence against a person or any other criminal act.The conditions placed on the killers after their release included that they did not contact each other, and that they stayed away from the Liverpool area.Michael Wolkind QC said he thought there was a "significant chance" the breach had been serious.He said: "Licence is a means of controlling people once they are released. Now this has been publicised, I think there must be a possibility of his new identity being exposed in prison and the inference must be it was a serious breach."To go to all the trouble of building him a new identity and a new life, there must be a significant chance it was serious."Venables and Thompson were released from custody in 2001, having been the youngest people to be charged with murder in 20th century Britain.They were convicted following a trial at Preston crown court and ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, the usual sentence for life imprisonment when the offender is a juvenile.Trial judge Mr Justice Morland told the pair they had committed a crime of "unparalleled evil and barbarity".Venables and Thompson were given life sentences for the murder and will remain on licence for the rest of their lives.CCTV images of James's abduction were seared into the nation's consciousness, with the pictures showing the toddler being led away by the hand.On their release, the pair were given new homes, new passports and new national insurance and social security documents.The media were also gagged from revealing their new identities or where they lived.Yesterday evening's statement announcing Venables's recall to prison was made by the government, before his breach of his licence conditions were revealed by a newspaper.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation union, said: "The fact that the statement has been put out today does not mean he has been recalled within the last 24 hours."It's more likely that information about his whereabouts has leaked and the Ministry of Justice has taken a proactive step to limit the damage. He will now be in an adult prison somewhere in England and Wales."If the usual procedures are followed, Venables will appear before the Parole Board within 28 days of his recall and it will consider how serious the breach is. The board will also decide whether to recommend Venables for release.David Blunkett, who as home secretary told the House of Commons of the Parole Board's decision that Venables should be released in 2001, said: "It is with great regret that I have learned of the breach – but it is a great credit to the professionals undertaking the supervision and the continuing follow-through work that action has been taken and the original terms enforced."The Ministry of Justice said: "We can confirm that Jon Venables has been recalled to custody following a breach of licence conditions. Offenders on licence are subject to strict conditions; if they breach those conditions they are subject to immediate recall. There is a worldwide injunction in place that prohibits any reporting that could identify Jon Venables or his location."
