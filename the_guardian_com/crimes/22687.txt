The attorney general dealt the home secretary, John Reid, a humiliating rebuff yesterday when he refused to refer to the appeal court the five-year minimum term imposed on a paedophile who kidnapped and sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl. But the case of Craig Sweeney is likely to lead to changes in the system of giving automatic discounts of up to one third off the sentences of those who make early guilty pleas; ministers are conducting an urgent review of the rules with an announcement to be made this month.Lord Goldsmith said that he had decided not to refer the sentence on Sweeney, in his role as guardian of the public interest, and without regard to pressure from politicians or the press.The mother of the child victim said she was "gut-wrenchingly sick" over the decision - Sweeney "was literally found with our child's blood on his hands".The Home Office said last night that Mr Reid stood by his view that it was an "unduly lenient" sentence: "He is committed to protecting the public from violent and sexual offenders, and remains concerned about sentencing arrangements. That is a concern which is shared by his colleagues, including the attorney general, and they intend to make the necessary changes by reviewing the system."Sweeney was at the centre of a public outcry last month over the sentencing of serious sexual offenders. To Lord Goldsmith's irritation, the home secretary criticised the sentence within hours of it being passed and said he would be writing to the attorney general to ask him to consider referring the case to the court of appeal.The constitutional affairs minister, Vera Baird QC, also criticised the sentencing last month in an interview with the BBC - making comments which she was later forced to retract. "I'm critical of the judge for three reasons", she said: "starting too low; deducting too much for the guilty plea; and getting the formula wrong."The junior minister later wrote an apologetic letter to Lord Falconer, saying she fully supported the government's position.Lord Goldsmith said yesterday that he had taken advice from independent, specialist lawyers and was satisfied that "as the law stands and on current sentencing guidelines, the court of appeal would not interfere with this sentence. Accordingly, I cannot refer his [Sweeney's] case to the court of appeal." The attorney general said the five-year "tariff" or minimum term did not mean that Sweeney, who was given a life sentence, would be released after five years. It would be up to the parole board, when he applied for release, to decide whether he was still dangerous. "Given his past history, Sweeney may never be released."He said that Judge John Griffith Williams, who sentenced the paedophile to life last month, was acting within current sentencing guidelines when he set the term, after which he could apply for parole after five years and 108 days.The judge had decided that 18 years would have been the correct sentence if he were imposing a fixed term, rather than life. He deducted one-third for a guilty plea, giving a 12-year term. Then he deducted a further 50% because prisoners given fixed term sentences generally serve only half the term in prison. That brought it down to six years, and the further discount was for time Sweeney had spent in custody on remand.Lord Goldsmith said the government review of the criminal justice system, announced last month, would look again at the discounts.He said that he, the home secretary, and the lord chancellor were "in complete agreement that we need a criminal justice system which protects the public, particularly vulnerable children, and in which the public has confidence", and would be making an announcement on sentencing before the summer recess.
