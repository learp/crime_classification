A former nursery worker was warned he may spend the rest of his life in prison after he admitted raping a toddler in his care and a string of offences involving young girls whom he groomed online using fake profiles.The full extent of Paul Wilson's crimes only came to light when police investigated a single complaint against him from a young girl he had abused over the internet.When officers raided his flat in Birmingham, they found images of him abusing a toddler at the Little Stars nursery.At Birmingham crown court, Wilson admitted two counts of raping a girl aged two or three years old and a further 45 charges of making and distributing indecent images and inciting youngsters to engage in sexual activity on the internet.The judge, William Davis QC, said it was "highly likely" an indeterminate life sentence would be imposed when Wilson is sentenced next month. "The public have to be protected from you," the judge said.Wilson, of Nechells, Birmingham, was charged with rape in January after his arrest on suspicion of child abuse prompted an investigation into his employment at the nursery, which was temporarily closed and later reopened.The investigation by West Midlands police revealed the extent of Wilson's online grooming of young girls whom he threatened if they did not comply with his wishes. All of the 22 victims were young girls aged between 12 and 15.One of Wilson's internet victims, who is now 17, said she was left feeling shocked, violated and ashamed. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she now felt "pure hatred" for Wilson, with whom she communicated via MSN instant messaging and on the youth community site Netlog.The teenager initially engaged in normal conversations but was eventually pressured into exposing herself to Wilson via a webcam, and was then told that the images would be distributed if she refused to follow his orders.Asked to describe her emotions when she discovered what the nursery worker had done to other victims, she replied: "I felt violated – it just betrayed all my trust. I felt quite stupid and ashamed that I had succumbed to what he had asked me to do. To know that it was the same person who I was talking to and felt that I trusted and had a relationship with – it just made me feel I had been violated."It has really affected me in the way that I go on the internet now," she added. "I am really careful – I will stick to Facebook and only speak to people who I genuinely know in the real world."Wilson used multiple identities to befriend the girls on chatlogs and social networking sites. Detective Chief Inspector Gary Booth, who led the investigation, told a news conference that Wilson had manipulated and coerced his victims.He said: "This was a complex case in which Paul Wilson created multiple online identities to manipulate teenage girls and committed a serious sexual offence against a child attending the nursery at which he worked. His actions were clearly calculated and carefully considered."Booth said Wilson had abused his online relationships to satisfy his perversions and then used fear and guilt to keep the victims silent and force them to perform further sexual acts.After Wilson's arrest, Booth said, police officers had faced the difficult task of calling at the homes of victims of the abuse knowing that the lives of those inside would be "irrevocably changed".It is understood that images of the abuse of the toddler were found during the first few hours of the investigation into a single allegation of internet grooming. Wilson had no criminal record when he was detained and it is believed that appropriate checks on his background were conducted before he began to work at the nursery about 18 months earlier.Detectives described him as a confident and selfish offender who had posed as a talent scout for a modelling agency to befriend young girls and had 23 fake profiles – purporting to be teenagers of both genders with photographs to accompany his alter egos.At the peak of his offending, detectives said, the predator had constructed a "fictional community" to exert pressure on those who engaged in sexual activity. His victims were found to live across various regions of England and Wales.Sentencing has been provisionally set for 27 July. Wilson was remanded in custody.
