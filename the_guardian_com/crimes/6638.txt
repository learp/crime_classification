The comedian and television presenter Justin Lee Collins forced his girlfriend to compile a "dossier" detailing every sexual experience she had ever had as part of a campaign of abuse, a court has heard.Collins made Anna Larke write down the details in a notebook and would add in the word "done" once he was satisfied she had told him everything, it was claimed.The jury at St Albans crown court was told that Collins deprived Larke of sleep, telling her she had to stay awake as long as he did. He made her sleep facing him and would rouse her and criticise her if he saw she had turned away, it was claimed.Collins threw away some of Larke's DVDs on the basis that she found the male actors to be attractive and forced her to close down her email and social networking accounts, the jury was told.In addition, Larke, a public relations worker, was the victim of physical violence during the couple's nine-month relationship last year, it was alleged.During a trip to Miami, Collins is said to have grabbed his partner's hair, pulled her to the floor, pinned her down and spat in her face.On one occasion after returning from filming abroad, Collins accused Larke of infidelity. He is alleged to have slapped her and she was forced to flee screaming for help. On another occasion he threw a sat-nav at her, the court was told.Clips recorded on a mobile phone allegedly catch Collins hurling abuse at Larke. On one, she is accused of having had 50 lovers. She is also accused of having sex "on a train with different ethnicities".Collins, 38, denies harassing Larke, who is the same age. The pair met when she helped him move from Bristol to Kew in west London.Peter Shaw, prosecuting, told the jury: "The main part of that relationship was characterised by this defendant exerting control over her, verbally abusing her and physically assaulting her."The trial continues.
