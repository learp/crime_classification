Members of a gang who kidnapped two shop workers at gunpoint and threatened to kill them unless their relatives made ransom payments were told by a judge to expect "very, very substantial" prison sentences.The two victims – one a friend of the singer Lily Allen – were handcuffed and bundled into a car boot as they closed a west London sports shop in August last year. The pair, who are 25 and 18, were held for a week, during which time they were kicked, pistol-whipped, forced to watch torture DVDs and dressed in bin bags, Southwark crown court heard.Relatives handed over £90,000 to the gang of six – all men from the London area – before the shop workers were rescued by officers from the Metropolitan police's kidnap unit, which had placed the kidnappers under surveillance.In the middle of the trial, the plot organiser, Joseph Hadji, 27, admitted two counts of kidnap and one of blackmail.Today, a jury found three co-defendants, Thijseen Johns-Elliot, 28, and Virgil Percival, 36, and Jason Goode, 27, guilty of a string of charges, including false imprisonment, kidnap and blackmail. The two other men implicated in the plot, Ashanti Kumpati, 28, who rented a safehouse in south-east London, and Paul Wigan, 29, had previously admitted their involvement in the kidnapping.Adjourning sentencing for all six until 12 October, the judge, John Price, said: "There are going to be very, very substantial sentences of imprisonment for a vile and cruel crime."During the trial, Matthew Farmer, for the prosecution, said: "The only motive was pure profit. The misery inflicted on the victims was gratuitous."
