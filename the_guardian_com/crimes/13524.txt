"Arresting people for smoking dope is pointless." Â… "It's a waste of time, the war is lost."Who said that? The male singers in S-Club 7? Howard Marks?No. A high-ranking officer at Scotland Yard, prepared to voice his frustration in private, but not, as yet, in public. He is not alone in holding those views.In policing terms, cannabis possession has not been a priority for years. But there isn't a senior detective in the country willing to put his head above the parapet to say it in such blunt terms, for fear of being shot down by politicians and the rightwing press, who are notoriously trigger-happy on the subject of drugs.Commander Brian Paddick almost said the unthinkable yesterday. The man in charge of policing in Lambeth, south London, wants to change the way his officers treat the possession of cannabis.Instead of arresting and charging users, confiscation and a verbal warning should be enough, he argues.If Cdr Paddick pushes this commitment through, Lambeth will be the first area in the country to have an official policy to treat drug-users this way.He is not making up rules on the hoof. The Home Office has been whispering encouragement to the police. "[Officers] can issue written warnings and may make a conditional offer of a fixed penalty," says the discretionary guideline on drug possession. It does not say explicitly: you can be soft on drugs. It's more of a nudge and wink.The police have been right to treat the guideline with caution; government sensitivity to the issue might be gauged by the cool reaction to Cdr Paddick's initiative."This is a policing matter," said the Home Office, adding, somewhat disingenuously, "it's nothing to do with us."The Association of Chief Police Officers was also reluctant to be seen supporting the move. Sir John Stevens, the Met commissioner, is, apparently watching from the sidelines "with a great deal of interest."So, poor Cdr Paddick is out on his own, and every other senior police officer in the UK is waiting to see whether he gets buried in bad publicity before having the nerve to say in public what they have all agreed in private. If Cdr Paddick survives, then expect other forces to follow the precedent.With cannabis possession accounting for up to 85% of more than 120,000 countrywide drug busts a year, it is easy to imagine how much time and money the police can save by easing up on users, and concentrating their efforts on more serious offences.The police say they don't want to legalise cannabis, which is true. But they don't want to treat possession as a crime either.Another detective, without Cdr Paddick's courage in going on the record, put it like this: "If we police cannabis possession in the way some people expect us to, every cell and every prison in the country would be full to bursting. "The world moves on, we've got to move on. We must stop pretending this is a priority for us, because it isn't."Special reportsDrugs in BritainTalk about itWhat do you think?Related articles28.03.2001: Met takes softer line on cannabis22.03.2001: 'Drugs shame' threat to teen band S Club 722.03.2001: Lords urge legal use of cannabisNet notesCannabis: the story in linksInteractive quizAre you an addict?Useful linksMetropolitan police: crackdown on drugs campaignUrban 75: bullshit-free drugs guideDrugScopeMarijuana NewsCannabis communityHoward Marks: Legalise Cannabis party
