The prime minister, Tony Blair, today chaired the first meeting of a cross-government action group set up to halt the escalation of muggings, car-jackings and snatch thefts.Also present were the home secretary, David Blunkett, the lord chancellor, the attorney general, ministers from the departments of education, health, and local government, and senior police officers led by the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir John Stevens.Their aim was to find ways to dispatch more police to crime hotspots, to deal with criminals swiftly after arrest and to involve community leaders in preventing crime."This morning's meeting is about getting people literally on the streets, but with a targeted approach so they are there at the right time, there to pick up the right people and when they are picked up the criminal justice system deals with them quickly," Mr Blunkett, who will chair future meetings of the group, told the GMTV programme.The initiative follows a surge in street crime, which last weekend prompted Mr Blunkett to announce a new robbery reduction initiative. The plan aims to get police and court authorities to cooperate in targeting street criminals in the 10 urban areas where four-fifths of all such offences occur.Police officers will be moved off traffic duties and other low-priority tasks to deal with street crime under the initiative.Mr Blunkett said ahead of the meeting today that the government alone could not stem the rise in street crime. The community must play its part in tackling crime, he said. "All of us are involved in this, not just government, but everybody in the community, including parents, in getting a grip on what's going on. This morning's meeting is about sending that signal," he said."This isn't simply a job for the government, this is about improving policing, it's about the criminal justice system and what happens with the courts. It's about what we do about truants and those who cause mayhem either when they are not in school or the moment they leave. "And of course it's about prevention, intervening with young people at a very early stage." "We will, as a government, get things right, because we simply have to," Mr Blunkett added after the meeting.
