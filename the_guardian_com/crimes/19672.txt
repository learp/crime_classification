The government announced plans yesterday to press ahead with the biggest shakeup to the legal aid system in 50 years, as solicitors threatened strike action to try to head off the reforms.Intense lobbying by legal aid lawyers has produced only minor amendments and brief delays to plans for far-reaching changes to the way their services are bought and paid for from the public purse.The final package, unveiled yesterday by the lord chancellor, will mean a move from hourly rates to fixed fees and then to a market for legal aid work, with lawyers bidding for contracts and open competition on price. Asked about threats of strike action by solicitors throughout England and Wales, Lord Falconer said: "I strongly urge them not to. The worst thing possible that could happen is that they take industrial action."The reforms follow proposals from Lord Carter of Coles, who was asked to draw up a blueprint for change after an overspend of £130m on the £2bn legal aid budget.The government acknowledges that hundreds of law firms providing criminal defence services will have to close or merge, with criminal legal aid work going to fewer and larger firms.The number of firms doing legal aid family law work has already dropped significantly, threatening "advice deserts" in parts of the country. As a concession, the government agreed yesterday to "reconsult" on fee levels for family law before implementing changes. The lord chancellor outlined other minor concessions, including six-month delays for some proposals, but insisted there would be no new money. The reforms will be phased in during 2007 and 2008.A move to limited panels of barristers and solicitors who will tender for very high cost crown court cases from October 2007 will spell the end of the £1m-a-year legal aid barrister, Lord Falconer said.Hundreds of criminal defence solicitors are expected to attend a meeting in Birmingham tomorrow to consider action. Solicitors are threatening legal action over the complex mean test which they say leaves some clients who should have a lawyer unrepresented. The Law Society, the solicitors' professional body, will campaign against the plans, claiming they will damage legal services for the vulnerable.
