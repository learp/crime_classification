A police investigation is under way after a woman was knocked down and killed by a 4x4 Jeep involved in a police chase. Paula Stead, 32, a dinner lady from Sunderland, died after she was hit by the car yards from her home on Thursday night.Northumbria police said two girls, aged 11 and 10, believed to be the dead woman's daughter, Bridie, and her niece, Danica Green, were injured in the hit and run incident. Both had fractured limbs and were undergoing surgery.A spokesman said yesterday that the crash happened as a marked patrol car followed a Jeep Cherokee after noticing it was being driven erratically.The officer in pursuit lost sight of the Jeep as it weaved through side streets in the city's Ford estate, but minutes later found Ms Stead and the two girls lying on the pavement. The impact of the crash, witnesses said, had torn the mother's clothes off. The driver had fled."Extensive inquiries are still being carried out to trace the driver of the Jeep," the spokesman said. Donna Smith, 31, who worked with Ms Stead at Southmoor community school, described her as a "bubbly, happy-go-lucky person".Hours after the fatal collision, a 22-year-old driver crashed into a pub wall just 600 yards from the first incident, inflicting serious injuries on his 19-year-old passenger. The Mazda driver had also apparently been fleeing police - he had been stopped moments earlier for erratic driving. Police said the collisions were not connected.
