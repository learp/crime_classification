A schoolgirl has been imprisoned for her part in a family plot to kill her elderly grandfather to get at his money. The 16-year-old girl searched the internet with her 49-year-old mother, 19-year-old brother and his 17-year-old girlfriend for "the easiest way to kill an old person".They researched the possibility of poisoning the 89-year-old with toadstools but then in a campaign to try to "frighten him to death" threw bricks through his window late at night and cut the fuel line on his car to try to make it explode.Finally they attacked the elderly man, who lived with his 87-year-old wife, using bricks in plastic bags at his bungalow in a village near Winchester in Hampshire. The pensioner suffered head injuries but survived the beating.Last month the elderly victim's adopted daughter, 49, who was paid to be a carer for her father, was jailed for 17 years and her son, 19, was given an indeterminate sentence in a young offenders' institution after they were found guilty of conspiracy to murder.The convicted woman's older daughter, 16, was also found guilty of conspiracy to murder and has now been given a 26-month youth detention order at Winchester crown court.The teenager's younger sister, 14, was given a two-year youth rehabilitation order after she was convicted of wounding with intent but acquitted of the conspiracy charge. A third girl, the 19-year-old son's girlfriend, was also found guilty of the conspiracy charge and was sentenced to three years' youth detention.The three girls sobbed as they sat in court with their social workers when their sentences were handed down.Outside the grandfather's son spoke of his bewilderment at discovering his sister and her family had carried out the attack. The man said he and sister had enjoyed a privileged upbringing including private education and that she had been planning to kill their mother too.He said: "The police told me they had reason to believe my own sister and her family had been planning to kill mum and dad. "They told me they believed they were planning to do away with Dad first and then my mum as well. Thankfully they never got that far. It's the type of story you might see on Midsomer Murders or Crimewatch."Sentencing the two older girls, Mr Justice Foskett said: "The essence of the offence of which you were convicted is that you were prepared to contemplate the death of another individual."Speaking to the younger sister, he said: "Despite your physical appearance, you are still very young and immature. I do not think the public interest calls for a custodial sentence in your case."The judge described the three girls as "vulnerable", adding that they had acted out of "fear" of the 49-year-old woman.Sentencing the two adults last month, the judge called the attack "despicable and inhuman". He said the plot and the attempts to kill the pensioner "will defy belief in the minds of any right-thinking person".None of the family can be named for legal reasons. During the six-week trial, jurors were shown appalling pictures of the blackened eyes plus cuts and bruising the elderly man suffered across his body.He was subjected to the attack on 15 November last year after being lured out of his bungalow in a village near Winchester, Hants.He believed his 49-year-old daughter had collapsed in the garden but as he stepped outside he was set upon by his grandson and then hit by his granddaughters who were "armed with bricks" in plastic bags.The grandfather had given his adopted daughter lavish gifts, including a car, in the months leading up to the attack but she was not prepared to wait for her inheritance.Police analysis of computers seized from the family home in revealed Google searches including "1,000 ways to die", "how to kill someone" and "10 easy ways to kill someone with no trace".There were further searches for "can you kill someone with a punch?", "dangerous drugs for the elderly", "if you hit someone across the back of the head with a brick will they die or just get a bruise?" and "easiest way to kill an old person".Afterwards, detective sergeant Bryan Carter said: "This was a particularly cruel crime involving a vulnerable elderly man who was seriously assaulted by members of his own family."
