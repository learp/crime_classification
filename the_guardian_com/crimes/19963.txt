A Taser stun gun has been fired for the first time by police in Britain, in an attempt to disable an armed man - but it did not deliver its 50,000-volt electric shock. The weapon has been on trial in five forces in England and Wales since April as a so-called "less lethal" alternative to firearms. Metropolitan police officers fired one in Hounslow, west London, at a man aged 30 who emerged from his flat after a siege. As well as two handguns, he is thought to have had grenades. The Â£350 battery-powered, US-made Taser M26 delivers its shock by firing two needle-tipped barbs attached to cables that travel up to 21 feet. Inspector Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said yesterday: "It didn't work in the way that it should have. "You have to have both parts next to the skin or the clothing, and if they aren't it won't work. The first barb hits where the laser dot is aimed and the second one is fired fractionally later and is some distance below the first one. "It could be that the second barb passed between the legs. "The whole purpose of the trial is to find out how it works in an operational situation. "We support it, but we know its operational uses are limited." Scotland Yard's directorate of professional standards will investigate, supervised by the independent police complaints authority. The man called police at 10.45pm on Sunday, saying he had been shot. Following negotiations he emerged armed at 1am. Another "less lethal" weapon, a plastic baton round, was fired at him. It was the first fired in London, but rounds have been used elsewhere after being introduced by some forces in 2001. The man was arrested and taken in an ambulance to hospital where his injuries were described as "not life threatening". Knives, firearms and bullets were found in his flat. Detectives are investigating how he received the injuries which made him call police. Scotland Yard said it was too early to say how effective the Taser had been.
