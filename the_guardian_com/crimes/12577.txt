In many ways today's Fawcett report, which highlights the growing gap in conviction rates between police force areas, sadly tells us nothing new. Rape convictions remain a postcode lottery, and Essex, the county where I'm based, at the South Essex Rape and Incest Crisis Centre (Sericc), is still one of England and Wales's underperforming forces. Rape conviction rates in Essex have now dipped from 4% to just 3.1% in the last year.Although the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) have spent the last few years working closely with stakeholders like the Crown Prosecution Service and the 43 police authorities in England and Wales to improve the criminal justice response to sexual violence, some forces are continuing to disregard the good practice guidelines and recommendations that have come out of this drive to improve the second worst conviction rate in Europe.Police forces have been tasked with drawing up sexual violence action plans, and as part of that, they've been advised to work in partnership with their local specialist sexual violence voluntary sector providers to ensure better support and provision for victims of rape who choose to report their assault. However, rarely are the two rape crisis centres in Essex invited to share their expertise or knowledge, gained through supporting victims of sexual violence for more than 20 years.In the past year, both rape crisis centres in Essex have responded to hundreds of women and girls who have experienced rape and other forms of sexual violence; the majority (90%) of whom will never go anywhere near the criminal justice system.But for the 10% of women who do choose to report their assault, it is vital that they are supported in the best way possible from "report to court". It has been clearly acknowledged that if we can provide this joined-up support to women throughout that process, then it is more likely that the woman will stay within the criminal justice system.We are seeing some good examples of this around the country, and where the police, the CPS and rape crisis centres are working in partnership, we are seeing the consistent improvement of conviction rates such as those that have been reported in Cleveland and North Yorkshire.The Home Office, in response to poor attrition and conviction rates, has created sexual assault referral centres and independent sexual violence advisers (ISVA). Rape crisis centres have provided this form of advocacy since they were first set up. The main aim of the role is to reduce the number of women dropping out or withdrawing from the criminal justice process. Sericc currently is the only agency in Essex that provides this service, so it is hard to fathom why it has received only four referrals from Essex police in the past year of women raped in south Essex.We know that currently in nearly three-quarters of all reported rapes, the perpetrator is never charged and the case isn't referred to the CPS. The reasons are numerous and have been debated in various arenas over the past few years. However, in a recent interview, Dave Gee, rape adviser to Acpo and the Home Office, admitted that Britain's appalling conviction rates were often due to poor evidence-gathering and negative mindsets, which he said too often led to cases being "undermined rather than built up".Police forces across the UK and Wales have all been allocated "rape champions" to oversee the roll-out of their sexual violence action plans, to implement good practice guidelines and to tackle the "negative mindsets" within their forces. Along with specially trained officers, they have received sexual violence training and are part of the initiative that we have been assured will help to address the culture of disbelief that we know, from what women tell us, still exists. However, at the Home Office violence against women consultation in the east of England in May, a rape champion for one of the police forces in the east of England stated openly that "everyone knows most women and girls who report rape can't be believed".It is truly concerning that rape champions, who oversee the training and work of the specially trained sexual offences officers in police forces, hold these views. It has long been acknowledged by Acpo that miscounting rape statistics – most specifically recording women's withdrawal from the process as a false allegation – has not helped to change the police's wrong assumptions that at least 25% of women reporting rape won't be telling the truth, when in reality that figure is no more than for any other crime. If frontline officers are assuming that 25% of the women who come in to their stations to report rape "can't be believed", one wonders how this affects their response to all victims of this most serious of crimes.In the past year, we have seen another disturbing development in the attempt to further manipulate the statistics. Throughout the country, rape crisis ISVAs have been reporting their concerns that women who have attempted to report their rape to the police are being discouraged from doing so with the rationale that "there probably isn't enough evidence", "it's their word against his" and "it really isn't worth them going through with it".Discouraging women from reporting and depriving them of receiving the justice they deserve may appear to be a good solution towards lowering the reported rape and hence conviction rates; but the home secretary must "bite the bullet" and accept that if we are truly committed to tackling this postcode lottery of conviction rates, it is vital that we have an honest and realistic picture of what is happening in every police force area in the country and that forces that continue to underperform have some form of sanction against them in the hope that this will encourage them to take this issue seriously.
