Concerns were raised last night about security in jails after it emerged that prisoners have been building scores of homemade explosive devices.Statistics released by the Ministry of Justice show that since 1997 there had been 334 recorded incidents involving suspected explosive devices in England and Wales. Of these around a quarter - 80 - were found to be "viable".Prison officers warned of a rise in the number of extremists in jail. "Over the past 10 to 15 years the length of prison sentences and the nature of people being sent to prison has changed dramatically," said Glyn Travis, assistant general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association. "As a result there are now an awful lot of people with time on their hands."Suspect devices have been found at high-security prisons such as Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire and Long Lartin in Worcestershire which hold terrorists and gangland bosses.The numbers were released in response to questions asked by the shadow justice minister, Edward Garnier. Of the 80 viable devices, 57 had been made by packing flammable material, such as match heads, into an improvised container. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said all incidents were taken seriously. She said most involved false alarms or hoaxes.
