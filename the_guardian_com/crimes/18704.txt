One of Britain's most notorious murder inquiries is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Scotland Yard has already acknowledged that serious failings by its detectives meant paranoid schizophrenic and multiple rapist Robert Napper was left free to kill Rachel Nickell as she walked with her young son on Wimbledon Common in 1992, then kill another woman and her child 16 months later.In a series of complaints, Andre Hanscombe, who was Nickell's boyfriend and the father of her child, said the Metropolitan police could have done more to prevent her death.Deborah Glass of the IPCC said: "The allegations made in this complaint are numerous and serious."They range from allegations that investigating officers overlooked, discounted or otherwise wrongfully evaluated evidence, through to high-level strategic decisions by senior officers about the direction of the investigations."We are in the very early stages of gathering and examining information, and given the scale of the original police investigation this will take some time."Napper pleaded guilty last December to Nickell's murder after one of Britain's longest and most controversial homicide inquiries, costing an estimated Â£3m. Nickell was walking with her two-year-old son Alex on Wimbledon Common when she was forced to her knees at knifepoint by Napper and stabbed 49 times in a frenzied attack that almost decapitated her. Alex was dragged face down along the ground to stop him going to his mother. Police focused on the wrong man, Colin Stagg, and tried to ensnare him using a glamorous undercover policewoman.The prosecution against Stagg collapsed and it emerged last year that the real killer, Napper, had crossed the police's radar numerous times before Nickell's murder. Napper had been responsible for a series of rapes in south-east London and had confessed one of them to his mother.After years of police mistakes Napper was apprehended when a forensic breakthrough was made in 2004. He was already in Broadmoor for the manslaughter of Samantha and Jasmine Bissett committed 16 months after he killed Nickell.Hanscombe said this week: "When Robert Napper was convicted of killing Rachel, although the intolerable waiting had come to an end, the glaring question why the investigation had taken so long and had been handled so badly remained largely unanswered."To have found out ... that Rachel's death may have been prevented initially left me numb. Now that I have had time to come to terms with it, I feel determined to bring all of the issues and events and mistakes out into the light."A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "The IPCC has sent us the complaint they received. It is only right this complaint will be properly dealt with and we will now consider what the appropriate next step is."
