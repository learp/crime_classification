The police force at the centre of the Rotherham child abuse scandal showed a disregard for victims of major crime, including rape and sexual assaults, an official police watchdog has found.South Yorkshire police was under further pressure today after an audit by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) concluded that officers in its public protection unit spent "a great deal deal of time trying to disprove" victims' allegations.Separately, it emerged today that the force currently has 173 "live" investigations into suspected child sexual exploitation – including 32 cases in Rotherham.HMIC's chief inspector, Tom Winsor, ordered South Yorkshire police to end immediately the culture of "investigate-to-record", where officers do not record incidents as possible crimes until they have been investigated.Of the violent offences, including rape, that had been written off as "no crime" by the force, just under a fifth were wrongly classified and should have been pursued, inspectors found.HMIC examined 66 recorded crimes of rape, violence and robbery that South Yorkshire police had recorded as no-crime but found that 11 of these – equal to 17% – were incorrectly classified.The report said: "This culture of dealing with reports of crime shows a disregard for victims and is unacceptable; it hides the true extent of the picture of crime from the force and is particularly concerning when the offences investigated by this unit are often of the most serious nature and victims are often the most vulnerable."Most officers thought the culture had changed over the past 12 months, the report said. However, its publication in the aftermath of the Rotherham child abuse scandal will heap further pressure on the force and the under-fire local police and crime commissioner, Shaun Wright.One officer in the force's child abuse unit told inspectors that some years ago "there had been pressure not to crime rape, robberies and burglaries straight away but rather to investigate-to-record", the report found. "In her experience, she said that things had now changed and that pressure was no longer around."The HMIC also raised concerns about South Yorkshire police's recording of crimes including child abuse.Winsor said that inspectors had examined 53 reports to South Yorkshire's specialist departments. Out of those, 34 crimes should have been recorded – but only 18 were, the report said. Of these 18 crimes, eight fell outside the 72-hour limit allowed to record incidents.The report found: "This level of under-recorded crime is a significant cause of concern and is a matter of material and urgent importance, particularly as some of these relate to violence and sexual assault against vulnerable children."South Yorkshire police said it welcomed the HMIC's findings, and was actively working to implement the recommendations made in the report.A spokeswoman said: "It is important to recognise that this report is about the recording of crime and not how we investigate crime. The force's public protection unit is victim-led and officers take great care to ensure all victims of this type of crime are fully supported throughout an investigation, from the moment a report is received."Officers working in public protection are specially trained to ensure these victims, who are often vulnerable, receive the service they need."
