A judge has warned a former police officer that he may be jailed after being found guilty of assaulting a man he was trying to arrest.Timothy Allatt, 33, formerly a Nottinghamshire police constable, was found guilty at Mansfield magistrates court of assaulting Jake Bramley in the early hours of 25 July last year.District judge Diane Baker told Allatt that after hearing two days of evidence she did not accept that he used reasonable force in detaining Bramley, who was being pursued by officers on suspicion of stealing a car.She said she was satisfied by evidence that Allatt hit Bramley, threw him against a wall and then dragged him face down on to the floor before kicking him in the chest area.She told Allatt that in normal circumstances she would hand out a community order for an assault conviction but his case had aggravating factors. "Those aggravating factors are that this was a sustained assault," she said. "It was a sustained assault on a member of the public by a serving police officer." She continued: "At this stage I cannot rule out a custodial sentence."The judge told Allatt that when considering his sentence she would take into account that he was a highly trained authorised firearms officer, that he had received four commendations in his 11 years as a police officer and that he was widely respected.She told the court it was not said that Allatt caused all of Bramley's injuries – he was treated as an inpatient at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham for a collapsed lung and facial injuries following the incident – but she could not ignore the seriousness of his conviction and her duty to protect the public.She added: "This was a gross breach of his position as a police officer." She granted Allatt unconditional bail and adjourned his case to 28 September for pre-sentence reports.Last week the court heard that Allatt, who denied the offence, chased Bramley through Sneinton, Nottingham, as he ran from police after they attempted to stop his silver Ford Fiesta because it was a suspected stolen vehicle.PC Daniel Moss, who was on duty that night, told the court that after being chased Bramley was cornered by police and then Allatt assaulted him.Bramley was punched, grabbed, and kicked in the rib cage by Allatt, according to Moss. His account was to be believed over Allatt's, Baker said.Allatt said Bramley, who was 22 at the time, looked "agitated" and "appeared to be in a fighting stance". He said he carried out a "palm heel strike" as a distraction blow, which hit Bramley on the left side of his face near his ear, and pushed and pulled Bramley with both arms to bring him to the ground and make a lawful arrest. He said he did not kick him, drag him, or throw him against a wall.Bramley was arrested and taken to the Queen's Medical Centre at around 2.30am after he complained of chest pains.Baker said she did not find Allatt's account on the witness stand to be plausible, nor did she accept that Moss may have made up the allegation against him because he was derided by fellow officers after the incident for failing to keep hold of Bramley when he managed to grab on to his tracksuit top as he ran past.Allatt also did not tell the custody sergeant he had struck Bramley, nor did he record it on the standard police "use of force" forms that all officers have to complete when they have used force to restrain an individual.During the trial, the court also heard that Allatt was dismissed in April this year after a police tribunal made a finding against him for unreasonable force. But it was in relation to a separate matter and a different man who, the court heard, Allatt pushed against a wall. Allatt has since appealed against the decision, but Baker said it showed "bad character in the form of previous reprehensible behaviour". Nottinghamshire police said Allatt was suspended after an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry, and while this was ongoing, was dismissed from the force for another matter.Acting Detective Superintendent Mick Windmill-Jones, from the Professional Standards Directorate, said: "The public rightly expect their police officers to demonstrate in all they do the very highest standards of behaviour, integrity and professionalism. When an officer fails to display these qualities and commits a criminal offence, they can expect, like any other member of society, to be prosecuted in a court of law."Tim Allatt acted outside the code of conduct set for every officer by using excessive force and causing injury to another person. We referred this to the IPCC and a full investigation was launched. Today's guilty verdict reflects the severity of what Allatt did, and shows the way he abused his position with a total lack of regard for his responsibility to protect the public."
