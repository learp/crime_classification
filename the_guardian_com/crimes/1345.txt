Detectives investigating the murder of 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell today released an e-fit picture of a man seen near the scene of an earlier linked attack.Police are also tentatively linking both incidents to an attack on an 18-year-old man in the same area of southwest London three weeks ago.A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police said: "The attacks have not been conclusively linked but there is a concern that they are connected. They were in the same area and the same type of blunt metal instrument was used."The likeness was drawn up after police interviewed a new witness, who saw the suspect leaning over a 17-year-old girl in Strawberry Hill, southwest London, at 9pm on January 8 as she lay in the snow clutching her head. The suspect was described as white, in his late 40s and 5ft 9in tall. He had a chunky build and dark collar-length hair. He was wearing a dark thigh-length Barbour-style jacket. The man was seen crouching over the first victim and then walking away towards Spencer Road.The 17-year-old girl, who was attacked four weeks before the attack on Ms McDonnell, was walking home alone from shops at 9pm. She was listening to her personal stereo when she was beaten over the head. Her parents thought she had fallen over in the snow until publicity surrounding Marsha's murder made them contact police. Tests confirmed their daughter had been attacked. Ms McDonnell was battered over the head just yards from her home in the early hours of February 4. She had been out with friends in Kingston-upon-Thames. In the latest attack being linked to the murder of Ms McDonnell by detectives, an 18-year-old man was attacked in Hampton on February 25. He had caught the night bus home from a nightclub in Kingston, and escaped unharmed after his attacker swung a blunt metallic object at him. In each of the three attacks a "hammer-like" blunt instrument is thought to have been used. Witnesses were asked to contact the incident room on 020-8358 0100.
