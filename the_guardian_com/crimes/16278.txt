A council worker who stole more than Â£500,000 to feed her obsession with Elvis Presley was jailed for three years yesterday.For more than a decade, Julie Wall, a 46-year-old cashier at North Kesteven district council in Lincolnshire, helped herself to parking meter revenues. Lincoln crown court heard that instead of counting coins and depositing them in the council's bank account, she swapped them for banknotes which she used to buy rare vinyl, CDs and DVDs featuring her idol. The Elvis collection is expected to be auctioned off to reimburse the council.
