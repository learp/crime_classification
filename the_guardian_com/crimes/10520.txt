The lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, yesterday reiterated his plea for more community punishments to unblock overcrowded prisons so that serious offenders who must be kept in custody can receive help in tackling their offending behaviour and rehabilitating themselves.England's top judge recently undertook community service incognito and described in the Observer last Sunday how he had done "foul" cleaning jobs while posing as a solicitor guilty of drink driving. Yesterday, delivering a lecture in Oxford on crime and punishment, he again insisted that community sentences are not soft and blamed the media for influencing the public's views on sentencing."I have witnessed 'community payback', drug treatment and domestic violence courses. They are not a panacea, but I believe they offer a better chance of preventing re-offending than short spells of imprisonment and can leave room in the prisons for effective intervention for those whose crimes require detention," he said.He said Britain sent more people proportionally to prison, and for longer, than any other country in western Europe. Over the last 20 years there had been a marked increase in the length of the average sentences imposed for the more serious offences: drugs, criminal damage, violence and burglary. In addition, there had been a "massive increase" in sentences of under 12 months, from 39,000 in 1994 to nearly 62,000 in 2004. Of these, the vast majority - 53,676 - were for less than six months.He said the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provided that a court must not pass a custodial sentence unless the offending was so serious that neither a fine nor a community sentence could be justified.Lord Phillips said fitting the punishment to the crime was a difficult exercise. "Some elements of the media are inclined, however, to make light of sentences of imprisonment - to speak of defendants being permitted to 'walk free' after only five years inside."I am inclined to think that to be confined in prison for five years is a very weighty punishment indeed."
