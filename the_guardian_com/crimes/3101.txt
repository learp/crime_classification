Cherie Blair has settled a libel action against the News of the World for an article that falsely accused her of having an "inhuman" attitude in a discussion about the victims of crime.An article penned by News of the World columnist Carole Malone, which appeared on 5 October last year, contained a string of criticisms of Blair after she appeared as a panellist at a meeting attended by victims of crime.The News of the World settled the libel claim made by Blair, printing an apology in yesterday's edition of the tabloid and online accepting that Malone's claims were "unfounded", and paid unspecified damages and legal costs.Malone's column made a number of false claims, including that Blair had arrived with hordes of secuity men, only made the appearance at the event for publicity purposes and gave "inhuman" responses about the Human Rights Act when questioned in a panel discussion.The News of the World apology stated: "In the Carole Malone column on 5 October, several criticisms were made of Cherie Blair after she appeared as a panellist at a fringe meeting attended by prominent victims of crime."In particular, it was not right to say Mrs Blair arrived with hordes of security men, only appeared for publicity and was "inhuman" in her responses about the Human Rights Act."We apologise to her for these assertions which we accept were unfounded."Graham Atkins, a partner at law firm Atkins Thomson, which represented Blair, said: "Mrs Blair is delighted with the settlement and that her reputation has been restored by taking this action. She will be paying the damages she received to her foundation."The law firm also pointed out that Blair has spent a "considerable period of time investigating and highlighting for public attention issues relating to crime in this country". She was formerly the patron of Victim Support London.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
