Barry George, the man convicted of the murder of the BBC presenter Jill Dando, has won the right to a second appeal against his conviction, the Criminal Cases Review Commission will announce today.The announcement comes after years of investigation by lawyers for the CCRC, who interviewed George at length, corresponded with senior police officers in the case and investigated some of the more bizarre allegations about the killing in some detail. These included the claim that Lord Archer's secretary Angela Peppiatt, whose evidence at his perjury trial led to his being jailed, was the intended target for a hitman, not Ms Dando.But the main evidence that the CCRC has been examining has been the speck of firearms residue found deep in George's coat pocket. Lawyers for the CCRC have questioned the police at length about claims that the residue came, not from the weapon which killed Dando, but from contamination by firearms officers called to the scene when he was arrested. The police have insisted that no firearms officers were present at George's arrest.But George's lawyers are expected to argue that an inquiry by Strathclyde police undermines the evidential value of the residue. The crown is likely to vigorously defend the appeal, which is George's second, saying the residue was consistent with that found on Dando's hair and clothing.The presenter was fatally shot on the doorstep of her home in Fulham, west London in 1999. George, 42, who lived nearby, was investigated by police, who discovered he had a conviction for rape and an interest in guns.During the trial, he was portrayed as a fantasist who had stalked and photographed hundreds of women. His defence team, led by Michael Mansfield QC, had argued that Dando could have been killed by a Serbian hitman in revenge for the bombing by Nato of a TV centre during the conflict in the Balkans.George was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey in 2000 on a majority 10-1 verdict. There was immediate criticism after the conviction that the prosecution case was one of the thinnest in a major murder trial.No weapon was found, there appeared to be no motive, there were no eyewitnesses, and neither were there fingerprints or DNA evidence.The parties involved in the case, including Dando's fiancee, Alan Farthing, and George's family, have been told of the CCRC's decision. The court of appeal has a duty to re-examine cases referred by the review body.If George's conviction is quashed he could face a second crown court trial, but there is likely to be legal argument that a retrial would not be possible after such a length of time.A spokeswoman for the CCRC said an announcement would be made today.
