Single mothers will be able to ask the police to check the background of a new partner to find out whether he is a sex offender under moves being considered by the Home Office, the Guardian can reveal.An interim report of a government taskforce will propose allowing individuals to request criminal record information directly. Currently, it is up to police and other agencies to warn women that their children could be at risk from a boyfriend.Mothers would have to have grounds for suspicion and would face tough penalties if they abused the information, including by making it public. Establishing a relationship with a single mother is a common strategy used by predatory paedophiles to gain access to children. Such men represent about a fifth of child sex offenders; the rest are relatives or otherwise known to the victim.A further proposal would give people in a community the right to be told by police or other authorities whether there are any child sex offenders living in their area, but not where they lived.The proposals are contained in a paper overseen by Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe which will be sent to police, the probation service and other agencies early next month. They are seen as an attempt by the government to respond to demands for greater disclosure of the whereabouts of paedophiles, triggered by a number of high profile cases such as the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne.However, despite tabloid pressure, the "emerging findings" document will not recommend full public disclosure of the names and addresses of released sex offenders along the lines of Megan's Law in the US, though sources said the option had not yet been entirely ruled out.The home secretary, John Reid, said last June that he would consider introducing a British version of the law, introduced in the US after the murder of seven-year-old Megan Kanka in July 1994 by a known paedophile, Jesse Timmendequas, and sent Mr Sutcliffe to the US to investigate.However, ministers now argue such a move could encourage vigilantes and would drive paedophiles underground, making them far harder to manage and ultimately putting children at greater risk. This view is endorsed by child protection charities including Barnardo's.At present, those on the sex offences register - nearly 30,000 across England and Wales - have to tell police where they are living. More than 95% comply according to Home Office figures. Since 2005, courts have also been able impose public protection sentences, under which offenders can be kept in prison until they are regarded as safe for release.Under the new proposals, members of the public asking about paedophiles in their own area would be told whether any offenders were living locally and how they were being managed but would not be given details of how many nor any names or addresses.The moves are intended to reform the current one way disclosure, in which the police or other agencies have for the last five years been able to alert a mother that a new partner is a sex offender.A Home Office source close to the inquiry, due to be completed in January, said the aim was to ensure "a balance is struck so that people who have a just and reasonable concern or cause for concern can find out reasonable information."The detail of exactly what grounds would be needed in order for police to disclose information is still to be worked out. Ministers are also likely to have to justify confining a new right to know to partners and not close neighbours who might also claim their children are potentially at risk.The disclosures come as some of Britain's most wanted child sex offenders will be identified publicly today on a new website dedicated to tracking them down. It is thought to be the first time that details of convicted paedophiles have been published nationwide by Britain's law enforcement agencies.The Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre has set up the site, at www.ceop.gov.uk/wanted, to appeal for information about child sex offenders who have disappeared off the radar.
