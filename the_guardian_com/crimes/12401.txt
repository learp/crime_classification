Oliver Letwin, the shadow home secretary, is to drop one of William Hague's most controversial policies - the right of householders to defend their property by force.Before the last election, the then Conservative leader championed the cause of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who shot dead a teenage intruder.Mr Martin received a life sentence for murder, but has since had his conviction reduced to manslaugher on appeal.Yesterday Mr Letwin confirmed that he will not be reviving Mr Hague's controversial policy, espoused by Ann Widdecombe, of allowing a defence of protecting property.He said: "One doesn't want to create a society in which people are liable to be mown down if they enter a property."You can't just ask if a measure will stop a particular crime. You must also ask: 'Is this helping to promote the kind of society we want to live in?' The single most important thing I want to do is to avoid reaching out for instant solutions."In an interview to launch a Tory rethink on law and order, Mr Letwin backtracked on the conventional Conservative view that crime is a result of the weakness of individuals only, saying that social background plays the most important part of in forming criminals.He also admits that lengthy prison sentences are an insufficinet tool in the war on crime - a direct rebuttal of the "prison works" maxim favoured by Michael Howard and John Major.Mr Letwin, who himself was the victim of a robbery last week when he let a stranger into his house at 5.15am to use the toilet, said: "I'm saying that tougher sentences are necessary but not sufficient as a solution."There is a terrible image of a conveyor belt to crime: the child growing up in a dysfunctional family, who becomes a problem at school, who joins a gang, gets on to drugs ... eventually engages in serious crime and goes to prison."If we are to do something about the appalling malaise in society, we cannot just deal with the end of the conveyor belt, we have to get back to the early stage."Mr Letwin is due to unveil more of his thinking on crime, law and order tomorrow at a lecture to the right-leaning thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies.
