High street names including Boots, TK Maxx, Tesco and Debenhams are employing private security firms who have demanded more than £100 from people accused of shoplifting goods worth a few pounds without proper legal authority, according to Citizens Advice.In 67% of 300 cases analysed, the goods were worth less than £20, and in 79% of cases they were recovered in store for resale – but the average demand was £147.69 including the costs of "dealing with the incident" as well as the goods stolen.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: "It would appear that the principal beneficiaries, in cases of low-value alleged theft, are the agents. They collectively profit by millions of pounds but have no obvious interest in a reduction of retail crime."In some cases, the alleged offence appears to have been no more than an innocent mistake or the result of confusion or genuine error when using a self-service checkout."Its report says many of those targeted are vulnerable. One in four of the 300 cases involved teenagers, the majority of which were under 17.Demands against the elderly, single mothers, carers and people with mental and physical disabilities are also documented, although retailers insist that these cases are unrepresentative. In a recent high-profile case, Kim Molloy, a chief inspector with Northampton police, received a demand of £137.50 after being accused of stealing makeup worth £12 from Tesco. Her lawyers confirm she received letters from the recovery agent even though she was cleared in court last month.Retailers have hit back angrily at the report.A spokesperson at Tesco said stores were the real victims. "We don't apologise for getting back the costs of what we lose (from shoplifting). The only people that lose out are the people who have stolen; if people don't steal they won't have a problem."Letters from recovery agents, sent on behalf of the retailer and seen by the Guardian, threaten civil court action if the sum demanded is not paid. The largest civil recovery company, Retail Loss Prevention Ltd (RLP), informs recipients that they have been added to a database that is screened by employers.Retailers insist that their procedures are legitimate, but Citizens Advice says there is no obvious legal authority behind many of the demands being issued, and they are yet to see any evidence for such claims being up held in court.Young teenagers report being bullied into handing out their contact details and several recipients describe private security guards taking pleasure in making the claims. Individuals who have refused to pay the demands have received phone calls to their homes.Allyn Thomas, for the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) says: "If someone is subject to such inappropriate behaviour they should go to their local police station. It would be wholly inappropriate if individuals were being brow beaten into an admission of guilt, and I'm sure no retailer would countenance harassment."Some retailers feel frustrated by the courts and the police who see shoplifting at the lower end of offending, and we support their efforts to remedy that. But the problem comes when some companies respond disproportionately."RLP, who has carried out 80% of the civil recovery claims documented by Citizens Advice, claims that their procedures are in accordance with guidelines agreed with Acpo, but Thomas confirms that they are in correspondence about whether that is appropriate,.A similar correspondence was had with the Information Commissioner's Office, the independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, after RLP claimed the company's operations were consistent with their guidance in letters sent out to alleged shoplifters.Citizens Advice estimates that more than 600,000 people have received such "civil recovery" demands since 2000, and that its bureaux have dealt with some 10,000 claims since 2007. Four out of five cases were issued on behalf of eight major retailers – Boots, TK Maxx, Asda, Tesco, Debenhams, Wilkinson, B&Q and Superdrug. Boots and TK Maxx – made up over a third of reported cases, but both refused to comment.Tesco, Debenhams and Asda said that they explicitly instructed their recovery agents not to target vulnerable individuals. Asda also claimed that the three cases described against the company in the report had been dropped, and that it did not blacklist individuals. Debenhams said the practice was a "useful deterrent".Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said, "Retail crime costs £1.1bn a year. Ultimately much of that is reflected in shop prices."Civil recovery is about retailers attempting to protect their honest customers and the viability of their businesses by recovering the costs imposed on them by thieves. At a time when police resources are being cut, it's vital retailers are able to take this action."The RLP said Citizens Advice misunderstood the nature of civil recovery claims and that it was "naïve in the extreme" to assume that there was no obvious legal authority behind the claims, which the company said reflected only a proportion of the costs incurred by the retailer in terms of staff time, administration and security costs. Jackie Lambert, the managing director, said:""Civil recovery not only acts as an effective deterrent to shoplifting crime, it recovers the retailer's costs and losses directly from those responsible, which is fairer for everyone.".Neither the Home Office nor the Ministry of Justice agreed to comment, both saying that it was the responsibility of the other department.A Home Office spokesperson has subsequently said: "We support the appropriate and proportionate use of civil recovery by businesses who incur financial losses through shop theft."• This article was amended on 14 December 2010 to add the quote from the Home Office in the final paragraph.
