Noel Smith (Victim of its own success, 6 August ) writes about the setting of Grendon's therapeutic community work in which he and many others have been able to explore their criminality in confidence and trust, and learn to become more sociable and understanding of others in the process. As the previous governor of the prison for 10 years I was aware that there was always a risk of extreme breakdown when working with deep-seated experiences of deprivation, abuse, violence and rejection that those engaged in the process had suffered. In mixing all categories of offender, who in the system that they came from were segregated, the risk was enhanced, but was always managed by the close working of staff and prisoners to make the setting safe, keeping to the expectation that there would be no violence in the prison.The therapeutic regime is sustained by the dedication of hard-pressed prison staff, and the courage of prisoners realising that this may be the one chance they have to restore their life to what they want it to be. Having recently visited the prison again I was aware that the culture of inquiry was very strong and the work of the communities was robust and alive, though under threat from continuing budget constraints â€“ you can only squeeze so much without causing serious consequences. The costs of similar treatment places in the NHS are considerably higher, for good reasons, and a serious examination of the risks to the regime should now be part of the outcomes from the sad and tragic death of Robert Coello.Tim NewellGovernor of Grendon prison, 1991-2001
