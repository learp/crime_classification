A 58-year-old man appeared in court via video-link today charged with murdering three men who were found dead in the 1990s. Robin Ligus, who is accused of killing Trevor Bradley, Brian Coles and Bernard Czyzewska between March and November 1994, was remanded in custody following a seven-minute hearing at Birmingham magistrates court. Ligus, who is from the Shrewsbury area, spoke only to confirm that he could hear and see the proceedings via the live video-link to HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire. Ligus was ordered to appear at Birmingham crown court tomorrow. Bradley, 53, was found dead in a burnt-out car near Melverley, Shropshire, in April 1994, while the body of Coles, 57, was discovered in October 1994 at his home in Higher Heath, near Whitchurch, also in Shropshire. The body of Czyzewska, 36, was found in the River Severn at Shrewsbury in November 1994. The defendant was charged with three counts of murder last week after a cold case review of the deaths.
