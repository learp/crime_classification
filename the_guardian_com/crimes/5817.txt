The key witness in the Damilola Taylor murder trial today denied that she had been told what to say by police.The schoolgirl, said by the police to be the only witness to the killing of the 10-year-old, also denied leaving out "awkward" details from her statement. George Carter-Stephenson QC, defence counsel, asked if the 14-year-old had conversations with PC Carolyn Crooks during breaks while she was being interviewed. He asked: "Was she telling you what to say?" The girl replied: "No, I have never been directed what to say." Asked what went on during two two-minute breaks in video recordings, she said she could not remember and had not known that the cameras were not recording during those periods. Mr Carter-Stephenson asked the girl about changes she made in her story during the course of a number of interviews. He asked: "You were prepared to do what they told you? Leaving out bits that they might want? Were you prepared to leave out pieces of evidence that might make the case awkward for the police?" She replied: "No".Damilola died after being stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle in November 2000 on the North Peckham Estate, south London, where he lived. Two brothers aged 16, their 17-year-old friend and a 14-year-old youth deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob.The trial continues.
