Prisoners should be entitled to housing benefit payments to avoid the high levels of homelessness amongst ex-offenders, the government's social exclusion unit has suggested.The SEU's report, Reducing Re-offending by Ex-prisoners, spells out the problems caused by a rule that bans prisoners claiming housing benefit if their sentence is longer than 13 weeks.It said that the rule was one of the main reason why up to a third of prisoners lose their homes during custody, and one in 20 ends up sleeping rough. It added that this in turn lead to more re-offending since homeless ex-offenders are more likely to be reconvicted. One in 10 repeat prisoners said they had slept rough when they had left custody the last time. "Those prisoners in custody for more than 13 weeks without immediate family available to take over a housing benefit claim have very little chance of keeping a tenancy open until the end of the sentence," the report said."This is the case even if the prisoner is in custody for as little as 14 weeks resulting in the prisoner being left to secure new accommodation from scratch."The report said that in the worst cases poor communication between prisoners and their landlords resulted not only in the possession of their home but the destruction of a prisoners' belongings. This left some prisoners with no documents to prove their identity when they come out, which in turn makes it harder to claim benefits and access housing, according to the report.The report stops short of recommending that the 13-week rule should be scrapped. But it does call on the government to consider "enabling more prisoners to retain their housing or pay unavoidable arrears".It added that any changes to housing benefit should be introduced alongside measures to encourage prisoners to take more responsibility for their housing. Another recommendation was that resettlement departments within prison be given the ability to secure emergency housing for prisoners who would otherwise be homeless on release.It also criticised the level of care currently given to former prisoners. "The lack of probation aftercare for the majority of prisoners after prison means most have even less support and advocacy once they have left custody."
