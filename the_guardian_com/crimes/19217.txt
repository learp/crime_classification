Bedfordshire is the worst performing police force in England and Wales, an annual review of policing data released by the Home Office today has concluded.However, the government said police forces were improving overall, with more than three-quarters having good or excellent records in tackling crime.According to the Home Office's Police Performance Assessments 2006-07, which assesses a wealth of data for 43 forces, only 10 are listed as fair in dealing with crime, while none is viewed as poor. Of the rest, 23 are listed as good and 10 as excellent.Almost half the forces - 20 out of 43 - have improved their records in tackling crime, with the same number stable. Only three - City of London, Thames Valley and Wiltshire - are doing worse on crime than they were last year.Thames Valley and Wiltshire came near the bottom of an unofficial league table of police performance compiled by the Press Association from the various data, while Bedfordshire came bottom.The league table showed that the Greater Manchester, Lincolnshire, Humberside and Northamptonshire forces were also performing less well than others, while Surrey and Lancashire were top.Overall, the report showed an improvement in police performance, the Home Office minister, Tony McNulty, said."The record levels of investment in the police that this government has made are making a real difference to the performance of the police and the safety of the neighbourhoods and communities they serve," he said."The figures out today show improvements in tackling crime, more offences brought to justice and greater satisfaction among victims of crimes in the police forces who help them."However, the findings revealed that, despite the extra spending, the amount of time officers spent in front line policing had barely increased, with a national average of 64.2% - only 0.6% up on last year.Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the chief inspector of constabulary, admitted the Bedfordshire force had "issues". "There have been areas of concern in how the neighbourhood policing programme there is being rolled out and in terms of the force's ability to protect vulnerable people," he told reporters."They are recognised and accepted by the force. We will be working with the force to see improvement brought about."City of London police, the small force covering the capital's financial district, received the worst rating for "direction of travel", with tackling crime and resources and efficiency seen as having deteriorated.Sir Ronnie said this was partly down to the force's unique status, adding: "I wouldn't want anyone to think that City of London is a failing force. It is far from it."Mr McNulty, who said police were "entering a more flatline period" after recent increases in resources, insisted forces were run efficiently overall."The notion that this is still an inefficient public service is wrong," he added. "The notion that this is the last bastion of 1960s public service ... could not be further from the truth."
