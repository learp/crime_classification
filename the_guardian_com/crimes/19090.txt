Will the BBC be able to screen Panorama next Monday? The programme that is scheduled to be broadcast, "The fake sheikh exposed", is about Mazher Mahmood, the Sun on Sunday journalist who is currently under suspension by his newspaper.But a tweet by the producer, Meirion Jones, suggests its fate is in the balance:"Apparently we may be stopped from exposing the Fake Sheikh by the legal apparatus but I can't tell you more until Monday."It is unclear exactly what "legal apparatus" is involved. But it is thought that lawyers acting for Mahmood have registered an objection to the programme being aired and may seek an injunction to prevent the broadcast.Mahmood, the former investigations editor at the News of the World, was suspended by the Sun in July this year following the collapse of a trial involving the the singer and former X-Factor judge, Tulisa Contostavlos.The judge ruled that it was likely Mahmood had attempted to persuade a witness to change his evidence and then lied about it under oath.That decision vindicated Contostavlos, who had always insisted she was entrapped by Mahmood into promising to arrange a cocaine deal.Since that case, the Crown Prosecution Service has dropped two other cases (see here and here) in which Mahmood was to be the main witness.Although there were suggestions after the collapsed Contostavlos trial that Mahmood might face a perjury charge, the police refuse to confirm or deny whether any action will be taken against him.He is said to be the subject of "an exhaustive internal investigation" by the Sun on Sunday's publishers, News UK.Mahmood worked for the News of the World from December 1991 until the paper was closed down during the phone hacking scandal in July 2011.He was then assigned to the Sunday Times until he joined the Sun on Sunday at its launch in February 2012.According to the BBC's billing for Panorama, its reporter, John Sweeney, has spoken to some of Mahmood's highest profile targets and the men who helped him expose them. The BBC release states: "They allege that the fake sheikh was the real crook, using sophisticated entrapment and even creating crimes and fabricating evidence."Mahmood's lawyers, Kingsley Napley, said they had no comment to make. At the time of writing, neither the BBC nor News UK had returned calls about the matter.Full disclosure: I was interviewed for the programme.
