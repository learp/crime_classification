The suspected killer of the Southampton student Hannah Foster was detained near the Nepalese border yesterday, 48 hours after her parents made a moving appeal for help via the Indian media.Maninder Pal Singh Kohli was arrested by West Bengal police in the border village of Panighata as he was preparing to cross into Nepal.The police said that after the wide publicity given to the hunt for Mr Kohli and the reward of 5m rupees (Â£70,000) for information leading to his arrest, a caller in the tea-growing Darjeeling district provided details about his whereabouts."He was staying with a relative of his wife in Panighata," said Rajeev Mishra, Darjeeling's district superintendent of police.Mr Kohli had apparently moved to the district earlier this year. He had married a Nepalese girl three months previously and had been living in Kalimpong, 403 miles north of Calcutta."It's been an emotional rollercoaster for my wife Hilary and myself," the dead girl's father, Trevor Foster, said after news of the arrest reached the Punjab capital, Chandigarh, where they had gone to lobby officials to intensify the hunt for the suspected killer.The body of Hannah, 17, was found on March 16 in the West End area of Southampton, Hampshire. She was found to have been raped and strangled. Mr Kohli is believed to have gone to India shortly after her death."We are hoping this [will] be the first step on the way to Kohli's extradition and criminal trial in the UK," Mr Foster said.Although the West Bengal police are fairly certain they have got the man who is wanted, Hampshire police officers accompanying the Fosters are flying to the eastern Indian state to make sure the person is Mr Kohli.The police said they had arrested Mr Kohli yesterday afternoon and would send him to court today.A telephone hotline financed by Mr Foster's employer, British Gas, had been set up earlier this week to gather information on Mr Kohli.In just two days, the hotline had received 1,100 calls. Appealing for help on Indian television, Mr Foster had pleaded: "If anyone out there is hiding Kohli, please examine your conscience and ask yourself whether it is right that the murder should go unpunished of a kind, caring and talented young woman, about to go to university in pursuit of her dream to become a doctor."Hannah was abducted from Portswood, Southampton, just before 11 pm on March 14 last year as she was returning after seeing friends at a nearby pub.The Hampshire police focused on Mr Kohli after a friend of Hannah's told them she had complained about being approached by a man more than once.During a six-day official visit to the sub-continent, David Blunkett, the home secretary, had appealed to the residents of Punjab to help locate Mr Kohli. A new "wanted" poster in English and Punjabi was released on the anniversary of Hannah's death.The suspect had worked as a sandwich delivery driver and lived with his wife and two sons in Southampton.
