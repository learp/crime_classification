The 1986 Vauxhall Belmont was yesterday named the car most likely to be stolen, with one in 10 falling prey to thieves last year.According to the annual Car Theft Index, two other makes of Vauxhall - the 1984 Astra and 1983 Nova - were the second and third most vulnerable cars.The index, which covers thefts in England, Wales and Scotland, showed older cars were much more likely to be stolen and those made between 11 and 15 years ago account for 41% of all thefts. Overall, 314,749 cars were stolen in 2002, a decrease of 7.9% on the year before. Small saloons were most at risk, with 13 out of every 1,000 being stolen. The most secure were people carriers, with only six thefts for every 1,000 vehicles.The figures were compiled from theft data on the police national computer and DVLA records of registered cars. Christopher Macgowan, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: "With a record 2.56m new cars sold in the UK in 2002, this report substantiates research showing it is virtually impossible to steal a new car without access to the correct keys." In another survey by Lloyds TSB Loans, one in 10 people admitted not locking their car doors and only half of drivers have an alarm fitted. People in the south-west appeared to be the least security conscious, with one in five regularly leaving their car doors unlocked. But Scots made the most effort, with only 4% leaving their cars unlocked.
