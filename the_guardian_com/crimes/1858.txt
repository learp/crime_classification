Television presenter Justin Lee Collins's ex-girlfriend repeatedly told him to dump her, his trial for domestic and emotional abuse heard on Wednesday.The 38-year-old said Anna Larke, whom he is accused of harassing, frequently phoned him with the "mantra": "There are things you don't know about me, there are things you don't know about me, there are things you don't know about, you need to dump me, you need to dump me."Collins is alleged to have made Larke, a recovering alcoholic, write down in a Pukka pad all her previous sexual encounters regardless of how graphic.The comedian, who shot to fame with Channel 4's The Friday Night Project, said making the sex list was her idea as cathartic, therapeutic and to "unburden herself".St Albans crown court heard that Collins did not want to write the details down but Larke, a video games public relations worker, dictated them to him.Sonia Woodley QC asked Collins: "Did it ever occur to you to ask her about boyfriends?""No," he answered."Were you interested?""No," he replied.He added: "She told me she wanted me to write everything in the pad. She couldn't bring herself to write it down herself and wanted me to do it."I felt that if she felt it was cathartic, therapeutic in some sense, for her to unburden and she wanted me to write it down, however odd I felt it seemed, if it helped her, then fine."Collins said his ex-girlfriend was worried about telling him about a relationship she had had with a man called "Charlie" who was famous and worked in the public domain.The man's surname was not divulged to the jury of nine women and three men.Collins said she screamed the man's name down the phone to him during a conversation in December 2010 when she was "almost incoherent"."I said to her that it didn't matter," said Collins. "She assumed it would."Collins denies harassment.
