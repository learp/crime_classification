The serial killer Dennis Nilsen was today refused permission to appeal against a recent court ruling that effectively denied him the right to continue working on and publishing his autobiography.Mr Justice Maurice Kay rejected his plea for a judicial review at the high court in London last month. Today, the judge rejected argument by Nilsen's lawyer, Alison Foster QC, that the court of appeal should consider the case because there were no recorded precedents relating to a prisoner's right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European convention on human rights. Nilsen had sought to overturn the refusal of the home secretary, David Blunkett, and the governor of Full Sutton prison, near York, to return a copy of his partially completed book. In his ruling last month, the judge said the secretary of state was "entitled to have regard to the likely effect of publication on members of the public, including survivors and the families of victims of Mr Nilsen's serial offences". Nilsen, 57, admitted killing and butchering 15 young men, most of them homeless homosexuals, at his north London home. The former policeman was jailed for life in 1983, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 25 years, on six counts of murder and two of attempted murder. He was later made the subject of a "whole life" tariff.
