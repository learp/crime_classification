Prisons would be legally obliged to provide specialist treatment and support to mentally ill inmates under Conservative proposals set before MPs.The plan to only detain mentally ill prisoners in jails with specialist facilities and staff was outlined in a private members' bill proposed yesterday by Charles Hendry, the MP for Wealden.Mr Hendry, the shadow industry minister, told the House of Commons that the current treatment of mentally ill prisoners was "a stain on our society".He highlighted the case of 29-year-old constituent Daniel Meehan, who died this year soon after being released from prison, where for 10 years his mental health and behavioural problems were not addressed.Mr Hendry said: "A young man with profound mental health needs died because he did not receive the help he needed. At the start of the 21st century that is something that should shame us all."The MP said the case showed official rules that all severely mentally ill prisoners would receive treatment and that none would leave without a care plan were not being followed.He said his bill would impose a legal requirement for mentally ill prisoners to receive appropriate specialist care."Those with mental health requirements would only be detained in establishments with specialised facilities and staff, trained to deal with them. And a pathway programme of support would have to be developed to ensure their mental needs are met," he told MPs.The private members bill would also require prisons to undertake an assessment of all prisoners educational needs in a bid to address the high rates of illiteracy and innumeracy among offenders. This would improve rehabilitation by giving them the skills to find legitimate work, said the MP.The bill, which has cross-party support, will get its second reading next year.
