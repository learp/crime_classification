So Zoe Williams reckons "there's a world of difference between a man who thinks he looks cool with a tough dog, and a young man ... encouraging it to be vicious" (Comment, 11 March). Really? I didn't notice the difference when my neighbour's pit bull/boxer cross tried to separate my cat from its head while he sat there smirking; I just wanted the vicious bastard and his dog to find a new home miles away from me.However, I did notice the difference when I worked with a guy who told us all, seriously and proudly, that he was teaching his two young staffs to react aggressively to the word "paki". The working class (Ms Williams mentioned council estates first), of which I'm from, is not one huddled, oppressed mass forever at the mercy of the "establishment". There are evil idiots among them, and if you don't believe me you are welcome to come and spend a day on my street, among the empty Stella cans, pizza boxes and dog mess.Name and address supplied• Two points on the government's plan to enforce microchipping of all dogs and third-party insurance to compensate victims (Man bytes dog, 9 March). 1) Microchipping is not an accurate way of tracing the owner of a dog, as it can be sold and not re-registered. 2) You cannot realistically force dog owners to take out insurance. There would have to be some kind of annual dog licence check.Just enforce the current law which says: "Possessing an unregistered pit bull terrier type dog is unlawful and if you have such a dog you are committing a criminal offence." Technically these types of dog can only be allowed out in public if they are muzzled, chipped and registered. If not, the police can take the dog and the owner will have to go to court to prove the dog is not a danger or it will be destroyed. I see at least eight every time I take my dog for a walk in my local park. How have so many pit bull types been allowed to exist? Jo SandersonLondon
