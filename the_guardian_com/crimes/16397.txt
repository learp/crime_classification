Asian prisoners in England and Wales now face more racist bullying and abuse than black prisoners, according to a survey published today.The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, says in a review of race relations in prisons that 52% of Asian inmates say they feel unsafe compared with 32% of whites and 18% of blacks.Her report says that while Asian prisoners face most racist abuse from other inmates, black prisoners felt that they were least likely to be treated with respect by staff. Ms Owers suggests that young black prisoners feel "confident and protected" by the strength of contemporary black youth culture in prisons.The report also shows that while most prison governors and white race relations officers take an optimistic view that generally the prison regime operates fairly for all minority ethnic groups, black and Asian prison staff were much less likely to believe progress was being made."A few complained about overt racism; many complained of subtle racism from colleagues, about which they were very reluctant to complain," said Ms Owers. White prison staff felt racism was principally an issue between prisoners and not one for staff.The survey, based on interviews with 5,500 prisoners in 18 prisons, found evidence of overt racism. A Palestinian said officers repeatedly accused him of a being a terrorist: "They call me Jihad and I don't like it." Another reported, "When they call a prisoner called Mr Singh they go 'la, la, la'." An officer was reported as saying: "G wing is becoming planet of the apes."But Ms Owers said such overt racism was rare and "subtle racism" was the problem with a very low level of understanding of cultural differences and little choice over food, especially Halal meat, and a general lack of respect for different religious beliefs.Ms Owers said that race awareness training for front line prison staff had been reduced when it needed to be increased."We have serious concern about the training now available for governors, and for the staff who need to implement change.""Without a specific and mandatory focus on race awareness, it is unlikely that managers or staff will be sufficiently equipped to break down the borders of the parallel worlds we have dscribed here," said the chief inspector.
