The number of race hate crimes in Britain has risen by nearly a third, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.The latest figures from the CPS, which do not include data from the period after the July 7 London bombings, show that racially aggravated offences in England and Wales rose by 29% compared with the previous year.The CPS said it prosecuted 4,600 people for race hate crimes between March 2004 and March 2005, but it expects the number to increase next year once the effect of the July 7 London bombings is felt.A spokesperson for the CPS said an initial look at cases currently in the justice system showed there has been a slight rise since July."We think they have gone up slightly, but that's the only indication we have at the moment. We will not see the full impact of the bombings until this time next year," she said.Today's figures revealed the number of racist incidents given to the CPS by the police rose by 22%. Most were assaults, criminal damage or public order offences, but four murders were also included.Of the 5,788 cases handed over to the CPS, 81% went to court, but there was a 5% increase in the number of race cases that had to be abandoned because witnesses refused to give evidence or failed to attend court.The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, said the CPS had worked hard to give victims confidence that their cases would be treated properly to encourage them to come forward."Last year many CPS areas moved to working with the police, giving on-the-spot legal advice and helping to construct trial-ready cases," he said."Compared to the last set of figures, 8% fewer racially aggravated charges were dropped because of insufficient evidence."The conviction rate for all race offences charged dropped by 2% to 84%.The number of religiously aggravated cases dropped to 34 from 49 the year before. In 67% of religion cases the victim was Muslim."Racist and religious crime does not simply injure the victim or their property," Mr Macdonald said."It affects the whole family and erodes the standards of decency of the wider community. We are determined to prosecute robustly wherever and whenever we can."A survey released in December 2004 revealed nearly 80% of the 1.8 million Muslims in the UK had experienced discrimination because of their faith compared with 50% in 2000 and 35% in 1999.
