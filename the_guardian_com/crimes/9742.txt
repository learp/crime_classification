A criminal gang is suspected of taking a woman hostage while over £1m was stolen from a cash delivery van in Belfast yesterday.The woman was kidnapped from her home at Belvoir on the south-eastern outskirts of Belfast early yesterday morning and held for up to eight hours at a derelict house.Her partner, who works for the Brink's security firm, was ordered to drop off the contents of a cash delivery van at a filling station. "He was to hand over a large sum of cash to an unknown party," a police spokeswoman said. "Once this handover had taken place the woman was released unharmed." Although police had not ruled out paramilitary involvement last night, there was nothing to suggest any link to the £26.5m Northern Bank robbery or the Makro cash-and-carry raid in Belfast, both blamed on the IRA. There appeared to be nothing directly pointing to paramilitary involvement. One security source said there were a number of gangs in Northern Ireland capable of this type of crime. Robberies involving hostage-taking - known as "tiger kidnappings" - are common in Northern Ireland and usually involve abducting the family members of an employee of the business being targeted. There were more than 40 last year, the most high profile being the Northern Bank robbery.Yesterday's robbery began when men arrived at the couple's home after midnight, and ended after the security guard obeyed orders to meet the gang at the garage, three miles from his house, leading to the woman's release yesterday morning. Parts of the filling station were sealed off yesterday and the three-storey unoccupied house where the woman had been held was being examined by forensic officers. Brink's, a security firm which services many cash dispensers, refused to comment. Meanwhile, four men and two woman were arrested in Co Fermanagh and Derbyshire yesterday as part of an investigation into money laundering in Northern Ireland.
