Police are treating as suspicious the deaths of a man and a woman in a house fire.The pair, who were in their 50s, had injuries "inconsistent with fire-related injuries", Greater Manchester police said.Officers were called to a house on Darley Avenue, Farnworth, Bolton, following reports of a fire shortly after 5.15pm yesterday.A man was taken to the Royal Bolton hospital, where he died. A woman had died at the scene.Det Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said: "A more detailed examination to establish the cause of the injuries will take place over the weekend."We are also continuing to seek the extended families of those who we believe to be the occupants of the house."Two police officers stood guard outside the corner semi-detached house, which had a smoke-blackened lintel above a downstairs front window.The dead man was named as Nigel Simms. A neighbour, 44, who did not wish to be named, said the deceased were a middle aged, unmarried couple.She said that the dead man had worked as a driver for the Hampsons bakery chain but had recently been ill and had epilepsy."He used to live there with his mum but she died a couple of years ago."Neighbour Jason Davis told the Bolton Evening News that he heard the couple's smoke alarm going off and saw the man standing in a doorway.He told the newspaper: "I said 'come on now' but he wouldn't come out. His T-shirt was absolutely covered in blood."It is not believed that detectives are looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.Police sources indicated the couple both had similar types of injuries but are refusing to comment on how they were inflicted until a postmortem is carried out.
