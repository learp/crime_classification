The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday 27 September 2009  We said that Judge Khan's cleaner had tried to blackmail him. In fact, she was never convicted of blackmailing Judge Khan. She appealed against her conviction for blackmail (involving a Judge J) and theft (involving Judge Khan). All charges were dropped and therefore she was cleared on both counts. Apologies. A Brazilian cleaner was today jailed for 33 months for blackmailing a female judge and stealing sex videos from a male judge who was her lover.Passing sentence at the Old Bailey, the recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont, told Roselane Driza that she was "a greedy and determined woman".After Driza was sent down, blowing a kiss as she went, her lawyers said she would be seeking to appeal. Galbraith Branley, solicitors for Driza, 37, said: "The case is by no means concluded."During the trials at the Old Bailey last month, Driza, 37, made serious allegations about the drug- and sex-fuelled private lives of the two full-time immigration judges - a woman referred to as Judge J and Mohammed Ilyas Khan - which led the lord chancellor and the lord chief justice to launch a formal investigation into their conduct.Driza claimed Judge J and Mr Khan had known she was in Britain illegally when they employed her as a cleaner. The judges deny this.Driza was found guilty of making a Â£20,000 blackmail demand to Judge J after being sacked as her cleaner in 2004. She threatened in letters to Judge J to tell the prime minister, the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the lord chancellor that she had been employed illegally.Driza overstayed in Britain in 1998 after arriving on a visitor's visa. The jury was not told that her former husband was an Albanian serial killer who is wanted by the Metropolitan police for murder.
