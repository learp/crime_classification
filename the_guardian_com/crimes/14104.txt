Neighbours who discover that a husband is beating his wife have a duty to report him to the police, Harriet Harman, the solicitor general, says in an interview today.Ms Harman calls for society's attitude to domestic violence to change so that citizens feel compelled to turn offenders in even if they are friends. She said: "If you see someone burgling your neighbour, you don't think: 'Shall I intervene?' A man who beats his wife is a violent criminal." Ms Harman said she thought neighbourhood watch coordinators throughout Britain knew of people who beat their partners, but chose not to report them. "We have managed to change our view about people who harm children. Now we must start taking the same approach with violence against women," she said. Ms Harman said the government could not live up to its commitment to tackle violent crime unless it dealt with domestic violence. She suggested the police and courts needed to do more. "Domestic violence is something the criminal justice system can do something about and must do something about," she told the Independent newspaper.
