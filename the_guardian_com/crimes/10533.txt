The chief constable of Cleveland police and his deputy have been freed on police bail after being questioned for a day and a half by detectives investigating fraud and corruption..Sean Price, the force's chief, and Derek Bonnard, his deputy, were arrested on Wednesday morning along with the former Cleveland police solicitor Caroline Llewellyn. Llewellyn was released on police bail on Wednesday night but the two men remained in custody and their questioning resumed on Thursday.The investigation is examining the way in which members of Cleveland police authority carried out their business and is focusing on a number of contracts. The authority rules allow contracts worth up to £150,000 to be approved and authorised by the chief constable.The arrest of the two most senior Cleveland police officers has left the force in crisis, coming three months after the resignation of the chairman of the police authority, which is also under investigation.Price is the subject of a separate investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) into claims he used "undue influence" to get an individual appointed to a position within the force.Price, Bonnard and Llewellyn – who recently received £213,379 in a voluntary redundancy payoff – were questioned by detectives at a police station in North Yorkshire on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, corrupt practice and fraud by abuse of position.The criminal inquiry, being run by Warwickshire police with the help of officers from North Yorkshire, is understood to include an examination of the way business contracts were awarded by the police authority. As part of the investigation searches were carried out at properties linked to those who were arrested.Shortly after the three were taken in for questioning, members of Cleveland police authority – which has previously strongly backed the chief constable – held an extraordinary meeting behind closed doors, at which it voted to suspend Price and Bonnard.A spokesman for the authority said: "Cleveland police authority can confirm that it has been made aware of potential conduct matters involving chief officers of Cleveland police. The authority can confirm that two chief officers have been suspended from their posts with Cleveland police while the investigations are being considered."It should be emphasised that suspension is a neutral act and it should not be inferred from the decision to suspend that the potential conduct matters have been proven in respect to the two chief officers concerned."The authority said it had referred the matters to the IPCC.The inquiry by Warwickshire police began after a review by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary into the way some individuals within Cleveland police authority "may have conducted some of its business". After the review misconduct issues were passed to the IPCC and the criminal investigation began under the command of Keith Bristow, chief constable of Warwickshire, using North Yorkshire detectives.Price has been chief constable of Cleveland police since 2003. He is paid £191,905, including £54,421 agreed by the police authority to stop him being poached by other forces. Under Price's watch crime has gone down on the Cleveland force's beat, which is one of the smallest in the country.
