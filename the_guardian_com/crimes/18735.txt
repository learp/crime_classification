A teenager who chopped off a man's hand with a sword after an argument in a Chinese restaurant was convicted of grievous bodily harm yesterday.Shaun Campbell, 19, attacked Mark Togstead after a row at the Shangri-La in Liverpool with two of Campbell's friends. The jury at Liverpool crown court took just over two hours to find him guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, and affray. Stuart Driver, prosecuting, described the attack as an act of medieval violence. On the night of the incident in November 2001 Mr Togstead and a friend became involved in an argument with Danny Gilmore and his girlfriend, Melanie Corridon, who were seated at the next table. After Mr Togstead and his friend left the restaurant, and were trying to find a taxi, Campbell and another man - allegedly Mr Gilmore - came running at them after Mr Gilmore had used a mobile phone to contact Campbell. Campbell later denied being involved in the incident. Mr Togstead told the court he was being chased by Campbell when he felt something hit his hand. When he looked down at his right arm he saw that his hand was lying on the ground. He was taken to hospital in a police car and underwent a 16-hour operation in which his hand was reattached. Campbell was remanded in custody until May 9 for pre-sentence reports. Mr Gilmore has been charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent but has not faced trial after he failed to attend court.
