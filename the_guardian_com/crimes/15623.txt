A long-awaited inquest into the death of a black man who slipped into a coma after being restrained by eight police officers more than four years ago is finally due to open today.Roger Sylvester, 30, died seven days after being restrained by police outside his house in Tottenham, north London, on January 11 1999. Police were called to the address after he was seen apparently naked, rolling on the floor and banging on his front door. The born-again Christian had previously been treated for depression and the police detained him under the Mental Health Act. He was taken to hospital naked and handcuffed but he collapsed and stopped breathing, allegedly while police were restraining him. No doctor was present at the time, having left the room to get a sedative. The care worker remained in a coma until his life support machine was switched off a week later. His family, who have campaigned tirelessly to find out how and why he died, wanted the officers to face criminal charges. In November 2000 the crown prosecution service decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. In May 2001 the high court blocked the Sylvesters' attempt to gain a judicial review of the CPS's decision. Lord Justice Woolf said their challenge should await the outcome of the inquest. After years of setbacks Sheila Sylvester will finally hear the evidence of the circumstances surrounding her son's death.
