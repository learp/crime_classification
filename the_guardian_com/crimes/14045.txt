Greater Manchester police is being investigated for its handling of the murder of a woman at the hands of her ex-partner, who had a history of domestic violence, it emerged yesterday.The Independent Police Complaints Commission will examine the police response to complaints from Katie Summers in the days before she was killed by Brian Taylor, 29, last October.The investigation comes as ministers launch a consultation on violence against women in England and Wales.Taylor stabbed Summers, 24, to death at her home in Bolton while their two young children were in the house. The IPCC said officers visited the victim's home four times in the days before her death. On the final occasion Taylor was arrested for an unconnected offence and released on bail.The pair had been involved in a violent and volatile relationship for eight years, and were separated at the time of her death.The court heard that Taylor was consumed with jealousy when he discovered Summers had been out to a nightclub and vowed to friends that he would kill her.He told one friend he was going to break into his ex-lover's home and stab her, but the friend thought he was joking and ignored the remarks.Summers, also known as Katie Boardman, was fatally attacked in the lounge of her house in Farnworth, near Bolton. Taylor did not harm his three-year-old son and two-year-old daughter and drove them to his mother's house where he confessed to the killing.Naseem Malik, IPCC commissioner for the north-west, said the watchdog would assess whether police took "appropriate action" when contacted by Summers. She said: "Our focus initially will be on several incidents Greater Manchester police dealt with after Ms Summers moved back into the area in the summer of 2007."Taylor, from Bolton, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 17 years after he pleaded guilty to the killing. He was sentenced at Manchester crown court last month.The chairman of the IPCC, Nick Hardwick, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: "We have a systemic cluster of domestic violence cases coming to us at the moment and there are a number of common themes with what has gone wrong. I think, generally, people accept that the police response to these sorts of murders has improved but one death, of course, is one too many."What we are trying to do is to use the experience of cases like Katie's to make sure the police learn from them and improve their performance."The Crown Prosecution Service said last week it would apologise to the family of a domestic violence victim who was murdered by her husband. Malik Mannan, 36, stabbed to death Sabina Akhtar, 26, days after his bail conditions were removed.
