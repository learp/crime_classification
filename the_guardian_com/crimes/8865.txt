The parents of a schoolgirl abused by a paedophile she met in an internet chatroom yesterday said they were "disgusted" by a judge's decision to jail him for three years.Simon Moore was sentenced at the high court in Edinburgh after he earlier admitted having sex with the teenager, from Renfrewshire. Moore, of Hackney, east London, is serving six years for abducting and abusing a schoolgirl from Humberside while on bail for his assault on the Scottish girl. Lord Philip ordered the three-year sentence should only begin on conclusion of the six-year term. But outside court the girl's family reacted with anger at the "leniency". Her father said: "I'm appalled. We came here with high hopes he would get his just rewards." Moore was due to be sentenced at Paisley sheriff court last month, but the judge referred him to the high court, saying he believed his powers were not sufficient.
