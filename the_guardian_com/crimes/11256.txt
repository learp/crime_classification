Two more men were arrested yesterday in connection with the death of a holidaymaker run over while trying to stop his car being stolen outside Liverpool John Lennon airport.Earlier this week detectives investigating the death of Michael Howard, 57, arrested two men, aged 19 and 20, who were both still being questioned last night. Merseyside police said a third, aged 21, was arrested yesterday and a fourth, aged 17, was held later. Mr Howard, a father of three and director of a Salford pharmaceutical company, was unloading luggage when a man jumped into his silver Volvo estate and began to drive away. He died after being trapped beneath the wheels of his car during the incident. He had been due to fly to Malaga with his wife, Elaine. Magistrates gave the detectives extra time yesterday to question the 19-year-old man, who is from the Woolton area of Liverpool and who was arrested on Tuesday night. The 20-year-old man, from the Speke district of Liverpool, was arrested on Wednesday evening. The incident was the third carjacking at the airport in six months.
