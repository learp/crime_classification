The health authority which controls the area where Dr Shipman practised has set up a support telephone line for families and staff affected by the case.David Common, chief executive of West Pennine Health Authority, said: "I would like to offer, on behalf of the health authority, my deepest sympathy to the relatives and friends of the people who have suffered at the hands of Dr Shipman."Not only have they had to come to terms with the unexpected loss of loved ones but to find out that they died at the hands of a trusted doctor is appalling beyond belief. "I also want to tender to them our sincere condolences at what happened on behalf of the health authority and to the whole of the NHS locally. "It is difficult to express how we feel in words. We have emerged from this deeply shocked and saddened by these events." Mr Common said the health authority would co-operate fully with any further action that the Government decides to take and was offering the families involved the opportunity to meet them and discuss their concerns. Mr Common added that a prior investigation into Shipman, which took place in March 1998, would now be re-examined. He said the medical adviser to the health authority, Dr Alan Banks, had now been suspended. Dr Banks examined the patient records as part of the investigation which took place more than three months before Shipman murdered his last victim, Kathleen Grundy. Mr Common added: "Suspension is purely a neutral act and does not in any way imply wrongdoing by Dr Banks." In a statement Dr Banks said: "The decision to suspend me has come as a deep surprise and a disappointment. I will be happy to co-operate fully with the inquiry that West Pennine Health Authority are wishing to conduct." Dr Banks added that in the meantime he did not want to add any comments and would be asking guidance from the Medical Protection Society to see what actions were open to him.
