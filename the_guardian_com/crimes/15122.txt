Gordon Brown today accused the Tories of turning their backs on their traditional stance of being tough on crime by refusing to support Labour plans for the DNA database.Conservative proposals to remove all innocent people from the database – apart from those accused of the most violent crimes – would mean more criminals escaping punishment if they win the election, he said.The government this week legislated to limit the retention of DNA profiles to six years, under pressure from the European court of human rights, which ruled the indefinite storage of data illegal.The Tories wanted to further limit that to three years, but dropped their opposition in the wash-up of legislation at the end of the parliament, pledging to instead remove data from people who are not charged or convicted of crimes, bar the most serious allegations. They also committed to adding the profiles of every prisoner in England if elected.Brown said it marked a firm dividing line with the Tories, with Labour committed to taking tougher action to tackle crime. The government has been heavily criticised by human rights groups over the database.After seeing youth projects designed to dissuade young people form criminal activities, Brown told a meeting of Labour activists at a community centre in Stevenage: "This is a big issue and a big dividing line at this election."I'm sorry to say that the Conservative party has turned its back on their tradition and said they will destroy that [DNA] data."He was joined by Linda Bowman, the mother of Sally Anne Bowman who was brutally murdered and her body raped on the driveway of her home in 2005. Her killer Mark Dixie was convicted in 2008 on the basis of DNA evidence which also cleared her boyfriend, who had just dropped her off, of the crime. Dixie's DNA profile had been added to the database after he was arrested for a violent assault.She said: "If it wasn't for the DNA found on Sally Anne her boyfriend would be serving a sentence for a murder he didn't commit."Bowman has previously suggested that the DNA database should include profiles of everyone in the country in a bid to solve crimes.The home secretary, Alan Johnson, who was accompanying Brown today, said: "Linda Bowman is a remarkable and brave woman who has suffered the most unspeakable tragedy, yet still manages to be a compassionate campaigner for good."As Mrs Bowman says, the use of DNA helps the police put the most dangerous criminals behind bars but can also exonerate the innocent."Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said: "Election fever seems to be confusing the debate about DNA retention. It has been suggested that the tragic case of Sally Anne Bowman was only solved because her murderer was 'an innocent' on the database. In fact, he was arrested for a separate violent offence, and it was then that his DNA was matched to the crime scene."We all agree that DNA taken on arrest should be checked against unsolved crimes – this is entirely different from stockpiling the DNA of innocent men, women and children for years on end."Campaign group GeneWatch UK said the home secretary was misleading the public about the benefits of expanding the DNA database.Dr Helen Wallace said: "Murders solved by keeping innocent people's DNA records are as elusive as the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. If the government has a case to make why can't it produce the evidence?"
