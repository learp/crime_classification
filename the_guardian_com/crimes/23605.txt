Thousands of low-risk criminals could be released early from jail as part of a government drive to ease soaring prison numbers, it has emerged.The Home Office confirmed that a number of options were being considered to create space in the packed prisons of England and Wales.It is understood that one such option would be allowing governors to release low-risk prisoners 10 days before the end of their sentence, which could potentially see thousands walk free.Latest figures show the prison population is now 79,010, close to full capacity.A Home Office spokeswoman insisted that no decision had yet been taken on how best to ease prison congestion."The new home secretary [John Reid] has made additional prison places a high priority," she said."In July, he announced that a further 8,000 prison places will be built to manage the pressures on the prison population following the recent review of the criminal justice system."In the meantime, a number of options for managing the prison population are being considered, but no decision has been taken."The early release would involve extending "prison rule nine", known as transitional home leave, that already allows prisoners to be temporarily released for a number of reasons.Those available for early release would be people sentenced to more than four weeks but less that four years in prison.It would not include high-risk prisoners such as those convicted of manslaughter, child cruelty, grievous bodily harm with intent, sex offenders and foreign nationals who could be deported.Last week, it emerged that young offenders eligible for early release were to be identified as a matter of urgency to prevent youth prisons becoming full. The youth justice board, which oversees the running of prisons for young people, proposed a series of new measures because institutions were nearly full. Meanwhile, it was reported that as few as approximately 400 cells were still empty in prisons.Pentonville prison was forced to reduce inmate numbers by 116 to 1,011 after the suspension of 14 warders in the wake of a corruption investigation.Brian Caton, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, warned that other prisons could suffer from the "shuffle the pack" policy.During the jail overcrowding crisis of 2002, inmates were held in police cells at five times the cost of regular cells.The director of the Prison Reform Trust, Juliet Lyon, welcomed the government's attempts to reduce the prison population, but warned that far more preventative work needed to be undertaken to solve the overcrowding crisis."It's good to see [the] government at last considering how to reduce prison numbers to sensible, safe levels, but bad that this comes as a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis of its own making, driven not by crime rates but by tough political posturing and ever-harsher sentencing," she said."As well as moves to prepare prisoners for release and so prevent offending, the home secretary should move upstream to invest in preventative work with young people at risk, court diversion for the mentally ill and treatment for addicts."These measures, together with a reduction in any unnecessary use of remand and recall and opportunities for foreign national prisoners, where possible, to serve their sentences in their home country, would solve the problem in a more effective way," she said.But the government's predicament over the lack of prison places received short shrift from the opposition.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "When this issue was raised two months ago the Home Office denied it."It is time the government admitted that its own serial failure has lead to the chronic lack of capacity in our prisons and did something about it. "Prison overcrowding leads to dangerous criminals being released early, being inappropriately paroled, or not being sent to prison in the first place."It also means there is little chance of them being rehabilitated from drugs or crime and retrained for an honest life."Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said that the proposals were a "sticking plaster solution" to the overcrowding crisis."The government has totally failed to put in place a long term strategy to tackle the ever-growing numbers of prisoners", he said."What we need is a coherent plan from the Home Office, not a series of panic measures."
