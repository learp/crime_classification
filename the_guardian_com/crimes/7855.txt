The two officers who shot dead an unarmed man in east London five years ago must remain suspended, Scotland Yard deputy commissioner Sir Ian Blair ruled last night.Chief Inspector Neil Sharman and Constable Kevin Fagan were suspended on October 29 when an inquest jury decided they unlawfully killed Harry Stanley, 46, outside a pub in Hackney, in 1999. They were tipped off that Mr Stanley was carrying a gun but it turned out to be a table leg in a plastic bag. The suspension sparked an unofficial strike by police firearms officers. Sir Ian, who takes over as Metropolitan police commissioner next February, said he sympathised with the Stanley family and the officers, particularly given the length of the legal process. But he could not ignore the jury's verdict, which was a finding against the actions of the two officers rather than police firearms procedures. He promised to review the officers' status on a monthly basis and seek an alternative to formal suspension in similar circumstances. The Stanley family welcomed the decision but said they were worried about Sir Ian's plans to review it. "The family considers that the officers should remain suspended and should not return to work in any capacity, albeit limited, pending a decision on charges by the crown prosecution service," a statement said. But the Metropolitan Police Federation condemned failure to reinstate the officers as "grossly unfair", insisting there was no mandatory requirement to suspend them. Mrs Fagan, the wife of Kevin Fagan and also a serving police officer, said the Met had not supported her husband since Mr Stanley's death. "I have every sympathy with the Stanley family," she said. "However, from day one, they have been on television and radio and in the press, and that is very, very stressful to deal with when nobody knows our side of the story. At the end of the day police officers are human, aren't they? They don't have x-ray vision. They didn't know what was in that bag."
