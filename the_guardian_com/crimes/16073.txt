The public is being warned against taking vigilante action against some of Britain's most wanted paedophiles after they were identified publicly yesterday on a new website dedicated to tracking them down.In what is being seen as the closest the UK has come to introducing an equivalent of America's Megan's Law, five child sex offenders had their pictures, names and profiles published on the internet on a website set up by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre.The move is thought to be the first time that details of convicted paedophiles have been published nationwide by Britain's law enforcement agencies.The five men named on the website are Alexander Colin Dalgleish, Gordon Stewart, Paul Turner (also known as Paul Francis or Geddes), Joshua Karney, who also goes by five other names, and Kamil Krawiec. Dalgleish has connections with Merseyside and the West Midlands, Stewart to central, north and north-west England and Scotland, Turner to the south coast, Karney to Lancashire but travels all over the UK, and Krawiec has links to Hackney and Earl's Court in London, and to Birmingham.The men have gone missing after failing to comply with legal restrictions on their movements. Breaching these "notification requirements" - which are conditions of their placement on the sex offenders register - is an arrestable offence punishable with up to five years in prison.The CEOP Centre stressed that the website was not about "naming and shaming" offenders whose whereabouts are known, but finding those who have gone missing. The initiative is running together with the Crimestoppers Most Wanted site, which is designed to help track down Britain's most dangerous on-the-run criminals.Jim Gamble, chief executive of the CEOP Centre, said: "I cannot emphasise strongly enough the need for the public to act responsibly if they believe they know the location of a sought offender. They must make immediate reports of sightings so that the police can take appropriate action. Any vigilante activity will be robustly dealt with and is likely to constitute a criminal offence, resulting in arrest and prosecution."The Home Office has resisted the campaign for a UK version of Megan's Law, giving the public access to details of sex offenders living in their communities.Yesterday's move coincides with the first anniversary of the Crimestoppers Most Wanted site, which has received almost 40m hits and led to 24 arrests since it went live last November. It lists Britain's 10 most wanted criminals and carries appeals for information on others. Currently, 32 police forces and government agencies are signed up to the website.
