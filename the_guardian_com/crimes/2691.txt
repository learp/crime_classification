Two men were caught discussing a plot to send a remote-controlled toy car laden with explosives under the gap of a gate at a Territorial Army base, a court has heard.Covert recordings were made of Zahid Iqbal, 31, and Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, 25, discussing the plan, with the explosives made following instructions from a terrorism manual called Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.Iqbal, Ahmed, Umar Arshad, 24, and Syed Farhan Hussain, 21, all from Luton, have already admitted one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism.On Monday Woolwich crown court heard more details of the case against them as the court considered what sentences to pass.Iqbal was recorded telling Ahmed about a possible target in Luton: "I was looking and drove past like the TA centre, Marsh Road. At the bottom of their gate there's quite a big gap."If you had a little toy car it drives underneath one of their vehicles or something."The men were arrested after an operation by the domestic security service, MI5, and police.Max Hill QC, prosecuting, said the evidence showed that Iqbal had been acting as a facilitator for people who wanted to travel for extremist purposes, adding that he had direct contact with a Pakistani operative who was given the pseudonym Modern Sleeve.By spring 2011 Iqbal had lost contact with Modern Sleeve in Pakistan, he said. As a result of this, and also inspired by information from a banned al-Qaida online magazine, Inspire, Iqbal and Ahmed began to focus on attack planning in the UK, Hill said."They discussed making an IED [improvised explosive device] following instructions from an Inspire magazine which they planned to adapt," Hill said. "They also identified a target for such an attack, namely a Territorial Army base in their locality, although they discussed targeting multiple sites at one time."A search of Iqbal's house found a hard drive containing a number of items including a copy of 44 Ways to Support Jihad, by Anwar al-Awlaki, the court heard.A copy of Inspire, including articles on how to bypass airport security and avoid detection by x-ray scanning equipment, how to transport explosives in printer cartridges and how packages were shipped to Yemen in cargo planes was also found.In May 2011 Ahmed and Hussain were recorded discussing the possibility of doing an "inside job" on MI5, Hill said, adding: "Hussain referred to having a cousin in the US air force who could do a lot of damage. They later discussed the fact that Ahmed wanted to buy a replicaÂ firearm."The four men were arrested following a series of raids last April at their homes.Hill said the evidence uncovered from the raids, from computers, sim cards and travel documents, showed their involvement in violent terrorism: "This evidence supports the product of eavesdropping and surveillance in showing the radicalisation of the defendants and their commitment to engage in violent jihad in the sense of violent terrorist attacks against the military and civilian population of western states such as the United Kingdom."Hill said an officer at the Forensic Explosives Laboratory had confirmed that the article Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom would have allowed the manufacture of explosives from ingredients that would "at least in some instances" be readily available. "Overall the document provided reasonably clear instructions on how to manufacture an improvised explosive device, including a timer, and the necessary components were identified," he said. "He [the officer] further observed that the proposed modifications in the instructions would probably render the device not viable."The court was told that Ahmed was observed on numerous occasions attending a gym for training and going on trips to mountainous regions with others. Hill said: "He stated that Snowdon was a particular favourite location to train because within the UK it bears the most resemblance to the mountainous regions of Pakistan."The surveillance in Snowdon shows on occasions Ahmed and others carrying out regimental walking, press-ups, running in formation and using logs and branches, perhaps as mock firearms."Hill has asked the judge, Mr Justice Wilkie QC, for a further 13 counts relating to the possession of information contrary to section 58(1) (b) of the Terrorism Act 2000 to be left on file.The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday when mitigation for the men will be heard from their lawyers before they are sentenced.
