The chief of the Metropolitan police yesterday appealed to mobile phone companies to make it more difficult to swap identity cards between handsets in an attempt to halt the alarming rise in phone related robberies among teenagers.Many parents believe mobile phones make their children safer, but according to Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, recent figures show that more than 30% of robberies involve mobile phones.Sir John said he believed the theft of mobile phones was an extension of playground bullying, with more than 70% of London street robberies involving victims and offenders under 17."Forty per cent of people arrested for street crime have no previous convictions, so this is a new phenomenon that we need to tackle before it gets out of hand," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."It is matter of bullying in the play yard that goes on into the streets. Over 30% of the robberies involve mobile phones, so what we are finding here is a schoolboy or schooolgirl attacking another to get those particular mobile phones."What we can do is make a plea to the mobile industry so that you can't just take a chip out of one phone and put it in another. It is a very simple way of dealing with that particular problem."The other way we can deal with it is for us to work with other agencies and actually get out there into the schools and do some crime prevention."According to Scotland Yard a new breed of young criminals, many as young as 10, are regularly committing street robberies because it will give them credibility and status. Many of the offenders target pupils known to them and then put pressure on the victims not to come forward for fear of reprisals.With the massive rise in the number of mobile phones - it is estimated that more than 4m were given as Christmas presents this year - they have become an easy target for thieves.Industry figures suggest that 15,000 mobile phones are stolen nationwide each month. When a phone is stolen thieves can replace the subscriber identity module (SIM) card in seconds, giving the handset a new phone number.Every handset has an electronic fingerprint, the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) code, which enables stolen handsets to be barred even after the SIM card has been replaced. But Britain's two largest mobile phone networks, Vodafone and BT Cellnet, do not operate the system.Neither company could make anybody available to comment yesterday, but earlier this month Vodafone said it was impractical to use the IMEI system to block stolen phones.
