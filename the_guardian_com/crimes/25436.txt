The brothers of an architect stabbed to death in daylight told yesterday how the heart had been "torn out" of their family as they pleaded with his killer to give himself up.Bernard Hegarty, 29, died on Monday after being stabbed once through the heart last Wednesday in Bethnal Green, east London. Mr Hegarty was attacked as he walked through busy streets near his architect's practice, shopping for a carpet. Yesterday his brothers Matthew, 26, and Michael, 31, spoke at a press conference, which it is hoped will encourage witnesses to come forward. Matthew, 26, said: "The heart of our family has been torn out. We want this individual caught before he destroys the life of any other family." Michael, 31, described the toll the killer had exacted on the family: "He tried to rob my brother, but he has robbed us and he has torn us apart." Mr Hegarty was stabbed in the chest and found bleeding in the street by passersby. At least one witness is believed to have seen the struggle as Mr Hegarty refused to hand over his wallet. He was airlifted to the Royal London hospital, Whitechapel, where his family, who live in north London, were by his bedside until he died. Detective Chief Inspector Jim Condron said the motive for the attack was thought to be robbery.
