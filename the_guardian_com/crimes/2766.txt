The flagship London store of the Italian fashion label Prada was the target of an audacious smash-and-grab raid of designer handbags in the early hours of Friday morning.Four men broke the front windows of the Old Bond Street shop and took as many handbags as they could carry before speeding off on two mopeds just before 1.30am.Soon afterwards, one of the mopeds crashed into a lamp post in nearby Conduit Street. Some of the handbags, which are thought to be worth more than Â£1,000 each, were recovered by police at the scene of the crash.The Metropolitan police have launched a hunt for the four men and are appealing for witnesses.Anyone with information is asked to call Police on 101 or, to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
