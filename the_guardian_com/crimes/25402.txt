A prison reform charity said today it had been unaware of the scale of the problem at a prison condemned by the chief inspector of prisons as "dismal" and described as having a "significant" drug problem.The Penal Reform Trust said it knew about problems of overcrowding at The Mount prison in Hertfordshire. However it said was shocked to hear of the other issues highlighted in the recent inspection report such as the drugs problem, which inspectors said was threatening the jail's security and the safety of prisoners.Director of the trust, Juliet Lyon, said this morning: "We had heard that the prison was struggling with overcrowding but that was all."If The Mount, a relatively modern prison, can get into such a shocking state in our overcrowded prison system, you shudder to think about conditions that face prisoners in Victorian local jails."She said it was "depressing" that with such a number of checks and balances in the prison system that The Mount, which was described just three years ago in an earlier inspection report as "good", had deteriorated so quickly.But she was optimistic that the list of failings identified in the latest inspector's report, which included bullying, poor record keeping and a sentence planning procedure which was in disarray, could be overcome.She said: "They will be able to lift it off the ground. When inspectors give a damning report everybody lifts the level again."In her report published today the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, said the prison should never have been allowed to deteriorate to the level it had and it had failed to offer a "safe" or "decent" environment to its 760 male inmates.
