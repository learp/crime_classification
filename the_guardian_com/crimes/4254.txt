A conman was jailed for 16 months today after selling forgeries of works by the artist Tracey Emin for £26,000. Jonathan Rayfern, 32, made at least 11 fakes after working alongside Emin at her gallery in London in order to study her methods. He sold the forgeries to two unsuspecting buyers on eBay. Emin was "hurt and distressed" by the fraud, the court heard. Rayfern, of Manchester – a former art student at the University of Westminster – admitted 10 counts of fraud and one of deception at Manchester crown court. Rayfern was "beguiled by art, beauty and celebrity" and forged the works to pay debts to a loan shark, the court heard.He claimed Emin was a personal friend on Facebook and boasted of visiting London's Groucho Club with the artist.Jailing Rayfern, Judge Martin Rudland said: "It is important the integrity and provenance of established and aspiring artists is not undermined by the deliberate forgery of their endeavours."It is in the public interest that our cultural heritage should not be compromised in this way."It may be you are a skilled artist yourself but there is a streak of dishonesty in you. There may well be an element of the fantasist about you, but the reality has come home to roost."
