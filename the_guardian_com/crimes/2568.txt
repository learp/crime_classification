The merger of the prison and probation services will lead to more offenders being made to compensate their victims, the Home Office pledged today.The prisons and probation minister, Paul Goggins, said that restorative justice schemes, whereby offenders apologise and make reparation to their victims, will be a "key plank" of the new national offender management system (Noms).Addressing the National Probation Service's international conference on reducing reoffending and cutting crime, Mr Goggins said: "We are embarking on the next stage of reform with a renewed emphasis on less serious offenders paying back to their communities for the crimes they have committed. "Sometimes this will be through the use of fixed penalty fines and sometimes through other forms of reparation, such as unpaid work."The Home Office has pledged that the creation of Noms, announced earlier this month, will cut both reoffending and prison overcrowding.The home secretary, David Blunkett, has said it will lead to a shake-up of sentencing with a greater focus on intensive community programmes - such as fines based on the ability to pay - rather than short prison sentences.Mr Goggins added that Noms would improve the enforcement and credibility of community sentences, which have been criticised for being soft on criminals. He said: "It will ensure that both custodial and community punishments make offenders address their behaviour and offer a path away from crime." The minister added that Noms would also place a greater emphasis on education in a bid to break the link between poor school performance and criminality.
