The singer George Michael could be jailed today after he admitted crashing his Range Rover while under the influence of cannabis.The 47-year-old, whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou, was found slumped at the wheel of his car after it crashed into a branch of Snappy Snaps in Hampstead, north London.Police who banged on the window suspected Michael was under the influence of something after they found him "spaced out" and with no memory of what had happened.The former Wham! star was found carrying two cannabis cigarettes, and tests on a sample of his blood showed he had chemicals linked to the drug in his system.The court heard Michael was also convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes in October 2006.The crash was the latest in a long line of clashes with the law for the singer, who has been open about his use of cannabis and recently claimed he was trying to cut down.The singer has been cautioned for drugs possession, questioned over several minor accidents and was fined for "engaging in a lewd act" in a public toilet in California.Michael, who appeared with heavy security at Highbury Corner magistrates court last month, admitted driving while unfit through drugs and possessing two cannabis cigarettes when he was held in Hampstead in the early hours of 4 July.District Judge Robin McPhee gave him an interim six-month driving ban and warned him he could be jailed.The judge said: "I make it clear all options in respect of sentencing remain open, including powers to imprison."It is a serious matter. Your driving was extremely poor and there was an accident. There is also your conviction from three years ago."Michael was arrested shortly before 4am when two police officers found him apparently unconscious in his Range Rover in Rosslyn Hill, Hampstead.Penny Fergusson, prosecucting, said Michael appeared to try to get the car back in gear when he was roused by one officer banging on his window.She said: "Mr Michael looked at the officer with his eyes wide open and the officers could see his pupils were dilated. They opened the door and could see he was dripping with sweat."The court heard Michael did not initially respond to police and, when asked what his name was, replied: "George."When he got out of the car, the officers found he was breathing heavily and had to be held up.Fergusson said Michael was confused and, when told he had crashed into a shop, added: "No I didn't. I didn't crash into anything."He was handcuffed, arrested and driven to Hampstead police station, where he failed a test to find whether he was fit to drive. He had not been drinking.The prosecutor added: "He could not remember the route he took or crashing his car. He just remembers the police officer knocking at his window."Michael admitted smoking a "small quantity" of cannabis at about 10pm the previous evening, and said he also took a newly-prescribed sedative to help him sleep.He told police he decided to drive between his homes in Highgate and Hampstead to meet a friend on the spur of the moment and forgot he had taken the sedative.His barrister, Mukul Chawla QC, said his legal team would undertake further research about the impact of the sedative on Michael before the next hearing.Chawla said his client had "clearly" been unfit to drive and could not remember when he took the prescribed drug. He said this was no excuse for the offence.The court heard Michael had stopped driving after his latest crash.
