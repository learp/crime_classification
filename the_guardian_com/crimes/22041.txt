A lawyer from Birmingham has become the most highly paid legal aid barrister in the country after pulling in more than £1.1m last year.Figures released yesterday by the Ministry of Justice revealed that Balbir Singh, head of Equity Chambers, was paid £1,116,000 in legal aid fees in 2005-06. It was the second year in a row that the biggest payout to a legal aid barrister has hit seven figures.Mr Singh is the only one of the top 10 earners not to have been made a Queen's counsel (QC), the elite status which entitles barristers to charge higher fees.Fundamental changes to the legal aid system announced a year ago were trumpeted as "the end of £1m-a -year criminal defence barristers". But the reforms have not yet kicked in and the top 10 in 2005-06 drew almost £8.6m in public money.Mr Singh, 50, practises from chambers in Birmingham. A former magistrates' clerk, he was born in Walsall, went to grammar school there and to Walsall College, and took a law degree at Coventry Polytechnic, according to his chambers.He defends mainly in terrorism, murder and serious fraud cases. He was not available for comment yesterday because he was involved in a trial in Leeds.In 2004-05 the £1m legal aid barrier was breached for the first time when James Sturman QC received £1.18m. Last year he dropped to seventh place, with £765,000.The top nine in 2005-06 all earned over £700,000, with the tenth pulling in £699,000. The figures include 17.5% VAT, to be repaid to HM Revenue and Customs. Second highest was Nigel Lithman QC, with £978,000, followed by John Rees QC, £947,000, and Oliver Blunt QC, at £913,000.The figures will embarrass the justice minister, Lord Falconer, who has repeatedly pledged an end to £1m a year legal aid barristers. Around 1% of cases in the crown court consume more than 40% of the crown court legal aid budget. The problem has been exacerbated by ever lengthier trials with multiple defendants, culminating in the collapse of the Jubilee Line extension fraud case in March 2005 at a cost of £60m.Proposals by Lord Carter of Coles, published last summer, aim to cut criminal defence fees over four years, freeing up money for the underfunded areas of civil and family law.Labour MP Andrew Dismore said: "I think it's bizarre that bewigged fat cats are profiting to this extent at the same time as the bread-and-butter legal aid work through the advice agencies and voluntary groups is being cut back. There has to be some thought given to rebalancing the legal aid budget."Top 10 earnersBalbir Singh £1,116,000Nigel Lithman QC £978,000John C Rees QC £947,000Oliver Blunt QC £913,000Andrew Trollope QC £889,000William Clegg QC £849,000James Sturman QC £765,000Howard Godfrey QC £733,000Abbas Lakha QC £706,000Stephen Riordan QC £699,000
