The Cumbrian mass killer Derrick Bird's funeral took place today, the final of 13 services held in a week. About 80 friends and relatives gathered at Distington crematorium, also the venue for the funerals of several of Bird's victims.In a statement, the family of his twin brother, David, Bird's first victim, said: "We send our love and support to our grandma, auntie, uncle and cousins on this difficult day. As you can imagine, this has been a very hard time for our family and at this present moment we do not feel physically and emotionally strong enough to attend the funeral. However, we would like to express our love and support to the rest of the family."Funeral organisers said Bird's mother, Mary, 87, was too distraught to attend. A parallel service was held in her room at Cockermouth hospital. Taxi driver Bird, 52, was responsible for a killing spree in which 12 people died in Cumbria two weeks ago. After his rampage, he turned his gun on himselfBird's relatives insisted his funeral be held last out of respect for his victims. The Rev Jim Marshall, who conducted the service, said it was hoped that the final funeral would give a sense of hope for the community and individuals struggling to come to terms with the events of 2 June.As well as his sons Graeme, 28, and Jamie, 16, and daughter-in-law, Victoria – who gave birth just weeks ago – his ex partner Linda Mills, 48, was in attendance.Earlier today, the funeral was held of Bird's youngest victim, estate agent Jamie Clark, who was 23. Clark was driving through Seascale after a viewing when Bird shot him. Mourners flocked to the private service at the Vale crematorium in Luton, Bedfordshire.Clark's fiancee, Leanne Jarman, 21, his parents Richard and Jane, 56 and 51, from Northall, near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, and his brother Andrew, 26, were among the mourners.
