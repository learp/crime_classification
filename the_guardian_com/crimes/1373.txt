Big Brother is not only watching you, but can now hold delinquents in the palm of his hand, and yesterday he proved the point on the streets of Sheffield.With a series of electronic bleeps, a sequence of still pictures from the city's central security camera control room was flicked to a group of waiting police officers, clutching tiny hand-held monitors. Moments later, a 15-second video clip appeared on one of the gadgets, showing a recording from one of Sheffield's 150 city-centre cameras. "It's going to be a fast and effective way of helping to reduce street crime," said junior education minister Ivan Lewis, who had come to launch the system on its first British outing. "Officers can now view incidents as they unfold and identify suspects immediately." The Synergymobile system, which is made in Sheffield, is the latest spin-off from the city's sophisticated CCTV surveillance, which is testing a range of devices and systems using a Â£2.8m Home Office grant.
