Tory plans to scale back crime fighting co-operation across Europe would hamper the police's ability to tackle some of Britain's most serious criminals and threaten "the safety of the British people", according to the Liberal Democrats.Cross-border crime in the UK has reached record levels in recent years with 80% of non-domestic murders in London now involving investigations outside Britain.The Conservatives have consistently voted against Eurojust – the EU body that co-ordinates criminal investigations across EU countries – and the party has confirmed that it will oppose the expansion of Eurojust's powers granted under the Lisbon treaty. This stance has won favour with Conservative Eurosceptics, who claim Eurojust transfers sovereignty to Brussels and is on course to become a pan-European crime fighting force equivalent to the FBI in the US.However, senior UK prosecutors say closer cross-border co-operation has become an integral part of the UK's ability to fight serious crime, from drug smuggling to terrorism.At a recent select committee hearing, Mike Kennedy, chief operating officer at the Crown Prosecution Service, described the level of cross-border crime affecting the UK as "phenomenal"."The Metropolitan police are saying that 80% of non-domestic violence homicide cases that they had investigated had some sort of element outside the jurisdiction … There has been a huge increase in the UK's use of Eurojust. I still think there are more cases out there that could be referred."Opponents accused the Conservative leader, David Cameron, of pandering to Eurosceptics within the party's ranks at the expense of the UK's ability to tackle serious cross-border crime."This should be the critical European issue in the election as crucial decisions on UK involvement in Eurojust are imminent," said Liberal Democrat MP Ed Davey."Cameron will have to explain why he wants to take the UK out of these successful initiatives. British police and prosecutors co-operating across Europe will be rightly concerned that the ­Conservative party risks putting its Eurosceptic ­ideology before the safety of the British people."Figures shown to the Guardian by the CPS say that last year the UK requested assistance from Eurojust in more cases than any other European country, with almost one-tenth of the organisation's cases involving the UK.But Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said the Tories would continue to vote against the expansion of Europol – the EU's criminal intelligence agency – and Eurojust. "What they have in mind in terms of Europol is a European equivalent of the FBI, where we end up with a mix of state and federal powers. With these bodies we are moving towards a transnational police force and criminal justice system and people here in Brussels are quite clear that that is the intention."Fellow Tory MEP Timothy Kirkhope said that although the EU had a role to play, that did not mean "the extension of EU powers over criminal law in the UK"."We will continue to oppose the extension of powers for Europol and Eurojust and we believe that only British authorities should be able to initiate criminal investigations in Britain."Eurojust currently oversees co-operation between prosecutors from 27 EU member countries. It has an annual budget of about £22m and 170 full-time staff.Its advocates say it has transformed the way the UK can track and prosecute serious criminals who move across borders, with paperwork that previously took weeks or months being completed within hours.The Lisbon treaty gives member states the power to extend Eurojust's powers and create a "European Public Prosecutor" – a position opposed by most UK political parties, including Labour."The Lisbon treaty will in theory incrementally lead to further integration in criminal justice measures across EU member states", said Valsamis Mitsilegas, a professor of European criminal law at Queen Mary, University of London."The fear among some countries is the extent to which this will impact sovereignty, and the degree to which an EU body can interfere with domestic investigations."But the Tories have strongly opposed any expansion of Eurojust's powers, despite new evidence that the UK authorities are increasingly relying on the body to investigate cross-border crime."Eurojust has a role to play in helping national authorities co-operate in the fight against crime," said a Conservative spokesman."But we believe that only British authorities should be able to instigate criminal investigations in the UK, and therefore oppose the extensive new powers the Lisbon treaty gives to Eurojust."Davey said it was crucial that Cameron sets out his party's stance ahead of the election."Every political party is under an obligation to spell out its position on co-operation on crime – whether it's Eurojust, Europol or the European arrest warrant," he said."This is a John Major moment for Cameron. He needs to face down the anti-European extremists in his party, as he failed to do in order to win the leadership, and make it clear that he will put the safety of the public first."
