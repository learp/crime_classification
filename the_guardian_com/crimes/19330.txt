The former children's services chief who lost her job over the Baby P tragedy has lodged an employment tribunal claim against Haringey council.Sharon Shoesmith was dismissed without compensation from her senior position at the north London authority last December after a critical report into her department's failings.A spokesman for Haringey council said: "We will be contesting this vigorously."Shoesmith lodged a claim against the council with the Watford employment tribunal on Friday, a Tribunals Service spokeswoman said.The children's secretary, Ed Balls, sent inspectors into the local authority after the trial of those responsible for 17-month-old Baby P's death.The inspectors identified "serious concerns" about Haringey's child protection services, which they described as "inadequate".Balls removed Shoesmith from her post on 1 December. She remained suspended on full pay until Haringey councillors decided to sack her a week later. Shoesmith lost an internal appeal against her dismissal in January.Employment law experts say Shoesmith could be in line for a payout of up to Â£173,000 if she can prove that the council was wrong to sack her.Baby P died in August 2007, having suffered more than 50 injuries at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend and their lodger despite being on the child protection register and receiving 60 contacts with the authorities over eight months.
