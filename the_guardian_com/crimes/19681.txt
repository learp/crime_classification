The brother of Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams should be given 15 years in prison for sexually abusing his eldest daughter, a Belfast court has been told.Liam Adams is also being held in custody for his own protection, Belfast crown court heard on Tuesday.The father of six, of Bernagh Drive, west Belfast, was convicted just over a month ago with majority verdicts of 11 to one by the jury of nine men and three women, of a total of 10 charges: three of raping his now 40-year-old daughter Aine, three of gross indecency, and four of indecently assaulting her when she was aged four and nine between March 1977 and March 1983.Crown lawyer Ciaran Murphy QC told judge Corinne Philpott that guidelines indicated 15 years was an appropriate starting point for a sentence before aggravating or mitigating factors were considered.During a pre-sentence hearing at Belfast crown court, Murphy insisted there were aggravating features to Adams' crimes that the judge should take into account, including the abuse of trust committed, the young age of his victim and the fact that he repeatedly offended.Arguing for a lesser sentence, defence lawyer Eilis McDermott QC highlighted her client's health problems.Adams, who walks with a stick, watched from the dock as his lawyer detailed his ongoing treatment for inflammation of the arteries (temporal arteritis) and osteoarthritis.Following the submissions the judge said she would deliver Adams's sentence "as expediously" as she can after considering all matters, including further clarifications from the probation service.
