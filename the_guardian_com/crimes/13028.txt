Detectives hunting the murderer of 18-year-old model Sally Anne Bowman believe the killer is a serial sex attacker who assaulted another young woman four years ago, less than a mile away.Miss Bowman's partially clothed body was found in the drive of her home in Croydon, south London, in the early hours of Sunday morning. She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death minutes after her ex-boyfriend dropped her off in his car. Officers initially arrested the ex-boyfriend and three other men, but all four have now been released without charge and ruled out of inquiries.However, detectives have now forensically linked the murder to an indecent assault on another woman, of similar age and appearance to Miss Bowman, in nearby Purley in 2001. This victim's description of her attacker was very similar to that of a man seen in the street outside Miss Bowman's house shortly after her murder.The killer inflicted several deep stab wounds, probably with a carving knife. The weapon has not been recovered, nor has Miss Bowman's white Prada half-moon-shaped handbag, her passport, and her Samsung D500 mobile phone.Detectives think she was attacked between 4.15am and 4.30am. Neighbours in Blenheim Crescent heard screams, and a short time later a man was seen walking down the street. Witnesses described him as white, in his 20s or 30s, 5ft 9in to 6ft, clean shaven with short dark hair.Police fear the man may have attacked other women in the intervening period, and that he could strike again. Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Cundy, who is leading the investigation, warned women in the area to be vigilant. Local police patrols have been stepped up.
