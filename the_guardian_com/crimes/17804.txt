Why are we surprised that the security services have been spying on lawyers (Report, 7 November), when the reputation of former senior government ministers is at stake? Likewise, when over 100 files containing information on alleged child abuse by members of the establishment are “missing” from the Home Office? The establishment – that shadowy beast – will always be ruthless in defence of its own. If there are people alive who are protected by the loss of those files, it’s more than likely that we, and the brave but so damaged abused, may only be permitted to know the truth long after the alleged perpetrators, and indeed some of the abused, have died. Is this one reason why these cases take so long to come to court?Anna FordLondon
