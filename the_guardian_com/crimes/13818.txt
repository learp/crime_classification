The government today unveiled its centrepiece legislation to combat gun, knife and alcohol-fuelled crime in Britain.The measures - trumpeted in Labour's election manifesto and receiving a cautious welcome from the opposition parties - will see a ban on the sale of replica guns, a rise in the age permitted to buy knives, and new 'alcohol disorder zones' to combat binge drinking-fuelled violence.Unveiling the measures, the home office minister, Hazel Blears, said the Violent Crime Reduction Bill was a response to public fears over "low level crime".If passed, the bill will raise the age of buying knives from 16 to 18, ban the sale of replica guns, make it an offence to use other people to carry knives or guns, and allow headteachers to search pupils for weapons.However, despite a relatively open mind on the bill from the opposition parties, the most controversial elements in the 54-page bill will be those on monitoring and closing down pubs and clubs within new alcohol disorder zones (ADZ). This concept was first floated in January, after the government's bill to liberalise licensing hours suffered an unexpected backlash.The bill allows for councils and the police to charge alcohol outlets within an ADZ to be charged for policing costs, for individuals to be served with a two-year drinking ban if found guilty of alcohol-fuelled violence, and for pubs serving under-18s to face an immediate 48-hour shut down.Today, Ms Blears told reporters that all shops selling alcohol, even if it was only a small section, would be liable to be charged if they were in an ADZ. She said the cost for such premises was still being worked on, but stressed it was not a "revenue raising" exercise. The powers to stop people selling alcohol for 48 hours if they had persistently been selling it to under-18s would cover off-licences and supermarkets, she confirmed. It had previously been suggested that the drinking banning orders would only be imposed on people who had already been cautioned three times, but this provision has not made it into the bill."We haven't specified on the face of the bill three strikes and you're out because there may well be some circumstances, very limited, where you would want to make a drinking banning order on the first occasion," Ms Blears said. "I think it's right that the courts should have some flexibility and discretion around that but we will be looking at guidance and making sure people don't use these orders in a disproportionate fashion." Initially the plan was for individuals at risk of carrying out alcohol-related disorder to be able to be banned from an area for 24 hours, but Ms Blears said that period had been extended to 48 hours so that someone could not be banned early on a Friday night and be back on the streets by Saturday evening. For the Conservatives, the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said he would "look at this bill carefully but it is important to remember that Labour has form for making headline grabbing announcements only to fail to follow them up with any detail or delivery".  "Given that a lot of violent crime is caused by binge drinking, it beggars belief that the government is going ahead with 24-hour opening." The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, welcomed the measures on alcohol and gun crime, but warned: "It is difficult to see how the proposed age limit for knives can work. The bill will land us in the ridiculous situation where a 16- and a 17-year-old can get married and set up home on their own, but can't buy a kitchen knife."The SNP promised to table specific amendments allowing the Scottish parliament to further restrict airguns - a particular issue north of the border.
