Sexist language and playground banter that portrays girls as inferior to boys can legitimise domestic violence in later life and should not be tolerated in schools, according to a teaching union.Guidance published by the National Union of Teachers (NUT) today argues that schools have a crucial role to play in challenging attitudes that can lead to violence towards women.The document argues that seeing women and girls as inferior to men and boys lies at the heart of most domestic violence.The general secretary of the NUT, Steve Sinnott, said: "Domestic violence is an invisible crime but it has devastating and long-term effects on the physical and mental health of those subjected to it. It may occur behind closed doors but everyone has a part to play in its eradication."In the pamphlet, which was launched to coincide with International Women's Day, teachers are advised to challenge gender stereotypes and focus on promoting mutual respect.Staff are advised to use drama and English to explore issues relating to domestic violence as well as the new citizenship lessons to ensure pupils learn about respect - especially within intimate relationships.The pamphlet also gives advice to teachers who fear that pupils may be living with domestic violence or other forms of abuse against women in the home.Mr Sinnott said: "Whilst there are no set symptoms displayed by children who witness domestic violence, the impact on their behaviour can be dramatic. Absenteeism, bullying, antisocial behaviour, drug and alcohol misuse and self harm can all result."The guidance covers advice about how to deal with all types of violence against women and is supported by the Home Office.Last night Baroness Scotland, minister for the Criminal Justice System and Law Reform, said: "One in four women will suffer domestic violence in their lifetime, and victims tend to suffer repeated attacks - on average 35 assaults - before they seek help. Teachers and schools have an important role in helping address domestic violence, raise the importance of the issue and support children and help them regain their confidence and keep them safe."The Home Office also launched its Domestic Violence and Bullying Toolkit yesterday which aims to highlight the progression from schoolyard intimidation to violence later in life."Domestic violence and bullying are closely linked, with both issues being about the exploitation of power differentials," said Baroness Scotland. She added: "Perpetrators of bullying often become domestic abusers in adult life. Tackling this behaviour can act as a powerful deterrent to its continued use."
