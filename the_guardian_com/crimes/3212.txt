The home secretary, Charles Clarke, yesterday confirmed his plans, revealed in the Guardian this week, to abolish 42 local probation boards and instead create "a vibrant mixed economy" in the management of 200,000 offenders in the community. He intends to take over the statutory duty of the local boards to provide probation services and enable a Whitehall network of 10 regional "offender managers" to put them out to tender to private companies and voluntary organisations or remain with the public sector."This is not about cost-cutting: it is about driving up standards and improving value for money. It is not about privatisation. It is about finding the best provider for the job," said Mr Clarke.But the Home Office consultation paper published yesterday makes clear that the local probation boards are to be abolished and replaced with new probation "trusts" which will be packed with senior financial and business people so they can "win contracts in the first place in a competitive environment" and then manage performance so the standards specified in the contracts are met.Public probation trusts which fail to win any business, or enough to sustain their overheads, will cease to exist, says the consultation paper. It envisages that the changes will come into effect in April 2007, the centenary of the 1907 Edwardian legislation which set up a public probation service in Britain.The decision has provoked widespread opposition. Martin Wargeant of the Probation Boards' Association warned that they would fight the proposal, saying they "shouldn't be competing over the carcass of the Probation Service" with private companies.Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation officers' union, said that fragmentation and privatisation would drive down standards, cut wages and lead to less cooperation and not more between criminal justice services: "Probation is not a business but a viable public service."Neil Gerrard, Labour MP and chair of the justice unions parliamentary group, said he believed the overwhelming majority of MPs were disturbed by the proposals, which went much further than the initial plan to open up the Probation Service.But Neil Bentley, director of public services for the CBI, welcomed the plans. "Plainly when half of all crime is committed by those who have already been through the system then radical change is essential," he said.
