Detectives investigating the murder of PC Keith Blakelock today began searching a back garden near the scene of the killing in north London.Officers began a "forensic evacuation" at the address on Willan Road, Tottenham, at 7am. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said police believe that "evidence was buried there shortly after the murder".The 40-year-old officer was hacked to death at the height of the riots on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham in October 1985.A re-investigation was announced in December 2003, after a three-year review process that Scotland Yard said had given it significant new leads in the case.The violence was sparked by the death of Cynthia Jarrett, 49, who suffered heart failure during a police raid on her home. PC Blakelock died at the scene while his colleague, PC Richard Coombes, was so severely wounded in the attack that he never resumed active duty.Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of the murder in 1987 but the court of appeal overturned their convictions four years later. Two senior officers were cleared of fabricating evidence but Mr Silcott was given Â£50,000 compensation from the Metropolitan police.Police stressed that the current occupiers moved into the address some years after the murder and attempted murder. They do not form any part of the investigation, and were not suspects.A spokesman said: "Officers are doing everything possible to minimise the disruption and distress this may cause the family who live there."
