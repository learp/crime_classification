A third body has been found in a country lane close to where two others were discovered by a passing motorist.Firefighters were called to a fire in Holme Lane, near Tong, Bradford, where they found the corpse at about 6.40am.A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said detectives would examine any links between the death and the ongoing investigation into the murders of two men whose badly beaten bodies were found in nearby New Lane on Tuesday night.It is not yet known whether the body discovered on Thursday is male or female.Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, who is leading the investigation into the latest discovery, said: "We are currently working to establish the full circumstances of this incident and inquiries are at a very early stage."I am liaising closely with Detective Superintendent Dick Nuttall who is investigating the recent incident on New Lane."Although the incidents are geographically close, there is nothing to suggest at this stage that they are linked."A spokeswoman for the West Yorkshire fire and rescue service said a member of the public called firefighters after spotting flames "in the open".She added: "It wasn't a building fire, it was a bonfire."Police said the bodies of two men in their mid-20s to 30s were discovered by a motorist in New Lane, near the junction with Raikes Lane on the outskirts of Bradford, at about 10.20pm on Tuesday. Neither victim has been identified.The area where the bodies were found is open countryside, a mile or two from the suburbs of south Bradford.It is thought that the first two deaths may be gang-related.
