Two men who stabbed and slashed a man 43 times in an "honour killing" in 1996 were convicted unanimously by a jury of his murder yesterday.The Old Bailey jury took four days to find Waseem Afsar and Nisar Khan guilty of murdering Ahmed Bashir, a 21-year-old Afghan who had been in a relationship with Afsar's younger sister Nighat. The pair ambushed Bashir outside his home in Hounslow, west London, and killed him with a sword and a machete. Afsar, who was serving a life sentence for a separate murder of which he was convicted in 1997, and Khan were also found guilty of the attempted murder of Bashir's friend Abdul Ebrahimkhail, whom they wounded in the attack after he tried to intervene. They will be sentenced on Friday. Nighat is now married with three children and lives in east London. Yesterday her father, Mohammed, told the Guardian: "The family is ruined. I don't speak to anyone any more ... Allah has taken everything away from me. I ask what I have done to deserve this?"
