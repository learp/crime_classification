A paedophile, who was dubbed "Al the Paedo" by colleagues who were unaware of his actions, was jailed for 10 years today for repeatedly abusing two girls and hoarding about 200,000 indecent images of children.Alan Potbury, 38, carried out the abuse on two six-year-old girls over a period of three years. He babysat one of the victims after befriending her parents.Former deliveryman Potbury took pictures and filmed his crimes on a mobile phone before downloading the footage on to his computer.He was caught when the mother of one of his victims saw her daughter kissing her brother and was told that Potbury had shown her how to do it.Police raided his home in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and uncovered almost 200,000 indecent images and films on mobile phones, DVDs and his computer.Potbury admitted a total of 35 counts at Bristol crown court, including 12 counts of sexual assault on children. He admitted taking photographs or filming the abuse and downloading thousands of indecent images and films from the internet.Jailing him, Judge Neil Ford QC told Potbury his catalogue of abuse had been a "flagrant and dreadful breach of trust".He said: "You were a trusted friend of the families of the victims. The offences you committed were very often late at night when you had been left to babysit the children."The court heard Potbury was known by work colleagues as "Al the Paedo" because of his crude and sexual comments about children and women.The court heard Potbury, who stared straight ahead throughout the two-hour hearing, had received a caution for indecently assaulting a girl under the age of 16 in 1993, while babysitting for her.James Ward, prosecuting, said Potbury befriended a young couple with a six-year-old girl in 2004 and suggested looking after her when they went out.Ward said: "The victim's mother says she thought nothing of it and that Alan would often stay over on the sofa."Potbury's babysitting duties became more frequent in 2010 when the girl's mother started an evening course and her husband left the marital home.Ward told the court: "The victim's mother says Alan would quite regularly read the child a bedtime story or help bath her other two children."Last July, the girl told her mother about Potbury's actions. Police investigated and found images and films of him abusing the youngster, as well as photographs and footage of him attacking another six-year-old girl in 2007.A statement read out by the prosecution on behalf of the father of one of the victims accused Potbury of preying on his family in order to get his hands on his daughter.He said: "I now firmly believe that Alan Potbury got close to my family to get close to my children. I thought it was my wife who he was interested in and not my children."Ward told the judge that the case was the chance to punish a producer of child pornography, not just someone who downloaded images.He said: "The importance of this case before this court is this is someone who has taken images then downloaded them on to his computer. We can't speculate on what may have happened thereafter but this is one of those rare occasions where someone who took photographs is before the court."Police investigated Potbury's volunteer work for the coastguard, but the court was told there was no evidence of offending connected to that activity.Derek Perry, defending Potbury, said his client vehemently denied he had targeted women or families with young children.
