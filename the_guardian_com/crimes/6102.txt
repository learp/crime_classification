Hundreds of cases of suspected child abuse in football and serious flaws in the way young players and fans are cared for will be exposed this week in a report on the treatment of children in soccer.The report, compiled by the government-backed Independent Football Commission after an 18-month investigation, discloses that 250 suspected child abuse cases are being probed by the Football Association and that two more allegations are being investigated at Premiership clubs. It also reveals that a further four cases of suspected child abuse have been investigated at Premiership clubs since 2003.In a separate admission, the FA says it has banned between 60 and 70 people from any association with organised football because they are a danger to children and that it is dealing with up to 10 cases a week in which criminal record checks indicate that individuals in the game could be potential abusers.The revelations are certain to revive concerns about the extent of physical abuse and bullying in sport, which have been highlighted in recent years by high-profile prosecutions in swimming, tennis and athletics, and to prompt calls for tougher action to safeguard children. Up to four million children participate in football in Britain, whether as ball boys, assistants or playing the game.The commission, set up in 2001 by the FA, the Premiership and the Football League with support from ministers, gives no details of the child abuse investigations that it cites in its 60-page report, but they are thought to include inappropriate behaviour and bullying.The report, compiled with the help of the NSPCC, makes 23 recommendations to strengthen child protection. It also lists a series of ways in which children involved in the game are placed at risk.These include the failure of some clubs to supervise star players adequately when they meet youngsters, including when female fans ask for body autographs, and inadequate vetting of adults who come into contact with children at games.Further concern is expressed about the publication of the names, addresses and schools of child mascots and ball boys in match programmes and other promotional material, which, the report says, could lead to them being targeted by abusers.'Children playing football must have an enjoyable and safe environment and be protected from abuse. Parents have a right to expect that football will do all it can to fulfil this objective,' Professor Derek Fraser, the commission's chairman, writes in the report. He emphasises that 'real progress' has been made, but adds: 'The challenge for football remains daunting. Safeguarding children in football is not a task to be under-estimated.'Tony Pickerin, the FA's head of child protection, said that, although the definition of child abuse in football included bullying, there were also far more serious cases involving criminality and a large number of people who posed a threat had been found within the game.He described the commission's findings as fair. He added that, although the figure of 250 cases under investigation was a 'snapshot', the total was a reasonable representation of the number being dealt with at any one time.'The FA's role is to investigate more serious referrals. In the past four or five years, we have put 60 or 70 people out of the game. There are probably about six to 10 cases a week where criminal record checks show that a person has committed an offence that could represent a threat to children. Our duty is that the children's safety be paramount.'Pickerin said that the FA had prepared new guidance on the use of children's photographs and was considering other measures, including a licensing system for football coaches and the introduction of ID cards for those who worked with children.Kate Coleman, the Premiership's head of child protection, said she was unable to give the names of the clubs or individuals involved in the two ongoing investigations, but suggested that the incidents did not involve criminal behaviour.'It can't be defined as child abuse unless somebody has been convicted. I would prefer to use the term "bad practice". In all the cases that have been resolved, there was no conviction,' she said.Coleman said that she was unwilling to comment further without legal advice: 'A tremendous amount of work has been done to get child protection off the ground and ensuring that children are safe is a top priority.'Shy Keenan, a spokeswoman for Phoenix Survivors, an organisation that represents the victims of child abuse, said that significant risks remained.'The FA tries very hard, but the problem is that much of it is lip service rather than action,' she said. 'There are huge loopholes and we would like to see it made illegal for people to be involved with children in sport unless they have had a criminal record check. Anyone can set themselves up as a coach, so the opportunity to abuse is endemic within the game.'Steve Boocock, director of the NSPCC's child protection in sport unit, conceded that youngsters remained vulnerable within football, but said that the safety of children had improved: 'Football still has a way to go, but, if we were to look back five years, it has come a long way.'
