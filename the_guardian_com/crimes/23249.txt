While Polly Toynbee (Labour does one thing really well - burying good news, Comment, July 19) may be quite right to castigate the government for presentational weaknesses, an examination of press coverage of recent crime figures reveals just how difficult it is for good news stories to get out. The fact that crime had fallen 10% over the past year and that the chances of a person in England and Wales being the victim of crime is at the lowest level for 27 years was deemed not to be worthy of a headline in any national newspaper. These positive facts were reported in the Guardian subsumed on page one under the heading "Knife attacks top 22,000 in the last year", suggesting to the casual reader a predominately negative situation. Other newspapers assured their readers that the government really could not take credit for the drop, or ignored the good news in favour of suggesting an epidemic of knife crime. While the government should certainly sharpen its presentational skills, it is hard to see this having a decisive impact in an environment where many influential parties appear intent on burying good news.Dr Charles WattersCanterbury, Kent Polly Toynbee is probably right, but this is surely not helped by the way the press report any good news. There was a 10% fall in crime levels over the past year, and an amazing 48% decline in crime since the peak in 1995. How did your paper headline this really good news? Under the headline "Crime rates expected to soar as economic difficulties deepen" (July 18). Mike CantorLondon
