Three men were arrested today on suspicion of murder in connection with the brutal killings of two Chinese graduates, Northumbria police said.The three murder suspects, aged 33, 30 and 22, are Chinese nationals and were arrested in a series of raids in Northumbria and Durham.The mutilated bodies of Xi Zhou and her boyfriend Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, were found in their ground floor flat in Newcastle, in August.Zhen had been tortured for at least an hour before being hacked to death. The attackers then turned on Xi, who was last seen alive on CCTV returning home from work at about 4pm on August 7. The couple's cat was also drowned by their killers.During the inquiry it emerged Yang might have made enemies after getting embroiled in an internet betting scam.It is also thought that a Triad-style criminal syndicate that preys on Chinese students in Britain, could be linked to the murder.A further 14 Chinese nationals were arrested during the raids, including nine men on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary and three women on suspicion of immigration offences. One woman and one man are also being held on suspicion of assisting an offender.Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, leading the investigation, said: "Searches at the address are currently being carried out and those arrested are being questioned throughout today." He added the investigation was at an early stage but described the arrests as "a positive development". Both families have been informed of these developments.
