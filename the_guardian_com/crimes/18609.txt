Home secretary Jack Straw, delivering his first annual progress report on the action plan drawn up after the Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence affair, warned the police today to stop grumbling and to keep working to eradicate institutional racism.He acknowledged that the report on the police handling of the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence had made uncomfortable reading. "But there is no reason for the report to have been a trauma for the police service. It was a shock."Some officers have suggested that rising levels of street crime could be due to police not carrying out stop-and-searches for fear of being accused of racism. The Metropolitan force was described as "institutionally racist" by the report. Mr Straw said he believed the report had opened people's eyes to the unequal treatment some people in Britain received simply because of the colour of their skin.It also emerged today that a third of ethnic minority staff in the home office, Mr Straw's own department, say they have suffered racial discrimination at work, although the majority believe the department is committed to equal opportunities.Mr Straw said he believed there had been a "significant reduction" in levels of racism experienced by people at the hands of public bodies.The action plan progress report claimed more than half the recommendations made by Sir William had been implemented. Work was under way on the remainder.Action taken included the introduction of the new race relations act, better recording and investigation of racist incidents and racism education programmes in schools.The report said new policies to ensure stop and search powers were used more fairly and effectively were being drawn up, police were getting better training in race awareness and the recruitment of ethnic minority police officers was being stepped up.Two of the most controversial proposals put forward by Sir William remained under consideration. A conclusion on whether to scrap the double jeopardy rule which blocks the prosecution of someone twice for the same crime is not expected before early next year. Additionally, a working party is still looking at whether to change the law to allow people to be prosecuted for using racist language in private.Mr Straw stated his commitment to independent investigation of complaints against police officers, rather than the current practice of inquiries being carried out by fellow officers.He said: "I am under no illusions that we have a long way to go. Full delivery of the action plan can only be a start on the road to delivering a truly multicultural Britain, not just free from the scourge of racism, but where diversity becomes a cornerstone of our modern society."Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation, commented: "The service has come a long way since Macpherson but knows there is further to go, with more mountains to climb."The crown prosecution service also published details today of the progress it has made in meeting the report's recommendations.Almost a year after the release of the report on the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, concluded that the service had achieved a "great deal". However, he admitted that it "still had much to do", particularly in improving communications with victims of racist crime.Under new plans, crown prosecution staff will offer to meet victims of racially-motivated crimes to explain its decision not to prosecute or to substantially alter charges. They will also receive extra training in handling such cases sensitively.The service adopted the Macpherson report's new definition of a racist incident and renamed its monitoring unit accordingly.Additionally, special care will be taken to ensure that any evidence of racist motivation for a crime is referred to during the trial and any pre-trial hearings to establish correct evidence. Defendants will not be allowed to plea-bargain (submit a guilty plea in the hope of more lenient sentencing, which saves the court time) in order to conceal any racist elements of their crime.
