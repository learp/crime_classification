You may have destroyed lives. It may have led people to commit crime. It may have led to despair and desperation. None of that concerned you. You were only concerned with yourself and leading a lavish lifestyle," the judge said.Baron was a leading figure in an international ring who owned yachts and sports cars as well as luxury villas in Spain, all funded by drug money.He admitted three counts including conspiracy to import cocaine, conspiracy to import cannabis, and money laundering.
