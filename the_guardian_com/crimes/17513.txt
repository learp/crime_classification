A man who urinated beside a war memorial only weeks after a student prompted a national furore by doing the same thing was ordered to work 160 hours of unpaid community service.Ian Marshall, who was drunkenly celebrating a long-service award with an air-conditioning firm in Leeds, admitted splashing the steps of the memorial but denied acting deliberately or affecting any Remembrance Day poppies or wreaths.Leeds magistrates court had been due to hold a hearing into conflicting evidence about intent but a witness, whose account differed from Marshall's, was no longer available to appear.The court heard that the 49-year-old's family life and friendships had been affected by publicity for what district judge Christopher Darnton described as "a moment of madness". The judge accepted that Marshall was of previously good character and acknowledged his shame as the father of a 14-year-old boy who is an army cadet.He told Marshall, who lives in the Leeds suburb of Yeadon: "If ever there was a case of someone being shamed, then it must be this one. I have no doubt that if you could put the clock back, you would do so."He described the offence as serious and added: "You should have known better. This was a moment of madness."Marshall's solicitor, James Bourne-Arton, said that his client, who lives with his partner, their son and a 13-year-old daughter, had not intended any "disrespect to those who fought or are fighting for this country".Marshall admitted outraging public decency by urinating in public, but denied urinating on the actual memorial or insulting a church verger who claimed he witnessed the event. Police were called after staff at a nearby bar saw what was going on.Philip Laing, a 19-year-old student who was caught on camera urinating on Sheffield's main war memorial in October, was given 250 hours community service. District judge Anthony Brown condemned the "student drink culture" which saw Laing consume vast quantities of alcohol, before and during a spree organised by campus party specialists, Carnage.
