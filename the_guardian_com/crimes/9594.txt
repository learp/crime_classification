Children as young as 14 are helping to sell drugs in local communities, a charity report said today.The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said the recruitment of young people to sell drugs was increasing, and added that they were being extensively used as drug runners for local dealers in one part of Britain.The report also said drug dealers were not outsiders preying on underprivileged housing estates, but that dealing in many communities was run as a "family business", involving a close network of relatives and friends.It claimed police action alone would not be enough to solve the problem of drug abuse in Britain.The foundation said teenagers involved in the business usually worked as runners or lookouts, and were often recruited through older male relatives. "Professionals in another [unidentified] area reported youths as young as 14 working in shifts to sell drugs," its report said.Children working as runners could earn an average of £450 a week, while dealers - who did not use drugs themselves - could earn up to £7,500 a week.The charity said drug dealing could thrive in close-knit communities, and it was a misconception that it only did so on struggling estates."It is ... clear that deprived but cohesive, closely-knit neighbourhoods can also provide fertile soil for the development of drug dealing," Professor Mike Hough, the co-author of the report, said. "We found that drug dealing was sometimes run by cohesive groups with local family ties and extensive local networks of friends."The study found heroin and crack cocaine could be bought on any day of the week at any time of day or night, usually through public exchanges following deals arranged in advance by mobile phone. Researchers from King's College London interviewed 68 dealers, 800 residents, and 120 police and other professionals for the report in what the foundation said was the largest-ever study into the relationship between dealers and their clients.The report concluded that communities had to become more involved in the problem of drug dealing to tackle it effectively."While arresting and punishing dealers is an essential part of any strategic response, support from the community and other agencies is essential," Tiggey May, another co-author, said.
