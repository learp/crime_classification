A man who smashed the skulls of three sisters with a claw hammer as they slept in a London hotel room has had his minimum term increased from 18 years to 27.Philip Spence, 33, attacked Ohoud al-Najjar and her sisters Khulood and Fatima, who were visiting from their home in the United Arab Emirates, during a burglary at the Cumberland hotel in Marble Arch in April 2014.All the women sustained life-threatening injuries and Ohoud will never again have proper brain function or be able to walk or communicate.The assault was witnessed by Khulood’s three children, one of whom was found cowering under the bedcovers as his aunt Ohoud lay next to him with massive head injuries.In November, Spence, of north-west London, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, with a minimum of 18 years to be served before he is eligible to apply for parole.The case was referred to the court of appeal by the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, on the basis that the sentence was unduly lenient.The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Globe and Mr Justice Knowles, said it was a “shocking” case but not one where a whole-life order was appropriate.“In our judgment, the minimum term should be one of 27 years,” he said. “We wish however to emphasise that that is only a minimum term. It will be for the parole board in due course to consider whether this defendant, who is obviously highly dangerous, will, if ever, be released.“It seems highly improbable that he will, after the expiry of 27 years, or indeed ever, be safe for release.”
