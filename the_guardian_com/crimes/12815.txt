The bloodied uniform of the murdered police officer Keith Blakelock has been removed from a secretive museum within Scotland Yard for forensic examination, it was revealed yesterday.Police hope that DNA tests on the clothing may provide crucial evidence to bring to justice the killer of the police constable, 19 years after he was hacked to death on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London.PC Blakelock, 40, was murdered by a machete wielding gang during the riot on in October 1985.He was attacked with his colleague PC Richard Coombes, when they went to the estate to protect firefighters as violence erupted following the death of Cynthia Jarrett. Ms Jarrett, 49, had collapsed from a heart attack in her home after four policeman burst in during a raid.PC Coombes was seriously injured and never returned to duty.Since the killing, PC Blakelock's uniform has been kept in the Crime Museum at Scotland Yard. The museum has never been open to the public and was dubbed the Black Museum in 1877 after an Observer journalist was refused entry.It contains weapons and artefacts taken from notorious crimes and is used to train police and forensic officers."We can confirm that PC Blakelock's uniform has been removed from the New Scotland Yard Crime Museum," a Metropolitan police spokeswoman said yesterday."The uniform will be subjected to forensic testing as part of a new inquiry."The removal of the uniform is the latest move in a fresh investigation into the murder of the officer, which began in December 2003. More than 6,000 statements have been examined and the latest DNA techniques used to scrutinise evidence.Last week, 40 specialist search officers excavated the tiny back garden of a home in Tottenham, where they believed that evidence was buried shortly after the murder.A rusty metal object, which it is thought was the blade of a machete used to kill PC Blakelock, was discovered after forensic archaeologists combed through more than six tonnes of soil taken from the property.Weapons were discovered at the time of the murder but PC Blakelock's helmet has never been found.Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of the murder in 1987 but cleared on appeal in 1991 because of "unsafe" police evidence.Mr Silcott, who is now 43, was released from jail last year after serving a sentence for another murder.Two senior officers were cleared of fabricating evidence, but Mr Silcott was given Â£50,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan police.The murder of PC Blakelock was considered one of the most brutal and controversial in the last 20 years. Another 50 police officers were casualties of the violence on the estate.The new investigation is thought to have identified six new suspects by piecing together a "virtual video" of thousands of police and press photographs.The Crime Museum at Scotland Yard contains an extensive collection of weapons, which have been used in murders and serious assaults in London, many of them notorious crimes committed before 1900.
