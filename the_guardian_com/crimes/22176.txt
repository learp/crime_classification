It may have come as a shock to some that Peter Bowers should express a kind of view we don't expect a judge to hold (Inquiry into judge's 'brave burglars' comment in court, 7 September). It is, is it not, a responsibility of those with both influence and a conscience to occasionally use it and poke the political establishment. My son is currently serving a prison sentence for burglary. When he broke into houses he didn't feel brave, he felt frightened. His fear was overridden by a physical and psychological craving for heroin. Few people other than addicts and recovering addicts fully comprehend the power of class A drugs. The ongoing tragedy is that those who burgle and those who are burgled are both victims of a society that refuses to address realities. The real villains are the crowd-pleasing politicians who never show courage and avoid tackling the issues because the outcomes may offend the Daily Mail.Name and address suppliedâ€¢ From 15 November, support for victims of crime will be the responsibility of police and crime commissioners in England and Wales. New research shows that although the majority (91%) of people think it is important for PCCs to listen to victims, only one in five people believe they will be treated as a priority. That is why we are calling on PCC candidates to prove they are committed to victims, by signing up to Victim Support's five promises to victims. As not-for-profit organisations working in and around the criminal justice sector, or with people affected by crime, we are together also urging the public to use their vote to support candidates who pledge to make the greatest difference for victims of crime. Being a victim of crime can be devastating and leave long lasting scars. Don't let them fend for themselves.
