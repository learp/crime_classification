Three youths have admitted going on a “rampage” during which a US army veteran was racially abused on a packed tram.Aaron Cauchi, 19, Robert Molloy, 20, and another youth aged 16, also used foul language and spat in the face of a cyclist, Manchester magistrates court heard.All three had been up all night and were drinking and “looking for trouble” when they abused three people, all on their way to work in Manchester city centre, on the morning of 28 June last year.Joseph O’Connor, prosecuting, said the racist attack came five days after the EU referendum, which resulted in a 41% increase in hate crime, according to Home Office statistics.The trouble first began around 7.45am when a passenger heard “disgusting, vile abuse” on the tram packed with mothers with babies in buggies, schoolchildren and commuters, the court heard.Juan Jasso, a father of one and former US serviceman who has lived in England for 18 years, stepped forward and tackled the group, telling them to mind their language.Instead all three turned on him. Molloy, the instigator, told Jasso: “Don’t chat shit when you’re not even from England, you little fucking immigrant. Get off the fucking tram now. Get back to Africa.”Molloy then flicked beer over Jasso from the bottle he was holding before all three got off the tram. Minutes later they surrounded Alistair Lambert, who was with a female work colleague, “with their chests stuck out and shoulders back” and striking him with a cigarette lighter to intimidate him, said O’Connor.Shortly after, Andrew Guest was cycling to work when he passed the three. One or more spat in his face and down his body.Guest stopped but one of them shouted: “We have got one!” and they began to chase him so he got back on his bike and cycled away. When video of the tram attack went viral, all three were identified and arrested.All three pleaded guilty to the offences on Monday.The 16-year-old, who cannot be named because of his age and was accompanied to court by his grandmother, pleaded guilty to using threatening words or behaviour towards Jasso and Lambert and common assault to Guest.Cauchi, of Little Hulton, Salford, pleaded guilty to the same public order offences against Jasso and Lambert, and assault on Guest.Molloy, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated assault on Jasso, common assault on Guest and using threatening words and behaviour to Lambert. All three will be sentenced on Monday afternoon after the preparation of probation reports.
