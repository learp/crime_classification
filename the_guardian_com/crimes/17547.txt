A prison dentist pulled out inmates' healthy teeth to make money from the NHS, Wolverhampton crown court heard yesterday.Vernon Flackett, 66, was removing teeth not because he believed it was in the interests of the prisoners but because he was making money from it, Roderick Henderson, prosecuting, alleged. He then further cheated the taxpayers by making fraudu lent claims for the treatment. Mr Henderson told the court that Mr Flackett provided dental treatment for prisoners at Stafford jail. He argued that Mr Flackett was guilty of a gross breach of trust, because the prisoners looked to him for proper treatment of their dental problems. Every one of his victims had at least one tooth removed; one prisoner lost 11 teeth, another had every tooth in his mouth extracted. "This is not a case of an incompetent dentist but a dishonest one," Mr Henderson told the jury. He said Mr Flackett pulled the teeth out and then claimed that they were surgical extractions. On this basis they earned a higher rate of payment under the NHS scale of charges. Mr Flackett, who qualified as a dentist in 1964, could have made more money by carrying out fillings. But it was "quicker and simpler" for him to to pull a tooth instead. These were ordinary extractions presented dishonestly for greater profit, said Mr Henderson. "One of the aggravating features of this case is that these victims were vulnerable people. They were in a position where their voices might not be heard if they complained. It was only after a routine check by the Dental Practitioners' Board that the offences came to light." Mr Flackett, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, has denied seven charges of assault and seven of obtaining money by deception. The trial continues.
