A homemade nail bomb exploded outside a primary school yesterday, minutes before the end of the school day.The large firework, which had been packed with nails, went off inside the car of a teacher, shattering the windows of the silver saloon and sending fragments of nails and glass flying from the vehicle .No one was injured in the blast outside the Catholic fee-paying Runnymede St Edward's school in Sandfield Park, Liverpool, at about 2.50pm. Police are seeking two men seen near the school at the time of the explosion.Superintendent Ian Pilling from Merseyside police described the crime as "despicable" and said it was only "good luck" that nobody was hurt."Certainly from what I have seen anybody in the vicinity of the vehicle could have been injured or killed," he said.Around 300 pupils were still in their classrooms awaiting the end of the school day at 3pm. They were kept inside as police checked the car before being evacuated later. Last night, forensic teams were examining the scene of the blast and gathering information from CCTV cameras at the school and in the area. Police were also making house-to-house inquiries.Officers said they did not know whether the teacher who owned the car had been targeted.Mr Pilling said: " There is no indication whatsoever as to why anyone would target this person. This is an extremely unusual offence and we are investigating fully to bring the offenders to justice as quickly as possible."Parents and local residents were urged to come forward if they had seen anything suspicious in the hours leading up to the blast.
