Two men described as Manchester's most dangerous gangsters have been arrested after a police crackdown on the Gooch Close gang. Lee Amos, 31, known as Cabbo, and Colin Joyce, 28, known as Piggy, have been returned to prison to finish nine-year sentences for gun possession.They have been blamed for a recent upsurge in gang-related violence in the city following their release from jail on licence. It is believed they had been settling scores with members of the Longsight Crew, which resulted in a series of tit-for-tat shootings.Amos was arrested at his girlfriend's home in Nottingham on Sunday in a swoop which involved armed officers and hostage negotiators. Joyce was arrested last week in a taxi on the A666 in Walkden, Greater Manchester, by police who used teargas to subdue him. Three houses in Salford were raided as part of the police investigation, involving 100 officers.Chief Superintendent Dave Keller of Manchester metropolitan division, said the arrests were incredibly significant. "After they came out of prison, tensions increased and there were a lot more firearms-related incidents," he said. "They think they are above the law, but we have shown they are not."He said the Jessie James inquest shows the lengths police will go to protect witnesses. At the inquest, two key witnesses had their voices distorted and gender disguised to protect their identity. James, 15, was killed in Moss Side last September when he refused to join a gang.Three other people were arrested in connection with gun incidents in the police operation and firearms were recovered.
