A judge has given parents whose children attended the nursery where paedophile Vanessa George worked the choice of knowing if she has named their children among her victims.Mr Justice John Royce confirmed that George, 39, had provided the names of some of the children she said she had abused at Little Ted's nursery in Plymouth, Devon."I take the view that if parents want to find out whether their child has been abused and if that information has been given then they should be in a position to do so," the judge told Bristol crown court."If they do not want to know, and I fully understand why some parents should not want to know, then the information should not be thrust upon them, it should be a parental choice."George and her co-defendants, Colin Blanchard, 38, and Angela Allen, 39, pleaded guilty to a string of offences of sexually abusing children, photographing the abuse and exchanging the images with each other via the internet.George's barrister, Nicolas Gerasimidis, successfully applied for the trio's sentencing to be delayed to give more time to prepare. He said George intended to claim that Blanchard "used" her to access indecent images. "It will be Vanessa George's case that she was used by Colin Blanchard, who is a principle mover in the contacting of women of a certain age so that the type of material this court is concerned with is disseminated back to him."Some parents have made it clear they do not want to know if George has named their children.Sentencing has been adjourned to the week beginning 14 December.
