The actor who plays Scott Windsor in the ITV1 soap Emmerdale, has been charged with rape while on holiday in Barbados, the Foreign office said last night.Ben Freeman, 26, was arrested and charged with the rape of a British woman by Barbadian police last week.A Foreign Office spokeswoman could not confirm reports that the alleged victim was 16, but said: "A female British national has reported an alleged rape. That was reported to the Barbadian police on Wednesday 29 November."The accused is also a British national and we can confirm his details. The next of kin are aware, and both individuals are receiving consular assistance.Mr Freeman had been due to attend a court hearing in Barbados scheduled for Friday, but that hearing was postponed and there were no further details of a new date, the Foreign Office said.Reports in yesterday's News of The World said Mr Freeman had been freed on bail but that his passport had been confiscated and he had been told not to leave the island.Katie Threlfall, Mr Freeman's agent, had not been able to contact her client, but she said she was aware of the story. "We cannot confirm the details of the story at the moment," said an Emmerdale spokeswoman.At the time of the alleged attack Mr Freeman is thought to have been on holiday at one of the island's luxury resorts, the Almond beach village in St Peter.The resort describes itself as "perfect for singles, couples and honeymooners", and promises a "holiday of laid-back luxury ... set amidst breathtaking tropical gardens, with three swimming pools and two restaurants".Mr Freeman's alleged victim has been allowed to return to Britain, while Mr Freeman may have to stay on the Caribbean island until the case is resolved, according to some reports.
