A shoe fetishist who raped four women and attempted to attack two others, keeping their stilettos as trophies, was jailed for life yesterday more than 20 years after the assaults.James Lloyd, 50, who was known as the Dearne Valley shoe rapist, was told by a judge at Sheffield crown court that he must serve at least 15 years in prison before he is eligible for parole. He was finally tracked down following a cold-case review of the attacks four years ago after detectives found a near match of a DNA sample from his sister with evidence gathered at the time of the assaults, in the early 1980s.Lloyd had terrorised each of his victims in Barnsley and Rotherham, South Yorkshire, as they walked home after a night out, dragging them off the street and tying them up with stockings and pairs of tights before raping them.Afterwards, he would steal their shoes, jewellery and perfume. Detectives found more than 100 pairs of stilettos hidden behind a locked trapdoor at his workplace, Dearne Valley Printers.Lloyd, a father-of-two, was sentenced after admitting the six attacks on the women, aged between 18 and 54.Judge Alan Goldsack said: "Few sexual cases are more serious than these."The court heard that the last offence was in 1986. When detectives searched Lloyd's possessions they found a series of videos of him and his wife Pat having sex. She was often tied up and appeared to be comatose. Lloyd was seen to stop what he was doing and replace his wife's stilettos if one of them fell off.But in a statement read to the court, she said she consented to all the acts in the videos and denied her husband had drugged her.Judge Goldsack told him: "It may be your sexual fantasies have simply been contained within the relationship. Were it to end, you may well have been tempted to carry them out with other women, giving them no choice whether to consent or not."Lloyd's arrest and conviction is now hailed as the biggest success using familial profiling. As part of the investigation DNA samples gathered in the early 1980s were compared with samples on the police database - more than 40 close matches were produced. The third house officers visited was that of Lloyd's sister, whose sample had been taken and stored after her arrest for drink driving.Lloyd appeared to be a respectable figure in his community after working his way up to a senior management position at a printing firm in Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire.Appearing before the court in July, he admitted raping four women between December 1983 and August 1986, and two further attempted rapes in February 1983 and October 1984.He denied a further charge of attempting to rape another woman and stealing a pair of black and gold stilettos from an eighth woman, which were ordered to lie on file.Following his arrest he attempted to take his own life.
