Earlier this week police in Lancashire were searching for a man who knocked an old lady over while riding his bike on the pavement in Oldham – she later died in hospital. Now they're appealing for information after a 20-year-old cyclist was assaulted by another rider in Preston.Both men were cycling the Guild Way, a 21 mile "Greenway" that encircles the city, when they collided on Tuesday 3 June at around 6pm.The 20-year-old, from Hoghton in Chorley, was put into a head lock by the other cyclist, who was riding a dark grey, carbon fibre road bike and wearing Team Sky kit, Lancashire police said on Thursday.There is no suggestion the assailant was a colleague of Bradley Wiggins or Chris Froome on the professional racing team which will try to win the Tour de France for a third consecutive year next month.Lancashire police said: "The man swore at the victim before putting him in a head lock and punching twice in the head, causing him to fall to the ground as he was clipped into his bike."After managing to struggle to his feet, the 20-year-old tried to ride away, but as he passed the other man, he was pushed to the ground and suffered a fractured collar bone."They added in a statement: "The offender is described as white, around 20 years old, six feet tall, of stocky build and clean shaven with blond hair; he spoke with a local accent."He was wearing a dark grey cycle helmet, a 'SKY TEAM' black and blue short sleeved cycling t-shirt and black shorts."PC Nicola Jackson said: “This was a nasty assault which has caused the victim serious injury. If anybody has any information about this incident or thinks they recognise the description of the man involved then please contact us.”Anybody with any information can contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or online at Crimestoppers-uk.org.
