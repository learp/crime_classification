The government is to make it a crime to incite hatred against gay, lesbian, transgender and disabled people, it announced today in a surprise addition to the Queen's speech.The monarch herself made no mention of the specific measure in outlining Gordon Brown's legislative programme to parliament, saying only that the new Criminal Justice and immigration Bill aimed at "protecting the public and reducing re-offending".It had previously been announced that it would become an offence to incite hatred against gay and lesbians, but minsters today extended the laws to cover transgender and disabled people.However, a justice ministry briefing paper on the bill outlined the new offence, as well as a other planned measures.Among these are so-called Violent Offender Orders, which will allow courts to impose restrictions on those convicted of violent offences - where they can live or travel, for example - even after their release from prison.Other measures include banning the possession of what the briefing paper called "extreme pornographic images", currently beyond the scope of the Obscene Publications Act.The government will also press ahead with changes to the law to protect people who use reasonable force to protect themselves, their family and their property from prosecution.This so-called "have a go hero" measure was announced in September by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, who revealed he had personally intervened on four occasions to try and stop criminals.
