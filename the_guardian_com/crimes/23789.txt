Jeffrey Archer will launch his return to public life this week by delivering an impassioned plea for prison reform.The irrepressible peer, who was released from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk this summer after serving two years for perjury, is understood to be keen to highlight the scourge of drugs and the futility of many work programmes in jails. His wife Mary said after his release that the family had decided prison does not work, adding: 'It's unjust. It's hugely expensive. People like me don't have a clue what really happens. It is a waste of time for most prisoners.' Former prisoner FF8282's conversion to the liberal cause will not please the Home Office, to which he has been a persistent annoyance ever since being convicted. But the Howard League for Penal Reform, which is giving him a platform at its annual conference in Oxford, argues he might help popularise a worthy but low-profile cause. 'Obviously his recent experiences are going to make him feel very strongly about it,' said Frances Crook, director of the Howard League. 'People are shocked by their experiences in prison: it is so incredibly pointless, and so incredibly awful and such a terrible failure.' Archer's return to the public circuit is likely to fuel demand both for those jail diaries - already a bestseller, although the Archers say they gave the profits from the Mail serialisation to charity - and his latest book. Crook says he is not an overnight convert. 'He has reached an audience, by serialising his diaries in the Daily Mail, in a way that our small charity never could.' Archer's interest is timely: the Home Office released figures last week showing the jail population rose another 3 per cent in the year to April. Archer might also highlight the plight of inmates' families on Thursday. Lady Archer has said that 'the partner of someone in prison suffers every bit as much as the prisoner him or herself.'
