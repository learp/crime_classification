Recreational cocaine users are being targeted in a crackdown designed to tackle the illegal drugs trade.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said its new campaign will focus on cocaine users with a social conscience, in an effort to demonstrate how their casual substance use is having devastating consequences for children, communities and the environment in countries producing the drug.The campaign, which will attempt to tap into social media with the hashtag #EveryLineCounts, will run alongside the NCA’s continued targeting of organised criminal networks responsible for trafficking cocaine. More than 70 tonnes of cocaine were seized as a result of NCA activity globally in 2014-15.Tony Saggers, head of drugs threat at the NCA, this country’s equivalent of the FBI, said: “Recreational users, who perhaps care about the exploitation of workers in sweatshops, or environmental abuses, often have no idea of the damage funded by their occasional line.

When they use cocaine, aside from putting their own lives at risk, they are feeding an industry which routinely uses death, violence and destruction in its production process.“Buying cocaine funds the exploitation of impoverished people, destroys and pollutes large areas of rainforest, forces people from their homes so coca can be grown on their land, and results in the murder of police officers and others who stand in the way of powerful crime groups. Those harms are usually out of sight of the end user, and we don’t think they should be.“The NCA and its partners will continue to disrupt the crime groups involved in the distribution of cocaine at every single point in the supply chain. But cocaine supply is about making money, and the end user drives production.“We are asking people to weigh up the facts and ask themselves whether they can square their use of this drug with the damage it does to others.”In March, a report by the advisory council on the misuse of drugs revealed the number of users of cocaine in the UK has more than trebled in two decades.It said the class A drug was no longer just the party drug of the wealthy and was available throughout all areas of society.The NCA campaign, launched today, is being supported by partners in Colombia, with some of their most senior law enforcement officers sharing their experiences.
