A 21-year-old man was fatally stabbed in the neck at a busy wine bar in west London in the early hours of Sunday morning.Josh Hanson, from Kingsbury in north London, died after being attacked in the RE Bar in Eastcote at about 1am. A murder investigation has begun and there have been no arrests. Police said they were trying to trace people who were inside or near the venue at the time of the stabbing or earlier in the evening.DCI Noel McHugh, who is leading the investigation, said: “I am appealing to anyone who was in the RE bar between midnight and the time of the incident, just after 1am, to contact us. It is believed there would have been around 40 people present at the time of the incident, many of whom left the venue as paramedics worked to save Josh’s life. It is imperative these people contact us to let us know what they saw.“We are also keen to hear from anyone who was in Field End Road area around 1am Sunday morning who may have seen or heard anything that they now think might be because of the incident at the RE bar. I would also appeal to anyone who had been at the RE bar throughout Saturday night, even if they left before Joshua was attacked, to contact us.”A postmortem is due to take place in the coming days.
