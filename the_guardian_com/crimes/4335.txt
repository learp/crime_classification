Customs officers will be able to use flashing blue lights and sirens as they chase suspected smugglers under new government proposals, as long as they keep to the speed limit.The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, is seeking views on legislation which will allow customs and excise to equip their vehicles with police-style emergency beacons. But unlike the police, fire and ambulance services, customs officers will not be allowed to go through red lights or break local speed limits. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said the change would give customs more "authority" as they close in on a drugs bust or an illicit alcohol operation.Customs are keen to use the blue lights because of the growing role of organised gangs in smuggling alcohol and tobacco into Britain. The right to break the speed limit is reserved for the three main emergency services. But customs will join a small number of other services allowed to use blue lights at modest speeds, such as forestry commission vehicles "while fighting fires" and the naval emergency monitoring organisation "for the purposes of a nuclear accident". Other changes to lights legislation will legalise flashing lights on bicycles. But more than eight flashes per second will not be allowed, due to the risk of sending other road users into epileptic fits.
