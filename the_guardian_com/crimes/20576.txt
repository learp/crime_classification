A loan shark who raped a client who could not afford his extortionate repayments and threatened to petrol bomb another woman's house was given an indefinite sentence today.Paul Nicholson, 39, was convicted in February of rape, 14 counts of blackmail, assault, acquiring criminal property and illegal money lending. Under the imprisonment for public protection rules, his sentence has no maximum tariff as he poses a danger to the public.When Nicholson was arrested by police and trading standards officials in March last year, he had 600 debtors on his books and was bringing in £800,000 a year, charging extortionate interest rates of up to 125%.Sentencing him at Warrington crown court today, Judge Thomas Teague told him: "This was a crime of deliberate, blatant, systematic and sustained intimidation."The judge said Nicholson and his partner Tracey Rogers, 38, were motivated by greed and had held parts of Widnes and Runcorn in Cheshire "in a state of fear, bordering on a collective servitude."The court heard Nicholson had a collection of weapons, including a baseball bat, knife and knuckleduster. Nicholson was also found guilty of lying about his criminal record, operating without a licence and acquiring criminal property.Rogers was convicted of blackmail, operating without a licence and acquiring criminal property. She was jailed for four years.The couple acquired enough money to move from a modest terrace property in Widnes to a £1m house adjoining a golf course on a large estate on the edge of Delamere Forest. When police raided the home, they found £26,000 in cash and a Porsche Carrera parked on the driveway.The former nightclub doorman, who has convictions for possessing a stun gun and supplying steroids, forced one woman who owed him money to perform a sex act on him.He told another woman she could work as a prostitute to pay off the money, while another was told: "You better get the money in fast or you'll be getting a couple of visitors."A 22-year-old man from Runcorn, Brian Shields, borrowed £300 from Nicholson but, within three months, that debt had risen to £3,400.Soon afterwards, he killed himself, and his mother, Carol Highton, blames his death on the intimidation her son received.She has since set up the Brian Shields Trust to advise anyone who is in debt to loan sharks.The senior investigating officer, Detective Inspector Giles Orton, said: "Paul Nicholson and Tracey Rogers created a climate of fear with violence and intimidation and Nicholson even used sexual impropriety to enforce debts. The court heard first-hand from witnesses who were subjected to terrifying threats and intimidation which had a terrible effect on their lives."He said their moral courage to stand up to Nicholson was key to achieving justice.Jacqui Kennedy, of the Stop Loan Sharks project, said: "This is probably the worst case we have seen so far."Nicholson trapped vulnerable people in a spiral of debt by charging extortionate interest rates and sexually intimidated women, just so he could maintain his lavish lifestyle. He did not care who he hurt in the process."As he was led away from the dock, Nicholson banged on the glass shouting: "This is a miscarriage of justice." His relatives wore T-shirts saying: "Nico aint no monster or loan shark."
