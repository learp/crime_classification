A retired teacher has won a lengthy legal battle to sue the so-called Lotto rapist for compensation, 20 years after she was attacked. The high court today cleared the final legal hurdle preventing the 78-year-old victim from claiming compensation from Iorworth Hoare, who won £7m with a Lotto Extra ticket bought while he was on day release in August 2004. Hoare, 59, attacked the woman, known as Mrs A, in Roundhay Park, Leeds in 1988. He spent 16 years in prison after being convicted of rape and jailed for life. He had six previous convictions for rape, attempted rape and indecent assault.Five months ago the law lords ruled that in special cases of serious assault, courts had the discretion to extend the usual six-year time limit within which compensation claims must be brought, leaving the high court to rule in individual cases.Mr Justice Coulson said today that the length of delay in suing, difficulties for Hoare in producing a defence and the fact that Mrs A had already received £5,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board all favoured Hoare's case.But he ruled in favour of Mrs A, saying that the delay in suing was reasonable because Hoare's life sentence rendered him incapable of earning a living and therefore not worth suing at the time of conviction.But he added that Mrs A's case was "wholly exceptional", and should not lead to a surge in people trying to get around the legal restraints to sue."It will be even rarer for such a defendant, years later, to buy a lottery ticket which wins him £7m or otherwise comes into an unexpected fortune which makes him suddenly worth pursuing after all," Coulson said. He ordered an urgent trial of Mrs A's action for psychological damages if a settlement could not be reached. Mrs A says she still suffers from nightmares and that the brutality of the assault destroyed her self-esteem and wrecked her relationships. Hoare, released from prison in 2005, reportedly lives in a £700,000 house near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
