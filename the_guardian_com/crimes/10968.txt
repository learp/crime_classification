A suspect in the disappearance of a businesswoman three months ago impersonated her brother in order to try to sell her £650,000 flat, detectives have said.Carole Waugh, 50, who had worked as an oil executive in Libya, has not contacted her family since mid-April and police are seriously concerned for her welfare. They revealed on Wednesday that a "significant amount of property" had been taken from her flat in Marylebone, London, adding that they were investigating a new development that a man had been posing for several weeks as her brother, in order to defraud her. The development emerged as Waugh's brother, Chris, travelled to London from his home in Cumbria to appeal for information about his sister's disappearance.Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane said a man had posed as Chris Waugh on several occasions up until the end of June.On at least one occasion the suspect had been outside her flat pretending to be her brother, discussing its sale with an individual from an estate agency."There has been a man who as yet we have not identified, who has been impersonating Chris and who was endeavouring to raise funds and engage in the sale of her flat in London," McFarlane said."He went to a number of people in different locations."Detectives hunting Carole Waugh – who worked until 2008 in the oil industry in Libya –have discovered hundreds of thousands of pounds have gone missing from her accounts.Initially the case was dealt with by a team of local officers, but last Thursday concerns grew and McFarlane's homicide and serious crime team took over.Within days he discovered that at least three women have impersonated her in order to allegedly defraud her.It also emerged on Wednesday that after her family first filed a cause for concern report with the Metropolitan police in early May an officer went round to her flat and gained entry. The officer reported back to the family that there was nothing untoward inside.But police now believe the flat might have been the scene of an abduction by individuals intent on taking over Carole Waugh's life. They are examining her relationships with friends in London, her business connections and her habits in an attempt to find those responsible.An extensive forensic search is being carried out inside the property.Police are hunting a number of individuals in connection with the disappearance.Eight people have been arrested. One woman remains in custody, a man has appeared in court in connection with the case, and six individuals have been released on police bail.
