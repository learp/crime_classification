Police were today hunting for a British millionaire after his girlfriend was found dead in a luxury Paris hotel.The man, aged 40, is thought to have fled the £1,000-a-night hotel in his Porsche 911.The 36-year-old woman's bruised and naked body was found in the bath of a suite in the Hotel Bristol by a cleaner on Tuesday morning.The couple are thought to have consumed a significant amount of champagne and other alcohol before the incident.Police said the woman checked in to a suite at the hotel on Monday, with her boyfriend arriving from London in the early hours of the following morning.They said she had been hit repeatedly with a blunt object and that the hotel rooms showed clear signs of a violent fight.The television, along with other furnishings, had been smashed to pieces.A police source told the Mail that officers were trying to establish the exact nature of the relationship between the pair."The woman was hit repeatedly, perhaps with a lamp stand or some other blunt tool," the source said."Nobody heard any shouts or screams. The room was chaotic. Lots of furniture had been knocked over or smashed and a curtain had been pulled down."A police spokesman said a national manhunt had been launched to find the man, and police at airports and land and sea borders had also been notified."We understand the woman had been seeing her boyfriend for about three years," he said."They had a turbulent time recently and she left alone for a few days' break in Paris. It appears the boyfriend followed her and visited her in her room at the hotel."The wanted man was seen by hotel staff arriving in a Porsche, he added.The woman had described herself to staff at the hotel as the director of an import-export agency who had been spending a lot of time in the French capital."The woman's body was found by a cleaner on Tuesday evening, severely beaten and covered in bruises. Neither the suspect nor the sports car he arrived in have been seen since," the spokesman said.A postmortem examination of the victim's body was due to take place later today.A source at the hotel, situated on the exclusive Rue Faubourg Saint-Honoré and one of city's most luxurious, told the Mail: "We assumed they were happy to see each other again, but things clearly turned very nasty."Everyone at the hotel is in shock, although it's business as usual today."
