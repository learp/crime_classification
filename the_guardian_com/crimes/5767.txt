A talented teenage ballet dancer is critically ill after he was mugged, possibly for his iPhone, during a trip to Britain from his base in Switzerland.Even if Jack Widdowson, 19, recovers from the attack in Cardiff, in which he suffered serious back and neck injuries, it is feared his dancing career may be over.Widdowson, an apprentice dancer with Bern:Ballett in Switzerland, was visiting his brother, Mark, in the Welsh capital.During a night out the brothers became separated in the Cardiff Bay area and police believe Widdowson's attacker may have pretended to befriend him before attacking him on a canal towpath.He was found unconscious more than an hour later.Widdowson was in a critical condition at the University Hospital of Wales with his family at his bedside.The teenager's father, Dr Julian Widdowson said: "He left school in August and was thrilled to have been chosen as one of the youngest ever members of Bern:Ballett, where he had the privilege to dance one of the lead roles in the company's winter production."We are all appalled by this unprovoked mindless violent attack in this great city where I was born. We continue to be by Jack's bedside hoping and praying for recovery."Widdowson, head of sports medicine at Aviva Premiership rugby club Bath, said his son was a "determined and strong-willed boy" who had worked hard to make the best of his natural talents.He added: "Jack is a very entertaining person who is very well loved by all who know and work with him. He has a polite and easy manner with a great sense of humour."Detective Chief Inspector Andy Davies, of South Wales Police, said: "This is an appalling assault while Jack was out with his brother."They became separated when he was walking home when he was joined by an unknown man. He was attacked and his iPhone was stolen and is still missing."Police want to speak to a man described as of mixed race and wearing a white-striped polo shirt with a dark-coloured motif on the left breast, blue jeans and white trainers.
