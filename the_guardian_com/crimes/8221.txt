There is something about the images of Vicky Pryce walking into Southwark court that I think would have been tragic even if she hadn't been found guilty. She is obviously determined not to meet any photographer's eye, but it's hard to look carefree while you're staring fixedly at nothing; her face is set to "unreadable"; her mouth is in that emotional no-man's land between a smile and repose. In the light of the verdict, the fragility leaps off the page, which is kinda ironic, given that she has been found guilty of being nothing like fragile enough.I was more surprised by the last jury's failure to decide than I was when this one returned with a guilty verdict. Pryce's defence – shall we just have one more recap for the road? – was that she subverted the law, took her husband's speeding points, because she was simply too emotionally fragile to resist Chris Huhne's bullying.The problem was that Pryce is a public figure in her own right; she's an economist, a researcher, she argues pretty trenchantly, we've all seen her on Newsnight. It's not quite Louise Mensch pleading marital coercion, but it's in that ballpark.However, there's an argument that domestic bullying is not something you can adjudicate from a distance. Indeed, that reflects pretty well on the first jury, that they went beyond the glaring open-and-shut details into the swampier territory that eventually mired them in indecision.Even if you do the mature thing and ignore that incongruity – this independent, assertive, capable woman, set against the vulnerability she was claiming – and furthermore, ignore the sheer unlikeliness of Chris Huhne qua ogre, that still leaves you with this inexplicable timing. She reported him, not then, not shortly afterwards, not when he got banned from driving anyway, not when the dust had settled, not when she'd had a couple of years to commune with her conscience, not when he was elected as MP, nor as cabinet minister … over seven years, nothing jogged her position on this, until her husband's affair.Which makes it look a little like revenge, a dish, like vomit, best not eaten at all; it doesn't matter what temperature it is.
