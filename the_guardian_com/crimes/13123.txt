A British Muslim man was today found guilty of two counts of soliciting to murder during a demonstration against the Muhammad cartoons.Abdul Muhid, 24, a prominent member of the Saviour Sect which is linked to the radical cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed, led a crowd chanting "Bomb, bomb the UK" and produced placards with slogans such as "Annihilate those who insult Islam", the Old Bailey heard.The demonstration happened outside the Danish embassy in London on February 3 2006 after the publication in a Danish newspaper of cartoons depicting Muhammad. The images included one of the prophet wearing a bomb-shaped turban.Other placards read "Europe you will pay, the Fantastic 4 are on their way" and "3/11 is on its way", apparent references to the fatal terrorist bombings in London and Madrid.During the trial, Muhid told the jury the protest was meant to show the "hurt and distress" felt by Muslims over the publication of the cartoons.David Perry QC, prosecuting, told the court that the real purpose of the protest in London was to encourage terrorism.Muhid saw himself as a "soldier" engaged in a struggle against those he believed had insulted Islam, and exhorted people to commit "terrorist killing", Mr Perry said.After the verdicts were read out, Mr Perry told the court Muhid had a previous conviction for smashing a bus shelter in Walthamstow market "which was displaying an advertisement which he said offended his religious beliefs".
