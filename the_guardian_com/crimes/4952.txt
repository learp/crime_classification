Up to six people were last night being questioned by police about the murder of a man in Co Down.They were detained hours after the first murder investigation of the new year was launched following the discovery of the body of a 29-year-old man in Banbridge. He had been battered to death at the rear of a house on a loyalist housing estate in the Cline Road area in the early hours of New Year's Day. Police believe he was bludgeoned with spades. Police said they believed up to four men and two women - one of the women with a Scottish accent - were involved in the killing, which they did not at this stage believe to be sectarian or terrorist-related. Joan Baird, an Ulster Unionist councillor, said people in the area were deeply shocked by the murder. "It is unbelievable that people could go out and do this to other people," she said. "Animals would not do this to each other and really these people have to be caught and punished for what they have done." Detectives have appealed for anyone with any information about the attack to contact them. Meanwhile, a man was being questioned by police in west Belfast following a hammer attack which left another man critically ill. He was detained after the attack at a house in Broadway Parade at around 4am. The injured man was taken to the Royal Victoria hospital suffering from severe head injuries. Police appealed for anyone with information or who witnessed the attack to contact them.
