A man was arrested today for the murder more than 10 years ago of a transsexual woman who worked as a prostitute.Police said scientific developments had allegedly linked the man to the fatal stabbing of Robyn Browne, 23, at her flat in Marylebone, north-west London, in February 1997.The man was arrested today in Leeds by officers from the Metropolitan police.Robyn, born James Errol Browne, was having treatment for a sex change and worked as a prostitute in London's West End.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The arrest follows a review of the evidence using techniques that were not available to the original investigating team. The arrested man is being transferred to a London police station."A report published in May this year said Scotland Yard's reaction to killings and attacks on gay, lesbian and transsexual people had historically been blighted by "institutional" homophobia.The review, written by the independent Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Advisory Group, examined how detectives had handled 10 murders of gay men or transsexuals, including the Browne case. Three of the other cases from the 10 also remain unsolved.The report said that in some cases inquiries were hampered by lack of knowledge, reliance on unfounded stereotypes and personal prejudices.
