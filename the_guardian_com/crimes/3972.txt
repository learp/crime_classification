The DNA of a forklift driver accused of murdering five prostitutes in Ipswich was on the bodies of three of the victims because he had sex with them - but he did not kill them, his defence counsel told a court today.Steve Wright, 49, of Ipswich, Suffolk, denies murdering Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24, and Annette Nicholls, 29.The court heard yesterday that samples containing Wright's DNA were taken from Alderton, Clennell and Nicholls.Timothy Langdale QC, defending, told the court it was unlikely the defence would challenge the prosecution's DNA evidence.He said his client admitted having sex with all of the women except Tania Nicol."It's not likely that you will be hearing the defence suggest to prosecution witnesses that they are lying or deliberately seeking to mislead you," he said."With regard to the DNA and the fibres, it's not the case that the defence suggests that the scientific findings are wrong."It's apparent from his plea of not guilty that he was not involved in any way in the death of these victims or the disposal of their bodies."He said Wright had also picked up Nicol with a view to having sex with her but "changed his mind and dropped her off".Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said today that "light blood staining" on a reflective jacket owned by the defendant was consistent with the DNA profile of Clennell and Nicholls. "The presence of ... blood matching that of Paula Clennell and Annette Nicholls upon the reflective jacket is, we submit, a remarkable coincidence," said the prosecutor.The women's corpses were discovered in isolated locations around Ipswich over 10 days in December 2006. Two of them had been arranged with their arms outstretched in a crucifix pose, Ipswich crown court heard.Peter Wright told the jury that no DNA was recovered from the bodies of Nicol and Adams, the first two women to be found."It is, we submit, hardly surprising that no DNA was found on either Tania Nicol or Gemma Adams," he said."These women had been immersed in water - in the case of Tania Nicol for approximately five weeks, and in the case of Gemma Adams for over two weeks."Wright said evidence of links between the defendant and the women's bodies painted a "compelling picture of his [the defendant's] guilt".Jurors were told a DNA sample was found on the right nipple and breast of Alderton. Wright said: "The male profile matched that of the defendant. The probability of obtaining such a match by chance is in the order of one in a billion."These findings point not to an unfortunate coincidence but rather to the defendant as being engaged in an active campaign of murder during the period from October to December 2006. A campaign that only came to an end with his arrest."A campaign in which he had deliberately targeted working prostitutes in the Ipswich area as his victims and succeeded in murdering no fewer than five in a very short space of time."Two semen-stained gloves were seized from Wright's car, the court heard. They contained DNA samples that could have come from Nicholls and Alderton, the jury was told.They were stained with semen on the inside and outside, which analysis showed could have come from Wright and Alderton's boyfriend.A forensic scientist concluded there was "very strong support" for the theory that Wright was wearing the gloves when he was in contact with Alderton and Nicholls.Wright said it would be "highly unusual, to say the least" for the defendant to have been wearing the gloves when he came into contact with the women if he was only engaging in consensual sexual activity with them as prostitutes."Unless, of course, he was wearing the gloves having murdered the women and was about to dispose of their bodies."Forensic experts found fibres linking the bodies of all five women to Wright's car and clothes, the court heard.The trial continues.
