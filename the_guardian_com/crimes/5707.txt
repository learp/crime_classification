A headteacher who stole from school funds to buy Gucci jewellery and pay for trips on the Orient Express was jailed today for five years.Former nun Colleen McCabe, 51, who swindled £500,000 to fund her lavish lifestyle, was convicted on 17 counts of theft. She bowed her head in the dock as she was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court in London.McCabe joined St John Rigby College - a state-funded, south London Catholic school - in 1989, after 15 years as a nun. She became headteacher in 1991, and ran a dictatorial regime that saw 26 teachers leave in a single year.During her three-month trial, the court heard that while pupils were left without books or heating, and the school was infested with rats, McCabe used the school's Barclaycard to pay for trips, and milked funds to buy Gucci jewellery, meals and West End theatre seats.She also ran up a £7,000 bill for shoes, and lavished gifts on family and friends.Passing sentence, judge Christopher Elwen told McCabe she was "self-satisfied, manipulative and mendacious". "You treated the college's funds as your own property to be used for the benefit of yourself, your family and your ecclesiastical friends without regards to the interests or welfare of the college and your pupils, to fund a lifestyle which the evidence showed your own finances could not have supported."Around 30 former teachers and pupils from the school were in court to see McCabe sentenced.
