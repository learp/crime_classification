Andrew Ibrahim, who changed his named to Isa Ibrahim by deed poll Photograph: Rex FeaturesIsa Ibrahim, 20, made viable explosives, manufactured a suicide vest and carried out reconnaissance on the Broadmead shopping centre. Detectives believe he was about to launch an attack, possibly targeting the centre's busy food court area.Police are heralding the case as a breakthrough as they say it is the first in which the information about a British would-be terrorist planning an atrocity in the UK has come just from a Muslim community.Ibrahim's extremism did not come to the attention of the authorities until members of a mosque he attended grew worried about his behaviour and went to Avon and Somerset police.Ibrahim was today found guilty of making an explosive with intent to danger life or cause serious injury to property in the UK in April last year. He was also convicted of preparing terrorist acts by purchasing material to make an explosive, making that explosive, buying material to detonate the explosive, carrying out reconnaissance before the act, and "making an improvised suicide vest in which to then detonate an explosive substance".The trial at Winchester crown court heard that when Ibrahim was arrested at his flat in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, the homemade explosive HMTD was found in a biscuit tin in the fridge.Also found in his one-bedroom flat was an electrical circuit capable of detonating the explosive at short range and a suicide vest hanging on the back of his bedroom door.The trial heard that Ibrahim, whose parents are Christian, converted to Islam and changing his name by deed poll from Andrew to Isa. He became radicalised after researching people such as Abu Hamza, and became fascinated by suicide bombing.Ibrahim used the internet to find instructions on how to make explosives from household products such as hydrogen peroxide.He claimed he had no intent to harm but just wanted to set the vest off and film it for video website YouTube.Summing up, the judge, Mr Justice Butterfield, had told the jury the prosecution's case was that he was a "disturbed" and "alienated" adolescent who had become radicalised.The defence's case was that Ibrahim was a "weak, lonely figure living in a fantasy world" who was not part of a terrorist cell and had simply become excited about making and detonating explosives.
