Kieren Fallon is a jockey with an undoubted compulsion to win - and the talent to see it through.But he was accused of using his talent to make sure some horses lost without anyone being any the wiser.The accusation was unthinkable to a legion of ordinary punters who backed the "Fallon Factor".The Old Bailey trial was only the latest in a series of controversies which have dogged the six-times champion jockey's career.Frankie Dettori may have been the darling of many, but when it came to getting the job done, no one did it better than Fallon.The day before his trial started, Fallon rode Dylan Thomas to victory in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris.Born in County Clare in 1965, Fallon had a fiery reputation when riding in the north of England early in his career.He hit the headlines for the wrong reasons after an altercation with a fellow jockey in 1994. He was banned from riding for six months after the Jockey Club found him guilty of violent or improper conduct after pulling Stuart Webster from his horse at Beverley.Fallon's talent, however, was indisputable and he landed the plum job as stable jockey to Henry Cecil in 1997.The string of winners from Warren Place in Newmarket helped Fallon make a giant leap forward and he ended the season as champion jockey for the first time, with more than 200 victories to his name.The Fallon-Cecil partnership did not last and the pair split in 1999 - even though they teamed up to win the Derby with Oath at Epsom in June of the same year.At Royal Ascot in June 2000, Fallon suffered a serious injury and almost lost the use of his left arm in a fall. The injury threatened his career and led to him being out of action for six months.In 2003, he admitted in an article in the Sunday Times to having a problem with alcohol and said he was undergoing a 30-day programme of treatment.There were other controversies but Fallon cemented his huge popularity with punters when he landed a massive public gamble in the 2003 Vodafone Derby, winning on Kris Kin for Sir Michael Stoute after an inspired ride.And he once again proved he had taken over Lester Piggott's mantle as the master of Epsom with a Classic-winning double 12 months later when he again won the Derby, this time on North Light, and also took the Vodafone Oaks on Ouija Board.Undeniably one of the all-time great jockeys, he ended 2004 as champion jockey for the sixth time.But during the same period, Fallon had been the subject of an undercover police surveillance operation.He left Newmarket to form a new successful partnership with the Coolmore and O'Brien stables in Ireland in 2005 and he rose to new heights, with an historic Guineas double at Newmarket, among other memorable wins.But things turned sour in July last year when he was charged with conspiracy to defraud punters at Betfair, and was banned from racing in Britain. Further suspensions in America and Hong Kong bedevilled his progress outside Britain.He was banned worldwide for six months in November 2006 for testing positive to a metabolite of a prohibited substance in France.
