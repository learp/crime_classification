Praia da Luz – originally a tiny fishing village – has attracted British tourists for the past few decades but, before Madeleine McCann went missing, the destination was one of the best-kept secrets on the Algarve.The Ocean Club was one of several collections of tourist accommodation in the holiday town, which is located just a couple of kilometres west of the larger town of Lagos, about an hour's drive from Faro airport. Owned by the holiday company, Mark Warner, the club comprises villa-style apartments, set around a series of private areas that include a swimming pool, tennis courts and restaurant. Kate and Gerry McCann, and their three children, stayed in an apartment that overlooked a private complex. The terms of their holiday were simple – half-board, breakfast and evening meal, all for about £1,500.They had been given a reduction when the Leicester-based couple discovered that, unlike most Mark Warner resorts, the Ocean Club did not offer a baby-listening service.The McCanns and their friends – now dubbed by the press as the "tapas seven" – asked for apartments close together so they were all assigned to block five.The Paynes were on the floor above the McCanns in the only apartment with a functioning baby monitor.Russell O'Brien and Jane Tanner had brought a monitor with them, but it didn't get a good signal at the tapas restaurant 50 yards away where the group gathered on May 3.In the usual style of Mark Warner, the Ocean Club is not a gated, enclosed resort, but a sprawling complex open to the village of Luz and scattered over such a wide distance that minibuses are used to ferry holidaymakers around. Many holidaymakers felt that, although the resort was open to the village, it was still safe and secure.In early May, it was still very quiet, more than a month before the holiday season gets into full swing. Gerry McCann has said he never saw a soul, except once, on the last night, on his evening checks going back and forth between the restaurant and the apartment – a walk of about a minute.As the McCanns endlessly repeated afterwards, if they had thought it was wrong or even risky, they would never have left their children.
