More than 5,000 people were arrested as part of this summer's nationwide police blitz on binge drinking and alcohol-fuelled violence, it will be announced today.The home secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to use the publication of the results of the two month campaign to urge magistrates to give tougher sentences to those offenders who use being drunk as an excuse for their criminal actions.The full results of the police campaign will show that 4,000 troublemakers were given fixed penalty notices for alcohol-related street crimes.These included offences of harassment and being drunk and disorderly.The Home Office figures will also show that a further 9,500 adults and children had alcohol confiscated from them for flouting bans on public drinking in designated areas.Ministers believe the success of the summer crackdown on binge drinking highlights the extent of the problem on Britain's streets at the weekends, caused by under-age drinking and alcohol-fuelled violence.The campaign also included more than 1,500 "sting" operations targeting drink sales by clubs, bars and off-licences to those under 18.The under-age participants found they could get served in 51% of the licensed premises they visited and nearly one in three off-licences and supermarkets.The call for tougher sentencing by magistrates of those who claim they were drunk at the time they committed the offence would mean a shift in attitude in the courts.At present drunkenness is often cited as a mitigating factor by those representing people accused of low-level anti-social behaviour.More than 90 of the 250 police divisions across England and Wales were involved in the campaign over the summer.It involved the first widespread use of on-the-spot fines in the form of fixed penalty notices to deal with street drinking.Official research to be published today evaluating the use of on-the-spot fines to deal with disorder shows widespread support among the police, and benefits for the criminal justice system.Ministers believe that use of fixed penalty notices saves police time and leaves courts free to deal with more serious offences.The success of the summer drink campaign means that the Home Office is likely to push ahead with an extension of on-the-spot fines, to target those involved in selling alcohol to under-18s, such as shops and off-licences, or adults buying it for them.Ministers also expect to continue with their plans to liberalise the alcohol licensing hours in England and Wales, in the belief that the staggering closing times would lead to a reduction in the incidence of late night yobbishness.
