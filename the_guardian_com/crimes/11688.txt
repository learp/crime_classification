Baby P's mother was jailed indefinitely today for causing or allowing her son's death, as an official report said the killing "could and should have been prevented".The mother was told she would serve at least five years. "You are a manipulative and self-centred person, with a calculating side as well as a temper," the judge, Stephen Kramer, told Baby P's mother at the Old Bailey."I am satisfied that you acted selfishly because your priority was your relationship with [your boyfriend]."The boyfriend, 32, was given a 12-year sentence by the judge for his role in the killing of Baby P, now named as Peter; and a concurrent life sentence with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl.Jason Owen, 37, from Bromley, south-east London, a lodger at the same home as the pair, was given an indeterminate sentence and told he would serve a minimum of three years.Due to the time the mother has already served in custody she could be eligible for parole in August 2012.Children's charity the NSPCC criticised the minimum terms for the mother and Owen as being too short. "It raises the question of how bad the abuse has to be before offenders get a longer minimum time in prison," said the NSPCC chief executive, Andrew Flanagan.The indeterminate sentences mean Peter's mother and Owen could be eligible for parole after serving the minimum tariff, but only if they satisfy authorities that they no longer pose a risk to the public.Peter was 17 months old when he was found dead in a blood-spattered cot in August 2007 with a broken back and fractured ribs.He had more than 50 injuries despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over eight months. For legal reasons the mother and boyfriend - who cannot be released until August 2017 - cannot be named.Today, Peter's mother showed no emotion in the Old Bailey until her boyfriend was sentenced to life. Her mouth fell open and she appeared to mouth "No". As she was led away, a woman called out "fucking tramp".The sentencing came as a second review by the Haringey safeguarding children board said doctors, lawyers, police and social workers should have been able to stop the situation "in its tracks at the first serious incident".The report [pdf] details how Peter's mother first become involved with social services after moving from Leicester to London as a child, and the meetings held about Peter's welfare after his bruised body came to the attention of health workers.Even after Peter was put under a child protection plan his case was regarded as routine "with injuries expected as a matter of course". Agencies were "lacking urgency", "lacking thoroughness" and "insufficiently challenging to the parent".The review found that agencies "did not exercise a strong enough sense of challenge" when dealing with Peter's mother and their outlook was "completely inadequate" to meet the challenges of the case.Graham Badman, the chairman of the safeguarding children board, said: "I believe the most important lesson arising from this case is that professionals charged with ensuring child safety must be deeply sceptical of any explanations, justifications or excuses they may hear in connection with the apparent maltreatment of children."If they have any doubt about the cause of physical injuries or what appears to be maltreatment, they should act swiftly and decisively."'Shock and concern'Lord Laming, who carried out a major review of child protection services after Baby P's death, said he shared the "sense of shock and concern", not least because of the failure of each of the key public services to intervene."Being on the frontline of services to protect children from deliberate harm or neglect is tough and demanding work," he said."Now is the time for a major step change in the managerial accountability of these key services as well as a major change in the recruitment, training and supervision of frontline staff."Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP in Haringey, said: "The guilty have at last been punished, but we still cannot rest until we fully understand how this poor little boy suffered so terribly, and for so long, under the noses of Haringey's children's services."She praised the rigour of the second serious case review. "The first serious case review either showed clear incompetence or was a cover-up," she said. "This one could not be more different from the first. It says exactly what we should have learnt at the start of this awful tragedy: Haringey council, health professionals and the police all failed to protect Baby Peter from three individuals who set out to harm him."The judge told all three defendants that "significant force" had been used on Peter "on a number of occasions"."Whatever the truth of what took place and the role and motivation of each individual, the result was that a child died in horrific circumstances with injuries that can only have caused great pain and distress prior to his death."Peter's mother wrote a letter to the judge from prison that was read aloud in court yesterday.In it she apologised for the pain and suffering she had caused and begged her family, including Peter's natural father, for forgiveness."I have lost all I hold dear to me. Now every day of my life is full of guilt and trying to come to terms with my failure as a mother," she wrote."I punish myself on a daily basis and there is not a day that goes by where I don't cry at some point."Peter's natural father told the Old Bailey yesterday of his horror at the knowledge that the little boy suffered months of pain, fear and loneliness before his death.He said his life had become a "living nightmare" since losing his son.Five employees of Haringey council in north London were sacked, including the children's services director, Sharon Shoesmith, and the General Medical Council has suspended two doctors involved in the case.The children's secretary, Ed Balls, said what happened in Haringey was "unforgivable" but insisted changes were being made up and down the country to try to prevent it occurring again. "What I can't do is make a commitment that I can stop adults harming children, because I don't have that power, and even though we don't understand why an adult could do this to a child, it does happen."But where it comes to the attention of the social worker, the police officer, the GP, the paediatrician, they should act to put the child first and not be deceived by parents covering things up when there's actual harm there right in front of you, staring you in the face, as happened with Baby Peter."The judge was very clear here, that the mother in this case was very deceptive, she was very manipulative â€“ she hid the evidence from the professionals."At the same time, the evidence was there to see, and when there was clear evidence of non-accidental injury, real harm for this child, the child's interests should have been put first."And there were opportunities to act, to take the child to a safe place, and they weren't properly taken, and that's wrong."And that's about the social workers and the police and the health service in that particular case not doing what they should have done and letting down that little boy."
