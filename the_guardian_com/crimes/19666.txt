The Serious Fraud Office published figures today showing its conviction rate had jumped over the last year despite steep budget cuts in a direct riposte to critics who have called for the crime agency to be scrapped.The figures showed the conviction rate rose from 78% the previous year to 91% in 2009/10 as the agency won a larger number of cases.A spokesman said success in trials was matched by the SFO's increasing ability to secure assets from fraudsters and return money to victims.He said: "Some £4m has been paid in compensation directly to victims. The figure last year was significantly less than a million pounds. Fines against companies amounted to nearly £12m this year, having risen from zero the year before."Staff numbers have remained almost static at 303, down only slightly from 305 in 2008/9, during a period when the budget slumped from £52m to £44m. Next year the budget is due to shrink a further 20% to £37m."Like most areas of government we are looking to do more with less. It is possible because over the last two years we have introduced management systems that give us a better idea of how the agency operates on a day to day basis," he said."We also assess cases on a more regular basis, which means we can abandon them at an earlier stage when they are unlikely to achieve a conviction, or put in more resources when it is obvious they are needed."Some legal experts have criticised the SFO for pursuing minor cases of fraud they argue allow for quick and cheap convictions. In several cases the agency has chased individual criminals involved in fraud against investors and mortgage frauds that involve amounts as low as £1m despite setting a £5m minimum in previous years.Richard Alderman, the SFO's director, said it remained committed to convicting criminals in major frauds. "With reduced funding we continue to work in innovative ways. This year has seen a number of firsts for us, including the first ever UK prosecution for breaching UN sanctions and use of cash seizure and other powers to return more money to victims of fraud and corruption."
