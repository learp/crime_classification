Sir Menzies Campbell tried to reinvigorate his leadership of the Liberal Democrats today by heralding a tougher stance on the treatment of serious offenders.He used a major speech to set out a new direction for the party on law and order issues in an attempt to foil accusations that the Lib Dems are soft on crime.In marked contrast to his predecessor, Charles Kennedy, Sir Menzies said that serious offenders such as Soham killer Ian Huntley should not have a vote while in prison.He also called for new restrictions on foreign criminals who cannot be deported and a new violent offenders register to keep track of dangerous individuals.Sir Menzies said: "A party which is serious about social justice cannot fail to be serious about preventing crime and enforcing the rules."I am determined that the Liberal Democrats under my leadership will stand for equality before the law and equality of responsibility under the law."Sir Menzies' address was the first in a series of policy speeches in which he will outline his vision for the party.It comes as he faces continued questions about his performance since he was elected leader in March.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning that his faltering performances at prime minister's questions were a "work in progress".Sir Menzies added: "If prime minister's questions were the only test of political leadership in this country, William Hague would still be leading the Conservative party and, who knows, might even be prime minister.He also criticised his former leadership rival Simon Hughes who recently gave him until September to prove himself.Sir Menzies said: "I set no time limits for my leadership and no one should set time limits for me either - including Simon Hughes."Speaking to Lib Dem councillors in London, Sir Menzies ditched the party's policy of giving all prisoners the vote, which was advocated by Mr Kennedy at the last general election to much criticism from Labour and the Tories.He said: "Penalties should go beyond custody. People like Ian Huntley should not have the right to vote. If you are guilty of a serious breach of the law, you forfeit the right to elect those who make the law."In my view, people convicted of serious violent or sexual offences should not have the right to vote while in prison."In the wake of the foreign prisoners fiasco, which has exposed failings in the immigration system, Sir Menzies called for a new drive to deport prisoners upon release wherever possible.He said: "Undesirable criminals from abroad who have been recommended for deportation should be transferred to serve time in their home country or deported as soon as their sentence ends."If they cannot be deported due to threats to their life, we need to introduce new measures to restrict their freedom of movement and association."Where a dangerous individual cannot be deported due to threats to their life, we should look at legislation to impose restrictions on their residence in the UK."Sir Menzies also proposed new measures in response to a series of high-profile crimes by dangerous offenders released on probation."In the light of recent horrific crimes committed by offenders under probation supervision, we must look seriously at creating a violent offenders register, like the sexual offences register, for all serious violent offenders."It would assist the job of keeping track of the most serious criminals and improve public safety."He added that the government had released criminals early, not because they deserved to be, but because the prisons were full. Sir Menzies said: "Labour has put more people in prison but then let more of them out, not because they deserve early release but because of overcrowding."This is not being tough on crime. This is mismanagement and inadequacy."A senior aide last night admitted that under Mr Kennedy there had been "ambiguities" in the Lib Dem's handling of crime which have contributed to a public perception of the party as soft.Sir Menzies was determined to dispel this impression and to make clear that his party's commitment to human rights and individual liberties would not stop it from being tough on criminals.
