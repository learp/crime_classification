The forced strip-searching of inmates at a young offenders' institution was condemned by prison inspectors today.Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, said strip-searching on arrival at HMP Werrington in Stoke-on-Trent was routine, and a surprise inspection revealed that two teenagers had had their clothes cut off by prison officers.Her report criticised the prison's overall safety record and anti-bullying policies, and blamed many of the problems at the 150-inmate centre on a population crisis.Ms Owers said "disgruntled" young prisoners from London were forced to move to the centre, leading to disruption."We were ... appalled by a video recording of the strip-searching by force of a refractory young person, which included cutting off his clothing despite his protestations that he was willing to comply," the report said."Whatever the provocation, excessive reaction of this kind is unacceptable."Though it had continued to improve in a number of areas, the weaknesses we identified in safety were serious and required urgent management attention."Ms Owers said the institution's record on self-harm also "needed improvement".Juliet Lyon, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the report was "explosive"."If people think that our young offender institutions are run in a disciplined and decent manner, this explosive report of enforced strip-searching, self-harm and bullying would make anyone question whether an overstretched prison can work either to keep young men safe or to reduce youth crime," she said.But Phil Wheatley, the director general of the prison service, defended the use of forced strip-searches in situations where inmates were not "compliant"."Generally this is a good report which charts decent progress at an establishment dealing with difficult individuals," he said."As to the incident involving the strip-search of the young person, I have seen the video and reviewed the matter in great detail."I am convinced that at no point in the process was he compliant and that the staff involved dealt with the incident correctly in the circumstances, when faced by a difficult and disturbed young man."
