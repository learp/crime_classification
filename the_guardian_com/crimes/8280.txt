MPs today called on the home secretary, Charles Clarke, to introduce statutory call-barring of all telephone numbers that appear on prostitutes' cards displayed in telephone kiosks.A group have tabled a House of Commons motion expressing disappointment at the "continued inaction" on the part of mobile phone operators in implementing this policy, although BT has barred incoming calls to any BT-owned number that appear on the cards. The motion speaks of the "significant and growing problem" of prostitutes' cards in telephone boxes. "This is simply a visible top layer of criminal activity behind which lies a range of serious crimes, including human trafficking, illegal immigration and drug dealing." The MPs said the only viable way of tackling this problem was for the government to introduce statutory call-barring, and at the earliest opportunity. Karen Buck, Labour MP for Regents Park and Kensington North, the sponsor of the motion, said the distributors of the cards were now displaying mobile phone numbers in order to get round the BT call-barring."We are not trying to make London like Disneyland and pretend that prostitution does not exist, but this is now a serious issue. For instance, if people try to remove the cards, they are liable to be attacked," she said.
