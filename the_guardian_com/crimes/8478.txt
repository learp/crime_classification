Away from the celebrated cases - the suspected terrorists, gangland killers and wayward politicians - Bow Street magistrates court's bread and butter has always been petty criminals.And so it was again this morning, during the last session before the court closed to be turned into a hotel, that a series of small-timers accused of falling foul of the law appeared amid the oak panelling of court one.The chief magistrate, Tim Workman - the 33rd in a continuous line of justices to have presided over the court since it was established by Sir Thomas De Veil in 1735 - opened the session by remarking that, in that time, Bow Street had become the most famous magistrates court in the world, playing a part "in some of the most notorious and high-profile cases"."The present dock - a mere 125 years old - has had amongst its occupants Oscar Wilde, Dr Crippen and the Kray twins," he told the ranks of court officials, lawyers, retired staff and press who crammed the wooden benches. "More recently, cases involving General Pinochet and cases of persons suspected of terrorist offences both here and abroad have been heard in this courtroom."But he also noted that, like all magistrates courts, Bow Street had a jurisdiction that dealt with local offences, many by the "sad, ill or unfortunate".Among those who became a footnote in history today by appearing before the judge was Sarmand Majeed, 35, from west London. He admitted he had been operating as an unlicensed cabbie and driving without insurance when stopped on Charing Cross Road in June. Judge Workman, sitting in his lofty tall-backed chair set between two bookcases filled with ageing leather-bound, gold embossed tomes, adjourned the case, saying he needed reports after discovering Mr Majeed had no driving licence.Many retired staff and former Metropolitan police officers who had worked in the adjoining police station until its closure in 1992 were among those following today's proceedings.Dave Powis, 73, a constable based in Bow Street from 1955 to 1957, said the chaos of the magistrates court had not changed much."Court one was always a showpiece and they used to have parties of ladies who came to see the panelling while we were all jammed together outside in the corridors with the drunks and the prostitutes waiting for the court to become free," he said.Another former Bow Street constable, Ken Brown, 74, who worked there for nine years from 1955, said the jailer knew all the prostitutes who used to queue up to appear before the judge."They used to be sent here so often. The jailer would say 'Hello Mary', 'Hello Susan'. They'd come for a chat and bring their knitting."Colin Burgess, 72, a sergeant and occasional acting inspector who worked for the police between 1962 and 1985, remembered when the Kray brothers, the notorious East End gang bosses, were held in the cells before appearing in court."They were just ordinary prisoners in one sense," he said. "But then they were the days when the police governor used to make sure that the well-known criminals were being treated well. They didn't want any complaints."Today saw the hearing of yet another high-profile case for which Bow Street is renowned. A man known only as LL stepped up to the dock accompanied by a police officer. With hands uncuffed and head bowed, LL sat quietly as his barrister, Maya Sinkand, explained that a translator had failed to turn up. LL's case was, she explained, the first of its kind. He is accused of breaching the terms of control orders imposed on him. But last week a high court judge ruled that the orders were unlawful, leaving LL in legal limbo until a higher court rules on the government's appeal.Today, Judge Workman granted LL unconditional bail but said he still remained subject to the control orders, and adjourned the case until August 11 when he will appear before the newly named City of Westminster magistrates court, in Horseferry Road, which will take all of Bow Street's cases.Memories from further back have also been chronicled. Sir Thomas De Veil's Bow Street court, located on the modern site of the Royal Opera House opposite today's Victorian building, went on to be run by the author Henry Fielding. He created the Bow Street runners, the forebears of the modern police service that came about a century later. Fielding was moved to set up the runners in response to the problems of gin consumption: he recorded that every fourth house in Covent Garden was a gin shop.Giacomo Casanova wrote in his memoirs about the experience of appearing before Fielding's blind brother, Sir John, accused of grievous bodily harm against "a pretty girl". He was released after two householders swore that he would not commit such a crime.Charles Dickens, who regularly attended Bow Street as a reporter, described its appearance in the 19th century."There were other prisoners, boys of 10, as hardened in vice as men of 50; a household vagrant going joyfully to prison as a place of food and shelter, handcuffed to a man whose prospects were ruined, character lost and family rendered destitute by his first offence."Many of the staff and retired police officers in court today said they were sad the court would not be preserved as a museum. Instead it has been sold to an Irish developer who has promised a "sympathetic" overhaul, opening up the prospect that tourists may be able to sleep in the cells.Few were keen to exchange the Bow Street history for the "soulless" Horseferry Road building. But Judge Workman maintained a fittingly stoical approach."The closure of the court with its great legal heritage and history is of great sadness to me and to all who are associated with this court, but the work will continue in the City of Westminster courthouse where I am sure that the standards, traditions and spirit of Bow Street will prevail and be preserved."And now the final morning's work must be completed, striving to see, as Sir Thomas De Veil insisted, that justice be done."
