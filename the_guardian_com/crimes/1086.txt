The brother of one of the suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation walked free from Woolwich crown court, south-east London, yesterday after a judge ruled he could not face a fair retrial for allegedly wounding an Asian taxi driver because of his family's "notoriety".Judge Brian Pryor, QC, said the "heavy police and media attention" surrounding Clifford Norris's brother, David, one of the five youths accused of murdering the black teenager in 1993 and their father, also Clifford, meant there was a risk any jury would be prejudiced. The physical similarity between the two brothers also cast doubt on whether the alleged victim, 26-year-old Gatri Hassan, had made an "honest" error in identifying Clifford Norris, as opposed to his brother, as the man who attacked him last November. In May a jury cleared Norris of possessing an offensive weapon but failed to decide whether he had unlawfully wounded Mr Hassan. Norris, 20, of Chislehurst, Kent, had denied both charges.
