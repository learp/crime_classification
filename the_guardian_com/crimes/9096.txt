Two teenagers have been charged with the murder of a 14-year-old schoolboy who was stabbed while sitting on a bench outside his east London home, police said today. Godiowe Dufeal, 19, of Hackney, east London, and a 16-year-old boy who cannot be named, will appear before Thames magistrates court today over the killing of Shaquille Smith at the weekend. Police arrested two other men today, aged 18 and 21, in connection with the case.Shaquille was sitting on a bench in St Thomas's Place, Hackney, just before midnight on Saturday when he was surrounded by a group of around 15 youths, witnesses said. He was stabbed in the stomach and died at 8am the next day in hospital. His sister Tahira, 16, was also stabbed and was treated in hospital for her injuries. Shaquille had been due to go back to school this week to start his GCSE studies. He was the 25th teenager to die in attacks in London this year. Earlier this week his mother, Sandra Maitland-Smith, a social worker, described her son's "star quality". She said in a statement: "He had a unique character and common touch that would have both taken him to the top and maintained him in that position. He was a tough individual with a lot of drive, with an easy going and pleasurable-loving nature."
