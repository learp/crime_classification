The outspoken former leader of the Scottish Socialist party Tommy Sheridan was today accused of deliberately lying to cover up his visits to a swingers club called Cupids in a case expected to become the longest perjury hearing in Scottish legal history.Looking tanned but drawn, Sheridan, 46, sat in the dock alongside his wife, Gail, at the high court in Glasgow, four years after the couple won a controversial Â£200,000 libel case against the News of the World over allegations he took part in adulterous sex sessions at a swingers' club in Manchester.In seven pages of charges, Sheridan is accused of asking his comrades and friends to lie for him, and of denying that he had made confessions about his adultery and affairs before he sued the News of the World for libel.The trial opened today with evidence from a Scottish Socialist party (SSP) official, Barbara Scott, who took minutes at an emergency party executive meeting soon after the News of the World stories naming Sheridan were published in November 2004.Scott told the jury of 13 women and two men that Sheridan, then a member of the Scottish parliament for Glasgow and the SSP's convenor, had admitted at the meeting he had twice visited Cupids, in 1996 and 2002.She recalled him saying "it was a flaw in his character and it was a weakness that he had, but it had been only those two times".Sheridan argued there was no photographic evidence of his visits, and demanded that the party executive back his attempts to face down the News of the World and his enemies, she said.According to her notes, he told the meeting "he didn't deserve sympathy but does deserve [the] right to fight [the claims]," Scott said.Scott, a former secretary in the NHS, said today that she had been so angry with Sheridan for calling her a liar during his libel hearing against the News of the World that she had voluntarily handed over her notes of that meeting to the police days after the libel case ended.Accompanied by the then SSP MSPs Carolyn Leckie and Rosie Kane, who employed her as an assistant at the Scottish parliament, Scott visited Lothian and Borders police headquarters of her own volition several days later to give them her notes."Basically, he had said that I had fabricated evidence and my job at that time was secretarial, and I had been called a liar and had been part of a conspiracy, which was total nonsense," she said. She approached the police "to clear my name. I didn't lie," she said.The case, before Lord Bracadale, is set to last up to 10 weeks, and could hear from up to 181 prosecution witnesses and up to 20 defence witnesses, including five former SSP MSPs, party activists, journalists and the women alleged to have been Sheridan's lovers.The Sheridans deny all the charges, but if convicted face up to 10 years in jail.The couple arrived hand in hand at court to the sound of cheers and applause from about 35 supporters from Sheridan's current party, Solidarity and the Socialist Party Scotland .They carried placards saying: "Defend Tommy and Gail Sheridan", "The real criminals? Blair and Murdoch" and "Put the News of the World on trial".The indictment claims that Sheridan lied about visiting Cupids with the journalist Anvar Khan in 1996 and 2002; lied about his confessions at the SSP executive meeting and to friends in the party; lied about confessing to some "madness" involving another woman at a hotel in Glasgow; and had deceived people about the length of his affair with Khan.Gail Sheridan, 46, who recently took voluntary redundancy from her job as a British Airways air steward, is separately accused of helping her husband win the libel case by giving him false alibis. She allegedly told the libel trial that she and her husband were at home together on several weekends in 2001 when he was allegedly at Cupids and she was actually in Miami.She is also alleged to have wrongly claimed that the couple were together when her aunt came to visit from the United States in June 2002, at a time when Sheridan was allegedly having group sex in a Glasgow hotel.An outspoken figure, Sheridan is well known in Scotland for his long career as a socialist activist and anti-poverty campaigner. He first came to prominence during the anti-poll-tax protests in the 1980s and early 1990s.He won a seat in the first Scottish parliament elections in 1999 for the SSP, and sat as a list MSP for Glasgow until the 2007 Scottish elections.He resigned as SSP leader immediately after the emergency executive meeting in November 2004, setting up a rival party, Solidarity, with other SSP MSPs and activists. Sheridan took part in Celebrity Big Brother in 2009, and was the fifth housemate to be evicted.The trial continues today.Who's who in the Sheridan caseTommy SheridanThe former "firebrand" convenor of the Scottish Socialist party, Sheridan was twice elected an MSP on the Glasgow regional list. After the News of the World's allegations about his sexual life, he quit as leader of the SSP and formed the breakaway Solidarity party.Maggie Scott QCKnown to her colleagues as the "queen of the appeal court", Scott is representing Sheridan. She was the lawyer for Abdelbaset al Megrahi, the Libyan man jailed for the Lockerbie bombing, until he dropped his appeal last year when his cancer became inoperable. She has won a series of notable appeal cases, including the acquittal of Thomas "TC" Campbell for murder in the so-called "ice-cream wars".Aamer AnwarSheridan's solicitor, Anwar is one of Scotland's most active civil rights lawyers and anti-racism campaigners. A supporter of Sheridan's Solidarity party, he was with the Anti-Nazi League when a police officer was convicted of racially assaulting him in 1991. He has championed cases involving racist murderers, and was one of the only lawyers reported to court for alleged contempt after criticising the conviction of student Mohammed Siddique on terror charges.Paul McBride QCA flamboyant advocate, McBride is representing Gail Sheridan. He has acted for the accused in several high-profile trials, including the defendants in the "head on the beach" case of the Lithuanian woman murdered for her savings, and the rapist who murdered the Glasgow businesswoman Moira Jones. McBride recently joined the Scottish Conservative party.Alex Prentice QCA widely respected and quietly spoken lawyer, Prentice is leading the prosecution. Despite being a Queen's counsel, he does not wear a wig in court because he is a solicitor-advocate and not a barrister.
