The Home Office will be split into two separate departments responsible for justice and security on May 9, Tony Blair announced today.The long-planned split was first mooted by the home secretary, John Reid, before Christmas, but was only approved by Downing Street today.The Home Office will keep its name, but will slim down its responsibilities to concentrate on terrorism, security and immigration. But it will also still be responsible for crime reduction and anti-social behaviour, in addition to the forthcoming ID cards scheme.Powers over prisons and probation will be switched to a new ministry for justice.As of May 9, the Department for Constitutional Affairs will cease to exist and its responsibilities for such matters as legal aid, courts and constitutional reform will switch to the ministry for justice.Lord Falconer will then become the UK's first secretary of state for justice.Home Office ministers are joking that their department is being "split for purpose", according to the Guardian's home affairs editor, Alan Travis.But the Tories immediately warned the move could result in a "lock 'em up" department and a "let 'em out" department.Within the Home Office, a new office for security and counter-terrorism will be established, plus a ministerial committee on security and terrorism, chaired by the prime minister.The planned break-up comes after a year of troubles for the Home Office on issues from the release with deportation of foreign prisoners to a failure to process information on Brits who committed crimes abroad.Mr Blair said in a written ministerial statement: "Our counter-terrorism capabilities are among the best in the world. However, the continuing and growing threat from terrorism means that the government must develop and improve its counter-terrorism and security capabilities, and its governance."Mr Reid went to the Commons to explain the move to MPs - where he was attacked for announcing the radical split on the last day before the Easter recess, when many MPs are already absent.The home secretary said he was "refocusing the Home Office - not for the first time in its history - towards the priorities of today's world and the priorities of today's people."Under the reforms, the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, will retain control of MI6, and the communities secretary, Ruth Kelly, would retain her responsibilities for community cohesion.The Guardian's security editor, Richard Norton-Taylor, said: "MI5, and the police, are likely to welcome the decision, after a battle royal in Whitehall, to break up the Home Office.""So crime will be in dealt with one place, the consequences of it, and its effects, in another. Whether that helps in the continuing quest for joined-up government remains to be seen."One of the first people to criticise the split was former home secretary Charles Clarke, who described the decision as "irresponsible" and said it would threaten the criminal justice system.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, and the Liberal Democrat spokesman, Nick Clegg, both criticised the move - despite both parties have called for a division of labour within the Home Office previously.Mr Davis said: "Breaking it up will solve none of the Home Office's problems. It will just create a whole new raft of problems."The logic, presumably, is that this job is too difficult for the home secretary to do."It has been well run in the past by home secretaries of all parties, when it was much bigger and still had responsibility for licensing, gambling, broadcasting, fire, civil defence, human rights, equal opportunities and charities.Mr Clegg said it risked being a "botched job"."The devil will be in the detail," he said.The announcement of the split in the Home Office comes after a year of mishaps, which first saw Mr Clarke resign over the failure to deport foreign criminals who had served their sentences.Mr Reid replaced him and immediately declared his department "unfit for purpose" before himself being engulfed in a series of blunders, such as a failure to process information on Britons who committed crimes abroad.With Mr Blair due to step down by the summer, Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat leader, voiced suspicions that today's announcement had more to do with the Labour leadership than the state of the Home Office.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There is some political gossip to the effect that Gordon Brown is against splitting the Home Office and the inference will be that what the prime minister and John Reid are about is trying to push this through before Gordon Brown takes over."John Denham, the influential former Home Office minister who now chairs the home affairs select committee, said there was a "lot of sense" in the idea - but that it could bring an over-concentration on terrorism.He said: "If you have a home secretary who wakes up every morning worrying about terrorism, the question is who is going to wake up in the morning worrying about antisocial behaviour and that end of the crime and justice spectrum?"Terrorism is very serious, but more people went to bed last night worrying about yobs on the street corner rather than terrorism."Experience from ministries of justice around the world showed that they often became departments "run by lawyers, who see the world through lawyers' eyes and don't want to upset lawyers", said Mr Denham.Paul Cavadino, chief executive of crime reduction charity Nacro, said: "Establishing a ministry of justice is an important step towards achieving a more coherent criminal justice system."Most European countries have long recognised the benefits of bringing responsibility for courts, prosecution, probation and prisons together in a single justice ministry."The penal system will benefit from no longer being managed in a department which also has responsibility for immigration and security.The Prison Reform Trust director, Juliet Lyon, welcomed the news, saying: "The establishment of a ministry of justice could mark the start of a fairer, more balanced criminal justice system with a return to proportionality and fairness in sentencing, a probation service valued for careful case work and management of risk, and prisons back where they belong as places of last resort."
