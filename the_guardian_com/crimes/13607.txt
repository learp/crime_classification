Children as young as 10 may be posing as predatory paedophiles on internet networking sites to frighten boys and girls they have fallen out with, police revealed yesterday. Officers have warned parents and children to be vigilant after as many as nine youngsters in Padstow, Cornwall, were targeted through the networking sites Bebo and MSN.Police initially believed a local man was trying to groom the children by befriending them online and arranging to meet them. But a member of the public has come forward and told them that youngsters are trying to settle playground disputes by posing as a paedophile to frighten their rivals.A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said: "Information from the public has highlighted a possibility that the offenders could be children aged 10 and over, masquerading as a paedophile. The investigations are continuing and at this moment we are looking into every line of inquiry and are not ruling out any possibility. However, the language used on the social networking sites such as Bebo and MSN is at times childish. It could be youngsters playing a sick game to try and intimidate friends they have fallen out with. This will be treated seriously and we will be contacting the families of the children involved and we will try and help them by involving social services."Police urged parents in Cornwall to keep a close eye on the websites their children were looking at. The spokesman added: "We would appeal to anyone who has information about this to please contact us immediately so we can continue with our investigations to get this stopped."A spokesman for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre said: "We have many incidents of cyber-bullying - where children use the internet as a forum to pursue grievances - but have not heard of this happening before. It sounds like a very extreme and worrying course of action."
