To Norfolk police it must have seemed as good an idea as the time two white officers blacked up to take part in a crime reconstruction.But to the street robbery victim the botched attempt to create an e-fit of his Asian attacker was bizarre. Realising that they had no Asian facial features stored in their computer program, officers combined the face of a black man, the nose of a white man and a white woman's hair. "It was farcical," said Hilary Fletcher, from Norwich. "I had a very clear image in my head of what the man looked like, but the result was a disaster. "They said sorry, but they didn't have the program for the Indian subcontinent. "I couldn't believe it when they started putting together features from different parts of the world and trying to change the skin shading. The result looked nothing like the mugger - and not really like any race I'd ever seen before." Mr Fletcher was punched in the face and had his mobile phone stolen in the attack. The gaffe brings further embarrassment for the force, which was widely criticised in 1989 after two white officers blacked up and wore curly wigs to play black armed robbers in a crime reconstruction for television. Mel Lacey, a spokesman for Norfolk police, said yesterday the robbery had revealed a shortcoming. "This issue is being urgently addressed by the purchase of new software to ensure a full range of nationalities and features are available," he said.
