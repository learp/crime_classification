An 88-year-old man yesterday admitted in court stabbing his wife of 60 years to death. Irene Powell, 87, was found dead at the couple's seaside home in Devon with a single stab wound to the chest, cuts to her wrist and head injuries.Her husband, Herbert Powell, claimed it was a mercy killing but police disputed this because of the apparent brutality of the attack.Powell was due to stand trial for murder at Exeter crown court yesterday but at the last moment the prosecution accepted his plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.Police were called after Powell crashed his white Mondeo into the wall of a church in the village of Strete, near Dartmouth, south Devon, in November 2005. Officers took Powell, who had been drinking, back to his house and found his wife's body in their bed. The couple's cat was also dead.Police later discovered Powell had high levels of calcium in his body, which may have caused mood swings and delusions.Neighbours of the Powells, who were churchgoers, were shocked by the killing. One said: "They seemed a nice couple. There was no animosity about them at all."Robert Linford, prosecuting, said: "Regardless of the age of the accused there is the public interest that a person of that age had committed murder and being tried for that offence. This defendant murdered his wife." But the prosecution then reviewed its position and accepted Powell's plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.The judge, Mrs Justice Dobbs, told Powell she was remanding him in custody while reports were prepared before he is sentenced.
