A man charged with criminal damage after a Mark Rothko painting was defaced at London's Tate Modern gallery is to deny the charge, a court has heard.Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, appeared via videolink accused of damaging the famous painting, worth in the region of £50m, to the value of in excess of £5,000.Umaniec, a Polish national, provided a friend's address and spoke only to confirm his personal details at Camberwell Green magistrates court. He sat for the majority of the hearing with his arms folded.The chair of the bench, Vicky Watkins, remanded him in custody until 16 October.Umaniec, an artist who co-founded an artistic movement known as "yellowism", was arrested on Monday and charged last night after the painting was vandalised on Sunday.He is alleged to have stepped over a wire barrier in the art gallery and daubed the Rothko painting, described as priceless, with his name and the words "12 a potential piece of yellowism" before fleeing.The gallery was then put into "operation shutdown" with people prevented from leaving or entering the building.Earlier this year, Rothko's Orange, Red, Yellow sold for £53.8m – the highest price paid for a piece of postwar art at auction. The 1961 painting went under the hammer at Christie's in New York.The defaced painting, called Black on Maroon, was donated to the Tate in 1969 by Rothko himself.
