A 100-year-old woman has been mugged outside her home in London after returning from a prayer meeting.The frail centenarian was pushed to the ground and her handbag, containing between £250 and £300, was stolen in broad daylight after she confronted a man who claimed he was there to do electrical work, Scotland Yard said. Her grandson, who was at her home at the time, chased the attacker as he fled following the robbery in Tottenham, north London, on 23 August, but he managed to escape, the Metropolitan police said. DCI Luke Marks said: “This was a despicable attack on a very elderly lady who lived independently and is now fearful to return home. At 100 years old she had the sense and foresight to dismiss the suspect when he tried to con her into unnecessary electrical work but he then decided to mug her instead.“She is naturally extremely distressed and shaken by what happened and we are appealing for help to catch this man before he targets someone else.” The attack happened at 5pm in Sherboro Road and the victim was taken to hospital as a precaution, but she escaped injury. The man, who had claimed he was there “to do the electrics”, according to detectives, was last seen heading north on to the nearby A10 High Road towards Seven Sisters Road. Police said he was described as white and aged about 35.
