A friend of one of Harold Shipman's alleged victims told the GP's murder trial yesterday she went to the bathroom while having tea with her and returned to find the doctor in the house and her companion dead.The elderly witness, Marion Hadfield, waited in the kitchen of the house in Hyde, Greater Manchester, on March 6, 1995 while Shipman spoke to Marie West, 81, in the next room, Preston crown court was told. Shipman then walked into the kitchen and, surprised to find anyone there, told Mrs Hadfield that Mrs West had collapsed. Shipman told her he was looking for Mrs West's son, Christopher, and then added: "She's collapsed on me." When she asked what could be done, he replied: "No, she's gone." Shipman then telephoned Mrs West's son to tell him of his mother's death. Shipman said he had another call to make, so she stayed until Mr West arrived and left when Shipman came back. Mr West described his mother as "very, very fit". Mr West said: "At first he told me it was a massive stroke. Then he said it was a heart attack." Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, denies murdering Mrs West and 14 other female patients. He has also pleaded not guilty to forging the will of one of his alleged victims, Kathleen Grundy. The trial continues today.
