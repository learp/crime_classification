The Cardiff study that correlates reduced alcohol consumption with the sustained fall in serious violence since 2001 partly explains this happy outcome (Report, 23 April). However, a longer-term factor has been the decline in lead exposure since the 1980s. In skeletons from ancient Rome lead levels were 83 parts per million (ppm); in modern Europeans and Americans they peaked at around 40 ppm in the 1980s. For most people now the level is less than 25 ppm. For younger people, who have had the least exposure, it is usually lower than 10 ppm. Ideally it should be no more than 3 ppm. This reduction in lead exposure has come about because leaded petrol was phased out from 1987; lead water pipes were replaced in the 1980s; the food industry switched from lead-solder-seam cans to welded-seam cans; lead paint was no longer used after 1978; and newspapers no longer imparted dirty fingers and lead residues by the early 1990s. Lead poisoning is associated with aggressive and impulsive behaviour. There is a 20-year lag between reduction of lead intake and reduction in crime levels. While alcohol is undoubtedly a co-factor in violent behaviour, the impact of lead reduction on the fall in violence over the past decade is also an important factor.Craig SamsHastings, East Sussex
