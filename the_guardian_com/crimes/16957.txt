A serious case review has been launched into the death of 12-year-old Tia Sharp, whose body was found at her grandmother Christine Sharp's home in New Addington, south London, last Friday, more than a week after she was reported missing.Stuart Hazell, 37, her grandmother's partner, appeared in court on Monday charged with her murder.Merton council, which has responsibility for Mitcham, where Tia lived with her mother Natalie, said it was standard procedure to carry out a review. Chief executive Ged Curran said: "Our thoughts and condolences go out to all those who knew Tia."The local safeguarding children board will now commission a serious case review, the standard procedure in a tragic case such as this. The review will be assisted by the police, health services and local authorities."Serious case reviews are carried out when a child has died to look at the role played by local agencies in the life of that child and their family. The review aims to find out if any lessons can be learned about ensuring children's safety.The government's guidance on the matter, Working Together To Safeguard Children, states: "The prime purpose of a serious case review (SCR) is for agencies and individuals to learn lessons to improve the way in which they work both individually and collectively to safeguard and promote the welfare of children."The lessons learned should be disseminated effectively, and the recommendations should be implemented in a timely manner so that the changes required result, wherever possible, in children being protected from suffering or being likely to suffer harm in the future."
