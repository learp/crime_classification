Another prisoner has been mistakenly released from a Scottish court by the private security firm Reliance, it emerged yesterday.The company admitted that Joseph Finnan, 20, had been released in error from Hamilton district court on Monday. He was at the court for non-payment of a fine and had been due to be taken by Reliance to the town's sheriff court to face an unconnected charge of assault. It is the third such error since the firm last month took over the Â£126m prison escort contract in the west of Scotland. At the beginning of April, convicted murderer James McCormick, 17, was allowed to walk away from Hamilton sheriff court by Reliance staff and was on the run for two weeks. Opposition politicians yesterday renewed their calls for the Reliance contract to be revoked and for the Scottish justice minister, Cathy Jamieson, to resign. "The public are being put at risk and the justice minister cannot continue to pass the buck," said Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party's justice spokeswoman. "She signed the contract that put Reliance in charge and when things started to go wrong refused to scrap it. "We cannot stand by while more and more prisoners slip through the net. Reliance must be taken off the job immediately." A spokeswoman for the Scottish prison service confirmed that the release had occurred in error and said that a full investigation was under way. A warrant has been issued for Finnan's arrest.
