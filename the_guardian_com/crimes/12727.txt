Mohammed Riaz, whose wife and four daughters were killed in an arson attack on their home in Accrington has died in hospital, Lancashire police said today.Mr Riaz had been pulled from the fire early on Tuesday morning with 50% burns and taken to hospital in Blackburn. He was later transferred to Wythenshawe hospital's specialist burns unit.His wife, Caneze Riaz, 39, and daughters Sayrah, 16, Sophia, 12, Alisha, eight, and Hannah, three, all died in the fire, which ripped through their home early on Tuesday morning. Postmortem examinations showed that all five victims had died in their beds as a result of smoke inhalation.A son, Adam, 17, escaped the fire because he was ill in hospital with leukaemia.Police had been waiting to talk to Mr Riaz after it emerged that the house had been locked up and torched from the inside using accelerants. Mr Riaz had been named as the "top line of inquiry" by detectives.Today they said they were no longer seeking anyone else in connection with the blaze.It emerged that Caneze Riaz had left her husband at home to go out with another man just hours before she was killed in the blaze. Sources say they had visited her son in hospital before having dinner in Manchester.Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell, leading the murder inquiry, said: "We are now investigating a line of inquiry that there has been a breakdown in the relationship between Caneze and Mohammed Riaz."Caneze, described as bubbly and popular, had an arranged marriage to Mr Riaz 20 years ago. She had been extremely active in the local area and was described as a "pillar of the community".Her husband worked in a plastic factory and was 10 years her senior. He was from the north-west frontier region of Pakistan, a strictly Muslim and deeply conservative area bordering Afghanistan.He has been described by neighbours as a "good family man" who was very quiet and did not socialise, other than at his local mosque.One possible motive police have not discounted is that the murders may have been an "honour killing" - when a person is killed by relatives for allegedly disgracing the family name.Prayers were said yesterday for the family at the schools where the children were pupils.
