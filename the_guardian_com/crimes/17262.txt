A heroin and crack addict may have pushed a stranger under a tube train in order to be admitted to a mental hospital "at all costs", the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Stephen Soans-Wade, 36, had been refused admission to psychiatric hospitals after staff said he was not mentally ill. One hospital suspected he was using illicit drugs on the ward and supplying them to patients, the court was told. Christophe Duclos, 37, a security guard, died after being pushed on to the tracks in front of a train at Mile End station, east London, on September 13 2002. Mr Soans-Wade told police he did it because voices told him to, and because a hospital had turned him away. "I went to Whitechapel station and waited half an hour. The trains weren't going fast enough. I have been trying to get into hospital, but they said I was all right." On August 24, he had been turned away from St Thomas's hospital, south London. In a statement, a nurse, Elizabeth Chester, said she could not detect any mental illness in him, but he might have had anti-social personality traits. He had been aggressive when told to collect his methadone heroin substitute from a hospital. Mr Soans-Wade, of Poplar, east London, denies murder. His plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, has not been accepted by the crown. The prosecutor, Vivian Robinson QC, told the jury: "Did he hear voices or was this a calculated act motivated by determination to get himself admitted to hospital at all costs?" The trial was adjourned until Monday, when psychiatrists will give evidence.
