Detectives are still looking for the overseas extremists who communicated via the internet with a "vulnerable" convert to Islam who tried to blow up a restaurant in Exeter, they said today.

Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PACommenting after Mohammad Rashid Abdulaziz Saeed Alim had been jailed for life and told he must serve a minimum of 18 years, Devon and Cornwall police said behind-the-scenes international efforts to identify the men and bring them to justice had focused on Pakistan.Sentencing Saeed Alim at the Old Bailey, the judge said it was "sheer luck or chance" that he did not succeed in his attempt to hurt multiple victims with his homemade nail bomb. The 22-year-old only injured himself when he accidentally set it off in a toilet cubicle during a busy lunchtime at the Giraffe restaurant in Exeter last May.He was encouraged to act by Islamic extremists overseas who contacted him via several websites, the Old Bailey heard."There is still part of the investigation that is ongoing and we are in contact, via the British Embassy, with the Pakistani authorities and that is still a live investigation," said Assistant Chief Constable Debbie Simpson, who led the investigation."We believe there is an association in Pakistan. It remains a live investigation and we are not in a position to confirm the details."But she said Saeed Alim was a self-motivated terrorist who had not been radicalised by anyone else."He was encouraged through literature on the internet and individuals via the internet, but he was self-radicalised," she said.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith told the court: "There is no dispute but that this defendant currently represents a significant risk of serious harm to the public."Saeed Alim has Asperger's syndrome and learning difficulties. His barrister described him as the "least cunning" person ever to have been charged with terrorism.The judge accepted the attack was "an unsophisticated attempt to kill" and the court heard that Saeed Alim, who is known by his previous name Nicky Reilly to friends and family, appeared to be a likeable and law-abiding person with no previous criminal convictions.But Calvert-Smith said: "This sort of crime, albeit thankfully extremely rare in this country, has in the main been committed by people who were not apparently in other respects criminally minded, but they were pursuing, as you were, what they believed to be a religious agenda."He added: "The offence of attempted murder is aggravated by the fact that it was long-planned, that it had multiple intended victims and was intended to terrorise the population of this country. It was sheer luck or chance that it did not succeed in its objectives."In October, Saeed Alim pleaded guilty to attempted murder and preparing an act of terrorism. The Old Bailey heard he had intended to run out into the packed dining area holding three bottles filled with caustic soda, kerosene, and nails to his stomach. But he got stuck in the toilet as he prepared for the attack, and one of the bottles went off before he could leave the cubicle, causing him serious facial injuries and sending dozens of customers fleeing in panic. Covered in blood, he was arrested at the scene.Saeed Alim changed his name in 2004, after converting to Islam between 2002 and 2003. He was soon telling others about his interest in jihad and later began to download videos on bomb-making and martyrdom from YouTube. He also received encouragement in an internet chatroom, the court heard, and considered bombing Plymouth's Charles Cross police station and Drake Circus shopping centre as well as Devonport dockyard.He was intent on becoming a martyr by killing himself and others, writing: "That is my dream."As a teenager, Saeed Alim's height and weight earned him the nickname BFG – the Big Friendly Giant, after the Roald Dahl story. But friends claim his mental health deteriorated after he split up with his first serious girlfriend. He harmed himself and was admitted to local mental health services.In a rambling suicide note written in red ink and left in his bedroom, Reilly described how he was motivated by the "disgusting" behaviour of people in Britain as well as the "war on Islam". He also claimed he had not been brainwashed or indoctrinated.Within hours of the attempted bombing, Devon and Cornwall police said they believed he had been preyed upon and radicalised because he was vulnerable.He shared a small flat in King Street, in a deprived area of Plymouth close to the city centre, with his mother, Kim, her partner and two half-brothers.After Saeed Alim admitted the charges, Kim Reilly said her son had been "brainwashed". He began to change because of "all the people that he was hanging around with", and started to express extreme views, she told the BBC.Today's sentencing was briefly adjourned earlier when she broke down in tears in the public gallery. Afterwards she sat crying on a bench in a courtyard behind the Old Bailey and left without commenting.Saeed Alim's barrister, Kerim Fuad, said his client was not part of any wider conspiracy and had not received any funding for his plan, adding that the "reprehensible" influence of the internet was partly to blame for what had happened."It is a sad and worrying feature of society that someone as vulnerable as this defendant can have unlimited access on the internet to instructions and guidance on the preparation of devices to harm others," Fuad said.He was "seduced" by a cause he "wrongly and almost fatally interpreted and probably never understood".Fuad added: "Had his poor unsuspecting mother not handed him the £10 note that she thought was for him to purchase a CD that morning, he would simply not have had enough money for the bus fare to Exeter."Simpson said the internet remained a potent tool for terrorists, and operators had a responsibility to make sure they did not publish extremist material.
