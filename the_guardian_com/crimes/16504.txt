More than one in four of all teenagers - about 1.25 million of all young people - have committed a criminal offence in the last 12 months, according to a draft official report on youth justice seen by the Guardian.Juvenile crime is now estimated by the Audit Commission to cost the economy more than Â£10bn a year and accounts for nearly a fifth of the total annual cost of crime.The yet to be published report into the youth justice system says the number of known juvenile offenders has actually fallen since a peak in 1992 alongside the drop in overall recorded crime.But it warns that the number of juveniles cautioned or convicted for violence, drug offences and robbery has risen and the number locked away in secure facilities increased steadily during the 1990s before beginning to level off.A draft copy of a separate report on youth justice from the National Audit Office (NAO), Whitehall's spending watchdog, also seen by the Guardian, warns that some youth jails are failing to provide education and other programmes for those in their care.The unpublished NAO report goes on to say that children who are getting some kind of education while they are locked away are only able to continue it when they leave custody in very few areas. The official report identifies this as one of the main reasons why 84% of young offenders released from detention reoffend within two years.The NAO report says the latest unpublished juvenile crime figures show that 268,500 young people aged 10 to 17 in England and Wales were arrested in 2002/03 - about 5% of their age group. This is more than twice the 2.4% arrest rate for the adult population.The courts in England and Wales last year sentenced 93,200 young offenders, of whom 64% received a community sentence, 7% were sent to custody and the remainder were fined or discharged.The Audit Commission inquiry was designed as a follow-up to its 1996 report, Misspent Youth, which found that the existing system for dealing with youth crime was inefficient and expensive, and that services were failing both young offenders and their victims.In response, the government set up the youth justice board in 1998 and a network of youth offending teams to work with juvenile offenders across England and Wales. Ministers also promised to halve the time taken by the courts to deal with young offenders from 142 days to 71 days or fewer. This pledge was met in July 2001.A draft preface to the Audit Commission's report says its research found that five years later "the new arrangements are a significant improvement and a good model for delivering public services" with the youth offending teams critical to their effectiveness.But it also concludes that resources need to be redistributed to focus more on serious and persistent young offenders and that the confidence of the courts and the public in alternatives to custody needs to be improved.The draft Audit Commission report also concludes that schools need to play a more central role in preventing youth offending.The NAO report reaches similar conclusions and highlights recent research which suggests 60% of children excluded from school committed an offence last year, compared with 26% of children at school.It also concludes that the youth justice board (YJB) has made good progress and is beginning to have an impact on reoffending rates.But it says it will have to improve the credibility of higher tariff community sentences for juveniles, which have a reoffending rate of around 60%, if it is to persuade the courts to reduce the number of young people placed in custody."Even a small shift in numbers could release significant resources for prevention work and improving the quality of both community sentences and custodial programmes provided," says the draft NAO report.It says that the courts have welcomed the introduction of a new higher tariff community sentence - the intensive supervision and surveillance programme - but some areas have reported high breach rates with some young offenders being re-sentenced to custody. It also warns it is being used instead of existing community penalties rather than as an alternative to prison. Leader comment, page 19 theguardian.com/crime
