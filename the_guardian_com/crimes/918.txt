The funeral of the murdered schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton took place today, more than 16 years after she disappeared.The remains of the 15-year-old, from Redding, near Falkirk, were found nearly three weeks ago at a house in Margate, Kent.They were discovered alongside those of the student Dinah McNicol, in the former home of Peter Tobin. The 61-year-old Scottish handyman has since been charged with Vicky's murder.Her funeral took place at Redding parish church, a short distance from where she lived at the time of her disappearance.The minister of Redding and Westquarter, the Rev Geoffrey Smart, said the "much loved" teenager was taken from her family by a "terrible act of evil"."All those years when hopes of Vicky's safe return amongst us caused such pain and suffering, worry and anxiety to her family and this community. Yet we know now that throughout the ordeal of these long years Vicky was not only safely in God's loving care, but also reunited with her granny, and also her mum when she sadly died a couple of years after Vicky," he told mourners.After the service, the schoolgirl's body was taken for burial in New Grandsable cemetery in nearby Polmont. She was laid to rest in a plot where her father also wants to be buried.Vicky disappeared while waiting for a bus in Bathgate, West Lothian, in February 1991. It sparked one of Scotland's biggest missing person investigations.Detectives interviewed more than 7,000 people, took 4,000 statements and seized around 12,000 documents. Her remains were unearthed at the Margate property on Monday November 12.
