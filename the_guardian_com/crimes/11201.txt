The culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, said today that the rapist who won a £7m lottery payout should be stopped from receiving his prize.Ms Jowell, who has responsibility for the Lotto, said it was right for the government to intervene in such "a very specific case".She refused to say whether new laws being introduced to stop serving prisoners receiving prizes should be made retrospective to cover cases like that of Iorworth Hoare.But she added: "I don't think that Mr Hoare should receive these lottery winnings."Mr Hoare is 15 years into a life sentence after being convicted of attempted rape in 1989. He was also jailed for a string of sex attacks during the 1970s and 80s.He bought the ticket that won him a share of the £21m Lotto Extra jackpot while on temporary release from a Middlesbrough bail hostel on Saturday.The home secretary, David Blunkett, has indicated that new laws currently before parliament will stop a serving prisoner or their family from benefiting from any win. However, the Home Office has refused to say whether Mr Blunkett plans to make these laws retrospective.But in an interview today with the BBC's World at One programme, Ms Jowell said: "What we can do in a very specific case like this, is to intervene and say that somebody in these circumstances who is a convicted prisoner can't receive lottery winnings - that those winnings should go instead to the benefit of victims."That's the kind of argument we are currently exploring, but I'm not in a position now to tell what the answer to that considered examination is going to be."The shadow culture spokesman, Boris Johnson, disagreed, saying taking the money away from Mr Hoare would not be "Christian". He told the programme: "[Mr Hoare] paid for his ticket fair and square when he was on day release. Several former prisoners have won the lottery. No attempt has been made to deprive them of their earnings. I think it would be wrong to do so just because it is a lottery."Mr Johnson also said he was opposed to any new legislation being made retrospective. "I happen to think it would be wrong to do anything legislative to try to correct this situation," he said.
