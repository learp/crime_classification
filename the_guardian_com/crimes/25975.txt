A man has been arrested following threats made against Jamie Oliver and Rick Stein by an extremist group in Cornwall, where the celebrity chefs have restaurants.Devon and Cornwall police said today that a 36-year-old man from Padstow had been arrested in connection with threats to destroy or damage property.He was arrested on July 4 and was later released on police bail until August 14 when he will have to report to Newquay police station.The police spokesman said officers were conducting parallel inquiries into the alleged threats made to the two chefs.Last month, a group calling itself the Cornish National Liberation Army (CNLA) said in an email that Oliver would be a target because he was "another incomer who has caused the inflation of house and other living costs at Cornish expense".The group's "directing council" also said Oliver's clients and customers were targets.The CNLA accused Stein of being seen to "ride over local democracy" and threatened to burn down one of his businesses in Padstow and target the cars of diners.Oliver shrugged off the threats at the Watergate Bay Fifteen restaurant on the day that his first group of trainee chefs there graduated.He said: "I do not feel threatened by it because actions speak louder than words. I just think the answers to their worries is government, not a couple of poxy chefs."A spokeswoman for Fifteen said of the threats: "We are very surprised and disappointed by the statement because everything about us is Cornish. We are a fifth-generation Cornish business employing large numbers of Cornish staff, we buy huge quantities of food from Cornish fishermen and farmers and ... we are committed to helping 400 disadvantaged young Cornish people over the next 20 years."Though he was born in Oxfordshire, Stein's family has had connections with Cornwall for the best part of a century. His businesses employ more than 200 people and have brought in millions of pounds to the economy.The CNLA, which claimed to include members of the An Gof organisation - militants suspected of a series of attacks in the 1980s, including an explosion at a courthouse in St Austell - also said it would target anyone who flew the flag of St George, which they called "imperialistic and tainted".But police sources said last month they were unclear whether the threats were the work of cranks operating from a spare bedroom or something more serious.Backstory Cornwall has a long history of rebellion. In 1497 an army of Cornishmen marched on London in protest against taxes levied by Henry VII to pay for a war against the Scots. They were defeated at the Battle of Deptford Bridge and the leaders, including the blacksmith Michael An Gof, were hung, drawn and quartered. In the 1980s a group calling itself An Gof, fighting for Cornish independence, claimed responsibility for a blast at a courthouse in St Austell, south Cornwall. They also said they were behind other incidents, but some commentators believe they were simply claiming random crimes as their own. The Cornish National Liberation Army says it is a union of An Gof and the Cornish Liberation Army - a name that adorns many bridges in the area in graffiti demanding a "free Cornwall".
