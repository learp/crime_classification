An official investigation into the integrity of police recorded crime figures in all 43 forces in England and Wales is expected to find "a degree of fiddling", some of it owing to dishonesty, the police watchdog, Tom Winsor, has told MPs.But Winsor, who is Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC), said he had no expectations that the inquiry, which is to issue an interim report in the spring, would conclude that the inaccurate recording of crime by police was owing to "institutional corruption".He told the Commons public administration select committee on Wednesday that the HMIC investigation, which is already under way, would establish the extent to which police recorded crime figures are being fiddled and help answer the "real question" of whether crime was truly falling or the statistics were being fiddled."I have no doubt we will find a degree of fiddling of the figures. The question is to establish the extent to which they are fiddled," said Winsor. He said he thought a lot of it was due to poor supervision, poor leadership and poor training but added that "some of it is about dishonesty".At the same hearing, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, acknowledged that PC James Patrick, who has raised concerns over the integrity of the police crime statistics, was a whistleblower. He said that while there were some inaccuracies in the allegations made by Patrick, "on the whole there's a truth we need to hear".The Met commissioner said an internal inquiry had been launched into 20 claims made by Patrick, which would report in three to six months' time. The police officer who went to the MPs with his claims is also facing disciplinary proceedings for alleged gross misconduct, but Hogan-Howe said he would not be suspended while the investigations were carried out.Patrick has claimed the Met manipulated crime figures to meet its performance targets and crimes such as sexual offences were understated in official figures by up to 25%.Hogan-Howe said ensuring recorded crime figures were accurate was a constant challenge and some of Patrick's claims were worthy of further investigation."Some of them are incomplete. I think he gives one side of the account and you would want to hear a bigger account before you accepted his judgment. On occasion there might be some inaccuracy but I think on the whole there's a truth that we need to hear."He said the "no-criming" of rape and other serious sexual offences had gone down from 20% of cases to 9% but was still a cause of concern. The Met is to review cases involving allegations of serious sexual offences that were "no-crimed" in the past two years in an attempt to establish why that happened.Hogan-Howe said the complexity of the crime-recording rules – they run to more than 600 pages – and problems with technology may be partly to blame for the flaws in the recorded crime figures but he was determined to ensure their integrity
