The death of 15-year-old Isobel Reilly, after she took a cocktail of drugs at a party, was hugely unlucky as well as terribly tragic. The drugs, according to the inquest, were found after her friend and hostess, 14-year-old Beatrice Hadjipateras, had searched in her parents' bedroom for them. The father, academic Brian Dodgeon, was arrested for possession of illegal drugs. But he was also arrested for child abandonment – which seems to me absurd. He's on bail now, still under suspicion of both.Not many people are likely to have sympathy if it turns out Dodgeon kept drugs – reportedly LSD, ecstasy and ketamine – in the same house as a teenage party. Liberal attitudes to drugs are understandable. I hold them myself. But there would be a huge difference between talking honestly with your own children about complicated issues, and letting them know, even inadvertently, that you're a current user, with a stash secreted about the place.Dodgeon jumped off a bridge into a road on Tuesday, in an apparent attempt to kill himself that left him with two broken legs. Nevertheless, if the drugs were his, this would be an occurrence that cries out for lessons to be learned, rather than punishments meted out.The moral would not be: "Lock up your daughters." Not even: "Lock up the fathers of daughters who lead your daughter fatally astray." But rather: "Lock up your mind-altering substances, legal or otherwise." Practical approaches limit drug tragedies, not moral strait-jackets.
