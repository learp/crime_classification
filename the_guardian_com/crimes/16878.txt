A Northern Ireland teenager was charged today with the murder of the police constable Stephen Carroll earlier this month.The 17-year-old appeared at Lisburn magistrates court shortly before 11am today to face four charges, including murder, possession of an AKM assault rifle and 26 rounds of ammunition, gathering intelligence likely to be of use to terrorists, and membership of the Continuity IRA.The youth, who cannot be named because of his age, denied all the charges, according to his solicitor.PC Carroll, 48, was shot dead as he answered a call for help in Craigavon on 9 March. He was the first Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer to be murdered by terrorists.The Continuity IRA said it had shot the police officer in the back of the head as he sat in an unmarked patrol car at Lismore Manor.Yesterday two men aged 27 and 31 were released without charge after being arrested last week. Four other people are still being held over the fatal shooting, which came two days after two soldiers were killed at Massereene army barracks in Antrim. They were Sappers Mark Quinsey, 23, and Patrick Azminkar, 21.Meanwhile, eight people being held over the three murders by dissident republicans in recent weeks have won high court permission to challenge their continued detention.Four are being questioned about the murder of Sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azminkar, the others over PC Carroll's murder.The men claim that their detention for an extra seven days breaches their right to liberty under EU human rights laws.The case will now be examined in a full judicial review hearing.None of the six, one of whom is the prominent republican Colin Duffy, has been charged.After receiving written details of her decision, a three-judge panel headed by Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Kerr ruled that the six applicants had put forward an arguable case.Granting leave to apply for a judicial review, Sir Brian said: "It is our view that this raises points which are worthy of further consideration in a substantive application."
