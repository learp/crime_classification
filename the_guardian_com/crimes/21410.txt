A Â£500,000 advertising campaign is to be launched next week in men's magazines, on radio and with posters in toilets in urban pubs and clubs stressing that men need to make sure a woman has agreed to sex to avoid any accusation of rape.The Home Office campaign is designed to help tackle rape by educating young men about the need for consent before sex."Giving consent is active, not passive, and it's up to everyone to make sure that their partner agrees to sexual activity," a Home Office spokeswoman said.The advertising campaign follows the introduction of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act, which emphasised the importance of adults agreeing to sex and having the freedom and capacity to make a choice.New measures are being considered by the government to try to drive up the low conviction rate for rapes, including a proposal to allow expert witnesses to be called in rape cases to explain the behaviour of victims.The solicitor-general, Mike O'Brien, also disclosed yesterday that a change in the rape laws is being considered to require juries to decide whether a woman who has consumed too much alcohol is too drunk to give her consent.Concern grew over the low conviction rate in rape cases last year after Home Office research showed that only 5.6% of reported cases ended in the rapist being convicted.Mr O'Brien said yesterday that further changes in the law might be needed to deal with the question of whether a woman had drunk too much to give consent in order to stop cases being thrown out."It may be that the legislation needs some clarification, because these sorts of mistakes shouldn't be being made. I do think there have been cases in which some extremely well-qualified judges and barristers have taken a view on the law which was not the intention of parliament," the solicitor-general told the BBC.A survey commissioned by Amnesty International found that more than a quarter of people in the UK believed a woman was at least partly responsible for being raped if she was drunk.The government is to publish proposals this month to reverse the fall in the rape conviction rate. The measures are expected to include the introduction of expert witnesses in court to explain the behaviour of rape victims.It is also likely to propose that victims be allowed to give evidence by pre-recorded video so that they do not have to confront the man who raped them and relive the experience in court.The Home Office research found that out of 11,766 allegations of rape only 655 ended in a conviction.
