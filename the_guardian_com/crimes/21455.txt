The storyCelebrity sweepAfter three days of riots, hundreds of Londoners reclaimed the streets on Tuesday, armed with brooms, bags, gloves – and a sprinkling of stardust. Singer-songwriters Emmy the Great and Kate Nash were spotted in Westbourne Grove and Clapham, while the Kaiser Chiefs' sterling work in the south of the city earned them the nickname the Kaiser Sweeps. The clean-up campaign, masterminded by Worthing-based artist Dan Thompson, also drew in Sam Duckworth of Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly. The Twitter account that he launched, @RiotCleanup, now has more than 87,000 followers.The stat1, 2, 3, 4 …Counting began in Sri Lanka's first elephant census for almost a century. Conservation groups are boycotting it, saying it's really an attempt to identify healthy animals for use in tourism and heavy labour. Numbers, estimated at between 5,000 and 7,000, have fallen by two thirds since the last count.The quoteTariq Jahan"Blacks, Asians, whites. We all live in the same community. Why do we have to kill one another? What started these riots, and what's escalated them? Why are we doing this? I lost my son. Step forward if you want to lose your sons. Otherwise, calm down and go home. Please!" Jahan's son died in the Birmingham riots.The tweet@LizJonesSomaliaAfter a week and a half in Somalia, Daily Mail columnist Liz Jones was ready to leave. "I'm looking forward to being at home so I can go to the toilet," she tweeted. "They're so dirty out here I've been holding it in all week." She was also "looking forward to being home with my cats, digs, chickens and horses. While the people in Somalia are nice, I really missed conversation." It wasn't the real Jones, but a spoof account. What started as a joke became serious, as appeals in the tweets raised more than £27,000 for famine relief.
