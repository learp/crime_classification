David Davis's pledges to drop identity cards and use the money saved to build 1,200 more prison places is a dramatic political "eyecatcher" that manages to sound tough and tender at the same time.But when it comes to making the sums add up, law and order policies always seem to turn out more expensive than you first thought.The promise to cancel the national identity cards project with its £5.75bn price tag may sound enough to build an entire new generation of prisons but public finances are never that simple.The cost of the ID cards scheme is spread over 10 years, and so on the most optimistic forecast a decision to cancel it would save £575m a year.Prison places do not come cheap - £100,000 builds you a place in a new category B prison with a running cost of £40,000 a year on top - and so the pledge to build 1,200 more prison places will take up a significant slice of the savings from the ID cards scheme.On top of this the government has already promised to build 9,000 more prison places. Ministers have set aside the money to build them but not yet earmarked the extra money to run them.The Conservatives are keen to make sure that the figures add up and so David Cameron has so far only made the limited law and order promise of closing down the "end of custody scheme" under which non-violent prisoners leave jail 18 days early which was introduced earlier this year to cope with record prison numbers.Mr Cameron say that this will stop 25,000 prisoners being let out onto the streets - not mentioning that they will get out 18 days later anyway.But in terms of the maths of the daily prison population of 81,000 - that translates into an extra 1,200 prison places - exactly the number the Conservative leader has promised today will be built out of savings from the ID cards scheme.It leaves little room for further promises to jail more criminals and demonstrates just how expensive this law and order business is.
