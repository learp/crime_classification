Not many people who have been fined £400 for driving at 99mph on a motorway have a chance to reform the law. Harriet Harman is an exception. As a minister in the law officers' department, she is at the heart of the criminal justice system, monitoring the performance of the crown prosecution system and advising the attorney general. If the Harman case was placed on her desk, what would she be saying, with her solicitor general's hat on?The defendant, who was caught by a laser detector on the M4, was driving in bright weather. In the words of her solicitor, she had been driving for 26 years without a blemish. But there was no reason for the defendant to exceed the 70mph limit. She was not on an emergency dash, only driving her son back to university. She would be familiar with official road-safety campaign slogans - Speed Kills - and of the research backing it up. The maximum penalty for her offence is £2,500, plus up to six penalty points, or a ban. Even the AA, ardent defender of motorists, described her £400 fine and seven-day driving ban as "on the lenient side". It was more than that. You can get fined £400 for driving at 40mph in a 30mph area. A £400 fine for 29mph over a motorway limit might be appropriate for someone on median income (£19,150), but the defendant earns almost six times as much: £115,989. Courts are meant to relate fines to income, but many do not. Ironically, on the same day that Ms Harman received her lenient fine, the chief inspector of probation was telling MPs how a unit fine system would make the penalty more effective. The scheme, linking fines to income, proved a success in pilot schemes (fairer, fewer arrears, fewer people sent to prison for default), but was abandoned just months after it went nationwide in 1993, because the pilot formula had changed. Now is the time to bring it back, on the original formula. Ms Harman should lead the calls for reform.
