An innovative prison radio station run mainly by prisoners has been praised by Cherie Booth, who yesterday presented diplomas to men who graduated from a BTEC course run at the jail. She was at Wandsworth prison to present the awards after launching the station, Radio Wanno, in January.The success will be welcome as it comes in a week when Wandsworth, the largest jail in England and Wales, has come under heavy criticism from the the chief inspector of prisons. The latest inspectorate report said Wandsworth had fallen far short of basic standards of decency for the majority of the 1,460 prisoners in the south London jail. The inspectorate found that, on most indicators, standards had slipped further since a critical inspection 16 months ago. Ms Booth returned to the jail yesterday to hand out the diplomas to prisoners who graduated from the BTEC radio course run in association with Lambeth College. Addressing two men who had been accepted into Goldsmiths College, to do a three year media and communications degree, she said that while she was proud of the educational achievements of her own children, she was equally proud of what the two men had achieved. She told the Wandsworth students that what they achieved - in six months - was "quite extraordinary." Mark, 34, who was released from Wandsworth in April, said that the project had given prisoners the opportunity to express themselves in a way that he had not experienced before. David Noble, head of creative studies at Lambeth College, said the the pass rates achieved by the Wandsworth students were well above the national average for the course.
