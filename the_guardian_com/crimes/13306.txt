A suicidal man who burst into a leading Conservative's office and slashed his wrists, spraying the room with blood, was today convicted of criminal damage.Robert Corcoran, who described himself as a former Mensa member and one-time champion cyclist, also hacked at his throat and cut his legs as Sir Malcolm Rifkind's staff hid behind the door. Blackfriars crown court, in London, heard that, as police arrived, Corcoran was in the process of using his blood to daub slogans on the surgery walls.The 43-year-old, who had been upset about having being deported from the US for overstaying his visa, had insisted that blood splashes did not amount to criminal damage.He added that, if he was wrong, he had not intended to cause any, but his arguments were rejected and he was found guilty as charged. Judge Gregory Stone QC adjourned the case for six weeks for pre-sentence and psychiatric reports. He said Corcoran could remain on bail but warned he was not allowed to contact the Conservative association, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Sir Malcolm or his staff. The three-day trial heard how the defendant stormed into the Chelsea Manor Street office, in central London, last December. He had been hoping to give the MP - who was not there at the time - a letter.When staff tried to usher Corcoran out, he pulled out a Stanley knife and turned it on himself.The politician's election agent, Jonathan Fraser-Howles, told the court: "He was very agitated, and when I opened the door he was slitting open his wrists. "My first response was the safety of myself and the staff. I left the room and shut the door behind me. Then I moved to a safe area and called for assistance."The court heard Sir Malcolm's office had to be re-carpeted, while the kitchen lino and much of the furniture had to be replaced because of bloodstains.
