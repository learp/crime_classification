It probably seemed like a good idea at the time, but two young Irish men were being questioned by police today after stealing a fishing trawler to sail home after missing the last ferry from north Wales.The pair, aged 18 and 20, took the 30ft inshore trawler, Le-Bon Heur, from the port at Holyhead, Anglesey, on Saturday night after missing the last boat to Dublin.According to one report, after several hours at sea the men realised they were lost and called what they believed was the Irish coastguard for help.In fact, they had been mainly sailing in circles and were just 12 miles north of where they started, meaning they were rescued by Holyhead's lifeboat service, with an RAF helicopter also scrambled."It was evident they didn't know what they were talking about," a coastguard spokesman said."They were totally disoriented, they didn't know any nautical terminology whatsoever, and they were quite frightened."After being held briefly by north Wales police, the men were released with a caution, only to be re-arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage after Paul Jones, the vessel's owner, made a complaint."The police let them go with a caution at first because they said it was their first offence and they were not from the UK," he said."I couldn't believe it. The police are giving a green light for people from Ireland to simply grab the nearest boat and try to sail home if they miss the ferry. "They were only re-arrested because I spotted them the next day in Holyhead and ran after them. The police had let them go before the damage to the boat was properly assessed."They have obviously thrashed the engine, because there wasn't a drop of oil left in the sump."Mr Jones said he could be without his boat for more than a month during a key time of year for fishing.
