The mother of Scarlett Keeling, the British teenager killed in Goa, has been warned she may have to give evidence from prison by video to the trial of the two men accused of manslaughter.Fiona MacKeown is awaiting sentencing in the UK for benefit fraud, but is hoping to travel to India to attend the trial.She has been warned by a judge in the UK that she is likely to be given a custodial sentence. Today a state prosecutor in Goa, SR Rivankar, said there were no plans to take her evidence early, even if that meant she had been jailed before she could testify.Rivankar said MacKeown was listed at number 25 in the running order of witnesses and the trial in Goa would not be influenced by court proceedings in the UK. "She can give evidence by video from prison if necessary," he said.Rivankar said he planned to take evidence in chronological order.MacKeown has been critical of the police handling of the investigation into the death of her 15-year-old daughter, accusing the authorities of staging a show trial and claiming that the two men are unlikely to be convicted.The initial police inquiry concluded that Keeling, from Bideford in Devon, drowned accidentally in the sea at Anjuna in the north of the state. A second investigation, launched after pressure from her family, found that she had been attacked and raped. Tests showed she had consumed drugs including cocaine and LSD on the night she died.The second day of the trial of Samson D'Souza and Placido Carvalho offered little hope for a speedy resolution, despite assurances from the children's court in the state capital Panaji that the case would be fast tracked.The court had already agreed to hear evidence only on alternate afternoons and, after two false starts last month, today's hearing was further delayed by the court's decision to take lengthy evidence in another trial before resuming.When the case finally got under way, a police constable, Vishant Chopdekar, told the court that on the morning of 18 February 2008 he was sent to Anjuna beach to investigate a report of a body in the sea.He said he found the teenager lying on her stomach on the edge of the water with her right cheek on the sand. Her bra was pulled up and the sea was splashing over her body.Chopdekar said he and a colleague moved the body out of the water and then informed their superiors. He was challenged by the defence over when the body was moved and when senior officers were informed, but could not explain discrepancies in statements made several weeks apart.The defence lawyers also questioned why pages appeared to be missing from the police station diary, suggesting that the official account had been fabricated. The judge dismissed the challenge, pointing out that the pages were extracts from the full diary.D'Souza, 28, and Carvalho, 36, face charges including culpable homicide, sexual assault, outraging modesty and destroying evidence.The trial continues.
