Government claims that victims of crime are at the centre of the criminal justice system are a "damaging misrepresentation of reality", a committee of MPs said today.Ministers who tell victims the system is being "re-balanced" in their favour are likely to leave them disappointed, the House of Commons justice committee said.Their report, a wide-ranging examination of the role of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales, dismisses attempts to portray prosecutors as "victims' champions".Instead, the CPS should be an "independent arbiter" representing the public interest.The report concluded: "The prosecutor's role in relation to victims ... seems to be generally misunderstood."The prosecutor is not able to be an advocate for the victim in the way that the defence counsel is for the defendant, yet government proclamations that the prosecutor is the champion of victims' rights may falsely give this impression."Telling a victim that their views are central to the criminal justice system, or that the prosecutor is their champion, is a damaging misrepresentation of reality."Expectations have been raised that will inevitably be disappointed."The committee calls on the attorney general, Lady Scotland, to conduct a review of charging decisions, amid concerns prosecutors may be opting for lesser charges in order to secure a conviction.Police officers told the committee some prosecutors were "risk averse" to hit conviction targets.The MPs concluded that perceptions of over or under-charging were "damaging to public confidence".And they warned against drifting into wider use of plea-bargaining, in which prosecutors negotiate with the defendant over charge and likely sentence."Expanding the use of plea-bargaining would have significant consequences and in our opinion needs the utmost care and consideration," they said.The committee was also "deeply concerned" by prosecutors' treatment of victims and witnesses with mental health problems, who were often not seen as potential witnesses.They called for special measures to be put in place to help them fulfil that role.Earlier this week, the head of the CPS, the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, published two new policy statements aimed at ensuring access to justice for witnesses and victims with mental health problems.Starmer said: "Fair, fearless and effective; open, honest and transparent; protective, supportive and independent: these are the qualities that the public has a right to expect of its public prosecution service. We are determined to meet those expectations."The attorney general said: "Working with the prosecutors, I will study the report's detailed recommendations carefully and respond formally in due course."The attorney general's spokesman added that the CPS's role "has greatly developed in explaining prosecution decisions to victims and supporting them in giving their best evidence, while still making it clear that it has to take objective and professional prosecution decisions based on the evidence and the wider public interest."
