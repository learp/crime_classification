Emergency measures to hold prisoners in police cells have come into force as jails in England and Wales approach full capacity, the Home Office said today.Nineteen police forces were ready to hold prisoners in up to 240 cells initially, said a Home Office spokeswoman, who confirmed that so-called Operation Safeguard came into force on Saturday. A list of the 19 affected areas was not immediately available.The jail population reached 79,714 today - still 65 below the all-time high of two weeks ago. But putting prisoners in police cells was necessary in some parts of the country as overcrowded jails reached breaking point.The home secretary, John Reid, had accepted that the move was "necessary and pragmatic", the spokeswoman said."A number of prisoners are being held in police cells under Safeguard but the number changes daily," she added.She said the operation could be expanded to a total of 520 police cells through October and November."The number of cells has been agreed with chief constables, who have used their operational judgment as to how many cells they can staff and make available," the spokeswoman said."The Home Secretary has accepted that this is a necessary and pragmatic response, and will keep this under close review." Earlier this month, Mr Reid faced criticism after unveiling plans to create space in the jails by offering foreign criminals packages worth up to Â£2,500 to leave Britain.Helen Edwards, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, has authorised the formal use of police cells to manage short-term pressures on the prison population.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said tonight: "This is a short-term and costly measure that will only buy the home secretary a few weeks and will place even more burdens on our police."We have only had to resort to it because of the government's utter failure to address the chronic lack of capacity in our prisons."Juliet Lyon, the director of the watchdog Prison Reform Trust, accused Mr Reid of acting in "desperation"."We look to a home secretary for strategic leadership to make sure that there are enough prison places for serious and violent offenders, not desperation and pragmatism that wastes police time and public money locking up petty criminals, addicts and the mentally ill in police stations."The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "This crisis will have a direct effect on public safety because education and training to turn prisoners away from crime cannot work properly in police cells, or in our now hopelessly overcrowded prisons."Prison cells are enormously expensive, and looking after prisoners will be a huge distraction for the police."He said the situation was the result of "inexcusable incompetence" by a series of Labour home secretaries.
