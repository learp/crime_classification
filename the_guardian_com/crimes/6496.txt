Amy Winehouse was spared jail today when she appeared in court to plead guilty to assaulting the manager of Milton Keynes theatre.The 26-year-old singer admitted she had drunk too much when she pulled Richard Pound's hair and called him a "fucking cunt". after he had told her she couldn't have another alcoholic drink while attending a pantomime before Christmas.Winehouse appeared in Milton Keynes magistrates court under her married name, Amy Civil, but without her wedding ring.Her lawyer, Paul Morris, asked the judge for leniency because the incident had had a "huge effect" on her drinking, which she had taken steps to curb. He produced a letter from Winehouse's GP as proof of her change in attitude.Dressed in a short grey skirt, white blouse and pink ballet pumps, Winehouse spoke in a quiet voice to plead guilty to one count of common assault and another of disorderly behaviour.Morris said she had "apologised profusely" and pointed out that the incident happened out of view and earshot of families and children who were watching the pantomime.Winehouse would have never behaved that way in front of children, he added.The judge, Peter Crabtree, gave her a two-year conditional discharge, and ordered her to pay £100 in compensation to Pound, as well as £85 costs.He warned her that although she had been spared a fine, the punishment he had chosen might be more painful."It might be harder than if you had a fine because you have to stay on the straight and narrow for two years now," he said.He noted that she although Winehouse had no previous convictions, she had two cautions for similar offences.The court heard that Winehouse had drunk five vodka and cokes before going to the theatre on 19 December to see a friend appear in Cinderella, alongside Mickey Rooney and Anthea Turner.During the first half, Winehouse joined in the audience participation in a "spirited manner", before a member of the audience asked her to be quiet, the prosecutor, Julian Vickery, told the court.Pound then escorted her party to a private box. During the second half, Pound offered to show Winehouse the way to the toilet. When they passed the theatre bar, she greeted the bar staff and asked for a double vodka and coke. Pound suggested she should have a glass of water instead."She felt hurt and patronised and embarrassed by this reply," Vickery told the court, which led to her grabbing Pound's hair and pulling it.She was heard muttering "fucking cunt" through the toilet cubicle, but when she emerged, she apologised to Pound."Mr Pound commented that she had had too much to drink and she should leave," said Vickery. In response, Winehouse said: "Who the fuck do you think you are?"
