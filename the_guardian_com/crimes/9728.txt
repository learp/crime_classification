A British businessman was today sentenced to 15 years in prison by a Dubai court after he was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend.Mark Arnold, from Stoke-on-Trent, was charged with the murder of South African Kerry Winter after a neighbour reported seeing him attack her.The 43-year-old admitted that he had attacked Winter after a "misunderstanding" in August 2008, the court heard, but denied her murder.Winter's body was never found. Arnold claimed she was still alive and had faked her death to get back at him after he ended their relationship. Prosecutors in Dubai accused him of dumping her body at sea.The British embassy in Dubai said he had faced a possible sentence of death by firing squad if convicted.In September, Arnold told reporters from his prison cell that he and Winter had argued over money, but he did not know what happened to her.Winter was last heard from on the evening of 20 August 2008 when she phoned her friend Jo Brown to say Arnold had followed her to a hotel.Her relatives said Arnold told them he had beaten her up and kept changing his story about where he had left her. The family alleged that he had been harassing her since their five-year relationship ended in May 2008.Arnold, who also previously lived in London, was working as an operations manager at the interior design firm Hamilton International. He flew to Britain two days after Winter's disappearance. He was arrested when he returned to Dubai three days later.It is understood that both Arnold and prosecutors can appeal against the sentence.
