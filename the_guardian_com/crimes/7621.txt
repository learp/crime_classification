The halcyon days where a copper could clip a trouble-maker round the ear without it being filmed on a passerby's mobile phone are to be celebrated in a museum that opened today in west London.Ancient truncheons, handcuffs and the uniform worn by the first TV cop, Dixon of Dock Green, are all on display at the Met Collection, which will also act as a recruiting centre for the police.The uniforms worn by peelers when police numbers on the shoulder were not a major issue and methods of communication before radio will be on display in the Met's first big venture into the heritage industry.With some artefacts dating back to 1829, and archive photographs of the early days at Scotland Yard, the aim is to present a positive face at a time when the Met might be feeling beleaguered over criticism of its handling of the G20 demonstrations and allegations of credit card fraud and unconventional interrogation methods.The museum will not feature items from the so-called Black Museum, or the Crime Museum to give it its correct title, at Scotland Yard, such as death masks and the stove on which murderer Denis Nilsen boiled the remains of his victims. But there will be a selection of items from almost two centuries of policing in the capital.Maggie Bird, curator of the Met Collection, said: "We will rotate some of the 15,000 items from the police archives, including old maps of London and a world war II display."Kit Malthouse, vice chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), which gave the green light to the Â£140,000 venture, said: "The Met Collection is a fantastic resource that has for too long been hidden from public view. The MPA and the mayor share the ambition to create a world class 'blue light' museum in the capital."Admission is free and the museum will be open between 10am and 4pm on weekdays.
