Two brothers aged 10 and 11 were remanded to secure care by a district judge yesterday charged with attempting to murder two boys and robbing them of a mobile phone and Â£5 in cash.During an hour-long hearing at the youth court in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, the boys sat in the glass-fronted dock flanked by two security officers, with a third guard between them.The brothers are alleged to have carried out what has been described as a prolonged assault last Saturday in Edlington, Doncaster, on the boys, aged nine and 11. The boys are making a slow recovery from serious injuries said to have been inflicted by bricks, a knife and cigarettes.In court yesterday the older brother wore a red England football shirt while his younger brother, who was wearing a grey Umbro T-shirt, strained to see over the bar of the glass-fronted dock.The pair stood only to answer some brief formal questions from District Judge Jonathan Bennett.They both remained expressionless as all eight charges were read in turn. Each of the brothers faces four charges of trying to kill and rob the two other boys.Both confirmed their dates of birth to district judge Jonathan Bennett and agreed they understood the charges. There was no application for bail and they were remanded into secure accommodation. They will next appear in the same court on 14 April.The boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were recently placed in foster care by Doncaster children's services, whose senior management was replaced last month by the children's secretary, Ed Balls.The brothers were arrested on Saturday at allotments in Edlington. The two boys had been attacked in Edlington at Brick Ponds, a semi-wild area on the site of a former brickworks, quarry and railway line.The older victim was on a ventilator for two days in the intensive care unit at Sheffield children's hospital where he was airlifted after being found semi-conscious with life-threatening head injuries.The younger victim, a nephew of the older boy, has had two operations on a deep knife wound to his arm.He was found wandering on the housing estate where he lives, dazed and covered in blood.His parents have been at his bedside and the family of the older boy, who has lived with his father since his mother died, have been with him. Both families thanked neighbours and the police for their support.Police are investigating other recent incidents at Brick Ponds including an attack on an 11-year-old local choirboy, Callam Reynolds.His mother, Kerry Reynolds, 37, said yesterday that two boys had lured her son into an isolated part of the area."They kicked Callam in the face, punched him and stamped on him," she said. "He was bleeding from where his teeth had ripped the side of his mouth. They threatened to hit him over the head with a brick and throw him in the Brick Pond."
