Laura Barcella claims that the big American pharmacy chain CVS "is helping to stigmatise contraception" by keeping condoms in a locked cabinet in some of its Washington, DC locations. "Perhaps that's the intention," she writes, "scaring folks straight, dissuading them from anything remotely close to healthy sexuality, and promoting the hackneyed notion that sex is wrong."Oh, please. Does anyone really think that a big American company, driven by Wall Street's demands for quarterly earnings gains, would try to discourage the sale of its products? And if CVS is so opposed to sex, why does it display so many magazine covers featuring attractive and buxom women?The condoms are locked up in stores where they're likely to be stolen. This is certainly a business decision: the company has weighed the cost of sales lost to embarrassment against the cost of theft, and has decided to lock up condoms in high-crime stores. A company spokesman told the Washington Post that in stores reporting high theft, the company permits managers to lock up not just condoms but other high-theft items like hair-care products, baby formula and pregnancy tests.If Barcella and the Alan Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood and the Whitman-Walker Clinic are so sure that CVS is unnecessarily worried about crime, they should open their own drug stores in high-crime neighbourhoods, put everything out on the shelf, and prove that that's the profitable decision.But big capitalist companies practising puritanism (in a small number of their stores)? It is to laugh.
