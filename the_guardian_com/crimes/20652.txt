Cherie Booth QC has endorsed a call to close some prisons and hand the management of the rest of the prison system in England and Wales over to local communities.The final report from the two-year Commission on English Prisons Today says that a significant cut is needed in the 84,000 prison population, with community-based punishments replacing short-term prison sentences.Booth, who served on the commission set up by the Howard League for Penal Reform, said she hoped the report would provide "a road-map" for long-term and fundamental reform: "The commission proposes that justice is more local. Crucially, more widespread use of effective community sentences would both allow us to reduce the use of prison and allow for reinvestment of resources into local communities to cut offending."She said that the "unrestrained and irresponsible penal excess" over the past 15 years, during which prison numbers have nearly doubled from 45,000, was no longer sustainable in the face of the current public spending squeeze."This is a significant moment to consider what should happen in prison policy when vital choices have to be made about future public spending against a background where money is woefully short." The report says over the past decade the prison system has become "bloated and dysfunctional over a prolonged period of economic growth".The commission comprised leading criminologists, prison and probation professionals, and it reported that spending on the criminal justice system as a whole was Â£22.7bn in 2008, more than one-third higher than 1998.It says that it is now highly questionable that the system can carry on this "restless expansion" and that even using "technocratic fixes" such as early-release schemes will no longer prove affordable.The report acknowledges that such localism could prove a vehicle for some of the nastiest forms of punitive populism but says that tendencies, such as an enthusiasm for asbos, are often driven by Whitehall policies. The commission believes that with local councils in the lead local criminal justice, health and education staff would co-operate to ensure that far more effective community-based justice initiatives were used to cut crime.The prisons minister, Maria Eagle, welcomed the report, saying it would provide the basis of a lively, ongoing debate, but reminded its authors that the government must provide sufficient prison places to accommodate all those sent to prison by the courts.
