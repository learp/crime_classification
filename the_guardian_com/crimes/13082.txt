There is a whiff of xenophobia about how the story of foreign national prisoners is being discussed and reported. There appears to be an assumption that all foreign national prisoners should be deported (900 foreign criminals go missing, April 26). In fact, many foreign national prisoners will have legitimate rights to British residency, they will have families in this country and some will have dual nationality.Given that out of all the cases of foreign national prisoners that the Home Office looked at in 2004 and 2005 only just over half were deported or removed, it would be fair to assume that of the hundreds who have slipped through the net and are now in the community, many have the right to legitimately remain in the UK.The real story at the heart of this matter is the way the prison and immigration authorities have, for many years, regarded foreign-national prisoners as undeserving second-class inmates, who have had their rights disregarded. If there was adequate immigration and legal advice available in prison, the current systemic failings could have been avoided. Enver Solomon Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, King's College LondonHow difficult can it be for the home secretary to deal with foreign nationals who have broken our laws? They are under lock and key - just do the paperwork before the release date and then put them on a plane. This is the same home secretary who is planning to compel us to carry ID cards, predicted to have a massive cock-up factor. Charles Clarke is beyond parody. Resigning would be too good for him: deport him, I say. Caroline Westgate Hexham, Northumberland
