Newspapers have been granted the right to "name and shame" young people who have been punished by a court for anti-social behaviour under new laws.It will mean papers such as the Sun will be able to continue their "Shop a yob" campaign without complaints that publishing pictures of tearaway youths was encouraging a lynch mob mentality.Automatic reporting restrictions imposed on youth courts have been lifted, leaving newspapers free to report the names of young offenders who are the subject of anti-social behaviour orders.Under the Anti-social Behaviour Act, which comes into force today, the press can also report the terms of an order, including any prohibitions imposed on youths, and any evidence presented to the court about their anti-social actions.Reporting restrictions will still apply to criminal proceedings involving young people, although courts have discretionary powers to impose or move restrictions where they think appropriate.Children's right campaigners have raised fears about the "naming and shaming" of young people, warning that such newspaper reports are "labelling them rather than dealing with them".The Sun launched its "Shop a yob" campaign last year, when it published names and photographs of youngsters who had anti-social behaviour orders against them.The policy adviser to the Children's Rights Alliance for England, Terri Dowty, warned at the time that the campaign "smacked a little of lynch mob mentality"."This is a punitive measure. It's labelling them rather than actually dealing with them in a way that will guarantee they won't offend in the future," Ms Dowty said.However, police officers gave their backing to the Sun's campaign, and the newspaper defended its actions, revealing that a hotline set up by the paper for readers to name and shame people in their community had been flooded with calls.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
