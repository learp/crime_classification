A man appeared in court today charged with the murder of a vicar outside his home in Wales earlier this week.Geraint David Evans, 23, from Trecynon, near Aberdare, South Wales, is accused of killing Father Paul Bennett in the grounds of his vicarage at St Fagan's church in Trecynon.Fr Bennett, a 59-year-old father of two, died from multiple stab wounds on Wednesday afternoon.Mr Evans, who has dark hair and a beard and wore a black tracksuit top, spoke only to confirm his name and address during the brief hearing at Aberdare magistrates court. His solicitor, Denny Bryant, made no application for bail, and he was remanded in custody to appear at Merthyr crown court on March 23. In a statement yesterday, Fr Bennett's family said: "Paul was a loyal son and a devoted husband, father and grandfather, who spent his whole life putting the thoughts and feelings of others ahead of his own. "He lived his life for his people and cared deeper than anyone can imagine for his church. We loved him dearly and cannot imagine life without him. All we can hope and pray for is that he hasn't lost his life in vain." Mourners of all ages from the close-knit communities within the parish gathered yesterday to share their grief and remember Fr Paul. More than 100 people visited the church hall in Trecynon to sign a book of condolence and lay flowers. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, described Fr Paul's death as an "appalling shock". "Fr Paul's family will be especially in our prayers here at Lambeth [Palace] as they come to terms with this terrible tragedy," he said.
