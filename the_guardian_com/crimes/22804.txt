Scotland Yard's counter-terrorist unit was last night investigating an Islamist website that appears to incite its users to attack MPs who voted for the Iraq war.The website, called Revolutionmuslim.com, was visited by the radicalised student Roshonara Choudhry, who was jailed for life this week for stabbing the MP Stephen Timms.It has published a list of the 395 MPs who voted for the Iraq war in 2003 and called on Muslims to "raise the knife of jihad" against them. Many of those listed are no longer MPs.It states: "We ask Allah for her [Choudhry's] action to inspire Muslims to raise the knife of jihad against those who voted for the countless rapes, murders, pillages, and torture of Muslim civilians as a direct consequence of their vote."The revelation that the website was part of the "inspiration" for Choudhry's assassination attempt was made in extracts from her police testimony published by the Guardian.The website praises her as a "mujaahidah," or female holy warrior, stating: "We ask Allah to keep her safe and secure, to hasten her release and to reward this heroine immensely."The website gives instructions "if you want to track an MP" and advice on how to attend a surgery "where you can encounter them in person." It also lists the addresses and times of Stephen Timms's constituency surgeries and a telephone number to book an appointment.Senior police sources told the Guardian that the information on the website could cause consternation and anxiety among MPs.It is believed that the website is hosted in the US, and British authorities would need the co-operation of their US counterparts if any action is to be taken against it, the sources added.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The Metropolitan Police is aware of the website and is making inquiries."Choudhry deliberately chose to visit Timms as he held his surgery to stage her murder attempt.Revolutionmuslim.com contains material by the British Muslim extremist Anjem Choudary [no relation], a key figure in the now-banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun. It has spawned a series of successor groups to try to beat the ban; the latest called Islam4UK was proscribed in January.In her police testimony Choudhry said she had been radicalised after "learning more about Islam" online. She said she had downloaded more than a hundred hours of sermons by Anwar al-Awlaki, the terrorist cleric described by the US as the spiritual leader of three of the 9/11 hijackers. Despite Awlaki being suspected of being a terrorist mastermind and on a CIA list to be killed, videos of his sermons remain freely available on the internet.
