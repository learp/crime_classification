The inquest jurors considering the death of the fugitive gunman Raoul Moat would have to "try the impossible" and forget what they had heard about the case, a coroner said on Monday.Moat shot and injured his former partner Samantha Stobbart and killed her boyfriend Chris Brown before going on the run for a week last year. He shot and blinded an unarmed police officer, David Rathband. He died after a standoff with police in Rothbury, Northumberland, in July last year during which a controversial new Taser was fired by police.The jury, sworn in on Monday at Newcastle crown court, will consider whether the Taser led the 37-year-old former nightclub doorman to shoot himself.Newcastle coroner David Mitford told the jurors: "The publicity was so great it would be impossible for anybody not to know what happened, to some extent, in the summer of last year. You will recall there was a very substantial number of police officers involved, not from just Northumbria, but others included from many, many forces and one of those was West Yorkshire police."He added: "It will not have escaped your attention that there were some weapons called Tasers used on the night in question. Those Tasers were supplied to Northumbria police by a firm called Pro-Tec Limited."He asked the jurors to try "the impossible" and forget what they had already heard about the case.Before the jurors were sworn in, Mitford said he wanted to ensure they were not familiar with any of the witnesses and read out a long list of names.The coroner said Moat's death was confirmed at Newcastle general hospital on 10 July last year."Mr Moat was a 37-year-old man, single, with children. He met his death when he was effectively detained," Mitford told the jury."There have been lots of theories and conclusions drawn, some of which may have been accurate, some of which may not."The inquest would focus on the events in Rothbury, he said. There would be questions about weapons used, how police managed the incident, how officers dealt with the deceased and how he acted, the jury was told. But it would first hear why so many officers were involved in the "manhunt", the coroner said.Barristers for the Moat family, the chief constable of Northumbria, West Yorkshire police officers and Pro-Tec were in court, Mitford said.The inquest is expected to take four weeks.
