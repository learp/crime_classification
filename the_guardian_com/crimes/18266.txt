A teenager who allegedly planned a copycat Columbine massacre at his former school was filmed making explosives, a jury heard yesterday. Matthew Swift, 18, and his friend, Ross McKnight, 16, filmed themselves on a mobile phone detonating a home-made pipe bomb, Manchester crown court heard. The pair are accused of plotting to bomb a shopping centre and shoot students at Audenshaw high school in Greater Manchester on the 10th anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Both defendants deny conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions. The case was adjourned until Monday.
