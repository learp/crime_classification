Detectives investigating claims that a boy was taken into a van in Surrey insist they are completely satisfied they have a credible witness, despite not receiving any reports of missing children 24 hours after the incident.Det Supt Chris Edwards said officers were investigating two theories following a claim that a child had been abducted in Redhill on Thursday afternoon. The boy, aged about six or seven and wearing a red T-shirt and navy jeans, was reported to have been taken into the side of a black Volkswagen Transporter with an 02 licence plate between 4.25pm and 4.40pm. “We’re operating two particular theories. The first one and the priority line of investigation is that this is exactly as portrayed and reported, and that a child has been abducted from the roadside,” Edwards said of the inquiry, which has been dubbed Operation Bigfoot.“The second theory that we are operating, and this a heartfelt plea to anybody who may have information in support of the second theory, is that if you were at that location and involved in an incident yesterday involving your own child, or a child that you are connected to, we would urge you to come forward and make contact immediately in order that we can scale this investigation back and offer messages of reassurance to the public.” Edwards added it was “implicit” that a child would be in danger given the circumstances as it appeared the child was taken “against their will”, although there was “no information to suggest a struggle”. He stressed the “credibility of the witness” as being important to inquiries and said there had been 130 reports by members of the public relating to the investigation. He said police were keeping an open mind but added: “I can confirm that we still don’t have, within the county, within the region or nationally, a report of a missing person fitting that description to date.” Edwards also ruled out from the inquiry a black VW van about which police had previously appealed for information. The force is now searching for a modified van, which is described as having an 02 number plate and three BBS alloy wheels, with one missing at the front driver’s side. The vehicle had no rear windows, a sliding side door and chrome sidesteps.Surrey Police (@SurreyPolice)Commuting on @SouthernRailUK? In #Redhill this time yesterday? See or know this van? 📞101 quote Op Bigfoot pic.twitter.com/3avE8cahP1August 26, 2016The mystery deepened on Friday after a mountain bike believed to have been left behind by the boy at the scene was revealed to have been there for days.The landlord of a nearby pub, who did not want to be named, said he had moved the Frantic Giant bike, which has a silver frame with black and yellow detail, next to some bins after finding it dumped outside his premises earlier in the week. He said: “On Wednesday it was outside at about 10am. At about 1pm I moved it to the back of the old arcade where the bins are, assuming someone would pick it up – all the kids play around there.”A statement from Surrey police earlier on Friday said a large police operation involving a significant number of officers had taken place overnight to trace the van and establish the identity of the child. “Reports of this nature involving children are extremely rare, which is why we are treating it so seriously,” the statement said.Supt Bex Smith, of Surrey police, said: “This is an incident we are taking extremely seriously and are asking for anyone with any information regarding the child, the van or what happened to come forward.“If you were in the area, perhaps commuting to or from Redhill train station at the time, please get in touch with us if you saw anything suspicious. At this stage, we are not ruling out a number of options, including whether the child and the person in the van know each other.”Anyone with any information should contact Surrey police by calling 999 in an emergency or 101.
