The home secretary, Charles Clarke is "talking nonsense" when he proposes new community prisons and an end to a cap on prison numbers, campaigners said today.Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said it would be impossible to create a network of community prisons if the number of prisoners was still rising.Mr Clarke told the Guardian he of plans for new-style prisons which would allow prisoners, especially those serving short sentences, to be held near their home, relatives and friends. The move will help cut reoffending rates, he said.He also said he was not convinced a cap on the total number of prisoners in England and Wales was the right policy. The prison population is 77,000 at present, close to the cap of 80,000.Mr Clarke is due to make a speech to the Prison Reform Trust this evening, where he is expected to outline the basis for his penal policies for the first time.Ms Crook was outspoken in her opposition to the home secretary's announcements. "It is nonsense. I hope he has a better grip on his brief by the time he addresses our conference in November," she said."We have to have a cap on numbers if we are going to keep people locally. At the moment people are being shunted around the country even when they are on remand."Prisons are grossly overcrowded, with 20,000 people sharing cells designed for one person."She highlighted Pentonville prison, London, and Norwich prison as two of the worst examples of prisons in a poor state.The Howard League, which is a charity, advocates more work in communities to prevent reoffending and "restorative justice" schemes to make offenders face their victims and apologise.Other campaigners agree with Ms Crook.Paul Cavadino, the chief executive of crime reduction charity Nacro, said: "The higher the prison population the more difficult it is to provide good resettlement services to all prisoners who need them. Pressure of numbers is also a key reason why many prisoners are placed far from their home areas in any prison which has a spare bedspace."One of the best ways of helping the Prison Service to rehabilitate prisoners would be the adoption of clear official targets to peg and then reduce the prison population."Mr Clarke will also say that judges should not take into account the prison population when sentencing which, like the abandonment of the cap on numbers, reverses the policies of his predecessor David Blunkett.
