The bullet that killed Mark Duggan had only recently been authorised for police use before the fatal shooting in 2011, the inquest into his death has heard.Michael Mansfield QC, for the Duggan family, told the jury on Thursday that the 9mm parabellum ammunition used by a police marksman was "not even in use by all army units" in the UK.The jury heard that the hollow-point bullet is designed to cause "instantaneous incapacitation" and "mushrooms" on contact with the body. The bullet travelled 30cm down through Duggan's body after hitting him 2cm above his right nipple, jurors were told.Duggan was fatally shot by a police marksman in August 2011 following a "hard stop" of the minicab he was inside in Tottenham, north-east London. Detectives believed Duggan was a gangster and in possession of a gun. The shooting sparked the worst riots in modern history across England.Hearing witness evidence from two expert pathologists, jurors were told that there was "possibly a second" between two major wounds sustained by Duggan, one to his right arm and a fatal shot to his chest."The weapon and the ammunition are intended to cause instantaneous incapacitation," said Mansfield. "What I'm going to suggest is that in relation to the combination of those shots that is pretty well what's happened: instantaneous incapacitation."The time frame of the whole incident was "a matter of seconds, possibly three, possibly five", Mansfield added.Dr Simon Poole, a Home Office pathologist who carried out the first postmortem on Duggan, told jurors he believed that Duggan was bent forward when he was shot fatally in the chest by a police marksman known only as V53.Another expert pathologist, Prof Derrick Pounder, who carried out a second autopsy on Duggan at the request of the dead man's family, told the jury that hollow-point bullets are designed to "mushroom" on impact with the body.He told jurors the bullet travelled at an approximately 46-degree angle down through Duggan's chest before exiting his body, before it was eventually found in the minicab.The inquest continues.
