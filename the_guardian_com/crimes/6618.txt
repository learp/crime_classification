A cruise ship crooner who fiddled £34,000 in benefits was caught when a Jobcentre worker recognised him performing on stage.The official was on a "mini cruise" from Plymouth to Santander when he saw Sean Grahame singing and telling jokes. The Jobcentre staff member thought his face seemed familiar and eventually identified him as a claimant who came into his office every week.Over six years Grahame claimed benefits, pretending to be an unemployed single parent struggling to bring up a child on his own. But he worked as a singer and comedian on Brittany Ferries ships and spent the extra money he pocketed on drink and prescription drugs.Grahame, of Paignton, Devon, appeared at Torquay magistrates court and admitted four offences of failing to notify the authorities that he was working.He was given a 12-week jail sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 250 hours' unpaid work as well as pay £100 costs.Philip White, prosecuting, said Grahame, 45, signed scores of documents declaring he was not working.White said: "Over a period of six years he claimed a range of benefits saying he was a lone parent and a single unemployed person. He was required to attend the local Jobcentre fortnightly to make signed declarations he had not worked since his last claim."An investigation took place which discovered he was working for various entertainment agencies and consistently performing aboard Brittany Ferries' flagship, the Pont-Aven."He was also carrying out other engagements and gigs throughout the West Country during those five or six years. Since his arrest and interview he has made only one repayment of £50."Mungo Wenban-Smith, defending, said Grahame was racked by remorse, had suffered a nervous breakdown, and had entered a rehabilitation programme to tackle his addictions.He said: "He has vowed to repay every cent he has taken from honest taxpayers and he stands by those words."Outside court, a spokesman for the dDepartment for wWork and pPensions said: "This case came to light in quite unusual circumstances. One of our officers who works in the local Jobcentre had been on one of the trips where Grahame was performing. "He recognised him as the same man and so when he next came into the jobcentre he contacted our investigators who started an inquiry. "This case shows that those who cheat the system can never be sure when they may be found out."
