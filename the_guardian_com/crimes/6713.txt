A career criminal who was part of a gang that stole £1.7m of artworks by LS Lowry was facing a "substantial" jail term today after being found guilty of robbery.Casey Miller, 23, held a knife to the throat of art dealer Ivan Aird, 43, and threatened to stab and kill his wife and two-year-old daughter in the raid on their home in Cheadle, Cheshire, in May 2007.He was convicted after a jury deliberated for two and a half hours at Manchester crown court today.Jurors gasped after they found him guilty and were told by the judge for the first time that Miller's DNA was found at the scene but ruled to be inadmissible evidence.The recorder of Manchester, Andrew Gilbart QC, warned Miller he faced a "substantial" jail term before telling the jury: "I only hope these wonderful paintings are discovered to the benefit of everyone."Police said Miller, who told detectives he "didn't know Lowry from Adam", was only the hired muscle in the team assembled to carry out the "audacious and well-planned" raid.Miller, who has 28 previous convictions for serious violence and robbery, threatened to stab the terrified victims and tied up Aird while the gang scoured the house for Lowry's works.Among the items taken during the raid were Lowry's paintings The Viaduct, worth £700,000, and Tanker Entering the Tyne, valued at £500,000. They have not been recovered.Aird's company, Grove Fine Art, advertised on the internet but he did not publicise his home address because it used as a gallery.Smaller works were also stolen. These included Maryport; A Doctor's Surgery; Bridge at Ringley, painted in 1926 and worth "around £50,000"; and Street Market, a line drawing from 1924.A palette with brushes underneath that had belonged to Lowry was also taken. It was the only one in existence and had the artist's paint on its surface.Miller will be sentenced on March 17.
