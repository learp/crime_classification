A former police officer has been convicted of two serious sexual offences after already pleading guilty to seven counts of rape.Wayne Scott, 37, was found guilty of rape and the attempted rape of a woman after a five-day trial.The jury at Newcastle crown court heard that he had ripped off the victim's jeans and underwear before attempting to rape her, and in a second incident raped her in his car.The court also heard that Scott, who was employed by Cleveland police, had already admitted raping a different woman seven times over a number of years.In addition he confessed to two common assaults, one sexual assault and two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual touching.After his conviction, the force appealed for anyone else who believes they might have been a victim of Scott to come forward.Detective Superintendent Peter McPhillips, of Cleveland police, said: "I'm pleased with the outcome given today. Wayne Scott is a sexual predator who has been a disgrace to the office of constable, and deserves to be behind bars."Scott was arrested in August 2011 following on-duty allegations, and subsequently suspended and dismissed."Our objective since has been to discover whether his behaviour was more widespread and to protect the public from him. That objective has now been achieved."The offences for which Scott has been convicted today occurred off duty but as a police officer he knew better than most the severity of his crimes."He was a disgrace to his uniform and there can be no place for people like him in the police service."McPhillips also paid tribute to the strength and courage of Scott's victims as they had gone through the court process.During the trial, the court heard that Scott had referred to himself as "sexed up" during a police interview and that he had also made advances to some of his former colleagues.After the jury delivered its verdict, Judge James Goss QC said he would pass sentence on 23 December. Scott was remanded in custody until then.
