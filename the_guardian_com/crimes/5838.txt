The husband of a woman seriously injured when a concrete block was thrown on their car from a bridge in Essex has spoken of his concern that a "craze of stupidity" could spark copycat incidents.Steve Manley, whose wife Carol remains in hospital following the incident last Friday evening, pleaded for witnesses to the attack or those with information to come forward. Pictures of Mrs Manley's injuries have also been released.He told journalists: "This could happen again because of some thoughtless people or person that thinks it's fun to throw pieces of concrete at innocent people and try to kill them so they can watch blue lights come flying down the road," he said.The Manleys were driving home along the A12 after visiting friends when a concrete block the size of a bucket landed on the roof, hitting Mrs Manley, 57, in the stomach and causing fractures to her face and ribs and internal injuries. It was the second such incident on the same stretch of road within 40 minutes; earlier another rock was thrown into a car driven by Lisa Horne, a 26 year-old mother, though that did not cause injuries.Manley said: "There was a bump on the roof of the car, as far as I could tell. I thought I had hit something in the road. When I turned around and looked at my wife to ask her what it was, I noticed that the front of the car was destroyed. My wife was covered in blood. There was a concrete block on her chest and leg.""My first reaction was to try and get the block off of my wife. The concerns that were running through my mind were that my wife couldn't breathe, she couldn't see, there was blood pouring from her face."He said his wife had only recently been released from hospital following a stomach operation. She is disabled, with rheumatoid arthritis and has epilepsy."Carol is frightened now to sit in the front seat of a car, she doesn't want to be in the car. Physically she's going to get better; mentally we're going to worry about the scars in the future."
