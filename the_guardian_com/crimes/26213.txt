A doctor who spiked his pregnant lover's drinks in an attempt to induce a miscarriage was today jailed for six years by a judge who condemned him as a "liar, a cheat and a predator".Judge Richard Hone told the Old Bailey that Edward Erin, a 44-year-old father of two, was a "self-centred, vainglorious and irresponsible" man who lived in a fantasy world and had preyed on women by dazzling them with his wealth.Last month, the hospital consultant was found guilty of two charges of trying to lace Bella Prowse's coffee and orange juice with poison.But 33-year-old Prowse noticed that the drinks had been tampered with and took them to police, the Old Bailey heard.Tests showed they contained drugs which induce abortion. Prowse later gave birth to a healthy son, Ernie."What you did to Bella Prowse is about as serious a breach of trust for a senior doctor as can be imagined," Hone told the court today in a scathing summing-up of Erin's conduct."Your criminal behaviour not only threw away the standards expected, but it has also betrayed your whole profession."The judge said: "The trial has exposed you, stripped you of your flummery, as a liar, a cheat and a predator".He added: "It is no surprise that, in addition to your chaotic emotional life, your clinical research is under scrutiny as lacking depth and validity."The fantasy part of your life left little time indeed for serious research."Prowse's impact statement, in which she told of the "enormous and devastating" effects on her life, was summarised Paul Raudnitz, prosecuting."She feels shocked that someone could think that they had a right to do this to her, let alone someone she loved," he said.He told the court Prowse had not known that Erin was married with children until police told her.Erin's wife, Lowri, a microbiologist, said she would stand by her husband after the verdict and did not believe he was guilty.She said: "How can the jury take the word of a woman out for revenge against that of a doctor of good character who has done nothing but help people all his life?"Speaking about her loyalty, the judge said: "If she continues to support you, as she says she will, you may think she deserves better than a husband who goes out on the prowl."Erin's brief relationship with Prowse began at an office Christmas party in December 2007.A month later, she found she was pregnant, and Erin – who had thought she was on the pill – begged her to have an abortion.But Prowse, who felt guilty about an earlier termination she had in 2002, cancelled appointments at a clinic.Erin wrote a prescription made out in the name of his German teacher, for anti-inflammatory, abortion-inducing drugs, the court heard.He ground up the tablets at his flat on 2 February, when his wife saw him but was told he was doing it for work.After a short trip to the US, he laced the drinks on 7 and 8 February last year.He put powder in her Starbucks coffee, but she noticed the lid of the cup had been removed and replaced and poured the coffee into a bottle without drinking it.The following day, Erin put powder in orange juice at St Mary's hospital in Paddington, west London, where they both worked, but Prowse noticed that the seal was broken.The coffee and orange juice were analysed by police and found to contain abortion-inducing drugs, and Erin was arrested on 14 February.The consultant, who said he had obtained the drugs without intending to use them, has provided DNA for a paternity test to determine whether he is Ernie's father. The results are not yet known.A chest specialist at St Mary's and a research fellow at the Royal Brompton hospital, also in west London, he denied the allegations against him.The judge said Erin's three affairs that formed part of the evidence illustrated "how you exploited your senior position as a consultant respiratory physician to lure women into sexual relations"."Your property wealth, tailored wardrobe, high lifestyle, illicit weekends and expensive trinkets dazzled those whom you designed to seduce," he said."You are clever, but also devious and dishonest. You inhabited a fantasy world."Detective chief inspector Mickey Gallagher said: "Edward Erin is a consultant physician, pharmacologist and honorary senior lecturer."He has been a medical professional for over 20 years, yet, having failed to persuade his girlfriend, Bella Prowse, to have an abortion, he has abused his profession and position of trust, used his medical knowledge to try to bring on a miscarriage."This was not a morality trial, but the nature of this case is unusual in that it is only the second of its type to be brought before the courts in the last 40 years."Gil Magira, a baker, was jailed for three years and nine months last year after pleading guilty to putting drugs into his wife's food in an unsuccessful attempt to induce a miscarriage.Erin had been banned from working with patients by the General Medical Council pending the outcome of the case."It is said your life is ruined and over 20 years as a rising specialist have been thrown away," Hone said."Although that is true and is some mitigation, you brought disaster entirely on yourself."
