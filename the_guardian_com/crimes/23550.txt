The home secretary, Charles Clarke, yesterday ordered officials to investigate the security arrangements surrounding Iorworth Hoare, the rapist with a £7m fortune, following revelations that the offender's care since release from prison is costing the taxpayer £10,000 a month.The inquiry is likely to consider whether wealthy offenders should be required to contribute towards costs incurred by the authorities on their release.Mr Clarke ordered the review after an exposé in the Sun newspaper, which revealed that Hoare, 52 - known as the "Lotto rapist" - has been living under an assumed name in Sunderland under a regime that costs £150,000 a year. At the same time, the paper said, he has been buying works of art and earning interest payments of £30,000 a month.Hoare's movements are being tracked under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements, set up to deal with sex offenders. Since being traced by reporters, he has been moved to a new address.Yesterday Mr Clarke said the exposé "highlighted a number of important issues". He added: "I have asked my department to look at the details of this case and some of the broader issues it raises. The main duty of the police, probation service and other agencies is to protect the public from serious, violent or sexual offenders who have completed their prison sentence and to maintain public order."He said the arrangements for managing and monitoring serious offenders are "as robust as anywhere in the world", but added: "I fully understand the concerns raised by this case and want to examine how this and similar cases are managed and financed to decide whether any changes are necessary."
