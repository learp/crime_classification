"Common sense" justifications of prison suggest that "prison works" by incapacitation. It takes people out of society and thus gives communities a rest from those who have broken the law. It is also a deterrent: it makes those who might be thinking about committing a crime think again, by punishing those who do actually commit crimes. And it rehabilitates: it helps those who have committed crimes to think through the causes of their offending so as to change their behaviour by developing new skills, which they are then able to put to good use on release from custody.These justifications are now so widespread and accepted among our politicians, media commentators and, indeed, many members of the public, that no one actually bothers to question whether they are actually true or not - whether they are "nonsense" rather than "common sense", and whether the one place that we can forget about "evidence-led practice" in relation to public policy is when prisons are discussed. After all, as a mountain of research testifies - much of it emanating from the Home Office - these justifications are, at best, aspirational and, at worst, simply lies.It would be easy to unmask these false justifications by patiently pointing out the realities about who gets imprisoned and who does not; the relationship between the crime rate and the rate of imprisonment; what happens to people when they are inside; and especially what happens to them after they are released.We would point to the fact that two out of every three young offenders are reconvicted within two years of leaving jail; that one out of every two adult men are similarly reconvicted; and that just under one out of every two women suffer the same fate. Would a school that failed to teach two out of every three of its pupils to read and write, or a hospital that killed one out of every two of its patients, continue to receive widespread political and popular support?However, we also know that prison fails by almost every measure that it sets for itself; that prison is a useless, outdated, bloated Victorian institution that is well past its sell-by date. We know, in short, that prison is a fiasco. How then do we explain the continuing hold of prison on our collective imagination? And, more importantly, how do we create a scepticism about prison and what is claimed for it by its supporters?Taking my inspiration from a range of contributions by European abolitionists - from Joe Sim to Nils Christie, Herman Bianchi and Louk Hulsman - I have been trying of late to create what has been described as a "politics of bad conscience" about prison, by appealing over the heads of politicians and other commentators directly to the public. Awful storiesIn particular, I have tried to engage the public emotionally, when they think about prison and prisoners, by using the scandal of the numbers of people who die while incarcerated in England and Wales - either through taking their own lives, being murdered, or growing old and/or ill and then dying in custody. In short, I have tried to "muck-rake" by telling the awful stories of real people and what happens to them when they are locked up in our name and become part of the 76,000 people who are currently held in prisons in this country.People like Shahid Aziz, who was murdered by his cellmate Peter McCann at HMP Leeds in March 2004, in circumstances that echo the racist murder of Zahid Mubarek at Feltham young offender institution in 2000; former prisoner Stuart Ware, the 67-year-old co-founder of the Pacer 50plus support network, who has described what is happening to the growing number of older people in our prisons as "not civilised"; and Pauline Campbell, a former college lecturer who now, like a modern-day suffragette, protests outside every women's jail to draw attention to the numbers of women who have taken their own lives in custody.One such woman was Campbell's own daughter, Sarah, who took her own life in January 2003 in Styal prison. Campbell told me she demonstrates to show that "prisons are unsafe places that constantly fail to uphold the duty of care that the Prison Service has to all prisoners. People must speak out. It's medieval."Yet how successful will this muck-raking be? The chances of making much of an inroad into the debate about prisons and prisoners look bleak, but this does not mean that those of us who favour prison contraction and eventual abolition should simply give up. Rather, it means trying to engage with the public in ever more creative ways - including, for example, using the public's fascination with prime-time TV series, such as Bad Girls, to create space in which the case for prison reform can be outlined and explained.It also means not being seduced by those politicians or academics who would have us believe that prison can be "re-legitimised" by looking at, for example, how to measure a prison's "moral performance". This type of theorising, no matter how well intentioned, merely contributes to the false justifications that continue to fill up our penal production line with those who have been socially excluded, all in the vain hope that "something is being done" about their lack of education, their mental health issues, and their addictions.Finally, it means engaging with a range of non-governmental organisations, pressure groups and service providers to provide our academic and campaigning support in their continuing battles with the Home Office and with those that have yet to come with the new National Offender Management Service. But let's also be honest: prisons have got to go.Â· David Wilson is professor of criminology at the University of Central England, Birmingham.
