A high court judge yesterday gave warning of "truly disastrous" consequences for public safety because hundreds of dangerous prisoners serving open-ended sentences to protect the public would have to be released.Mr Justice Collins was ordering that Brett James, an inmate at Doncaster prison serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection [IPP], should be released because his continued detention was unlawful. The violent offender was subject to a sentence which meant he could not be considered for release until he had shown he was no longer a threat to the public.But the judge found that James, who was jailed in 2005 for causing grievous bodily harm and ordered to serve a minimum term of one year and 295 days, should be freed because that period had passed and Doncaster prison had no facilities to enable him to follow a course to demonstrate he was unlikely to pose a further danger.His continued detention was unlawful regardless of whether he remained a risk to the public, the judge said.The ruling deepens the prisons crisis as it goes much further than a case last month in which judges ordered ministers to provide the resources needed to enable IPP prisoners to prepare for parole hearings. Ministers responded by saying they were making a further Â£3m available over the next 18 months to ensure inmates could attend behavioural courses.James's release has been postponed until the two cases are heard together in one appeal court case later this year. The outcome will have an impact on prison overcrowding, but is expected to go all the way to the House of Lords - which would also decide if compensation should be paid to the prisoners held unlawfully.The number of prisoners serving open-ended IPP sentences has jumped by nearly 500 since April to 3,101, fuelling the overall rise in prison numbers.Penal reformers already fear the prison population could reach a new record weeks after an early release scheme allowed 1,700 offenders to leave prison 18 days early. The jail population in England and Wales stood at 81,040 when ministers introduced emergency measures on June 29 and quickly dropped to 79,543, but provided only brief respite. By last Friday the numbers were back up to 80,693, with 64 prisoners in police cells. Numbers are believed to have risen further over the weekend against the backdrop of demands for tougher sentencing for knife crime and alcohol-fuelled violence.It is believed the growing use of open-ended IPP sentences by the courts has been a factor in increasing the prison population. Yesterday's ruling will exacerbate the crisis in public confidence. Mr Justice Collins blamed "government failings" for not providing enough courses and facilities to enable IPP prisoners to demonstrate to the parole board that they should be released as they no longer pose a risk to the public."Because of the failings of the government, a fairly large number of IPP prisoners are likely to be released if the court of appeal finds the detention unlawful. This is very worrying," said the judge. "It must be recognised that the consequences are truly disastrous because I think it is inevitable that short-term lifers will have to be released whether or not they remain a risk to the public."In the previous case, involving prisoners David Walker and Nicholas Wells, Lord Justice Laws, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting, said the justice secretary, Jack Straw, had acted unlawfully in not providing sufficient resources to enable them to prove they were no longer dangerous.The Ministry of Justice said last night that the latest ruling was disappointing, but welcomed the opportunity to have both appeals heard at the same time.The Conservative justice spokesman, Nick Herbert, said the ruling was another catastrophic consequence of prison overcrowding: "It was bad enough that prisoners were unable to get on courses to enable them to demonstrate their eligibility for release, but letting out serious offenders even though they could remain a risk to the public would be totally unacceptable."
