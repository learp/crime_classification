One of Britain's leading female tennis coaches was found guilty yesterday of molesting a 13-year-old schoolgirl.Former Wimbledon player Claire Lyte, 29, had sexual relations with the child between May 2005 and June 2006 while working as a coach at the Lawn Tennis Training Academy at Loughborough.She shared a bed with the girl, wore her underwear and was caught engaging in oral sex by the child's mother.Liverpool crown court heard the mother caught her daughter and the coach naked in bed together in October 2005. The jury was told that Lyte, who coached the girl for 10 months, had offered to babysit her.The judge warned Lyte, of Solihull, West Midlands, that she faced an "inevitable" custodial sentence.Lyte had claimed the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was infatuated with her. She also said her allegations were invented by the child's bitter and ambitious mother. But after a 14-day trial, a jury found Lyte guilty of five counts of unlawful sexual activity with a child.Lyte once ranked among the top 500 in the world, but turned to coaching after a wrist problem.Within months of their meeting, it was noted that the pair were spending time together in isolated parts of the campus and in the youngster's room.They wore similar clothes and tied their hair with three bands in the same distinctive way.The court heard that Lyte repeatedly ignored warnings not to get too close to the girl. But staff did not know that the pair were spending nights together at the child's home while her mother was away, or that they were sharing hotel rooms and visiting Lyte's flat.The LTA took action in late October 2005, unaware that the girl's mother had already discovered them in the child's bedroom naked and having oral sex.Despite assurances from Lyte, the relationship continued for another 10 months. But when her mother saw the coach wearing the child's clothes, it was the last straw. She went to the police, whereupon the child threatened to jump from a roof.The teenager, now 15, said she had been threatened and pressurised into the relationship.Lyte will be sentenced in November.
