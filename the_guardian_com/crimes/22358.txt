This year marks the centenary of the probation service in Britain, a vocation that was born amid all the old "badges of infamy" - penal servitude, hard labour, and ticket of leave men, that even as early as 1907 were beginning to look like stage props from some Victorian melodrama.That anniversary stems from the passage of the 1907 Probation of Offenders Act, which put the appointment and pay of probation officers onto a statutory footing for the first time. On May 8 1907, the Liberal home office minister, Herbert Samuel, moving the short second reading debate in the Commons, told MPs the measure was needed so that offenders "whom the court did not think fit to imprison on account of their age, character, or antecedents might be placed on probation under the supervision of these officers whose duty it would be to guide, admonish and befriend them." That last phrase about "guiding, admonishing and befriending" continues to ring down the decades as a warning to those who would rather see probation solely as a "correctional service".Indeed, the only real concern of the MPs in that more innocent Edwardian age was whether these new probation officers would "be something in the manner of a police officer" and have the power to follow a man around the country - a problem that currently seems to be exercising some of the new regional offender managers trying to keep track of prisoners being moved from one overcrowded prison to another.It might be thought that when a major international conference is held in May to mark this centenary that such history will be regarded as uncontroversial as the second reading debate was in that reforming Edwardian parliament.But as, a century later, the modern Commons battle intensifies over the government's plans to "introduce a vibrant mixed market" into the criminal justice system by ending the monopoly of the probation service over that statutory role, the very history of its roots and origins have become a matter of public debate.The Rainer Foundation, a keystone of third-sector activity in the criminal justice system, rightfully and proudly points to the role of its founder, Frederick Rainer, in establishing the first court missionary. In 1876 he sent a donation of five shillings to the Church of England Temperance Society expressing his concern about the "lack of hope and help for those who come before the court". The donation paid for the first missionary at the Southwark police court and by 1894 there were 70 staff working for the London Police Court Mission. Their traditional tasks were said to include exhorting offenders to give up the drink, distributing uplifting tracts and taking pledges of abstinence.Others, however, who wish to stress the more practical approach of the voluntary contribution point to pioneers such as Thomas Holmes, who had little time for such moral rescue work and instead, when asked if he gave them Christ, responded: "Sir, I cannot carry Christ in parcels and distribute him. I can only do as I think He would have done ... I give them myself." As Colin McCulloch has pointed out Holmes's practical work included preparing uninhabitable rooms for accommodation, providing money for food, finding a job and even burying the dead. Holmes also argued for a scientific study of "moral disease" - a quest for more scientific solutions that would become one of the key factors in the decline of this missionary ideal.Missionary workThe breadth of the missionary work was impressive: working with habitual inebriates, matrimonial disputes, prison aftercare, helping people to find work and the making of inquiries for the court. In fact it is surprising to learn that even as late as the 1960s and 1970s probation officers were engaged in general adoption work.Nevertheless it is clear that the work and quality of the police court missionaries varied greatly and that for every Thomas Holmes there were at least two police court missionaries who believed that offenders "could be warmed, fed and comforted with tracts or saved with goody stories", as Holmes himself put it.The 1907 legislation ended this approach only in name. Many police court missionaries became probation officers and carried on with their task of "saving offenders' souls by divine grace". But the patchwork of such voluntary effort was felt not to be up to the task and by 1936 an influential Home Office inquiry was worrying that this system of "dual control" was being hindered by the split loyalties of probation officers between the secular authority of the courts and the religious motivations of the voluntary societies.The Rev Harry Pearson for the police court missionaries told the inquiry that the voluntary societies attracted men and women with a sense of vocation based on religious conviction that might not be so motivated by a secular public authority. He also argued that the funds of the societies that were used represented a public spending saving.Nevertheless, the Home Office concluded that it was time the job was done by a fully trained and qualified full-time social worker and the role of the voluntary societies should be restricted to providing probation hostels and homes.Supervising the willingAnother key difference lies in the fact that until the Attlee Labour government probation was really a matter of supervising the willing. It was not until the 1948 Criminal Justice Act, which officially dismantled much of the machinery of the Victorian penal system, that a conviction was required for the sentence of probation to be imposed. It was no longer a task to be done only with the offender's consent.These debates may seem obscure against the current controversy over the role of the third sector in the modern probation service. Organisations such as Crime Concern, Rainer and Nacro, the crime reduction charity, say they have the skills and expertise needed and have strongly welcomed the chance to get far more involved in the direct provision of probation services and so end the 100-year-old monopoly of the public probation service. There are, after all, about 1,100 voluntary organisations and others already involved in providing programmes and courses for the prison and probation services, often on small, short-term local contracts. But ministers say they only account for 2% of the value of the work done by the probation service.They want that to increase to 10%, by compulsion if necessary, by 2007/08. The social care charity Turning Point has even announced a link-up with Serco, the private security company, to provide employment projects for offenders. More than £250m of work each year will be up for grabs.It will be interesting to see in this centenary year, if those debates of the early 20th century over "dual control" and split loyalties are resurrected as modern day charities and social enterprise organisations try to meet the new challenge of working with the "unwilling", and whether this expanding social market can deliver a high-performing unfragmented service to the courts. Government ministers talk of probation trusts that will subcontract to the provider that can make the best contribution whether from the public, private or third sectors. It all sounds a long way from the missionary sprit of Frederick Rainer or Thomas Holmes.The author is the Guardian's home affairs editor.· This article appears in the new edition of the Guardian's Public magazine
