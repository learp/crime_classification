Two youths convicted of the murder of Garry Newlove have been granted leave to appeal, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.Adam Swellings, the 19-year-old ringleader of the drunken gang that kicked the father of three to death in Cheshire, will appeal against both his conviction and his minimum 17-year jail sentence.His fellow gang member Stephen Sorton, 17, has been granted permission to appeal against his minimum 15-year term."We have been notified that Swellings will appeal against both conviction and sentence and Sorton will appeal against his sentence," a CPS spokeswoman said. "No date has been set for the appeal hearings."Newlove, a 47-year-old salesman with a plastics company, was killed outside his home in Station Road North, Warrington, after confronting a gang about vandalism last August.He was kicked "like a football" by the youths, the murder trial, at Chester crown court, was told. His daughters, Zoe, 18, 16-year-old Danielle and Amy, 13, saw the attack.It emerged after Swellings, Sorton and 16-year-old Jordan Cunliffe were found guilty in January that Swellings had been released from custody for an assault hours before the attack on Newlove.He was freed on bail on condition he stayed away from Warrington, but remained in the town despite the court order.Newlove's widow, Helen, launched a campaign for more to be done to stop youth gangs going on violent, drink-fuelled rampages against law-abiding people.
