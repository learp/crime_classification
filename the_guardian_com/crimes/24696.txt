A man was jailed at the Old Bailey today for Britain's first "web rage" attack on another internet user. Paul Gibbons, 47, traced John Jones, 43, after they exchanged insults in a chatroom. He was armed with a pickaxe handle and was with a man with a machete. Mr Jones, who had gone to the door of his home in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, with a knife, was disarmed and had his neck cut by Gibbons. Gibbons, unemployed, of Southwark, south London, was jailed for two-and-a half years for unlawful wounding. He pleaded guilty last month, when the prosecution agreed not to proceed with charges of attempted murder and threats to kill. After that hearing, police warned internet users not to put personal details from which they could be traced on the web. "It is accepted by the prosecution that Mr Jones taunted you and dared you to go to his house where you would be greeted with weapons," Judge Richard Hawkins told Gibbons.
