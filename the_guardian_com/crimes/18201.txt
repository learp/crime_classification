Photograph: Greater Manchester police/PAJohn Grainger, 32, was beheaded and set alight in the early hours of Thursday morning in woodland near a casino in the town centre.On Friday detectives from Greater Manchester police were continuing to question two men, aged 29 and 31, on suspicion of murder. Firefighters discovered the man's head after they put out the blaze and a murder inquiry was launched."There's nothing there to suggest that it's a gangland killing," a police source said on Friday, adding that all lines of inquiry were being explored.It would be wrong to speculate on rumours about the man's death, police said.The suspects were arrested an hour before the body was found – on suspicion of possessing shotgun cartridges – after an incident at a Stockport flat. While they were being taken to the police station, at about 5.10am, officers were alerted to a fire by an emergency services call and the body was discovered.Police said a Home Office postmortem examination had found that Grainger died from a blunt-force head injury and a "shotgun wound to the head". Police said it is believed he was decapitated after he was shot.Superintendent Pete Matthews said: "Our thoughts are with John's family at this tragic time, as they try to come to terms with the loss of their loved one."We have a team of dedicated detectives who are working hard to establish the exact circumstances surrounding John's death, so we can provide his family with some much-needed answers.We will be continuing with our inquiries and speaking to local residents."People in the community are in shock at what has happened and I would encourage anyone with any information to contact the police."In a statement, Grainger's family described him as a "cheeky and loveable" character who was "a fantastic brother and uncle" who hoped to have children of his own one day. They said he was an avid Manchester United fan.The two arrested men remain in police custody.
