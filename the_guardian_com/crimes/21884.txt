A teenager who stabbed a promising young footballer to death to show off to his friends was given a life sentence yesterday at the Old Bailey.Somali refugee Hannad Hasan, 17, was told he must spend at least 13 years in prison for murdering Kiyan Prince, described as one of the "brightest talents" in the Queens Park Rangers youth team.Hasan, from Colindale, north London, may be deported once he is considered fit for release. The judge said: "This country has no use for criminals of other nationalities."Jurors heard how in May 2006 Kiyan tried to break up a play fight outside his school, the London Academy in Edgware. Hasan grabbed Kiyan in a headlock and stabbed him in the heart, stomach and arm with a penknife. The teenager, who was excluded from the school, did not call an ambulance or help Kiyan, but fled.The youth denied murder but admitted manslaughter. Judge Paul Worsley QC acknowledged that Hasan, who came to the UK with his mother in 2001, had a difficult background, but said: "You not only destroyed his [Kiyan's] life but ruined the lives of those near him."It was the third time the youth had faced a jury for the offence. In the original trial the jury could not agree and a second trial collapsed after Kiyan's father, Mark, approached a juror on her way home.An inquiry is being held by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service into a "catastrophic" failure which meant the court could not hear evidence that Hasan threatened to stab a girl two weeks earlier.
