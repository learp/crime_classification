A 24-year-old man has been arrested by police investigating the "atrocious" murder of a couple found dead in their home.A murder investigation was launched after the bodies of Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife Carole, 58, were discovered at their home in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, by their son on Wednesday morning.West Midlands police said the man was arrested at a house in Birmingham on Friday night.He has been taken to a police station in the West Midlands where he is being questioned on suspicion of murder.Postmortem tests confirmed the couple died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head and that both had been struck several times.One of their sons, Jason Kolar, a serving officer with West Midlands police, discovered their bodies after he went to their home when family members were unable to make contact with them.The couple had four children and eight grandchildren.At an emotional press conference on Thursday, two of the children made a desperate plea for help to catch their killers.Michelle Kirwan, 39, described them as "the sweetest, kindest people that I have ever met", adding: "Our hearts are broken forever and our lives will never be the same."Another son, also called Avtar Kolar, 32, said: "We are now reaching out to anybody out there who could please, please help. No matter how little or however much they can, somebody out there knows who did this, so please I beg of you help us catch the person or people who has taken these two most special people away from us."More than 60 officers have been assigned to the case, which is led by Detective Superintendent Richard Baker.He said: "This was a horrendous attack. We continue to follow a number of lines of enquiry and we thank those who have called us so far. We encourage anyone with information to speak to us no matter how insignificant they feel the detail is."
