David Cameron has said burglars are cowards, after a judge reportedly told a criminal his raids took courage. The prime minister said he had been burgled twice, and branded the offence "hateful".During a case at Teesside crown court, the judge, Peter Bowers, apparently told an offender who had raided three homes in five days: "It takes a huge amount of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody's house. I wouldn't have the nerve."Handing the 26-year-old man a suspended 12-month term, the judge said: "I'm going to take a chance on you."On ITV's Daybreak programme, Cameron stressed he had not seen the details of the case, but said: "I am very clear that burglary is not bravery. Burglary is cowardice. Burglary is a hateful crime. People sometimes say it is not a violent crime, but actually if you have been burgled you do feel it was violence."I have been burgled twice. You feel completely violated. When someone has smashed their way into your house and stolen your possessions ... I am very clear that people who repeatedly burgle should be sent to prison," he added. "That is why this government is actually changing the law to toughen the rules on self-defence against burglars, saying householders have the right to defend themselves."Later, during a tour of a new housing estate in Cheshunt, Cameron said: "Judges must speak for themselves and it is not for me to attack a judge, but I'm very clear that burglary is a dreadful crime, it is a hateful crime."David Hines, chairman of the National Victims' Association, said the judge's comments were outrageous. "What message does this send out to society? The criminal justice system has let the victims down. Burglars are going to believe that judges think they are courageous. I think this judge is on a different wavelength to everyone else."A spokesman for the Judiciary of England and Wales said Bowers would not be censured.
