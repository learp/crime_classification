The parents of missing Madeleine McCann today said they were "convinced" she was still alive.Gerry and Kate McCann thanked the British media for focusing attention on the four-year-old, who vanished from a resort town in Portugal 50 days ago.As events were held in a dozen countries to mark the 50th day since the four-year-old's disappearance, the McCanns said in a letter to the media that their campaign was entering a new "event-driven" phase. "It is hard to express how much your support and the support of your readers and viewers have meant to us personally at this terribly difficult time," they said.Earlier, the couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, released yellow helium-filled balloons on the beach at Praia da Luz, the Algarve resort where Madeleine vanished from her holiday apartment.While thanking the media, the McCanns appealed for the focus to be kept firmly on Madeleine rather than the rest of the family."While we understand the media's natural desire to concentrate on us and our family, we would like the focus to remain firmly on Madeleine," they said. As the search for Madeleine continued, police in Malta were investigating reported sightings of the missing girl. The In-Nazzjon newspaper reported that two tourists had seen a girl matching her description in the Maltese capital, Valletta, on Saturday. Subsequent reports said four other people on the Mediterranean island had since come forward with information. The news followed possible sightings across Europe and in north Africa, but it is the first time claims of a possible Maltese sighting have been made public.One of the people who contacted police, Ray Roberts, from Anglesey, north Wales, said he had seen a girl in Sliema wearing what he said was a jet-black wig being told: "Get up, little girl" by a man of Arab appearance."On June 17, the Malta police were in receipt of a report of a sighting of a girl who resembled Madeleine McCann," Superintendent Pierre Calleja, of the Maltese CID, said.On his blog, Mr McCann wrote that the campaign to find Madeleine would be widened to include broader child abuse issues."We are very keen to see more debate on issues that we and other families in similar situations have to face," he said. "Child abuse is a taboo subject still in many countries, and we must encourage responsible debate around how child abuse can be prevented."The McCanns also said they were considering releasing a cover version of Bryan Adams' hit song (Everything I Do) I Do It For You to raise money for their campaign."That song best reflects how Kate and I feel emotionally, and how determined we are to continue searching for Madeleine," he told Sky News.
