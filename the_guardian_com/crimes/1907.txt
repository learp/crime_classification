The trial of the Muslim cleric Abu Hamza was "in all respects fair", the court of appeal was told today.Prosecutors made the claim during the second day of Hamza's challenge against convictions for incitement to murder and race hate crimes.The radical cleric was jailed for seven years in February after prosecutors argued he had preached "terrorism, homicidal violence and hatred" during sermons he gave at the Finsbury Park mosque, in north London, and elsewhere.An Old Bailey jury convicted him on 11 of 15 charges.Lawyers representing Hamza argued that the six-year delay in putting him on trial had made a fair trial impossible.Yesterday, Edward Fitzgerald QC told the court it was "unfair and oppressive" to put the cleric on trial in 2006 for speeches made between 1997 and 2000.He said subsequent terrorist atrocities including the September 11 attacks on the US and the London bombings, in addition to a sustained campaign from the media and leading politicians, had "prejudiced" his chances of a fair trial.However, David Perry QC, for the Crown, today said the conviction was safe and called for the appeal to be dismissed.The controversial cleric, who was not in court for the proceedings, now has to wait to find out if his appeal has been successful after the judges in the case announced they were reserving their decision.During Hamza's month-long trial, the prosecution alleged he had acted as a recruiting sergeant for global terrorism during sermons delivered at Finsbury Park and in Luton, Blackburn and Whitechapel, east London.Hamza was convicted of inciting his followers to murder non-Muslims and Jews and of possessing a terror "manual" called the Encyclopaedia of the Afghani Jihad.The book featured a dedication to the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, and a list of potential targets including Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower."The trial judge correctly decided that the proceedings against the appellant did not amount to an abuse of the process of the court and the trial was in all respects fair," Mr Perry told the court.He said submissions made on behalf of Hamza suggested "that the appellant could not fairly be tried in relation to any criminal offence and that he is therefore immune from prosecution", which he said would lead to an "absurd" situation.Mr Perry also denied claims that negative media portrayals of Hamza could have affected the jury's ability to return a fair verdict based on the evidence presented to them.The appeal continues.
