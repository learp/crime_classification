The Jon Venables case raises thorny issues about media responsibility and the competing interests of open justice and the right not just to a fair trial, but to life.Following the sentencing of Venables over child pornography charges, Mr Justice Bean reiterated the view of the courts that revealing his new identity risked endangering his life. But some media groups argued the reporting restrictions were draconian and an affront to the principle of open justice.The judge did relax reporting restrictions on naming the region, Cheshire, where Venables lived at the time he was recalled to prison in March this year, as well as the probation service that was supervising him. But Bean reiterated that the reporting restrictions to protect Venables' new identity, his address before he was recalled to prison, his whereabouts now, and his appearance, still stand and are permanent.Reporting restrictions have been in place ever since Venables and Robert Thompson, who were convicted for the murder of James Bulger, were released on licence with new identities in 2001.At that time, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss granted a high court injunction to prevent publication of their new identities on the basis that there was a real possibility of serious physical harm or death from vengeful members of the public.Lawyers said it is rare for a defendant's identity not to be revealed to the public because of a strong presumption in favour of open justice.Guy Vassall-Adams, a barrister specialising in media law at Doughty Street Chambers, said: "There may be circumstances where it is legitimate to depart from that principle. Where there is credible evidence that disclosing their identity could put their life in danger there must be legitimate grounds for not disclosing their identity. The tabloid media which would like to be able to identify [Venables] have partly themselves to blame for the current situation because of the way in which they have demonised him."There are concerns that the media behaved irresponsibly in its reporting of the new allegations against Venables, despite warnings that revealing his new identity during criminal proceedings put his right to a fair trial at risk.Hugh Tomlinson QC, at Matrix chambers, said: "The media at the time of his arrest for this new offence were pretty scandalous. There were all kinds of stories that were based on very dubious sources. The inevitability is if his new identity is revealed he would have to be given another one at massive public expense. If not, he would be the victim of lynch mob vengeance. Once you accept this is the case, then all these reporting restrictions are the only way to deal with it."Bean's decision this week that only he would be allowed to watch Venables' plea in court via video link was criticised in court by Anthony Hudson QC, representing a large section of the national media, who said it was a "very serious departure" from the principle of open justice. "This is the first time ever that such a course has been adopted in relation to an adult criminal defendant," he said.But the judge said he did not think it was an essential part of criminal proceedings that the public should be able to look at the defendant at the time of sentencing or before.These debates are further complicated by the controversies surrounding the original trial, the intense media coverage of it, and ongoing questions over whether Venables and Thompson should have been tried, as children, for murder in an adult court at all.
