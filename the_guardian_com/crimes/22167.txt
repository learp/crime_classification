Madeleine McCann's father has returned to a Portuguese court in the hope that he can give evidence at his family's libel case against a former local police chief who claims Madeleine's abduction was faked.Gerry McCann wants to testify in the case against Gonçalo Amaral, who published a book about Madeleine's disappearance in May 2007.The McCanns say the former detective's claims in the book The Truth of the Lie, including suggestions that they hid their daughter's body after she died in an accident and then faked her abduction, damaged the hunt for Madeleine and exacerbated their anguish.If successful in the case, the family stands to gain around £1m in damages.Gerry McCann was left frustrated after flying to Portugal last week, when proceedings were adjourned because one of Amaral's lawyers could not be present.Arriving at the Palace of Justice in Lisbon on Wednesday morning, McCann said he was not sure what would happen "after last week"."We are here to listen to the judge and hopefully be heard," he told reporters.He travelled to the Portuguese capital with his sister, Trish Cameron, and his wife Kate McCann's mother, Susan Healy, who are both expected to appear as witnesses in the case.Kate McCann attended the court last month on the first day of the case, telling reporters she was in Portugal to "stop the damage" she believes is being caused to the search for her daughter.The court has heard how she had suicidal thoughts after Amaral claimed she had covered up her daughter's death.Psychologist Alan Pike said that after the publication of the former police chief's book in July 2008, Kate McCann "thought about not being around any more".Madeleine, who was nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on 3 May 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.Amaral, who initially led the inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance, was removed from the case in October 2007 after criticising UK police.British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July this year and believe she could still be alive.The Portuguese investigation into Madeleine's disappearance is officially closed.The case, in which Amaral denies defamation, is expected to finish hearing evidence in November.
