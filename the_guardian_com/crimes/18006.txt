The volume of VAT "carousel" fraud was far worse than believed in the first half of the year, official data showed yesterday. But a dramatic fall in July trading levels suggests Revenue & Customs may be getting to grips with the crime.Monthly trade figures for July released by the Office for National Statistics showed an unchanged trade deficit of £3.8bn but had a £6.5bn upward revision to the Revenue's estimates of carousel fraud in the first half of the year to about £23bn, the same as for the whole of 2005 and nearly eight times the level of 2004.Missing trader intra-community fraud (MTIC), better known as carousel fraud, involves the repeated import and export of small, high-value items such as computer chips or mobile phones with the aim of reclaiming VAT at each crossing of a European Union border. The fraud has existed since the mid-1990s but has exploded over the past year as criminals have developed "virtual" frauds, which do not need real goods moved.The Revenue estimated losses for the 2004-05 financial year at £1.1bn-£1.9bn on activity of £3bn. With activity likely to be at least 10 times higher this year, VAT losses could reach more than £10bn, though official estimates will not be available until later this year.The number of Revenue staff investigating VAT fraud has doubled this year to 1,000, with several high-profile arrests and convictions recently. Officials believe they may be regaining the upper hand.Revenue & Customs issued monthly fraud estimates yesterday showing a fall in activity to £1.6bn in July, down from more than £4bn in each of the previous four months. It said this was not just a blip in the figures and it had "a comprehensive strategy to minimise MTIC losses."In response to the recent increase in transactions linked to attempted fraud, [Revenue & Customs] has significantly strengthened this strategy through a combination of legislation, litigation and operational activity."Operational data shows that the strategy is beginning to have an impact on the level of trading associated with MTIC fraud," it said.As part of the crackdown on alleged VAT fraud, the Dutch authorities raided offices of the First Curaçao International Bank last week, both in the Netherlands and in Curaçao in the Dutch Antilles, on suspicion that the bank may not have a licence and that some clients may be involved in carousel fraud in the Netherlands, Britain and beyond.The raids were carried out in cooperation with Revenue investigators, who searched addresses in Britain on behalf of their Dutch counterparts. Curaçao is a dependent territory of the Netherlands.
