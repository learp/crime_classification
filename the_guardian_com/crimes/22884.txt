The Scottish government has been accused of failing to tackle wildlife crime after the latest figures disclosed that 2009 was one of the worst years on record for bird of prey poisonings.The Scottish environment minister, Roseanna Cunningham, said that 27 protected birds of prey were proven to have been poisoned last year, including two golden eagles, 19 buzzards and four red kites, in 22 separate incidents.An updated map of persecution "hotspots" confirmed that the Angus glens in the southern Cairngorms, the Borders south of Edinburgh and Perthshire remained areas where the greatest number of confirmed incidents took place.Cunningham admitted that after only 16 poisoning cases were detected in 2006, these "appalling crimes" marked a return to the high level recorded in 2007, when 27 birds of prey were also poisoned, and close to the record figure of 34 in 2006.Sporting estates and grouse moors are widely blamed for the problem, where birds of prey are seen by game managers as a threat to grouse, pheasant and partridge stocks. The new figures showed that since 2005, 121 birds of prey had been poisoned â€“ a statistic which does not include trapping, shooting, nest disturbance and undetected incidents."This continued persecution of our precious wildlife is simply incomprehensible," Cunningham said. "Poisoning is an arbitrary method of killing which poses serious risks to other animals, and potentially people, in our countryside."The protection of Scotland's wildlife has never before occupied such a prominent position politically or in terms of the law. I am hugely grateful to those partners working together to tackle these appalling crimes and I hope that our joint efforts will result in a safer environment for our birds of prey."The rise in poisonings came despite the attempts by the governing Scottish National party (SNP) and police to crack down on persecution. Elaine Murray, Labour's environment spokeswoman in the Scottish parliament, said: "In order to tackle poisonings, we have called for estates to be named and shamed where foul play is involved. The former [environment] minister Mike Russell pledged to get tough on wildlife crime but we've seen precious little action from the SNP. These figures today show it is time for robust action not just warm words."The new figures have alarmed conservation groups, who fear the SNP's efforts to improve prosecution success rates have failed to be properly implemented.Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species at RSPB Scotland, said: "Experience tells us that [these figures] represent just a fraction of the true scale of this illegal activity, which persist with shocking regularity in some areas of Scotland. We ask the authorities to deploy the full range of sanctions against the perpetrators of this indiscriminate activity."Lord Hopetoun, director of the Scottish Rural Property and Business Association, the main landowners' organisation, said the high rate of incidents recorded could be due to increased awareness and policing. "Our position remains clear: wildlife crime should not be tolerated and should be punished accordingly," he said. "We remain committed to eradicating this scourge of our countryside."
