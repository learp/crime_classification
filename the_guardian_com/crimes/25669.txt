The pop star George Michael had a cocktail of legal and illegal drugs in his system when he was found slumped at the wheel of his Mercedes, a London court heard today.Prosecutor Andrew Torrington told Brent magistrates court that tests showed the 43-year-old singer, who admitted driving while unfit earlier this month, had a sleeping drug and a therapeutic quantity of an anti-depressant in his system, along with the illegal dance drug GHB - a class C substance.Mr Torrington said cannabis was also found in Michael's blood, but the prosecution did not maintain that this was the cause of his intoxication.Michael, who was not present at today's hearing, was discovered semi-conscious in his vehicle in Cricklewood, north London, on October 1 last year after police received calls of a car blocking a junction.Michael Grieve, mitigating, argued that the former Wham! star's condition was caused by prescription drugs.He said there was a strong body of opinion that said a sleeping drug was the most likely explanation for his state, adding it was possible that GHB could be present in the blood without any illegal substances having been taken.The court heard that although GHB was banned, its effects could be created by legal substances including a drug called GBL. Mr Grieve agreed with the district judge, Katherine Marshall, that the level of the singer's unfitness could be viewed as high.He said there was no dispute as to the description of Michael's condition as being semi-conscious at the wheel. However, in terms of considering sentence, he told the district judge: "One looks at the unfitness, not the cause of it. Whatever the level is, that's all you need to look at."On May 8, Michael - whose case is listed under his real name, Georgios Panayiotou - told the court he "did something very stupid, and I am very ashamed since doing it".He claimed he was "very distressed" by the case, and was perfectly aware he did something "very wrong" by attempting to drive.Since then, he has said he is addicted to prescription drugs and believes the world would be a better place if more people smoked marijuana, making his comments in a TV interview with Michael Parkinson screened on May 19.He attributed his erratic behaviour to an attention seeking and "self-destructive" impulse brought on by the death of his mother a decade ago.Michael faces a maximum six-month jail term, but his guilty plea and first time conviction means the judge is likely to sentence more leniently.Judge Marshall today adjourned sentence until June 8, the day before Michael is due to play the first concert at the new Wembley stadium as part of his current European tour.Michael's Cricklewood arrest was the second time in eight months police had taken action after finding him in a car. Last March, he accepted a police caution for possession of cannabis after being found slumped in his vehicle in February.After that arrest, which happened near Hyde Park Corner, in central London, he said it was "my own stupid fault, as usual".The singer, who continues to enjoy a huge following, last year told a television programme about his drug use. "This stuff [cannabis] keeps me sane and happy," he said on the South Bank Show."I could write without it ... if I were sane and happy. I'd say it's a great drug - but obviously it's not very healthy. You can't afford to smoke it if you've got anything else to do."
