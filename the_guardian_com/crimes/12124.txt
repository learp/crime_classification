A telephone engineer repeatedly shot himself in the chest with a nail-gun and then claimed he had been attacked by a gang of youths in the hope of getting criminal injuries compensation, a court heard yesterday.In August, David Russell, 38, was found staggering near his home in Gloucester with seven two-inch nails embedded in his ribcage and forearm. Doctors said he nearly died after one nail came within 1cm of piercing his diaphragm. Another was an inch from his heart. Medical staff spent more than an hour removing the nails.Russell told police at his hospital bedside that a gang of three youths had assaulted him, adding: "These people must be caught and punished."But Gloucester crown court heard that the injuries had been self-inflicted and Russell had received more than Â£4,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority for a previous fictitious assault. He pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and to a similar hoax three years ago.Judge Jamie Tabor warned Russell he faced a jail sentence and asked for him to be examined by a psychiatrist."There are some complex issues here," Judge Tabor said. "This is a very serious offence and he is in danger of losing his liberty. I think Mr Russell is going to need psychiatric assistance."Police, who used forensic science techniques to examine the scene and studied CCTV, later arrested and questioned two men. They were subsequently released without charge.The court heard Russell had recently lost his job and was under financial pressure to support his partner, who was on maternity leave.
