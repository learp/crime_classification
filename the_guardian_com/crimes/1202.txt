A new wave of cigarette smuggling is hitting the United Kingdom, with counterfeit brands manufactured abroad destined for sale in shops and on street corners, Sir David Varney, the head of Revenue and Customs, told MPs last night.The threat comes after customs officers successfully smashed a racket which involved British-made cigarettes being exported to places such as Andorra and Kaliningrad, Russia, then smuggled back into the UK.Sir David told MPs that Britain now faced "a new threat" from counterfeit cigarettes as smugglers turned to them following the clampdown on the illegal sale of genuine cigarettes. He warned MPs that the percentage of illicit cigarettes in Britain was likely to rise when new figures are published later this year.Revenue and Customs had managed to cut the illicit share of the market from 20% of all sales to 15%. New figures are expected to show that this will rise again to between 16% and 17% this year. The cigarettes tend to sell at £2.50 a packet on street corners compared with £4.20 to £4.50 in the shops.The revenue has just sealed a new agreement with three of Britain's leading manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco and BAT Industries, to police the trade in cigarette exports to ensure that millions of packets do not get smuggled back into the country. The agreement is about to be backed by laws which will lead to British manufacturers being fined the amount of lost revenue if their brands end up being illegally sold here. The fines could cost the industry million of pounds if it does not control the trade.The agreements followed a row last year with Imperial Tobacco, which was accused by MPs of turning a blind eye to the trade because it would boost cigarette consumption.Mr Varney told the Commons public accounts committee last night that the new agreements had been very successful, with the percentage of brands being illegally smuggled back to Britain falling from 75% of all cigarettes exported to some countries to as low as 35%."The trouble is now cigarette smugglers are turning to counterfeit products which are being manufactured in the countries where they used to smuggle brands back to Britain. We are having to gather new intelligence on how this has been done."Customs officers have had two successes in stopping fake cigarettes getting into Britain in the last three months - they seized 3m being smuggled from China to Belfast, hidden in a container ship carrying plate glass. They also seized tens of thousands of fake cigarettes and hand-rolled tobacco in Edinburgh which had been manufactured in Poland.Edward Leigh, the Tory chairman of the committee, said: "This new trade in counterfeit cigarettes and the growth in illicit sales is very alarming."Customs had also diverted people from checking on tobacco smuggling to policing a growing trade in heroin and cocaine, but Sir David assured MPs he had now strengthened the tobacco smuggling teams to meet the new threat.
