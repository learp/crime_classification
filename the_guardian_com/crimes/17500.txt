A prisoner serving life for attempted rape has won £7m in the national lottery.Iorworth Hoare, 52, was jailed for life at Leeds crown court in 1989. He was on temporary release from a Middlesbrough bail hostel when his numbers came up in last Saturday's Lotto Extra draw. Hoare, formerly of Seacroft Gate, Leeds, was convicted of attempting to rape a 60-year-old woman in a park in the city, after a series of crimes which included one rape, two attempted rapes and three indecent assaults. According to the Sun, Hoare began a series of sex attacks while he was still in his 20s and was sentenced to a total of 18 years between 1973 and 1987. Home Office guidelines allow prisoners in open conditions - such as day release or community projects - to take part in the lottery and claim any prize they may win. Hoare was on weekend leave from Middlesbrough's South Bank bail hostel when he won his £7,039,469 fortune. He was jailed in 1989 after he was trapped by a photograph he sent to a television station in an effort to be chosen as a contestant for the Winner Takes All television quiz show. A Prison Service spokesman confirmed last night that a prisoner had won the lottery. He said: "We are aware a prisoner on release on a temporary licence has participated in the lottery and we understand that he has won a substantial amount." After his the win Hoare was moved to a closed prison for "security and his own safety". It is understood a reassessment of his security status is being carried out.
