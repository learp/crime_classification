Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs is today in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack.The 74-year-old was taken from Belmarsh prison to the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Woolwich, south London, last night. His spokeswoman said that he was also being treated for pneumonia."The initial diagnosis is a suspected heart attack with very heavy pneumonia," she told Reuters.Biggs has suffered from poor health since voluntarily returning to the UK from Brazil in May 2001 after spending 36 years on the run. He has been held in the hospital wing of Belmarsh.His 29-year-old son, Michael, said: "My father is a very sick man, and I have absolutely no doubt that the nature of his imprisonment has contributed greatly to this."He was only ever a not very good thief, who has been straight now for over 30 years. How much punishment does this government really think he deserves?"Biggs had served less than two years of the sentence imposed for his part in the 1963 mail train heist before escaping from Wandsworth prison. Along with 11 other gang members, he stole £2.6m - the equivalent of around £30m today.He was caught and sentenced the following year, but escaped after 15 months, fleeing first to Australia and then, as police closed in, to Brazil, whose government allowed him to stay. His playboy lifestyle there turned him into a criminal legend, making him the subject of several films. Biggs was brought back to the UK following a deal with the Sun newspaper, which paid him up to £250,000 to secure his return.His attempt to launch a last-ditch appeal against his 30-year jail sentence was dismissed in the High Court last October. A judge described it as "hopeless" and "completely misconceived".
