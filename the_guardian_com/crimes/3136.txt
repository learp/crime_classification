A high-ranking policeman who befriended an elderly widow bought her house for half its true value and then spent years plundering her assets until she was penniless, a court heard yesterday.In May 1997, a year after being granted power of attorney over Eileen Savage's finances, Detective Chief Inspector Peter Salkeld sold her £105,000 home to himself for £55,000. Salkeld, of Sussex police, sold it again some two years later for £157,200, Maidstone crown court heard.David Walbank, prosecuting, said that Savage, now aged 93 and living in a care home in Hove, East Sussex, was not mentally incapable at the time. But he added: "She may not have understood the extent to which the price he paid represented an undervalue. What is clear, however, is that she was at that time deceived as to the defendant's true intentions."If she had known then what lay in the future, that within a few years she would be penniless and all but abandoned, it is inconceivable that she would have transferred her home in that way."The court heard that Salkeld stripped Savage's assets between May 1997 and January 2001. After gaining power of attorney over Savage's building society account, he allegedly stole £11,750 from her account for a sports car, and wrote cheques to himself worth £70,000.The court heard that by January 2001, Savage's capital assets had been largely depleted. She no longer owned a property, her building society account had been closed, and another account, with HSBC, held a cash reserve of just over £11,000.Salkeld is then alleged to have used Savage's HSBC bank card to make five separate cash withdrawals in March and April 2001, totalling £600.Withdrawals from her account continued right up until Salkeld's arrest in January 2006, the last being only seven days before his arrest, the court heard.The court heard that Salkeld duped Brighton and Hove city council in August 2001 into funding the care and accommodation costs of Savage, claiming that she had not owned a property for the last 15 years, despite having sold it himself.It was also alleged that in 2005 Salkeld bought goods for his own personal use on a Sussex police credit card. He is also accused of deceiving his employer by claiming a grant from the Sussex police welfare fund for £1,100 to buy caravanning equipment.Salkeld, 42 and from Shoreham in West Sussex, denies 19 charges of theft, obtaining property by deception and obtaining a money transfer by deception. The trial continues.
