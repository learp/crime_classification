Tony Martin told students at the Oxford Union last night he was "not a shooting man" and did not enjoy using guns.The farmer was answering questions at the debating society just months after ending a jail sentence for the manslaughter of a teenage burglar, Fred Barras. He defended himself for killing the 16-year-old with a shotgun at his isolated farmhouse in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, but said Barras had not deserved to die. Martin, 58, who served two-thirds of his five-year sentence and was freed in July, said: "I am not a shooting man. I myself do not enjoy shooting. But I have had access to guns all my life." He denied feeling any regret, saying: "I do not really see how I can be responsible for the actions of other people." But when asked if Barras had deserved to die, replied: "No." Danny Kemp, PA
