The wife of a man murdered this week as he attempted to foil an armed robbery yesterday pleaded for help in finding his killer, as police admitted that the public response to their investigation had been disappointing.Naila Hussain said her husband, Tasawar, who died from a single shot to the chest after he confronted robbers of a Bradford travel agency was a brave man who had always sought to help others. "Tassy would do anything for anybody," she said. "He just put others before himself." Accompanied by her two sisters, Mrs Hussain, 34, wept as she told a press conference: "I miss him so much. He was such a wonderful person. We were making plans for our unborn child the day he was murdered." She added: "The man who did this has broken my heart. I want him found." But West Yorkshire police say they have received very few calls from the public since Mr Hussain's death on Monday. "Hundreds of people must have passed the crime scene on Monday evening but not enough people are ringing us with information," said Detective Superintendent Allan Doherty. "At this stage of the inquiry I would have expected to have received hundreds of calls. So far we have had about 50."
