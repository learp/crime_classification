One of two men accused of being hired by British newlywed Shrien Dewani to kill his bride on their honeymoon in Cape Town has been jailed for 25 years after admitting murder.Victim Anni Dewani's family said they were happy with the sentence given to Mziwamadoda Qwabe but would not know what really happened until Shrien Dewani faces trial in South Africa. He has previously pledged to fight to clear his name but remains in a UK hospital under police supervision pending a decision to extradite him.Anni Dewani, 28, was shot dead and her body found in an abandoned taxi in Cape Town's Gugulethu township in November 2010.South Africa's national prosecuting authority said on Wednesday that Qwabe also admitted kidnapping, robbery and the illegal possession of a firearm. A second South African national, Xolile Mngeni, still faces charges over the killing.  Shrien and Anni Dewani. Photograph: PAAnni Dewani's uncle Ashok Hindocha said: "We are just happy. Two of the accused have now pleaded guilty. Now we want to know what really happened to Anni, why they killed her."Hindocha said the family were still unable to begin mourning because of the proceedings. "With a case like this, everything comes back again," he said. "The way we feel is that we are going through legal torture. It is extremely stressful for the family."I would have been much, much happier if all the accused were in South Africa and cross-examination took place and the truth could be found."To us, Anni is still not dead. We haven't started the mourning process. We can't. We need to know what happened and then we can start working our way through it."
