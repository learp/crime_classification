Three men allegedly caught with a step-by-step kidnap guide outside their intended victim's house were cleared of any wrongdoing today.Jurors accepted that what initially appeared to be an unusual aide-de-memoire for the would-be snatch, was nothing more than "fantasy" and the result of a "fertile imagination". They also decided a so-called "abduction toolkit", was simply decorating equipment.In the dock at Southwark crown court, London, were Carl Wiltshire, 21, of St Albans, Hertfordshire; Daniel Joseph, 18, of Golders Green, north London, and unrelated Pierre Joseph, 20, of Dagenham, Essex. They were unanimously cleared of one count of conspiring to kidnap and blackmail on December 15 last year.They were also found not guilty of two counts of possessing a "silver imitation firearm" – a cigarette lighter – with intent to commit the offences.The court heard the three were spotted shortly before midnight yards from the north London home of alleged would-be victim David Bodman, once a "wealthy benefactor" to Wiltshire and his family. The police were called and minutes later all three defendants were arrested.Jurors were told the so-called abduction guide found on Daniel Joseph began with the word "blindfold" and continued: "Ask him 'Are you Mr David Bodman?'." The crown claimed the list of prompts even suggested "yes" as the likely answer.It continued: "You had better come with us whether you like it or not. We are not going to hurt you but we will if we have to."The court heard it went on to mention having followed him, spoke of harming his niece and warned of retribution if the police were involved.Jurors were also told about a rucksack he was carrying containing an alleged kidnap toolkit including masks, paint stripper, a roll of duct tape, a small hammer, and glass cutters.But the trio insisted they were innocent, with Daniel Joseph explaining the alleged abduction instructions were no more than scribblings about a "fantasy kidnap" boosted by a "fertile imagination". He added a "scream" mask found by police had been left over from Halloween while the tools were to redecorate the home of Wiltshire's mother.Wiltshire agreed, adding there was no plan to do anything illegal. Pierre Joseph told the court: "I knew nothing about anything."
