Labour is broadly supportive of plans to decriminalise people who do not pay their television licence fee ahead of a House of Commons vote on whether to review the law this week, sources have said.After the coalition said it backed the idea of a consultation on scrapping the crime, Labour will also make clear that it is a strong supporter of the BBC but thinks it is difficult to justify sending people who do not pay their television licence fee to prison.The idea of decriminalisation has been pushed by more than 150 MPs from all parties, led by Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen. Many Conservatives were pushing for immediate decriminalisation but agreed a compromise with the government allowing for a long consultation about the idea.This pushes the decision into the next parliament and makes it more likely the law will be reconsidered as part of the BBC's charter review of 2017, meaning there is more time to investigate how much it could cost the corporation and how the shortfall would be made up.Bridgen, a Conservative MP, has proposed making non-payment a civil rather than criminal offence through an amendment to the forthcoming deregulation bill.The government then indicated its partial support when Oliver Heald, the solicitor general, put down a joint amendment with a promise to review the issue. This is what will be voted on by MPs during the committee stage of the bill on Tuesday.The BBC has raised concerns the proposal could lead to reduced revenue to the tune of £200m and force it to axe services but also appeared relieved that it has been given a reprieve from any instant change in the law.Responding to the government's position last week, a spokesman for the corporation said: "The BBC is content that this proposal balances a timely examination of this issue with a proper review of the options, while not taking any decisions prior to charter review."A BBC Trust spokesman said: "This is an issue that should be discussed in the round, including the potential impact on licence fee income and BBC output, with any decisions made as part of the charter review process. This amendment appears to be in line with that."The review will have to start within three months of the deregulation bill passing and take no longer than a year. Its findings will be presented to the BBC Trust as well as both houses of parliament.Cases of people accused of evading the £145.50 fee accounted for more than one in 10 of all criminal prosecutions last year – with 155,000 convicted and fined.The amendment, due to be voted on next week, said the review should start within three months of the deregulation act being passed and complete it no later than a year after it began.Bridgen also calls for a move "to replace the TV licensing offences with civil monetary penalties payable to the BBC".
