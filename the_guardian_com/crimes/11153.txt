A police chief praised the courage of officers who suffered stab wounds after being called to a disturbance in north London on Saturday morning.Chief Superintendent Dal Babu, borough commander for Harrow, said police had been "inundated by messages of support, for the enormous bravery of the officers who were stabbed, and their colleagues".Four officers were injured and three of them remained in hospital on Sunday, undergoing surgery and treatment. "The local community has been stopping officers in the street to inquire on the condition of the officers and thank the police for their bravery," said Babu."We all owe a huge debt to the officers who put the safety of members of the public over and above their own."The officers, all men, were hurt after they attempted to speak to a man in Kingsbury Road, Harrow. He ran away before entering a butcher's shop and grabbing a knife. One officer in his 20s suffered a stab wound in his stomach, another in his 20s had head injuries and a wound in his arm, and a third, in his 30s, was stabbed in the leg. The fourth officer, also in his 20s, had a broken hand and thumb. He was allowed home on Saturday.Babu, who visited the injured officers and passed on the public's thanks, said: "The next few weeks for these officers will be challenging as they reflect on their outstanding bravery in protecting our community and the impact this has had on them personally. I feel truly humbled by the humility of the officers who were injured, and their colleagues, as they talked about this horrific incident."These incidents are rare but when they occur it is important that we have brave officers who will not hesitate in dealing with these frightening situations."A 32-year old man arrested on suspicion of attempted murder is in custody at a west London police station.
