A trial of strength was under way between the tabloid media and the government over the reasons for the decision to send Jon Venables back to prison.Gordon Brown tried to defuse growing populist anger over the decision not to disclose what Venables – one of the killers of the toddler James Bulger –had done to breach the terms of his release on a life licence, nine years after he was freed and given a new identity."What we are talking about is a totally abhorrent crime that happened some years ago but that still, rightly so, disgusts and offends the British people. I can rightly understand the public outrage, even after so many years," the prime minister said. "But I want to be absolutely clear here that what matters is that the justice system is allowed to run its course and that justice is done, whatever wrongs are committed. The justice system must be allowed to take the action that is necessary. That is what people would expect and what is going to happen."Brown was defending the decision of the justice secretary, Jack Straw, not to disclose the reasons for the recall of Venables.In 1993 Venables and Robert Thompson became Britain's most notorious child murderers since Mary Bell when, at the age of 10, they abducted the two-year-old James Bulger from a Bootle shopping centre and left him dead on a railway line two miles away.James's mother, Denise Fergus, yesterday used her Twitter account to thank her supporters: "ive always said that there are more good people then bad in this world an the messages im still receiving proves it thanks to everyone x." Her number of Twitter followers has rocketed from 70 to 2,178 in less than 48 hours.An intense national debate over whether Venables should be hated or helped is underway, sometimes couched in the most lurid terms. The prison system in England and Wales is also awash with rumour over Venables's new identity.David Blunkett, home secretary at time the Bulger killers were freed in 2001, said he had made clear then that their release on licence would mean their being under supervision for the remainder of their lives. "It is vital the parole board act with firmness and clarity to send a clear message to all those on life licence that society means business," he said. The board is due to decide, in the next three weeks, how long Venables will stay in prison now.
