Ian Huntley and Maxine Carr, who face trial over the deaths of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, appeared at the Old Bailey yesterday.The pair's trial is scheduled to begin next week. Legal issues were debated during yesterday's hearing, the details of which cannot be reported. Mr Huntley, 29, the former caretaker at Soham Village college in Cambridgeshire, denies murdering the 10-year-olds in the summer of 2002. At a previous hearing he admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice by lying about Ms Carr's whereabouts at the time of the girls' disappearance. Ms Carr, 26, who was the girls' classroom assistant at St Andrew's primary school in Soham, denies attempting to pervert the course of justice and two counts of assisting an offender. Holly's parents, Kevin and Nicola, and Jessica's, Leslie and Sharon, also attended the pre-trial hearing. Mr Huntley and Ms Carr were arrested weeks after the best friends went missing on August 4 last year. The girls' bodies were found on August 17 at Lakenheath, Suffolk, 15 miles from their homes.
