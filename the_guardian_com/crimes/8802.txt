A science teacher appeared in court yesterday charged with the attempted murder of one of his students. Peter Harvey, 49, is accused of attacking 14-year-old Jack Waterhouse at All Saints' Roman Catholic school in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on Wednesday morning. Paramedics found the teenager unconscious in a pool of blood at the entrance to a classroom in the school's science block. Waterhouse is said to be in a stable condition at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, where he is being treated for bleeding on the brain and a fractured skull.Harvey, of Rannoch Drive, Mansfield, spoke only to confirm his name and address during a 10-minute hearing at the town's magistrates' court. He was remanded in custody to appear at Nottingham Crown Court by videolink on 27 July. Former pupils arrived at the court with letters of support and good luck cards. One girl, who wished not to be named, broke down in tears outside the courtroom after seeing her former teacher in the dock. Another ex-pupil, 18-year-old Joseph Smith, said: "I'm really upset to see my ex-teacher in the dock. I just wanted to come here today to show support. He was my form tutor and he was a good teacher. I got a bit emotional."
