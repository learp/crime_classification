Almost half of London's children have been victims of crime against themselves or their property, according to a survey.An opinion poll for the mayor of London revealed that young people shared the anxieties which made crime and antisocial behaviour a pressing topic for their parents.According to the research, by ICM, one in five children in London complained of being bullied and a similar number said someone had taken their property. But the majority said they felt safe in their localities, at school and on public transport. The number of young people involved in crime was decreasing.Children also felt an affinity with London as a city. Seventy-nine per cent said they were satisfied with life in London and 80% were happy with their neighbourhoods. One in three were concerned about the environmental damage caused by pollution and 36% complained at the level of traffic congestion.The survey of 1,000 children aged 11 to 16 accompanies the release, today, of Mr Livingstone's second State of London Children's Report, an academic work analysing the social indicators as they affect young people.Mr Livingstone said: "There is a reducing trend in the number of children who are killed or seriously injured on the roads. There has been a marked rise in the proportion of pupils achieving five or more passes at A*-C GCSE or GNVQ levels, particularly in inner London."Young Londoners were less likely to smoke cigarettes, and more likely to consume fruit and vegetables than young people elsewhere, though there is still much scope for improvement."
