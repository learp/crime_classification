Three children who were found dead near their father's body in a disused quarry had suffered wounds to their necks believed to have been inflicted with a hunting knife, an inquest has heard.The bodies of Ceri Fuller, 35, his son Samuel, 12, and daughters Rebecca, eight, and Charlotte, seven, were discovered at the quarry in Shropshire.A joint inquest into the four deaths heard that a fingerprint matching paper-mill worker Fuller was found on a bloodstained bowie-type knife recovered from the scene.Pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar told the hearing on Wednesday that all three children had suffered a "large incised wound" to the throat.Samuel died from a single wound to his neck, while his sisters both died from multiple stab injuries, including wounds to the chest. Rebecca had been stabbed five times in the chest and her sister had suffered four chest wounds, the inquest was told.During harrowing evidence, Kolar confirmed Samuel and Rebecca had also suffered "defensive" injuries to their hands, suggesting they had tried to ward off the blows.Fuller, of Coleford, Gloucestershire, was found dead at the foot of an 18-metre (60ft) cliff at the quarry with a fractured skull and other injuries consistent with a fall from a height.No traces of either drugs or alcohol were found in Fuller's body. At the time of the deaths, West Mercia police said one line of inquiry was that Fuller had killed his children before taking his own life.Fuller's Land Rover Freelander was seen parking up near the quarry, Poles Coppice at Pontesbury Hill, near Shrewsbury, on Friday 13 July last year â€“ three days before the bodies were found.In statements read to the court, friends of Fuller, a production line supervisor, described him as a reserved family man who went walking in the country with colleagues.Paper-mill employee Alan Norton said Fuller had appeared to be his normal self before he failed to attend work for a night shift on 12 July."I didn't notice anything different about him from his usual self and I didn't notice any changes in his behaviour or personality," Norton said.Other statements from Fuller's colleagues described him as a good listener who rarely instigated conversations.Peter Morgan, whose statement was read to the inquest, said: "I thought him to be a reserved type of person, very mild-mannered and softly spoken. I am not aware of any reason as to why he may have taken his own life or that of his children."Steven Bovill, who worked alongside Fuller at the mill in Lydney, Gloucestershire, said in his statement to the hearing: "On July 11 he seemed to be his normal self. He was always calm and level-headed. I have no idea if he was having any personal issues or family problems."The hearing, expected to last three days, continues.
