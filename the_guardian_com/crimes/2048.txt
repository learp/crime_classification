A student was duped when he handed over £600 for a laptop computer and given a computer bag filled with potatoes, police said today. The student was approached by a man who offered to sell him the computer in a car park at the rear of Debenhams in Portsmouth, Hampshire. The man posing as a seller, believed to be between 40 and 50 years old, showed the student a Sony laptop in a carry case in the back of a car. The 27-year-old agreed to buy it for £600. After handing over the money, he was given an identical laptop bag, which he later discovered contained only potatoes. Hampshire detectives are linking the scam to almost identical incidents in London, Wolverhampton and Wiltshire."I would advise members of the public to refrain from buying high value goods from people out of the back of cars or vans," PC Allison Fraser, of Hampshire police, said. "If you do choose to make a purchase, ensure that you have the goods before you hand over any money."Police are searching for a blue Ford Escort estate, registration number M235 GDD, in connection with the scam.
