A pilot scheme using a new generation of road surveillance cameras designed to help intercept criminals is to be extended to half the police forces in England and Wales from this summer, the Home Office announced yesterday.The cost of the cameras and police intercept patrols is to be financed from the revenue from new fixed-penalty fines for low-level motoring offences including driving without insurance, car tax or MOT. Home Office ministers hope the new scheme will lead to more than 200,000 extra arrests a year and help to meet the government's ambitious target of cutting car crime by 30% by 2004. The latest figures show car crime has only fallen by 7.8% since the target was set. Cameras using a number plate recognition system can check 3,000 number plates an hour on vehicles travelling at up to 100mph. The numbers are checked against the police national computer and other databases, with suspicious cars then intercepted. The Home Office said that in trials in nine forces, more than 3,000 people were arrested - 10 times the national average. More than Â£100,000 worth of illegal drugs were seized, and more than 300 stolen vehicles recovered. The Home Office minister Bob Ainsworth said: "The majority of arrests were for criminal offences such as drugs, theft or being the subject of an arrest warrant, rather than motoring offences." He said the scheme meant honest motorists were less likely to be pulled over, and the use of fixed-penalty fines meant that those who broke the law paid for its policing.
