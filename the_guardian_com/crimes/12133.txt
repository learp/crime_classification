A study published at the beginning of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week shows the scale of ID theft in the UK. Identity fraud is increasing at a rapid rate. In the first nine months of 2009 more than 59,000 criminal acts of impersonation have been recorded. This is an alarming 36% increase from the same period in 2008, with South-east London and Birmingham the most common areas of identity fraud and account takeover.   London is the hotspot for ID fraud in the UK, followed by BirminghamIdentity Fraud is one of the UK's fastest growing crimes, affecting individuals and businesses alike. The crime is of greater concern than other more traditional illegal activities such as burglary, mugging and pickpocketing. Around 81% of the British public are concerned about becoming a victim of identity theft according to a report published today by the fraud prevention service CIFAS. However despite this statistic, most consumers and businesses are not taking steps to protect themselves. 22% access their bank details at work or in internet cafes, while 79% of businesses make no effort to destroy sensitive material that is thrown away or recycled. The National Identity Fraud Prevention Week is a nationwide effort to raise awareness in the battle against identity fraud. It takes place from 12 to 19 October and is supported by the Metropolitan Police, Fellowes, National Fraud Strategic Authority, the Federation of Small Businesses, Equifax, CIFAS - the UK's Fraud Prevention Service, Callcredit, Experian, Association of Chief Police Officers, the Home Office's identity and passport service, British Chambers of Commerce, British Retail Consortium and the Royal Mail.
