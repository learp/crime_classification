Two teenagers accused of beating 18-year-old hairdresser Michael Causer to death in what police believe was a homophobic attack, were today told they would be charged with his murder.Shortly after the attack in Huyton, Merseyside, on July 26, James O'Connor, and Gavin Alker, both 19, were charged with grievous bodily harm with intent. But as Michael died in hospital eight days later from his injuries, they now face upgraded charges.At Liverpool crown court today, Nicholas Johnson, QC, prosecuting, told the pair that they would be charged with murder at their next court appearance on November 17.Both were bailed until then by the Recorder of Liverpool Judge Henry Globe QC, who said that as magistrates had previously given the pair bail, he would not interfere with their decision. Both of the accused were "extremely fortunate" not to be remanded in custody, he said.Bail conditions stipulate a 7pm to 7am curfew and electronic tags for O'Connor, and Alker, 19, who are both formerly of Huyton but are now of Runcorn, Cheshire. They are also not allowed to enter Merseyside except to see their legal team, and must not contact prosecution witnesses.A provisional trial date was fixed for January 26.Christopher Douglas, 19, of Huyton, has been charged with witness intimidation in connection with the attack.A book of condolence has been opened at Liverpool Town Hall and a vigil is planned in Michael's memory.
