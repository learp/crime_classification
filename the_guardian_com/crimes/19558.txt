The parents of Stephen Lawrence are preparing to issue writs for damages against both the Metropolitan police and the five men suspected of his murder, the Guardian has learned.Suing the five would mean that for the first time they would have to give evidence in court under oath on their whereabouts on the night of the murder. At the inquest they refused to answer questions, and a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family collapsed before they were called.These new moves are being worked out while the police and the Lawrences' solicitor negotiate over what Scotland Yard calls 'an appropriate ex-gratia payment' of compensation. It is believed that a figure close to Â£100,000 has been put on the table, but the family and their advisers are seeking for that to be significantly increased.The fallout from the inquiry into the police murder investigation continued with undiminished intensity yesterday, with Doreen and Neville Lawrence expressing their anger and dismay at Talk Radio for allowing one of the five suspects, Gary Dobson, a two-hour live question and answer session with the public.As with the five's television interviews on ITV's Tonight programme last week, Dobson used the occasion to plead his innocence and portrayed himself as an aggrieved victim.The show went ahead despite a letter from the family expressing their disapproval and threatening an injunction.The writ against the Metropolitan police alleging negligence will be issued before next Thursday the sixth anniversary of Stephen's death. The family see this as a precautionary move, as a civil action for negligence has a six-year limitation.But as the action would break new and controversial ground for English law based on an untested European Court of Human Rights decision last year it is believed that the police would prefer to settle rather than face an expensive court case that might open the door to a ruling that emphatically denies them immunity from negligence actions.A friend of the family, Ros Howells, chairwoman of the Lewisham Race Equality Council, said yesterday: 'You could never compensate anyone for the loss of a son.'The issue now is that these people's lives have been on hold for six years and they have lost a great deal.'As an example, she said, the family had had to move, and to sell their home quickly for a low price. 'One could never even begin to calculate the emotional stuff. Quite frankly, if the police are serious they should be giving them millions.'The suspects' performances on television and radio may have provided ammunition for the family's case against them. This would follow the pattern of the O J Simpson case in the US, in which he was acquitted of murder but found culpable in the civil courts.In a number of new admissions, including one from Dobson yesterday, they have grudgingly accepted they were members of a gang of knife-carrying racists. Contrary to his evidence at the public inquiry, Dobson agreed he had 'racist tendencies' in 1993.He was sneaked into Talk Radio's studio in Oxford Street, London, two hours before the programme went on air at 8am to avoid an Anti-Nazi League demonstration outside.He said he would refuse to submit to a lie detector. 'If you pass a lie detector test no one believes it; if you don't pass a lie detector test everyone believes it,' he said.Dobson claimed that he was living like a recluse with his family and unable to get a job. He was considering writing a book and moving out of London.Asked again if he had anything to do with the murder, he said: 'I will say on my mother's life I am innocent of this crime. We are all innocent.' He also claimed that he had no idea who had killed Stephen and had made no efforts to find out among the close-knit community of Eltham, south-east London, where four of the suspects lived.He had no explanation of why 26 people identified the gang to the police as the murderers within 48 hours.
