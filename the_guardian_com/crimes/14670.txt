The man arrested in connection with the killing of the French students Gabriel Ferez and Laurent Bonomo in London has been taken to hospital, police said today.A Metropolitan police spokesman told the Guardian the man was taken to hospital after handing himself in at a south London police station this morning."It is a precautionary measure," the spokesman added. "Whenever anyone is taken into custody, they are asked a series of questions and, if they have any visible injuries, they are dealt with."The spokesman said the suspect - the second man to be arrested in connection with the double murder inquiry - had yet to be interviewed about the killings."We don't yet know how significant he is to the investigation until that [interview] is carried out," he said.He could not confirm whether the man being detained matched the e-fit released by police yesterday.The computer-generated image shows a white man, aged 30 to 40, wearing a pale baseball cap, a dark top, blue jeans and white trainers.Several people saw the man fleeing the area after the killings. The French students, both 23, were killed in a brutal attack at a flat in New Cross, south-east London, eight days ago. The detective in charge of the inquiry said their injuries were the worst he had ever seen.A 21-year-old man was arrested on Saturday over the killings, but was released without charge yesterday.The bodies of Ferez and Bonomo were found bound, stabbed and set alight in Bonomo's bedsit.Six days before the killings, Bonomo had disturbed an intruder who was stealing a laptop computer. Experts found no evidence of forced entry at the scene, suggesting that door keys could also have been stolen.Two Sony handheld games consoles were also taken, and credit cards were believed to be missing.Forensic tests were carried out on a piece of clothing discovered during searches near the flat. Detectives also contacted the victims' banks to see whether their credit and debit cards had been used since their deaths, and are investigating whether the students were tortured for their pin numbers.Yesterday, Ferez's parents, Francoise and Olivier, appealed to the public to help catch the killer, saying: "As parents, we need the police to find the guilty parties for us to have some kind of explanation."Ferez and Bonomo were living in London while they worked on biochemistry research projects at Imperial College. They were in the second year of a three-year master's degree at the Polytech' Clermont-Ferrand, in central France.Students there will hold a silent procession in memory of their murdered colleagues today.
