The number of people killed during high-speed police chases has more than tripled in the past four years, according to the Police Complaints Authority.Research conducted by the authority found that the police are continuing to put the public at risk by engaging in too many high-speed chases.Its Fatal Pursuit report, published this morning, investigated 85 collisions involving police cars between 1998-2001. They resulted in 91 deaths.Most of the accidents happened on quiet or almost deserted roads. Many were on 30mph town roads and took place on Saturday or Sunday nights.The report recommended that control managers should have more involvement in chases and should take charge of them from the control rooms and that drivers' discretion to chase be reduced.Officers should not be able to pursue cars unless they had a "clear, centrally agreed strategy for attempting to stop the vehicle safely", the report suggested. Unmarked police cars should be banned from taking part in high-speed chases, the report recommended.PCA chairman Sir Alistair Graham said: "Far too many people have died as a result of crashes following police pursuits. We must make every effort to minimise the risk of collision, injury or death in these circumstances."I am most concerned that the numbers of fatalities have continued to grow and there is no sign of them levelling off. If anything the latest figures show the rate is accelerating."The report went on to say: "The police continue to engage in too many pursuits that endanger public safety and the most effective way to reduce this is by increasing management control on the evolution of pursuits and reducing officer discretion about both initiating and continuing with pursuits."Forces may need to consider whether officers who pursue without control room permission, or who fail to adequately communicate risk, or who fail to pull over when instructed to call off a chase by the control room, should be at risk of being disciplined as a result. PCA chairman Sir Alistair Graham said: "Far too many people have died as a result of crashes following police pursuits. We must make every effort to minimise the risk of collision, injury or death in these circumstances.
