She crossed the road and quickened her pace when she realised he was following her. She felt her hair being touched and "heard a metallic sound hit the floor", police said.Turning around, she saw Dixon picking up a pair of scissors and clumps of her hair.The second incident took place at around 9.45pm on 26 October.The victim was shopping in an Asda in Trafford, when she noticed Dixon had walked up and down the aisle twice.He apologised and walked off, dragging the hair with his foot before picking it up and walking off.Detective Constable Lawrence Gallagher from Longsight CID said: "This was a bizarre case and Dixon has never shown any indication as to why he carried out these assaults."He has severely knocked the confidence of both victims. Even though he did not hurt them, it will take them a while for them to get over it."
