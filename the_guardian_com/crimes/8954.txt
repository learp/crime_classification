A mugger knocked a 92-year-old man to the ground as he made a grab for his wallet before fleeing with just £5, in what police have described as a sickening attack.The pensioner was attacked in the communal entrance of the block of flats where he lives alone in Soho, central London, after the assailant followed him through the door.The Metropolitan police have issued CCTV video which shows the robber taking the wallet before leaving the victim stricken on the floor, where he remained for five minutes before managing to get to his feet and take a lift to his flat to dial 999.The widower suffered a shoulder injury but did not need hospital treatment, but police said he was “living in fear of his safety”.The suspect is described as a black man, between 5ft 10in and 6ft, slim and aged 20-30. He was wearing casual dark clothing.DS Gemma Alger of the Westminster serious crime unit said: “This is a totally unprovoked, callous and sickening assault on a defenceless pensioner. The victim is fiercely independent and has lived in London all his life. His confidence has been eroded as a result of the actions of this individual and now he is fearful about going out.“I would urge anyone who has any information on who was responsible to contact us as soon as possible before he targets someone else.”Any information should be given to Westminster serious crime unit on 020 7321 7513 or 101, quoting reference 6504926/15.
