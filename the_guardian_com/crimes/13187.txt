   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Two men were knocked to the ground by a cage fighter in drag after they picked a fight with his friend, a court has heard.Dean Jonathan Gardner, 19, and Jason Andrew Fender, 22, were left dazed after picking on the wrong man during a night out in Swansea city centre.The pair, from Bonymaen, were both intoxicated and aggressive during the early hours of 30 August after drinking several jugs of cocktails.A CCTV camera captured the pair involved in a large brawl outside the city's Escape nightclub which involved a reveller dressed as Spider-Man.The pair are then seen walking along Kingsway before Gardener throws a punch at a man wearing black hotpants and a pink wig.Gardner and then Fender are floored in quick succession by another man wearing a short black dress with stockings and suspenders. When Gardner eventually gets to his feet, he stumbles groggily before falling over again. A short time later, both men were arrested.In Swansea magistrates court on Monday, the pair pleaded guilty to using intimidating behaviour or words.Mark Davies, defending both men, said: "It is an absolute shame two young lads with no convictions bring themselves to court. They did not go out looking for trouble."Unfortunately they were extremely drunk, and you know it cannot have been a good night when you get into a fight with Spider-Man and two cross-dressing men."The court heard the two men in drag were believed to be cage fighters.Katrina Guntrip, magistrates' chairwoman, ordered Gardner and Fender to each carry out a four-month community order and pay prosecution costs of Â£85.They will be electronically tagged for the duration of the order and remain under house curfew between 7pm and 7am.
