Police across the UK have been asked to investigate more than 50 allegations of electoral fraud related to Thursday's elections in areas previously identified as vulnerable to vote-rigging, new figures show.Officers in Manchester, Bradford, London and Birmingham have begun inquiries after receiving complaints about "ghost" voters, false statements by candidates and multiple attempts to vote by a single person.The inquiries have emerged after the Guardian contacted police forces covering 16 areas that the elections watchdog has identified as being vulnerable to electoral fraud, particularly around the use of postal votes.As well as Birmingham and Bradford, they include Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Calderdale, Coventry, Derby, Hyndburn, Kirklees, Oldham, Pendle, Peterborough, Slough, Tower Hamlets, Walsall and Woking.West Yorkshire police, whose officers serve Bradford where former councillors have been imprisoned for electoral fraud, said they had received 21 allegations of electoral irregularities.DI Ian Lawrie, of protective services (crime), said: "We have currently had 21 allegations that have been recorded for further investigation for election-related incidents. These include a number of matters under the Representation of the People Act 1983."On Thursday, there were 14 investigations across Greater London, according to a Metropolitan police spokesman. These included the arrest of two prospective councillors in Tower Hamlets, east London, and Enfield, north London, for false declarations on election papers. Police have also been asked to investigate allegations of intimidation and tampering with postal votes in the east London borough.West Midlands police, which oversees parts of Birmingham and Walsall, said that they had received 11 allegations of electoral fraud.In Greater Manchester, police have launched five inquiries – three inquiries into the eligibility of candidates to stand in the elections, one into a claim that a person had voted twice and another into claims of a false statement on an election leaflet, a spokesman said.Ukip have sought to exploit electoral fraud allegations in Oldham, which is overseen by Greater Manchester police, by lampooning postal vote fraud in an election leaflet. The document, distributed by a former Labour councillor, claimed that it was easy for certain councillors to win because they can count on "the white folk not voting".A spokesman for Lancashire police, which covers towns including Burnley, Darwen and Hyndburn, where there have been previous allegations of fraud, said they would only release information about electoral fraud if an application was made under the Freedom of Information Act – a process that can take weeks.Thames Valley police said they had received eight allegations of minor misconduct relating to issues such as printing irregularities, four of which have been resolved, but had not received any claims of electoral fraud.Surrey, Derbyshire and Cambridgeshire police have not yet released any figures.An Electoral Commission report in January identified the 16 boroughs and cities as vulnerable to electoral fraud and called for increased police involvement in elections.At one point the commission considered dropping postal voting in these areas to combat fraud. But, following a public consultation, it decided this would unfairly hit many ordinary people who needed to vote by post.Instead, it has urged the police to patrol polling stations during elections in the 16 named areas and dedicate more resources to investigating electoral-fraud allegations, which critics complain have been a low priority for the police.
