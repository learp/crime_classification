A 36-year-old father charged with murdering his terminally ill son was today freed on bail.Andrew Wragg, of Worthing, West Sussex, is accused of murdering his 10-year-old son, Jacob, who suffered with Hunter syndrome. Mr Wragg was granted bail by Judge Richard Brown at Lewes crown court after spending the past 10 days in custody. Jacob was found at the family home after a 999 call was made on July 24. He died later at Worthing hospital. Mr Wragg and his wife Mary, 40, were arrested and detained until July 26, when the defendant was charged. Mrs Wragg, who has campaigned to raise money for sufferers of Hunter syndrome, which causes progressive physical and mental deterioration, was released without charge. The judge adjourned the case and said there would be a plea and directions hearing at the same court on October 22. Oscar Vincent, acting on behalf of the defendant, spoke outside court with Mr Wragg. Mr Vincent said: "Mr Wragg is immensely relieved to be granted bail this morning. "Over the past week he has had somehow to put up with the death of his son, several days of police questioning and a remand into a prison environment. "The granting of bail now allows him time to spend with his family, to grieve properly for the death of his son and to deal with the funeral arrangements. He also now has time to prepare properly for the trial."
