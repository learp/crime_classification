A man who killed two police officers when he deliberately smashed into their vehicle at 80mph during a high-speed pursuit admitted yesterday that he was guilty of their manslaughter.Leayon Dudley, 41, from Birmingham, entered the plea at Wolverhampton crown court. He had been jailed for life in May 2003 for the deaths of PCs Andrew Munn and Bryan Moore, but secured a retrial at the court of appeal. The officers were killed when Dudley's van hit their car on the A42 in Worthington, Leicestershire, in August 2002. He had been spotted driving at 70mph in a 30mph zone in Birmingham. After a chase, Dudley's van mounted the kerb to avoid a police roadblock and drove into the officers' car. PC Munn was killed instantly and his colleague died later in hospital. Dudley repeatedly swore at and punched the officer who rescued him from his overturned van. Told that an officer had died in the incident, he replied: "Fuck him." The appeal court ruled the convictions unsafe after hearing evidence on the accident that had not been allowed. Dudley, who had just split up with his partner of 12 years, was found to be twice over the legal drink drive limit. He had a history of violence against the police and previous convictions for assaults, burglaries and criminal damage. Police colleagues said they were disappointed that Dudley had not been finally convicted of murder and called for a change in the legal system. Detective Superintendent Bob Small said: "The jury did not have an opportunity to listen to the facts. Our case has always been that Dudley deliberately targeted the police officers." Sentencing was adjourned until Monday.
