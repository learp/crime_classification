Detectives investigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence have ratcheted up the pressure on those they suspect have knowledge of the crime by arresting two women on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.The arrests were made on Friday and followed dawn raids on two houses in south-east London, close to the scene where the black teenager was stabbed by a race hate gang on April 22, 1993. Police believe the women, both 25, could hold crucial information about the identities of the gang. Both women had previously been interviewed as witnesses and were arrested after detectives compared their statements to those made by other witnesses. The two women were questioned at separate police stations and then released on bail until next month while detectives hunt for further evidence. Last week's arrests are the first major activity that has become public for almost a year by the Scotland Yard squad set up to solve one of the highest-profile murders in recent years. In March last year two men were arrested on suspicion of murder, but later released. In a statement Scotland Yard said: "Information continues to come in to the investigation team eight years after the murder occurred. Witness appeals and intelligence gathering over the past year have proved very helpful to detectives. "People who have not spoken to us previously are now coming forward. We would encourage anyone who does have information to come and see us before we come to see them." Detectives are not ruling out more arrests as they seek to right some of the errors made by the first squad to handle the case.
