Criminologist Marian FitzGerald's analysis of Met figures showing that the relationship between the incidence of knife crime and the amount of stop-and-search is at best unclear received little coverage beyond the Guardian and the BBC. In a now sadly typical display of arrogance Mayor Johnson dismissed FitzGerald, who worked at the Home Office under Tory ministers for years, as "some professor". It seems that most of Britain's media mainstream has little appetite for questioning the efficacy of stop-and-search, which seems to be acquiring sacred cow status. It has been left to Australia's The Age to carry the story forward:London mayor Boris Johnson boasts that ''thousands of knives'' have been taken off London's streets. But talk to Britain's criminal justice fraternity about the project known as Operation Blunt 2 and most are cautious about the results, saying jurisdictions such as Victoria and New South Wales that are battling knife violence should experiment with a wider approach modelled on harm minimisation programs in the public health sphere.Dr Roger Grimshaw of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College in London said this week: ''There has been some decline in homicides of under-19s across all areas [in the program] but the decline in the number of stabbing injuries for this group reported to hospitals began earlier in February 2008. These crimes were already on a downward trajectory. It is very difficult to conclude what the impact has been."The Age reports FitzGerald's findings too. Now read on.
