Relatives of murdered children, including the parents of schoolgirl Sarah Payne and toddler James Bulger, today helped launch a campaign to raise money to support victims of crime.Around 60 family members directly effected by manslaughter or murder, gave their support to the campaign by the charity Victims of Crime Trust that claims just £18.66 is spent on helping each victim of crime compared to the £30,000 spent every year keeping a prisoner behind bars.Sara Payne, who was joined by her husband and five-month-old daughter Ellie, said the effects of murder can last for generations.And she urged people to support the campaign's telephone line petition where the profits from calls, which cost £1, will go towards a new centre to provide counselling for victims, research and campaigning work.Dr Janet McKenzie, whose sister Liz Sherlock was run over and killed by thieves who snatched her bag at Euston station three years ago, said that since her death her father had suffered three heart attacks - the last one fatal - and her mother had suffered two strokes.She said: " I believe that criminals should have the best possible support in their rehabilitation but I am here to say that there is something wrong with a society in which criminals are entitled to more support than their victims."Society should not be judged only by how it treats its criminals but also by how it treats their victims."
