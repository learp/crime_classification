Murdered forensic science student Sally Geeson is set to be awarded a posthumous degree, the university where she studied said today.Anglia Polytechnic University in Cambridge said it was "very likely" that Miss Geeson would be awarded the degree for her efforts during the past two years. Miss Geeson was in her third year and was due to start her final examinations this week. A spokesman for the university today said she had completed the majority of modules on the course and was guaranteed to pass with a good mark regardless of the outcome of her finals. On that basis academic staff felt it right that she should be awarded a degree. "It's very likely that Sally will be awarded a posthumous degree," said the spokesman. "The details haven't been finalised yet but it should go ahead. I'm not exactly sure what grade she was predicted but I know she had completed much of her course and was sure to do well regardless of her finals results. On that basis staff feel it is appropriate that she should be rewarded with a posthumous degree." Last week Miss Geeson's friends and family said she was guaranteed a 2:1 mark but could have earned a first class degree by doing well in her finals. Miss Geeson's twin Julie said today: "We hadn't heard that. It's brilliant news. My parents will be very pleased." Fellow forensic science students at the university were today being given the option of delaying exams as a result of Miss Geeson's murder. "They will be given the option to sit exams on another day if that is what they wish to do," added the spokesman. "Many were due to start their finals this week but if people feel they need time to grieve that will be organised. The university is deeply saddened by the tragic death of Sally Geeson. Sally was a popular and talented student who was excelling in her studies and she will be greatly missed."
