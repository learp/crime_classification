The husband of the reality television star Jade Goody was today found guilty of attacking a taxi driver, his second conviction for violence in less than six months.Jack Tweed, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, wept as magistrates found him guilty.The 21-year-old married Goody, who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, in a highly publicised ceremony last week.In January, he was released from a prison sentence for attacking a 16-year-old with a golf club last September.He currently wears a tag and has to observe a curfew following his conviction for the earlier offence, conditions temporarily lifted by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to allow him to spend his wedding night with Goody.The court, at Epping, in Essex, was told Tweed grabbed taxi driver Stephen Wilkins around the throat and threatened to stab him as he drove the cab at 50mph last May.An altercation was said to have arisen after the driver asked for the Â£50 fare to be paid in advance when Tweed, another male passenger and two women hired the cab after leaving a nightclub at 3am.Magistrates also heard that Tweed attempted to apply the hand brake while the car was moving.The attack only stopped when another taxi driver drew up alongside, and Tweed was later arrested by police at the scene.Tweed admitted he had been drinking all day and accepted his behaviour had been rowdy and reprehensible, but denied any memory of threatening violence.The chair of the magistrates, Karin Cox said, however, that Wilkins was a credible witness.Asking the court to defer sentencing for six months because of Tweed's wife's condition, his solicitor, Tania Panagiotopoulou, told the court Goody had only weeks to live.She added: "His partying lifestyle is well and truly over and has been for some months now. He tries within the confines of his tag to care for her. He is unable to work."Magistrates adjourned sentencing until March 26 so reports can be prepared on Tweed's background, but warned him they were considering a custodial sentence.Max Clifford, Goody's publicist, said she would be upset to hear of her husband's conviction.
