It sounds like something from a cheap crime novel: a jealous murderer is sprung from prison by a helicopter under the cover of a music festival, after planning the escape using hidden codes written in lemon juice and on sudoku puzzles.But Brian Lawrence, 67, serving life for murdering a friend of his ex-lover and hiring a hit man to kill two more of her acquaintances, could have succeeded in his fantastical plot. It was only foiled when prison guards spotted the phrase "more heat less light" in one of his letters and found hidden messages which were revealed when the paper was warmed.The guards found maps and instructions of how to bring a helicopter over a section of Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight not protected by nets, as well as the notion of using the island's annual rock festival as cover for the escape. Other clues were placed within sudoku puzzles.The festival, which took place in mid-June, attracts tens of thousands of visitors, with the likes of Jay Z and The Strokes performing this year.Lawrence, of Hermitage, Berkshire, planned to fund the escape with the sale of a Â£500,000 quarry in Newbury, the Ministry of Justice said today.Barry Greenberry, governor of HMP Isle of Wight, said: "I am delighted at the way our security team and Hampshire constabulary have foiled a possible escape attempt."I am very proud of the operations team at HMP Isle of Wight who diligently pieced together intelligence to stop a security breach."This is exactly the sort of excellent public service that the police and prison service provide to protect the public and reduce re-offending."Lawrence has since been transferred to another prison. The retired schoolteacher was convicted of battering to death Deryk Cox, a Korean war veteran, and setting fire to his home in 2003. He was caught by an undercover police officer posing as a hitman, who Lawrence tried to hire to kill two more of his lover's friends.The trail heard he was "insanely jealous" of any men close to his lover after their three-year relationship ended.
