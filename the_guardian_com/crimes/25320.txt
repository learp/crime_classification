An arsonist who killed a pensioner by setting fire to a block of flats in the early hours has been ordered to serve at least 21 years behind bars.Aiden Elmore was jailed for life after being told it was purely a matter of chance that not more people were killed when he used wheelie bins to block a rear exit from the flats.Elmore, 21, was convicted of murder and two counts of arson with intent to endanger life by a jury last week after a trial at Wolverhampton crown court.Passing sentence on Tuesday, Judge John Warner said Elmore had created a scene of "fear and panic" in which people could be heard screaming and were forced to escape through windows.Several people jumped to safety from the fire in Southey Close, Short Heath, near Walsall, but 69-year-old Victor Moore died after becoming trapped in a communal hallway.Elmore, of Essington Road, New Invention, West Midlands, also set two garden fires in a nearby street and another blaze at the home of his ex-partner's mother on the same night.The judge told Elmore: "Quite what your motive was for what you did remains a mystery to me. Only you know what your thinking was and you have not yet chosen to say. It was purely a matter of chance that Mr Moore was the only person to lose his life in that horrific fire."Elmore, who was on bail at the time of the murder in October 2012, smirked at members of the public from the dock before the start of the sentencing hearing.After ordering Elmore to serve a minimum term of 21 years before he can be considered for release, Warner commended the bravery of two gas engineers, a police officer and a member of the public who attended the scene."They went there in the course of their employment or they went there in a public-spirited effort to assist," the judge said."On behalf of the community they deserve commendation for their actions that night."In a victim impact statement read to the court, an unnamed relative of Victor Moore said: "There are no words that will describe how my family feel and he did not deserve to die in the way that he died."
