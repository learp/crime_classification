The former girlfriend of the man accused of murdering Milly Dowler did not believe he had killed her, even after he made a macabre joke about the missing schoolgirl, a jury has heard.Emma Mills told the Old Bailey she did not contact police after Levi Bellfield "disappeared" on the day the teenager went missing, nor after he quipped: "What, do you think I've done Milly?"Milly, 13, was last seen leaving Walton-on-Thames train station in Surrey in March 2002. Bellfield denies murdering her and trying to kidnap Rachel Cowles, 11.The court was told Mills did not mention Milly to detectives until Bellfield was arrested on suspicion of two other murders in November 2004.Bellfield, a former wheelclamper and bouncer, was convicted in 2008 of murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, Amelie Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18.Asked by Jeffrey Samuels QC, defending, why she did not "harbour any suspicions", Mills said: "I didn't think he'd done it, but when he made that comment it made me think: 'Why did he make that comment?'. But I didn't think that he had done it."The mother of Bellfield's three children was giving evidence for the second day against her partner of nine years. The prosecution claims Bellfield was living yards away from where Milly disappeared and that he murdered her in his flat before dumping the body. Six months later, her remains were found in woods 25 miles away.Mills was asked what her response was to the remark about Milly. She replied: "I asked how he could make a joke like that. I didn't say much â€¦ disgusting." Mills added that when she found bedding to be missing at their flat in Walton-on-Thames, she "thought he had disappeared with a woman in my bed".
