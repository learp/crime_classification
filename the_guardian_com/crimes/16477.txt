A Frenchman appeared in court today charged with the attempted murder of 14-year-old schoolgirl, Jessica Knight, who was stabbed 30 times as she walked through a park.Kristofer Beddar, 21, who was living with English relatives in Adlington, Chorley, was remanded in custody by Chorley magistrates.Knight remains in a stable-but-critical condition at Manchester children's hospital, following five hours of surgery after the attack.Although Beddar has been charged, police yesterday said they are continuing their investigation into the stabbing.Detective superintendent Steve Brunskill, of Lancashire police, said: "The fact that we have charged someone in relation to this offence does not mean our inquiry is at an end."I would like to renew my appeal for anyone with information to come forward, especially anyone who may have been in the park or surrounding area between 4.30pm and 5.30pm on Monday."Officers are still searching for the knife they believe was used in the attack. It is described as a steel-grey, three-inch, bladed lock knife with a steel handle.
