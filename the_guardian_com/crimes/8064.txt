The suspected leader of a 66-strong teenage ring of drug-dealers and runners which terrorised a Leeds council estate, was given a 10-year anti-social behaviour order yesterday.Council staff welcomed the unusually long set of restrictions on Emmanuel Emerson Manners, 19, whose order bans him from using two-way radios, scanners and other technology central to street drug deals. Manners admitted 30 out of 34 charges of anti-social behaviour yesterday at Leeds magistrates court, which heard that he had organised "havoc and misery" on the city's Little London estate. The court was told that he had threatened residents, council staff and the police while running an "early warning" radio system to protect drug deals. The sentence follows the serving of 66 orders on Little London teenagers in September last year. Councillor Richard Lewis said Manners, who now lives in Manchester, had played a part in "ruining Little London's community". He said: "Things might have got far worse if we had not intervened."
