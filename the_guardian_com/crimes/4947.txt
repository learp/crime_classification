Nicholas van Hoogstraten, the property tycoon, won a costs victory yesterday in his multi-million pound legal battle against the family of a man he had been convicted of killing.In July three appeal judges overturned high court orders giving victory to the family. They also quashed orders imposing fines on Mr Van Hoogstraten of more than £1m for contempt of court for failing to disclose his assets. The victim, Mohammed Raja, had been suing Mr Van Hoogstraten, a former business associate, when he was shot dead by two men identified at the Old Bailey criminal trial as henchmen of the tycoon. Mr Van Hoogstraten, 59, was sentenced to 10 years in 2002 for manslaughter but the conviction was set aside by the criminal court of appeal last year. The family of Mr Raja carried on with the civil action, in which the high court judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith, imposed the penalties on the tycoon for failing to disclose his assets. The civil case will now go back to the high court's chancery division for a new hearing - expected within a year - into the claim by the Raja family, with Mr Van Hoogstraten's defence and counter-claim for damages reinstated. The tycoon and Mr Raja's son, Amjad, were in court in London yesterday to hear Lord Justice Pill and Lord Justice Chadwick rule that Mr Van Hoogstraten should receive his costs of the appeal and the hearings in the lower court. An application by the Raja family that payment of costs should be deferred pending final determination of the action was rejected, and they were ordered to make an interim payment of £90,000 within two months.
