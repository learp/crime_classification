David Blunkett, home secretary "I believe that everyone who wants to see a reformed and modernised police service will be disappointed that once again the Police Federation have sought to block change.""The federation have been at the forefront of resisting change for decades"."Their own ballot reveals that trust is a key issue."This, however, appears to be as much about local management and confidence in procedures for pay and conditions at the local level as it is about whether the money on the table and the commitment to reform is believable at a national level."We will therefore go immediately to conciliation and, if necessary, to arbitration but will not back off the critical reform agenda which is crucial to ensuring that the public have confidence that they will be properly protected and the promised crackdown on crime will be successful."Those who mislead their colleagues or seek to undermine the package of rewards have to answer to the public for the disparity of performance and for the failure to reflect increased police numbers with an increased visible presence on the streets."We are determined to push ahead with our agenda for reform. "The public wants and expects us to tackle variations in police performance and be accountable for those that manage the service. "I know that the rank-and-file police officers, who so often do a superb job against the odds, were either unaware or were misled about the true nature of the rewards for reform which are on the table."We have never underestimated the challenge in bringing about radical change, but we must have a modern pay system, where officers are rewarded for job they do, not just for the overtime they work."The deal will mean the vast majority of officers are better off, with extra cash, shorter pay scales and financial reward for those at the sharp end of policing and protecting our communities."Tony Blair, prime minister Prime minister Tony Blair did not comment on the ballot results during a visit to a biotechnology research centre in Dundee today. Oliver Letwin, shadow home secretary: "Conservatives share the home secretary's desire to see more flexible working practices. But David Blunkett has failed to carry the police with him because he has not adequately spelt out the details of the package and has not gained the trust of the ordinary policeman."Police, who are prevented from striking by law, must not be browbeaten. The home secretary must design and negotiate a more detailed and sensitive package."Part of the problem is police demoralisation. This demoralisation has unfortunately been intensified by the home secretary's attack on the Metropolitan police commissioner and it will be further intensified if the government's police reform bill takes power to run the day-to-day operations of police forces from Whitehall."The problem will worsen if, instead of taking neighbourhood policing seriously and getting officers back on the streets, the home secretary tries to obtain neighbourhood policing on the cheap through semi-policemen given semi-powers in the police reform bill." Norman Baker, liberal democrat home affairs spokesman "No group should be immune from modernisation when there is scope for reform."But with police officers rejecting the offer by 10 to one, the home secretary has clearly failed to deal with reform in a way which inspires their confidence. "At a time of growing concern about violent crime, the home secretary must move swiftly to resolve this issue, or risk wasting more police time."Kevin Morris, president of the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales "Whilst we understand the concerns expressed in this ballot by the majority of federated officers, we cannot let this vote halt overall progress in the reform process."As senior managers within the service working to implement appropriate reforms, our job is made that much harder by taking a demotivated workforce with us."The government must realise that overt criticism of the police service, coupled with what has been perceived as a weakening of conditions for many officers, will have a serious impact on morale."The much-needed reform of certain key areas of policing will only succeed if officers feel valued for the difficult job they do and are suitably rewarded."We hope that the government acknowledges these concerns and acts upon them so they do not detract from the overall modernisation programme which has widespread support from all ranks."Dorset police chief constable Jane Stichbury "It is clear that there has been an extremely high turnout for the Federation ballot."This was of course a negotiated package, considered the best achievable within the tight timetable set. It is important that the major concerns of staff are fully considered as I am sure they will be."As a constituent body of the official side, the Association of Chief Police Officers remains committed to securing a package of reward and remuneration which will ensure that we are able to attract, recruit and retain the right people for the service, now and in the future. "Policing is a complex challenging job, which requires high levels of commitment, professionalism and dedication, which must be appropriately rewarded."
