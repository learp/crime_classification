A former soldier has been jailed for six-and-a-half years after admitting his role in a plot to sell explosives from a British army barracks to associates connected to the criminal underworld.Andrew Quinn, 26, from Glasgow, was formerly a member of the 5th Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders), stationed at Howe Barracks in Canterbury, Kent, but was removed from the army after failing a drugs test, when traces of ecstasy were detected in his body. In June, he pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy to possess explosives â€“ which included detonators, flares, smoke grenades, distraction grenades and other munitions belonging to the British army, along with conspiracy to dishonestly undertake or assist in the retention, removal, disposal or realisation of stolen goods.Cross-border police investigators searching Quinn's home in Glasgow in a drugs raid found a black suitcase stashed in a hallway cupboard containing three parachute flares, nine smoke grenades, 554 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition, 978 rounds of 9mm ammunition and 742 12-bore shotgun cartridges. They also found 2kg of heroin. After his arrest, Quinn initially denied being involved in the theft and supply of explosives. He said there had been explosives and detonators in the house but declined to say how they had got there. But he later admitted he was "the middle man for somebody passing them on".  Mitigating for Quinn, Alex Rooke told the court he had expressed remorse for his actions, pleading guilty to both charges."He realises through his actions he has brought shame not just upon himself but upon his family."Sentencing him at Maidstone crown court today, Justice Akenhead, said: "Your involvement was a pivotal one. It involved procuring them from contacts in the army, the paying of soldiers and selling them on."You knew that the people to whom you supplied would use them only for criminal purposes to spread death and violence." Earlier this week, serving soldiers Garry Graham, 37, a colour sergeant, and Martyn Fitzsimmons, 28, a lance corporal, were both sentenced to 12 years in prison after being found guilty of the same two charges following a three-week trial.Sergeant Kieran Campbell, 27, of the 5th Scots Battalion, was also jailed for four years this week after previously pleading guilty to both charges and coming forward to give evidence for the Crown during the trial.
