The head of the Metropolitan police has expressed concern about a high level of knife crime that marred the end of Notting Hill carnival on Monday.The overall level of unrest was down on that of previous years, but police imposed blanket stop-and-search powers for the first time since the riots of 2011, after a series of knife fights and the wounding of two police officers.In his assessment of the event, the Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said: "Although early indications are that reported crime is down at this year's carnival, I am concerned by the number of stabbings over the weekend."Stabbings are up on last year, and in some cases these are just centimetres from being a murder."Six people were being questioned on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a brawl near Trellick Tower. He is being treated, and no details of his condition have been disclosed.Nine people were also treated for stab wounds at an earlier fight in Colville Square.A 33-year-old policeman was injured in the head and torso when he was attacked while trying to prevent a suspected drug deal on Monday afternoon. He was discharged from hospital on Tuesday morning.Some of his colleagues were attacked when they came to help him, and a 35-year-old female officer received torso injuries. She was taken to hospital but released on Monday, Scotland Yard said. A man was arrested for affray.Hogan-Howe pledged that each of the stabbings would be "thoroughly investigated". He added: "Two of my officers were injured during an arrest yesterday and this shows the risks they must take. I would like to thank all the officers and support staff for their hard work in the most difficult of weather conditions. Their commitment is a major factor in ensuring the carnival is a safe and enjoyable event for the vast majority of those attending."The police invoked special stop-and-search powers across the carnival between 7pm on Monday night and 2am on Tuesday. Under the controversial powers, officers can conduct searches whether or not they suspect the subject to have been involved in wrongdoing.Heavy rain and unseasonably low temperatures dampened the mood at this year's event – and the overall level of disorder.Met figures showed 252 arrests were made over the two-day carnival, including 23 for possession of an offensive weapon, 43 public order offences and four sexual assaults.At last year's event there were more than 300 arrests, against 278 in 2012.The number of people injured was also significantly lower than last year, according to London ambulance services.The procession of sound systems and floats was delayed because of rain, but got under way by midday on Monday. A number of business owners and residents boarded up their properties on the carnival route to avoid damage.A gang-crime crackdown in the run-up to the event resulted in 157 arrests and the seizure of two machine guns, a handgun, crack cocaine and £78,000 in cash.Hogan-Howe added: "Our proactive operations in the days leading up to carnival and the weekend itself were a great success and meant we were able to stop many crimes before they happened."
