Traffic cones have long been fair game, as has the odd signpost. Now thieves are turning their attention to the traditional red postbox as the craze grows for street scene collectibles.In the past few weeks, the red George V boxes have been disappearing from telegraph poles in rural Shropshire."We indeed have had a problem," said a spokeswoman for West Mercia police yesterday. "They might have been sold for garden ornaments or for export. We don't know."Four of the boxes, with letters inside, have been swiped within six miles of Newport.Thieves in the same area have also targeted the larger, free-standing pillar boxes, with 13 disappearing within a month. The larger boxes are thought to fetch up to £2,000 on the US market, with the smaller ones making about £800.Philip Jervis, a local postman, believes the thefts are the work of organised criminals."It's a well known fact that lots of people like these letter boxes and they can sell for a lot of money. I think whoever stole them are professional thieves and they're selling them on the internet."Rupert Evans, who owns a reclamation yard in Cradely Heath, West Midlands, said the boxes were valuable and warned anyone considering buying one to make sure it was sold with its keys."Royal Mail have only sold postboxes to bona fide dealers. And as far as I know they haven't sold any in the last five years."The Campaign to Protect Rural England said the thefts were "disgraceful"."These postboxes are a lovely tradition and part of the character of rural England," a spokesman said. "It's a pathetic and really nasty crime."The post office said it did not know why the boxes had been taken. "Some of the boxes might have been stolen for personal gain but we can't rule out that the thefts were just an act of vandalism."
