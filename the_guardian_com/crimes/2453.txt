A police officer told the Harold Shipman trial yesterday of the moment he accused the doctor of killing one of his alleged victims with a lethal morphine injection.Detective Sergeant Mark Wareing said he confronted Dr Shipman with evidence that he had altered the computerised patient records of Winifred Mellor, 73, on the day of her death to create a false history of heart disease. Det Sgt Wareing said he had asked Dr Shipman what he had to say and the doctor had replied: "Nothing." The officer then said to him in a taped interview that he believed Dr Shipman had gone to Mrs Mellor's house in Hyde, Greater Manchester, and killed her, returning to the house more than three hours later. Det Sgt Wareing told Preston crown court he had told Dr Shipman: "You attended at 3pm and that's when you murdered this lady. "And so much was your rush that you went back to the surgery and started altering this lady's medical records. We can prove that only minutes after 3pm you were fabricating this false medical history." The officer said Dr Shipman replied: "There's no answer." The detective told him: "There's a very clear answer. You attended that house, you rolled up her sleeve and injected her with morphine, killing her, and that's what you were trying to cover up." Dr Shipman replied: "No." The GP, 53, of Roe Cross Green, Mottram, denies the murders of 15 women patients and forging a Â£386,000 will. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
