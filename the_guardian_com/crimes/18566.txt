A Nigerian state governor who fled Britain dressed as a woman to escape money laundering charges was refused a claim for immunity in the high court yesterday. But lawyers for Diepreye Alamieyeseigha were allowed to invite the House of Lords to reconsider the case.Mr Justice Collins and Mr Justice Silber certified that the case raised issues of general public importance. Even though he was a fugitive from justice, he was entitled to apply to the Lords, they ruled.Mr Alamieyeseigha, 53, governor of the oil-rich Bayelsa state, was arrested in September at Heathrow airport on his way from Germany. He was charged with laundering £1.8m, nearly £1m of which was found in cash in one of his four London houses, allegedly bought with corrupt money. Police discovered he had assets of £10m in Britain.He was released from Brixton prison on stringent bail conditions last month. As a condition of bail he was not allowed to go within three miles of a port and had to report daily to Paddington Green police station near his £1.7m apartment.But last Friday he failed to report and on Monday morning he turned up in the state capital, where he enjoys local immunity from prosecution until his term ends in 2007. It is believed he travelled with false documents by train to France and then by plane to Cameroon before proceeding along the coast.His escape came as no surprise to Scotland Yard detectives who had strenuously resisted his bail application. Mr Alamieyeseigha may yet be extradited and brought to trial. His state assembly has also issued a petition for impeachment against him.
