Fourteen prison officers were suspended today in connection with allegations of corruption including trafficking and "inappropriate relationships" with inmates.The governor of Pentonville prison in London, where the suspended officers worked, said the jail would "briefly reduce" its number of inmates while an investigation was being carried out.More than 1,000 prison officers in England and Wales are believed to be corrupt, a confidential report revealed last month. The assessment, carried out by the prison service's own anti-corruption unit and the Metropolitan police and leaked to the BBC, revealed that prison staff were using their positions to smuggle mobile phones and drugs to inmates. It also found that officers were taking cash backhanders for transfers to less secure centres."This morning the governor of HMP Pentonville has taken the decision to suspend 14 officers following allegations of corrupt behaviour," a prison service spokeswoman said. "All those suspended will be subject to investigations led by senior governors from other prisons in the London area."If any alleged or otherwise suspected criminal activity is uncovered during the investigations, relevant information will be passed to the police."The corruption allegations concerned trafficking and inappropriate relations, the spokeswoman confirmed. The suspended officers included male and female staff and the maximum number of prisoners being held at the jail has been reduced by 116 to 1,011."The total number of prison officers employed at the jail is normally 379, with about 129 on duty at any one time," she said. The governor's decision to suspend the 14 officers followed information being gathered over an unspecified period of time, she said.The prison service director general, Phil Wheatley, said he would not tolerate staff corruption of any sort."Allegations of corruption will be investigated thoroughly and where evidence is found to support those allegations the appropriate disciplinary action will be taken," he said.Last year, the prison service's professional standards unit held 1,360 formal investigations into alleged staff misconduct. In the same year there were 192 disciplinary hearings following governors' investigations and 40 staff were dismissed for unprofessional conduct.The spokeswoman said the service had a "zero tolerance" approach towards corruption among staff. "We are determined to root out corruption wherever it is discovered. Unfortunately in the closed world of prisons there will inevitably be some criminal collusion between staff and prisoners and we will always need to be extremely vigilant."Last month's leaked report, which was the result of a year-long investigation, concluded that while most staff operated in an honest way, a significant number of officers were involved in corrupt practices.It stated that corruption often started with "inappropriate relationships" between prisoners and staff and that there were currently nearly 600 such relationships. One of the most damaging claims contained in the report was that when intelligence was received about corrupt officers often no action was taken."We would obviously wish to see this fully investigated and we believe that the investigation should involve the police, not just an internal investigation," Colin Moses, the national chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said today. "Of course, if any wrongdoings are found we would expect that action be taken against these people. What we also believe is that this could be the direct result of prison service policy of local recruitment."He said the POA was pressing for a more stringent vetting process for prison officers.Brian Caton, the general secretary of the POA, warned that moving prisoners from Pentonville to other prisons could cause unrest and overcrowding."It is a sad indictment of the prison service that when a serious problem arises its solution is to shuffle the pack," he said. "The prison population is at an all-time high and it would appear the only solution prison service management can see is the movement of prisoners from Pentonville to other prisons, causing potential unrest and overcrowding at other establishments because of the staff shortages which now arise at Pentonville."
