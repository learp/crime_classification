The rising number of prisoners aged over 60 is turning some prisons into costly "high-security nursing homes", a penal reform charity warned today.The Howard League for Penal Reform said the number of inmates aged over 60 had trebled in a decade with further steep rises projected.In 1990 there were 365 sentenced prisoners aged 60 and over - in 2004 there were under 1,700.Currently, three prisons could be filled with older prisoners but the Prison Service has only four male prisons with small wings offering specialist facilities.The director of the Howard League, Frances Crook, said: "Continuing to imprison older people at this rate raises the spectre of the Prison Service having to take over whole cemeteries."We are currently witnessing a prison system which is bursting at the seams and trying to cope with the consequences of overcrowding. It is not a rational use of resources to use prison as a high security nursing home."The charity said older prisoners often have special needs - including infirmities, complex health problems, lack of mobility, incontinence and even terminal illnesses - which jails do not cater for.Prison exercise is usually gym-based with little access to the outdoors, and even then warm clothing is not provided and there are no seats, it added.Ann Owers, the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales, said a national strategy was required to deal with the needs of older prisoners.She told BBC 2's Newsnight programme that several jails were not fulfilling their duty of care towards older prisoners."Prisons are not very accessible places to people whose mobility is very limited. And what we've found in some cases was that wasn't helped by the fact that staff wont push wheelchairs. In one prison they said they weren't trained to do so. So going to visit your family could be a major problem," said Ms Owers.The chief inspector added that prison showers were also a problem for older inmates. "If you're not very mobile, you don't feel safe in showers because you fall over. Or you may be so immobile you need help," she said.The chairman of the Howard League's penal reform policy committee, Professor David Wilson, believes that no one over 65 should be in jail.He said: "No one is pretending that these elderly prisoners have not caused harm, but you have to think long and hard about what the point is of keeping the elderly in institutions designed for the young and in circumstances that merely hasten their deaths."
