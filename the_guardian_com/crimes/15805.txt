Judges should take into account victims' emotional distress, fear and loss of confidence when sentencing those convicted of theft, according to legal guidelines issued on Thursday.The proposals, put out for consultation by the Sentencing Council, stress that the impact of any crime is not merely financial loss but also the broader impact on society.The draft guidelines cover a wide variety of thefts including pick-pocketing, shoplifting, handling stolen goods, taking cars, leaving a restaurant or petrol station without paying, and stealing by employees or care workers. They also address gaps in previous guidance, such as theft of a bicycle.The range of prison sentences available to judges and magistrates is not changed under the guidelines but the fresh emphasis on considering harm to victims could lead to an increase in the number of offenders sent to prison. Risk of injury should be a factor, the Sentencing Council recommends, including, for example, where manhole covers, roof tiles or electrical cables are stolen.The chairman of the Sentencing Council, Lord Justice Treacy, said: "Theft comes in a great variety of forms, from someone pocketing a packet of razor blades in a shop to an organised gang stealing railway cables. As well as providing effective guidance to help sentencers deal with this wide spectrum of offenders, the guideline will ensure a clearer focus on the impact of thefts on victims beyond just the financial value of what is stolen from them."In the section on theft from shops, the guidelines focus on not only loss of business but also take into account the effect on shop owners particularly hard hit by thieves. Peter Chapman, chairman of the Magistrates' Association judicial committee said: "Shop theft is a big problem for both large and small retail businesses. Other offences expose the public to danger when vital equipment is stolen."Helen Dickinson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: "We welcome the development of a new sentencing guideline for theft offences, with a clearer focus on retailers as victims. Theft from stores pushed the direct cost of retail crime up to £511m last year, with the average cost of each theft rising by 62% to £177."
