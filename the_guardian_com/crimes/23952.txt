Ian Brady has spent nearly three decades resisting attempts to treat him for the pathological disorders that compelled him to carry out the Moors murders, a mental health tribunal heard on Friday.Throughout his time at Ashworth special hospital in Merseyside, psychologists have made repeated attempts to persuade him to engage, but after 28 years they are still reduced to peering through "tiny little peepholes into his life".Dr Caroline Logan, a consultant clinical psychologist at Ashworth, told the hearing in Manchester: "He is a man with a track record for crimes of the ultimate violence, but he has never been treated."He has never come close to being treated for his offending behaviour â€¦ He tells us he's not mentally ill, but the clinical team are not able to test that very closely. We can't get into his head and challenge him about the drivers for his behaviours."He has a powerful sense of his own self-worth and a minimal regard for others. His problems are other people, not in himself."Logan said that despite Brady's age of 75, he was still a danger to himself and those around him."We can't say: 'Oh, he's an old fellow now.' We can't take that risk."She described Brady as "pathologically narcissistic" and confirmed that he had consistently refused to take anti-psychotic drugs.She conceded that the ward on which he was being held was in effect managed around him.Patients being considered for entry were vetted so as not to antagonise him, no agency nurses were involved in his care and he was allowed to walk around at night.Nathalie Lieven QC, for Brady, asked: "To what extent do you think he's treated as a special case because he is Mr Brady?"Logan replied: "I think he is being treated as a special case because he's Mr Brady."She said Brady still had "deviant sexual interests" which manifested themselves in sporadic incidents, "enough incidents to think they are still relevant".Brady, who has been on hunger strike since 1999, scribbled copious notes as the hearing proceeded. Bespectacled and wearing a jacket, collar and tie, he had a feeding tube emerging from his right nostril.He insists through his legal team that he is not mentally ill and wants to be transferred to a prison where it would be easier to starve himself to death.While he remains at Ashworth staff are able to persist with a regime in which he is forcibly fed.Logan thought there would be flashpoints with staff if Brady was transferred to a prison."Mr Brady is very handy with expletives," she said. "I foresee extreme difficulties were he to call prison officers very unpleasant names in front of other prisoners."Brady's treatment at Ashworth was the best possible fit for his needs, she said, "given his lack of cooperation and lack of openness with regard to his inner world"."There is a risk that if he doesn't succeed [with his appeal] he could decide to commit suicide as an act of vengeance against the hospital."Brady is expected to give evidence on Tuesday.The tribunal continues.
