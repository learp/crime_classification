Families of stabbing victims today delivered a petition to Downing Street calling on the government to make carrying a knife as serious an offence as carrying a gun.The group, which includes Damilola Taylor's father, demanded that ministers introduce a five-year minimum jail term for carrying an object with a blade longer than three inches, which would equalise the penalties for knives and guns.They also want to see a six-month minimum jail term for carrying a blade shorter than three inches, or three months for juveniles.Jayne Walmsley, father of 14-year-old Luke Walmsley, who was stabbed in a school corridor in November last year, said she was "disgusted" with current government action on knife crime."I think if it was one of their children or a member of their family and one of their children had been murdered, I think measures would have been brought in within a year, but of course we are Joe Public."Mr Taylor, whose 10-year-old son was killed in London in 2000, said anti-knife laws have "no effect at all".The age at which knives can be bought is to be raised from 16 to 18, under plans to be announced by the home secretary, David Blunkett, this week but anti-knife campaigners attacked the move as "too little, too late".The Victims of Crime Trust accused Mr Blunkett of "hijacking" genuine concerns from the relatives of loved ones stabbed to death on Britain's streets.Its director, Norman Brennan, said raising the age limit would have little effect."Increasing the age when people can buy knives from 16 to 18 is like a hot dog without the sausage, full of hot air and no substance."This is far too little, far too late. It is the second time a government minister has stolen proposals being put forward by people with very genuine concerns."The move is expected to be agreed on Wednesday with police chiefs at a Downing Street summit to discuss progress in dealing with gun crime and other violent offences.The plan will also include imposing stiffer penalties on teenagers who are found to be carrying knives when they are searched on the street.Mr Blunkett wants to introduce a maximum five year sentence for carrying a knife on the street. The summit will be used to discuss the proposal with senior representatives of Britain's chief constables.The outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, has been pushing for tougher punishment for violent crimes involving knifes. He said earlier this month that gun crime had been reduced in London, but that the problem had moved on to knives.Sir John believes those who carry knives "for the wrong reasons" should receive a mandatory sentence of up to three years.Mark Oaten MP, home affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, warned that sending teenagers to jail for possession could turn someone into a criminal for life."We need to better educate people about the danger of knives and improve the controls on the sale of these lethal weapons," he said."Every case should be judged on an individual basis, and sometimes a tough education and treatment programme will bring more success than a long prison sentence."
