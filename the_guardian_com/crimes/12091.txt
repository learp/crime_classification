Dissident republican terrorists have seriously injured a Catholic police officer in a booby trap bomb attack in Northern Ireland.The policeman is fighting for his life after a device exploded underneath his car on the Milltown Road in the Randalstown area of County Antrim shortly after 6.30am.A spokeswoman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said the officer had been driving the car for about a mile before the bomb exploded. The incident occurred on the outskirts of the town just a few miles from Antrim town, where in March last year the Real IRA shot dead two soldiers outside Massereene Barracks.The PSNI spokeswoman confirmed that the victim's condition was "serious".Local MP the Rev William McCrea said he was convinced dissident republicans opposed to the peace process were behind this morning's attack.The Alliance party assembly member for the area, David Ford, condemned this latest attempt to murder police officers. Ford said: "I am appalled at this murderous attack. The people behind this bomb have no policy and strategy except to cause death and disruption."He said: "I am outraged that a very small number of people still believe that using violence will achieve anything. They are seeking to drag us backwards into the dark days of the Troubles."Late last year republican dissident terrorists placed a booby trap device under the passenger seat of a car belonging to the girlfriend of a police officer near his home in east Belfast. The policeman targeted in that attack was on a day off and was not in the car when the blast ripped through the front of the car. His partner was slightly injured in the explosion.Catholic police officers are prime targets for dissident republicans in their campaign to undermine support for the PSNI and to destabilise Northern Ireland. The Real IRA, Continuity IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann have all targeted Catholic recruits to the PSNI. Their tactic is similar to the one used by the Provisional IRA at the start of the Troubles when it killed Catholics in the police and army to deter the nationalist population from supporting the security forces.
