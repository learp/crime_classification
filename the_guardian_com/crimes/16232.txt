A suspected thief was found with 38 mobile phones stuffed down his trousers at a Libertines concert, according to police.West Midlands police arrested the man at Birmingham’s Barclaycard Arena on Wednesday night and are appealing for gig-goers who had mobiles stolen to contact officers. The man, 30, and another man of the same age, who was also arrested, were allegedly seen at the venue with their trousers taped closed at the bottom of the legs. The arrests formed part of a proactive operation led by Birmingham police, set up after intelligence suggested gig-goers had been targeted at another Libertines performance in Manchester. Insp Gareth Morris, who oversees local policing in the city, said: “It’s an unfortunate reality that large crowds at concerts such as this make rich pickings for career criminals. We’re hot on the heels of these offenders but you can also reduce your chances of falling victim to such crimes by remaining extra vigilant when attending busy events.“If you think you had your phone taken, please get in touch with us and we can check whether or not we have been able to recover it.”
