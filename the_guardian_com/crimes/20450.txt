A 13-year-old girl who was accused of trying to hang a five-year-old boy from a tree escaped custody yesterday when a court heard that she was a mixed-up, scared and lonely girl with problems.The girl, who was 12 at the time of the offence in May, admitted wrapping wire round the boy's neck, stomach and genitals and whipping him with nettles.Dewsbury youth court heard she lied about the attack in interviews with police and tried to blame four boys. She was charged with attempted murder but in court admitted the lesser charge of causing actual bodily harm and perverting the course of justice. Magistrates imposed a 12-month referral order.Pathologist Christopher Milroy concluded that the boy could have died during his ordeal. The girl's solicitor, Anastasis Tasou, described how her mother had died last Christmas Eve. "She's a mixed-up scared, lonely girl with many problems that she has to deal with," he said.On the day of the attack the boy had followed her to a wooded area. "[The boy] followed her against her wishes," said Mr Tasou. "She decided to pick up a length of wire and tied him to a tree ... He thought it was some sort of game, and she wrapped it round his neck and secured it to the tree to show him she didn't want to be followed."
