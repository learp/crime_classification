It was one of the notorious frauds in British history. But after 23 years, a court case, questions in parliament and an ombudsman's inquiry, a line has finally been drawn under the Barlow Clowes affair.The Treasury revealed it has recouped £120m of the £153m it paid out in compensation to 14,250 victims of the investment scam masterminded by swindler Peter Clowes.City minister Mark Hoban today declared the case was closed after recovery of the funds which had been channelled through 50 companies in 16 jurisdictions.The collapse of Barlow Clowes in 1988 rocked the investment industry and resulted in a 10-year jail sentence for Clowes in 1992 – four years after the collapse of his business empire.The Thatcher government paid out £153m in compensation – some 90% of the losses – after a report by the parliamentary ombudsman found lack of supervision by the Department of Trade and Industry had allowed the scam to continue for longer than necessary.Hoban said: "The government disputed the main findings in the report but made a decision to make substantial ex-gratia payments to Barlow Clowes investors. This was based on the exceptional combination of circumstances and was not to be regarded as a precedent. At the same time the government gave a clear assurance to parliament to try and recover the cost of the ex-gratia payments."In a written ministerial statement, Hoban revealed a further £36m had been paid out to investors who had been discovered after the initial compensation claims were made. This sum was paid directly from the liquidators to the investors out of a total of £156.5m recovered from the web of companies.To the fury of his victims, Clowes was released in 1996 after serving less than half his sentence. He had promised investors that their money was being put into gilts but instead embarked on a complex investment strategy to avoid tax and boost returns. He came unstuck during the October 1987 stock market crash when he tried to use a listed company to help bolster returns.He used the funds to enjoy a lavish lifestyle: he had a yacht, four personal jets, a helicopter, a chateau in France and a farm in the Peak District.Some 10 months after the then home secretary Michael Howard released him on parole in February 1996, Clowes was caught making false claims for job seekers allowance for which he received a four-month sentence in May 1999.Hoban is now the minister responsible for ensuring that investors in the collapsed Equitable Life receive compensation for losses they suffered – the only other occasion that the Treasury has stepped into compensate investors."Since 1988, successive governments have followed a policy of vigorously pursuing all claims in relation to the Barlow Clowes companies which showed any prospect of cost-effective recovery, in order to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the ex-gratia payments scheme," Hoban said.Hoban said a court in Gibraltar released the court-appointed receivers and liquidators in December. "This brings to an end the Barlow Clowes affair," Hoban said.
