A bus driver who hit and killed an 82-year-old man, and failed to tell his employers about problems with his eyesight, has been jailed for one year, Essex police said.Stephen Thompson, 49, of no fixed abode, was driving a double-decker bus in Civic Square, Tilbury, Essex, on 20 August 2015 when he struck Derek Coleman, who was taken to the Royal London hospital and died on 1 September 2015 from his injuries.Essex police said Thompson failed to disclose to the DVLA, and his employers, the Ensign Bus Company, that he had type 2 diabetes and problems with his vision.He admitted causing death by careless driving and one count of fraud by false representation relating to the information that he had failed to disclose to his employer between 2010 and 2015, the force said.On Friday, at Basildon crown court, Thompson was jailed for a year and banned from driving for three and a half years, Essex police said. He will also have to take an extended driving test before being allowed to drive again.Judge John Lodge said Thompson did not see Coleman due to a blind spot on the vehicle and that he ought to have known the view available, due to the structure of the bus, and the risk to pedestrians. He said the blind spot was the cause of the accident. But he said that Thompson’s health was an aggravating factor and that he had shown a “cavalier attitude to driving” by failing to disclose his vision problems.Steve Catton, an investigating officer with Essex police, said Thompson “repeatedly showed disregard for the safety of himself and other road users” by failing to disclose his diabetes and vision problems to his employers.“While these health issues were not the cause of the collision, they were an aggravating factor and Thompson ignored the requirements placed upon him as a driver,” Catton said. “He continued to drive a public bus on a daily basis regardless of his health. Tragically his selfish actions resulted in the death of Mr Coleman. I hope Mr Coleman’s family can take some comfort that Thompson is now serving a custodial sentence.”Catton added: “I would appeal to any other drivers who have medical conditions that they have not disclosed to the DVLA or to their employers to seriously consider the implications of not doing so. It is important to remember that holding a driving licence is a privilege and not a right. If you’re going to drive you owe it to other road users and yourself to comply with the requirements placed upon you.”
