Police investigating reports that a six-year-old girl was abducted from her bath, sexually assaulted then dumped naked in a nearby street said today her attacker was "extremely dangerous".The child said she was taken from her home in Willington Quay, North Tyneside, and left in a cold back lane on Tuesday night, as little as 15 minutes later."From her account, somebody has been brazen enough to enter her house, take her away undressed and then assaulted her in a manner which is clearly sexually motivated, and then leave her in this lane, in the dark, on her own," Detective Chief Inspector Jim Napier said."I am satisfied that the report, as it was given to us, is real and is credible and we are seeking to trace a male who is not known to the girl, who has entered the house and taken that girl out to conduct a sexually motivated assault. I consider that individual to be extremely dangerous and that is why I am keen to trace that individual and arrest him."The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was being cared for by her family, Mr Napier said. He added that examination of the scene and the victim indicated her account was true. "The girl did suffer injuries and that is part of the reason why I am reassured about the credibility of the report," he said.He urged anyone who may have seen a middle-aged man wearing a dark coat and gloves loitering in the area, either on foot or in a car, to contact police. The officer was also keen to confirm reports of a man driving erratically, with screeching brakes or a loud engine.The detective said officers were looking into the whereabouts of known sex offenders in the Tyneside area.Police were alerted by the girl's distraught mother when she discovered the child was missing from the ground-floor bathroom of their home. The naked girl was found wandering around in a distressed state by a resident.Officers want to speak to anyone who saw children near the girl's home between 4pm and 5pm on Tuesday.
