Michael Adebolajo, one of two men suspected of carrying out the Woolwich attack, was arrested two and half years ago in Kenya for allegedly trying to join the al-Shabaab Islamist militants in neighbouring Somalia.He was detained in November 2010 with a group of young men on an Indian ocean island 40 miles (64km) from the Somali border. The men were subsequently released without charge.Adebolajo, who was deported back to Britain, told local media that he had not eaten for two days and claimed he was tortured by police. Kenyan authorities deny his claims.While al-Shabaab has been ousted from large parts of Somalia in recent years, swaths of southern Somalia are still under its control.Members of Adebolajo's family have since claimed he was "pestered" by MI5 agents seeking to recruit him.
