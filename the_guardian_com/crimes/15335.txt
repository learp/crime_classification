British and German prosecutors are to meet to discuss the case of a doctor who gave a patient in the UK a lethal overdose, police said today. Daniel Ubani, a German national of Nigerian origin, gave 10 times too much painkiller to David Gray, 70, while working last year in Cambridgeshire for the company Take Care Now on behalf of the NHS. He was given a nine-month suspended jail term in Germany for negligence that caused Gray's death. Health officials in Cambridgeshire last month spoke of their disappointment that Ubani would not face trial in Britain.
