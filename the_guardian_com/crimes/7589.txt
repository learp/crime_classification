A 21-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a four-month-old baby boy who died in a house fire on Sunday, police said today.Northumbria police confirmed that the Newcastle-upon-Tyne woman was arrested this morning on suspicion of the murder of Alexander Gallon. She is the second person to be arrested in connection with the case.A post-mortem examination carried out yesterday revealed that Alexander died as a result of the fire. Further forensic tests are being conducted.Detectives say the baby's mother, 21-year-old Danielle Wails, was attacked by two men who tied her hands together with telephone cord and deliberately set the house, in the Cowgate area of Newcastle, on fire on Sunday night.Police said today they had CCTV footage of two men on the corner of Link Road and Whitethorn Crescent in Cowgate at 10.30pm on Sunday. They urged the men to come forward to help officers with their inquiries.Detective Superintendent Barbara Franklin, leading the investigation, said Ms Wails and Alexander had been at home alone when two men wearing black entered the house and attacked her in the kitchen, knocking her unconscious. They tied her hands in front of her and dragged her into the living room, where Alexander was asleep on a sofa.When Ms Wails regained consciousness, she was aware of smoke in the room. She managed to dial 999 with her tongue, and emergency services were immediately called to the scene. Firefighters rescued Alexander from the blaze, but he died later in Newcastle general hospital."It is difficult to comprehend the wickedness of someone who could do such a thing, and we appeal for the public to come forward and help us," DS Franklin said. She said there was "no way" the two men could have been unaware that Alexander was in the room, because he was crying when Ms Wails was attacked.
