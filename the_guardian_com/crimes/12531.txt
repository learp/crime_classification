Jack Straw pledged today to boost police numbers to record levels, with 9,000 new recruits funded by chancellor Gordon Brown's £43bn spending settlement.The home secretary told the House of Commons that the bulk of the £1.6bn extra money granted by the chancellor of the exchequer yesterday would be spent on recruiting officers and investing in the latest police equipment and new anti-crime technology. "The major investment outlined today will ensure that the police are better funded and better equipped than they have ever been before," Mr Straw said.Police funding will increase by more than 20% by 2003-4, making spending on police in that year total £9.3bn.Mr Straw acknowledged that police numbers in England and Wales have fallen by 1,678 in the past year to 124,418 and conceded that "predicting future numbers is very difficult".But he forecast he would successfully reverse eight years of decline. He said he had already provided new money to pay for 5,000 more recruits and announced funding for a further 4,000, making 9,000 extra recruits by 2003. New police technology will include the public safety radio communications system, a new police radio network the government will back with £500m, and information technology systems. The Home Office will also make additional investment in the police DNA database. Mr Straw promised £300m each year for programmes targeting vehicle crime, domestic burglary, robbery and violent crime, and drugs offending.The home secretary said the new settlement would fund a dedicated national confiscation agency which would deprive organised criminals of their assets and a new building programme to provide 2,660 more prison places.
