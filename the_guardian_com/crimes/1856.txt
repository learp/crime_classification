Dozens of people who had been cleared of charges, including murder and rape, might yet face prosecution. Re-analysis of 2,500 police investigations that relied on a controversial form of DNA evidence has raised the prospect of bringing these people to trial.Senior police officers said the results of a 14-month investigation, Operation Cube, into the validity of the low copy number technique - a method of obtaining a DNA profile from microscopic samples - had found that a significant number of people who had been cleared may now face conviction.Re-examination of 1,200 investigations so far had yielded 'interesting developments' in around 24 murder and rape cases with 'the potential of more to come', said Tony Lake, the Association of Chief Police Officers' expert on the use of forensic science.The development follows harsh criticism by the Omagh bomb case judge, Mr Justice Weir, who last week attacked the low copy number method of gathering DNA evidence as potentially unreliable and lacking validity. His criticism precipitated the Crown Prosecution Service to temporarily suspend its use by the Forensic Science Service.All current cases in which the method formed part of the evidence would be immediately scrutinised after the acquittal on all charges of Sean Hoey, who had been brought to trial for the 1998 Omagh attack in which 29 people died.However, Lake said yesterday that the DNA technique still had merit and should not be written off. He said: 'Low copy number has produced important lines of inquiry. The issue is now to get it properly validated.'The chief constable of Lincolnshire and chairman of the National DNA database strategy board added: 'The important point is that you don't prosecute on DNA evidence alone, there has to be other evidence.'A secret review was launched in October 2006 into 5,500 DNA samples encompassing 2,500 cases where experts from the FSS are said to have used the wrong procedures when testing for microscopic traces of DNA.Yesterday the CPS in England and Wales began reviewing 'live' cases, where the technique had been used. The review is likely to include thousands of forthcoming court cases, although it is understood that the Rachel Nickell murder case will not be among them because it involves a slightly different type of DNA evidence evaluation. Robert Napper, 41, was charged last month with the murder of Nickell on Wimbledon Common in 1992 and is awaiting trial.Clearing Hoey of 29 charges of murder in relation to the Omagh bomb last Thursday, the judge condemned the 'slapdash' manner in which material had been gathered by police and submitted for DNA testing by the FSS.But he also questioned the science behind the low copy number method, highlighting disagreements between experts and emphasising his concern that there was no international consensus about its value.Lawyers for Hoey, 38, an electrician from South Armagh, have threatened to launch a civil lawsuit against the prosecuting authorities on the grounds of malicious prosecution. He spent more than four years in custody.A government study of the science behind the technique will report next month to try to restore confidence in the method. Professor Brian Caddy, who is conducting the Home Office research, has been asked to draw up common standards and practices for the technique to be followed by all forensic science labs. He will outline proposals on how the evidence should be explained in court and what jurors should be told about its reliability.Lawyers also believe that prisoners jailed on the strength of the technique could turn to the appeal courts in a bid to have their convictions quashed.Robert Brown of law firm Corker Binning said: 'In cases where the evidence almost entirely relies on low copy number DNA, it is more likely that the conviction could be tested to be unsafe and that could lead to a retrial.'
