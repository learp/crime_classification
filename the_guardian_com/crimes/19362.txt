The chances of being a victim of crime on London's transport network is at a six-year low, Boris Johnson said.The capital's mayor hailed substantial falls in almost every type of offending on buses, trains, trams and the tube. Figures released by his office showed there were 10,595 crimes on buses and 3,305 on the tube last year.Officials said these represented falls of up to 30% over the past three years, outstripping the drop in overall crime.Speaking at Finsbury Park tube station in north London, Johnson said there was still more work to do to make travellers feel safer.He said: "The most important thing is, despite a deep recession, London crime is still coming down and crime on public transport is coming down very sharply."It is very important people do not feel apprehensive about others kicking off on the buses and that sort of thing, and that we make transport feel safe."It has important economic benefits, effectively it means people are happy to travel around, to do their shopping, to buy a house or to invest â€“ it is massively important."It is not the end of the story and in tough financial times we have to make sure we do everything we can to get people out there."
