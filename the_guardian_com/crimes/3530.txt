Juries are to be told about the previous convictions of all defendants under a government crackdown on repeat offending.The home secretary, David Blunkett, announced today that from December judges will be expected to reveal if a defendant has prior convictions for the same offence they are charged with. But for child sex offenders the new measures are more wide-ranging.Juries can be informed of any related past crime or conduct in the case of people charged with child sex abuse or theft. For example, someone facing charges of child rape could have previous convictions for downloading child pornography from the internet revealed to the jury.If this proves successful, these special measures will be extended to cover other types of offences, such as murder, said the spokeswoman.For other offences such as a man assaulting his wife then his previous convictions for domestic violence will be revealed to the jury, said a home office spokeswoman. But if he had previous convictions for another type of assault, such as grievous bodily harm, this would not necessarily be revealed.Other evidence of a defendant committing the same bad conduct in the past, such as social services reports, could also be considered in trials in England and Wales.The courts will have discretion on whether or not to allow previous convictions to be made known, but the onus will be on judges to make the details public.The controversial reform, which will apply in crown and magistrates' courts, reverses the current legal situation in which evidence about a defendant's past crimes is generally inadmissable in criminal proceedings. Disclosing such information to a jury would usually lead to the proceedings being stopped and a retrial ordered by the judge.David Walker, policy adviser for the crime reduction charity Nacro, warned: "The law has always recognised that juries who are aware of previous convictions are more likely to convict. "Unless these powers are very carefully applied, there is a real possibility of more miscarriages of justice. This includes the risk that ex-offenders could be prosecuted unfairly on the basis of their previous convictions and to the detriment of their rehabilitation."But Mr Blunkett said the reform, introduced in an order laid before parliament today, would allow juries to have greater access to information about previous convictions and other types of misconduct "without unduly prejudicing the fairness of the trial". He said: "Trials should be a search for the truth and juries should be trusted with all the relevant evidence available to help them to reach proper and fair decisions. "The law has recognised for over a century that evidence of a defendant's previous convictions and other misconduct may be admitted in some circumstances."But the current rules are confusing and difficult to apply, and can mean that evidence of previous misconduct that seems clearly relevant is still excluded from court." The measures, which follow reforms in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, will have to be debated by both houses of parliament.
