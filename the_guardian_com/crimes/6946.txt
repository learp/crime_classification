A jewellery shop owner was shot dead as she tried to shield her daughter from armed robbers who raided their family store, her husband said last night.Marian Bates, 64, leapt in front of her daughter Xanthe, 34, as one of the two young raiders aimed a handgun at her and demanded gems from the store. Her husband Victor, 64, said: "My wife ran forward to get between the gunman and my daughter and he shot her dead. She was a brave woman, not at all foolhardy. She was protecting her daughter, like every mother." Mr Bates who suffered head injuries in the struggle at the Time Centre in Arnold, a leafy Nottinghamshire suburb, said the gunman had first attempted to shoot him but the weapon had misfired. Paramedics attempted to revive Mrs Bates at the scene but she died in hospital, shortly after the raid at 1pm on Tuesday. A postmortem examination confirmed she died from a single shot to the chest. "They worked on Marian and gave her heart massage," said Mr Bates, who was hit on the head with a crowbar by one raider. Both Mr Bates and his daughter were treated in hospital for facial injuries. Police said the thieves, in their late teens or early 20s, were confronted by members of the public as they sped from the busy shopping area on a stolen blue scooter. A van driver ran into the road in an attempt to stop the thieves, and a pedestrian later tried to pull one of the attackers to the ground as they sped away. Yesterday tributes to Mrs Bates were continuing to be laid at the scene by local people. As detectives went on with the hunt for the killers, Mr Bates and his daughter were being consoled by friends and relatives at the family home in Ravenshead. Friends said Mr and Mrs Bates had planned to retire soon. They had run the business for around 25 years and had been married for 42 years.
