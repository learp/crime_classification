A 27-year-old woman has been arrested in connection with the death of an elderly man who was hit by a car outside a supermarket. West Midlands police said that the pedestrian, thought to be aged 76, was struck by the vehicle outside a Co-op store in Stirchley, Birmingham, at about 10am and died in hospital a short time later. A West Midlands ambulance service spokesman said the pensioner was given a very high level of first aid by staff from the supermarket before the arrival of emergency crews. He was then taken to Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham where he died.
