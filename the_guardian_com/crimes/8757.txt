The assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police today renewed his calls for the police to take rape cases seriously as he urged forces to set up specialist units to investigate rape allegations.John Yates, who is also the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on rape, said the 6% conviction rate for rape was "not good enough", and rape cases deserved to have the best experts in charge.Investigations should be given the same priority as murder or child protection cases, he said. Yates acknowledged that 10 forces had already set up specialist units but added: "What we are not seeing is the whole continuum of the investigation being managed in the best way."Only 15% of rape victims across the UK report the crime, and more than two-thirds of their complaints do not make it to court.Yates has in the past accused the police of contributing to the "appalling" conviction rate because officers often fail to take alleged victims seriously enough and carry out insufficient inquiries. In an interview with the Guardian in March, he said detectives did not apply the same degree of professionalism to rape as they did to other serious crimes, and blamed officers for greeting alleged victims' complaints with scepticism."If you've just been through the horror of a rape and you've plucked up the courage to see the cops, and the body language is sceptical, the voice is sceptical, what is that saying to you?" he asked.Yates said the new task forces would help raise the conviction rate and offer better support and counselling for victims. He is due to renew his call for better standards in rape investigations at a police conference today, where he will be joined by the home office minister Vernon Coaker.Coaker will promise to ensure that standards are applied consistently across different police forces, after complaints of a "postcode lottery". A women's equality group says women in some areas are five times less likely to see their attacker convicted than in others. The Fawcett Society produced a map this week, based on official figures, which it said revealed "huge deficiencies in police responses to rape" in many parts of the UK. Government plans include increasing the number of specialist centres for rape victims from 19 to 36 and running a trial scheme of supplying police forces with advisers on sexual violence. Ministers promised that by the end of next year there would be 36 sexual assault referral centres, where rape victims could be taken for medical care, counselling and forensic examinations to aid investigations.
