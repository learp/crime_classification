To her family she was a successful and well-travelled businesswoman but, as police investigate the mysterious disappearance of Carole Waugh, evidence is mounting that she may have lived a double life as an escort.Detectives have confirmed to the Guardian that her possible secret life is a definite line of inquiry as they search for any trace of the 50-year-old former oil company executive, who was last seen more than three months ago.Police are still trying to piece together the fragments of Waugh's life. The portrait painted by her loving family is that of a driven, tough and independent woman who had worked in the Libyan oil industry as a finance executive for eight years and returned to London with a comfortable nest egg as she entered her 50s.Yet as they peel back the layers, detectives are uncovering a different side to Waugh which her distressed relatives knew nothing about.They have information that she may have worked as an escort and are investigating her use of dating and escort websites. The Guardian understands she may also have advertised on an adult website and worked from her flat in Harrowby Street, Marylebone.Detectives are still trying to trace and speak to a number of female friends who Waugh's brother said made up her social network in London.While the picture is still a hazy one, what the police are increasingly confident of is that Waugh has been abducted by a group of individuals who have taken over her identity, ransacked her bank accounts and tried to sell her home.Across London their footprints have been left in clothes shops, at ATM machines, in banks and at estate agents' offices. They are marked out by the boldness with which they carry out their fraudulent activities.One of the suspects, a white man in his 50s, walked into Foxtons estate agents in Marylebone posing as her brother, and put her flat on the market. He was seen outside the property with an estate agent on at least one occasion.Another individual was caught on CCTV using her bank card at an ATM outside Sainsbury's in Enfield, and two women were captured on film posing as her to go on a shopping spree at Westfield in Shepherd's Bush. Of Waugh herself there is still no trace."These cases are very rare," said Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell, head of homicide at Scotland Yard."They are marked by the complete absence of understanding of how someone can disappear from a full life, a job, leaving no trace."The key for detectives is to unpick the life of the individual who has gone missing, an investigation which sometimes – as may be the case with Waugh's disappearance – throws up unexpected, unwelcome information for an already distressed family.Her brother spoke this week of the last time he saw Waugh, over the Easter weekend in April when they gathered as a family at their mother's home in Durham.He had wanted to put on a celebration for her forthcoming 50th birthday because she had done him proud for his – hiring a motor cruiser on Loch Lomond and splashing out on "fizz".After that weekend she phoned her mother from London to say she had returned home safely – and then nothing."We know she goes to see her family, they talk about the birthday. She comes back to London, makes contact and then she vanishes," said Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane, the senior investigating officer."And then from around the third week of April there is significant fraudulent activity in relation to her property and her finances which have involved at least three women impersonating her and a white man in his 50s posing as her brother to try and sell her flat. Obviously there have got to be serious concerns for her welfare."Detectives are scanning hours of CCTV footage from each of the locations where her bank details have been used or fraudulent activity has taken place.As they try to trace her last known movements, officers are analysing cell site data. It is understood they have identified the last place her phone was used but have not recovered the handset.The concern for Waugh grows daily. Her mother, Margaret, 78, who would speak to her daughter almost every other day on the phone, is said to be exhausted and too upset to speak. Her brother Chris had tears in his eyes as he spoke this week to appeal for his sister's friends and acquaintances to come forward to help the police.He always believed his sister could look after herself. "She is tough and driven, she had been to Libya on her own, she had loved it there, and compared to that London was easy," he said. "I always thought she was fine down here."Seven people have been arrested and released on police bail. One man has appeared in court charged in connection with the case.Anyone with relevant information is asked to contact the police incident room on 020 8721 4205 or speak to Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
