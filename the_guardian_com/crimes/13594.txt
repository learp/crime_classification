The government has wasted "a golden opportunity" to stop a repetition of the Harold Shipman serial killer scandal, a report by a committee of MPs says today.Plans to reform the way deaths are certified and investigated will do nothing to solve the problem of a GP intent on killing his patients, the committee says.Shipman was able to kill for years without arousing suspicion because he filled in all of his patients' death certificates. Two years ago, the Home Office proposed that a medical examiner based in a coroner's office check each death certificate for any suspicious trends.But the MPs say legislation proposed by the government ignores the Home Office proposals. The criticisms come in a damning report into reform of the coroners' system and death certification by the Commons constitutional affairs select committee, prompted by publication last month of the draft coroner bill, which aims to modernise a system largely unchanged since the 1920s.Proposals similar to the Home Office's were made by the Shipman inquiry and the Luce review, both commissioned by the government, to close the loophole that allowed Shipman to kill 215 patients over 23 years.The MPs' report says: "It is disappointing that the government has retreated from its 2004 proposals, leaving out much of what was good." Neither the Department of Health nor the Department for Constitutional Affairs seems to be taking responsibility for the issue, it says, so there is "no systematic and coordinated response to the serious issues raised".It accuses witnesses from both departments - who included the constitutional affairs minister, Harriet Harman - of being "evasive and vague" when asked about reform of death certification. "We can only assume from their evidence that, if anything specific is being done, it amounts to tinkering at the edges of a system which has already been deemed unsafe and unsatisfactory by two government-commissioned reviews."The committee also heard from Dame Janet Smith, the senior judge who investigated the Shipman killings, who told it that the reforms meant "there could still be a Shipman out there killing patients".The committee urges the government to reintroduce reform of death certification and ensure coroners are supported with adequate resources to do the job. The additional money provided in the draft bill - £5.8m a year - will only allow for an extra £22,000 a year to be given to each of the 60 coroner's offices for medical support.
