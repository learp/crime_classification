Two Sunderland players, Phil Bardsley and Stéphane Sessègnon, have returned from holidays to find their homes have been burgled with two cars apiece among the expensive items stolen.Northumbria police do not believe the crimes are connected but they have arrested a man in connection with the break-in at Sessègnon's home in Darras Hall, near Ponteland, in Northumberland and recovered a Range Rover. They are still looking for the Benin international's BMW along with some valuable jewellery.It is all part of a difficult few weeks for Bardsley. It is understood the right-back accepts he has no future at Sunderland after being pictured lying in a bed of £50 notes at a casino at the end of last season and is looking for a new club. Meanwhile it is not impossible that Paolo Di Canio, Sunderland's manager, may sell Sessegnon in order to fund team rebuilding.Having lined up Bosman deals for Lazio's Modibo Diakité, Marítimo's Valentin Roberge, Basel's Cabral and Le Havre's El-Hadji Ba, Sunderland are alsothought to be in discussions with Argentina's Atlético Tigre with a view to signing the left-back Lucas Orban. However, Danny Rose, who impressed while spending last season on loan from Tottenham, would be their preferred acquisition in that position.With Simon Mignolet, Sunderland's Belgium goalkeeper, continuing to attract admiring glances, Di Canio – who hopes to keep Mignolet – has pencilled in Celtic's Fraser Forster as his first-choice replacement and is also interested in Gary Hooper, the Celtic striker.
