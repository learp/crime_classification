An organisation representing crime reporters on national newspapers and TV has expressed concern that the suspension of a senior Metropolitan police press officer could set media relations back years.Jeff Edwards, the chairman of the Crime Reporters Association, said the decision to put Mike Cobb on temporary leave for alleged "unauthorised disclosure" of information could cloud a new era of glasnost at Scotland Yard, which has a reputation as one of the least forthcoming press operations in the public and private sectors."There has been a renaissance in media relations since Sir John Stephens took over as the Met's commissioner. He has even issued a policy document to tell his staff that they should engage with the media at every opportunity within reason. Every officer from the rank of inspector up has been given carte blanche to talk, if they so wish, to journalists," Edwards said."I fear this might have the effect of discouraging other staff there from being open and taking a different approach in their dealings with the media. No good can come of this."His comments are echoed by several other journalists, who have expressed surprise at the "heavy handed" nature of the inquiry.They have been contacted by the anti-corruption squad for formal interviews - Edwards said he had been grilled for an hour and a half last week.Mr Cobb, a civil servant who has been with the police press operation for 27 years, is one of the most popular press officers in the media, according to Edwards, who is the veteran crime writer on the Daily Mirror."That two men from the anti-corruption squad - who are normally employed to catch bent coppers - are employed to pursue a press officer over what is, at most, a disciplinary matter, is extraordinary," said Edwards.Edwards, in his capacity as chairman of the CRA, has already written to Sir John and other senior Metropolitan police staff to express his concern."I wrote to say I was surprised and concerned about his suspension and I said that, while not wishing to prejudge the matter, I wanted to register some support," he said."I told them he was one of the best assets Scotland Yard had and his love of work and enthusiasm made a positive difference to the way the Met is perceived by scores of journalists."I have known Mike for 20 years and he is a man of integrity; he is straightforward to deal with and is extremely well liked by journalists because, unlike some others, he's 24-hour accessible, he is sociable and he will go the extra mile to help you. "I have never ever known him to make a disclosure that would be damaging to the police and their investigations. He is a true enthusiast and he is absolutely loyal to the police forces," added the CRA chairman.Other crime correspondents, who have asked not to be named, echoed Edwards' sentiments."I am not sure if John Stephens knows what is going on but, if he does, he should be very concerned. If Mike loses his job they will loss a very powerful ambassador for the Met," said one."What has happened to Mike seems to be at odds with Sir John, who has regular press briefings and who is always saying, 'ring my police officers, ring my press offices'," said another. "I have known Mike for as long as most crime reporters and I have never known him brief against the Met. His interest is promoting good stories that reflect well on the Met."Another correspondent said he feared Mr Cobb could be taken out of action for 18 months because of the protracted inquiry system in the police force."That would be a tragedy," he said.
