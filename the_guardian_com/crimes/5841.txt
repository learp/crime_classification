Racked with sobs and moaning in pain, the father of six-year-old Liam Hogan was helped into a Greek court yesterday and charged with murdering the boy by jumping with him from a hotel balcony.John Hogan told an investigating magistrate in Crete that he could not remember leaping from the balcony with Liam tucked under one arm and his two-year-old daughter, Mia, under the other.Mr Hogan said the last thing he remembered was becoming frantic when his wife, Natasha, threatened to leave him and take the children with her. The magistrate was told he had a history of depression and two of his brothers had killed themselves.Liam Hogan suffered fatal head injuries in the fall from a fourth floor balcony earlier this month. Mr Hogan and Mia suffered broken bones.Since the accident Mr Hogan has been under police guard in the prisoners' ward of the University General hospital in Heraklion, Crete.Yesterday he was taken by ambulance to face the investigating magistrate, Christos Papagiorgopoulos, in Neapolis, northern Crete.He sobbed uncontrollably as he was removed from the vehicle, placed in a wheelchair and carried up the steps.He was moved into an ordinary chair to be carried up a flight of stairs and outside the magistrate's office he hugged his mother, Josephine, and another relative, gulping out: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." He hobbled before the magistrate, helped by members of his family and police officers, still weeping and shuddering.Following the accident, Mr Hogan, a 32-year-old tiler, has repeatedly told doctors and those close to him that he does not care what happens to him. He has been under suicide watch and there are rails across the windows of his hospital room to prevent him jumping again.The hearing was private but his lawyer, Dimitris Xiritakis, said his client's mother had told the judge that Mr Hogan had been severely affected by the suicides of his brothers: one took an overdose and the other jumped from a bridge.The lawyer said the magistrate was told that tragedy first hit the Hogan family when his father, also John, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis eight years ago. "The Hogan house was turned into a hospital. All the children suffered greatly."Mr Xiritakis continued: "Mr Hogan said he did not remember what happened on that day apart from that there was a verbal argument with his wife who had threatened to take his children away and go to live with her mother."The magistrate has asked for a psychiatric report on Mr Hogan. "If this shows he was not in a sane state of mind and this is accepted by the court at his trial, he will not be jailed. He will be sent to a mental institution," Mr Xiritakis said.
