A second postmortem examination will be carried out on Raoul Moat, following an appeal by members of his family, it emerged today.Detectives yesterday announced they had arrested four more people on suspicion of helping the fugitive gunman, who evaded police for a week, bringing the total number of arrests to 20. A police source confirmed that a second postmortem will be carried out in the wake of an appeal by his older brother Angus.Moat, 37, a former bouncer, shot dead his former girlfriend's new partner, Chris Brown, 29, earlier this month then turned the gun on Samantha Stobbart, 22, who survived.He went on to shoot PC David Rathband, 42, a father of two, who was blinded by the gunshots, as he sat in his patrol car.The gunman's brother Angus, 39, a tax inspector from Newcastle, asked for the second examination of his body after the first one found no marks consistent with a Taser injury. At an inquest last week, it emerged Raoul Moat had been shot by two unapproved XRep Tasers, fired by firearms officers from West Yorkshire police around the same time he apparently shot himself in the head.The weapons, with a 12-gauge shotgun action, which are being tested by the Home Office before being approved for police use, have a much longer range than a normal Taser.However, the Home Office stresses that police could use it as long as it was "lawful, reasonable and proportionate".The matter has been voluntarily referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission by Northumbria police.Moat's uncle, former soldier Charlie Alexander, 72, said he did not know when the second postmortem examination would take place.He said: "We've not been told when it will take place but it could be tomorrow."The coroner's officer said they wanted it done as soon as possible so we can get on and arrange for the funeral. After the first postmortem we were not even allowed to touch the body in case it interfered with the results of the second."We are hoping not to make a big deal of Raoul's funeral but we can't do anything about people finding out and turning up. He had a lot of friends."Alexander said Moat's brother, Angus, 39, had gone on holiday with friends. "He just needed to get away from it all so they've taken him away," he added.A spokesman for Newcastle coroner's office refused to comment.Meanwhile, the extraordinary numbers of those arrested in connection with the ongoing police investigation illustrate the potentially vast underworld network in which Moat operated for many years.Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson – who led the hunt for Moat – has already vowed to prosecute anyone who helped the killer during his time on the run.Northumbria police said that a man held yesterday on suspicion of firearms offences was continuing to help with inquiries.The four arrested this morning – two men and two women – were also being questioned on suspicion of assisting an offender.A man and a woman were arrested in Blyth as well as a man and woman in Newcastle.As well as the two men who have been charged with an offence – Karl Ness, 26, from Dudley, North Tyneside, and Qhuram Awan, 23, from Blyth – a further 13 people have been released on police bail pending further inquiries. Ness and Awan are due to appear before Newcastle crown court on Thursday on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and possession of a firearm with intent.They are accused of helping Moat during his time on the run and were arrested in Rothbury, where the fugitive was finally cornered on 9 July. The 37-year-old ex-nightclub bouncer apparently shot himself early on 10 July by the River Coquet at the end of a six-hour stand-off.
