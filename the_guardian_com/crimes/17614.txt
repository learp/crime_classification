Three inmates at Feltham young offenders' institute in west London staged a rooftop disturbance last night while others lit small fires in their cells.The three gained access to the roof just after 8pm, a spokeswoman for the Prison Service said. They did not appear to be protesting, but instead were running around and shouting abuse, she said. They were still up there at 11pm, despite the cold. Staff were negotiating with them to persuade them to come down. After the incident began, other inmates started fires in their cells, but these were quickly extinguished by staff, the spokeswoman said. Scotland Yard said police were called in to secure the area. HM Young Offender Institute Feltham was set up in 1991 after the amalgamation of two other centres. It has a capacity for 922 inmates and is split into Feltham A, housing juveniles up to 17 years, and Feltham B, for prisoners aged 18-21. The prison regime includes education workshops, vocational training in the building trade, farms and gardens, works and national vocational qualifications (NVQs). The three men who staged the disturbance last night were returning from "juvenile education" when they escaped on to the roof. The Prison Reform Trust said last night it had been worried about developments at Feltham for months. In the past two months, Feltham had lost its governor, deputy governor, a third senior manager and its head of education, who all moved to jobs elsewhere, the trust said. It described the Prison Service as "breathtakingly irresponsible" to allow so many senior staff to leave at once. Juliet Lyon, the trust's director, said: "The importance of strong and stable leadership in an institution holding vulnerable and volatile young men cannot be overstated." The former chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, described Feltham as "one of the worst" parts of the prison system when he retired.
