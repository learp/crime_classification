A nursery worker who sexually abused children in her care and took indecent images of her victims has named some of them, it was reported today.Vanessa George, who worked at Little Ted's Nursery in Plymouth, Devon, had previously refused to name any of the victims and they were impossible to identify because their faces were not shown in the images.The Mirror reported a source saying the 39-year-old had told "everything she knows", and said the number of abused children she had identified was in "double digits".The source said all the victims were under the age of three, according to the paper.George is due to be sentenced at Bristol crown court next month after admitting seven sexual assaults and six counts of distributing and making indecent pictures of children.Mr Justice Royce, who will sentence George, urged her to reveal the identities of her victims.George took more than 100 images and use a mobile phone to send them to two paedophiles she met on Facebook. She had never met them in person before they appeared in court together.Co-defendants Colin Blanchard, 39, from Rochdale, and Angela Allen, also 39, from Nottingham, have admitted several sex offences.Blanchard pleaded guilty to 17 child pornography counts, two sexual assaults on children, and a further charge of possessing extreme pornography.Allen pleaded guilty to four child sex assaults and one count of distributing an indecent image.Devon and Cornwall police said they were in talks with George's lawyers about the identity of the victims."We are involved in dialogue with defence counsel and this question is part of that," a statement said."It would be inappropriate to go into this further until sentencing is complete. We continue to update parents regularly regarding this investigation."Currently no individual children have been identified, but we continue to investigate this."
