The news that last year children too young to be prosecuted were the chief suspects in 2,840 crimes in England and Wales has produced outrage. The Daily Mirror branded them "The Untouchables"; shadow home secretary David Davis said the figures showed criminals were getting younger; Laurence Lee, solicitor for Jon Venables, one of the two 10-year-olds convicted of murdering James Bulger, said a reduction in the age of criminal responsibility to eight or nine should be considered to stop "children marauding around like packs of wolves".The age at which children can be punished varies dramatically - from seven in much of Asia and Africa up to 13 in France, 14 in Germany, Italy and Japan, 15 across Scandinavia and 18 in Belgium. England and Wales opt for 10. Two anomalies: it is a liberal 18 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a draconian eight in Scotland.Pressure groups dealing with children and criminality in the UK want the age increased - at least to 14 and perhaps to 18. "We need to look at a young person who commits an offence as a child, not a criminal," says Bob Reitemeier, chief executive of the Children's Society. "Locking children in a room with bars is not suitable, even for murder," says Will McMahon, policy adviser at the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies. "They need access to therapeutic communities."McMahon is critical of the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act for removing the "doli incapax" rule that presumed children under 14 could not be held responsible for their actions unless it was proved otherwise. For 10 to 14-year-olds, the onus is now on the defence to prove the child did not understand the difference between right and wrong. It seems we are anxious about the "erosion of childhood", except when it comes to crime.
