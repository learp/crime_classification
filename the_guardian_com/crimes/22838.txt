The flamboyant former Wham! frontman George Michael has a long and fractious relationship with illegal substances and with the strong arm of the law – encounters with the former often leading to encounters with the latter.The most high profile of the singer's misdemeanours came in 1998, when he was arrested for "engaging in a lewd act" with an undercover policeman in a Beverley Hills public toilet. The incident was not entirely negative, however – it inspired the irony-laden risqué song, Outside, in which he openly discussed his sexuality.In 2007 Michael was ordered to do 100 hours community service and banned from driving for two years after being found slumped over the wheel of his Mercedes in Cricklewood, north London, in October 2006. Just months earlier in February, he had been found in a similar position in his car near Hyde Park Corner and had called his arrest for possession of class C drugs his "own stupid fault, as usual".When he was arrested in September 2008, even he pointed out that the frequency of his arrests was becoming "boring". The singer was caught in a public toilet on Hampstead Heath in north London and arrested and cautioned for possession of substances believed to be crack cocaine and cannabis. After the incident he said: "I want to apologise to my fans for screwing up again, and to promise them I'll sort myself out. And to say sorry to everybody else, just for boring them."After his most recent arrest he wrote on his website that he was trying to deal with his demons. "Personal problems, which I had tried to deal with myself, had clearly got the better of me," he wrote. "I am sorry that my pride has prevented me from seeking help before now."In a nod to his long-suffering fans, he added: "As usual, I am overwhelmed by the support and genuine concern that so many of you around the world have expressed."
