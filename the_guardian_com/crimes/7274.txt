Rolf Harris has lost the first round of his bid to appeal against his convictions for a string of indecent assaults.A spokesman for the judicial office confirmed on Friday that a judge has refused his application for permission to appeal.But it is still open to the 84-year-old to renew the application before three judges at the court of appeal.The artist and musician was convicted of 12 indecent assaults at London’s Southwark crown court on 30 June – one on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter’s friend over 16 years.The appeal move was refused by a single judge considering the application on the case papers.Liz Dux, abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon, who represents victims of Harris, said: “The victims will be very relieved. They have already been through the horrific ordeal of a long and extremely stressful trial.“They want this over so they can get on with their lives as best they can, although for some the damage Harris has done will sadly be irreparable.“We must not forget the very serious nature of the crimes Harris committed. Justice has rightly been done and the victims will be pleased at the outcome.”
