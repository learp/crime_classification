Reporting a crime or handing over your possessions on arrest at a London police station in Lewisham or Deptford will soon be very different. Instead of a grim-faced desk sergeant you are likely to be dealt with by a smiling customer services officer from the building group John Laing. Laing finance director Adrian Ewer says there is no question of getting officially "nicked" by any of his staff but they will be there to greet you at the front desk. And if you are unlucky enough to get locked up in a custody cell they will be bringing you your food and drink. The takeover of tasks traditionally done by the police has been agreed as part of a £120m private finance initiative contract signed by Laing subsidiary Equion and the Metropolitan Police. The deal was announced at the end of October last year but the details on the extent of Laing's work surfaced as the group reported its latest - and dismal - set of annual results. Laing insists the company "will not be usurping" the traditional role of the police but said the move should allow more bobbies to get back on the beat. And the groundbreaking contract to build and operate Bromley, Lewisham, Sutton and Deptford stations over the next three years could be replicated in an even bigger way in Greater Manchester. Equion is the preferred bidder on an £81m PFI deal there involving 17 police stations. PFI work helped the Laing Investments side of the business to notch up a profit before interest of £83.2m from £27.4m in 2000. The 2001 figure was boosted by the £48m sale of its Spanish toll-road business, Europistas. Pretax profits at the group crashed from £5.7m last time to a £24.7m loss in the 12 months mainly due to a £94.5m operating loss at Laing Construction. This business, which ran into trouble with contracts such as Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, has now been sold leaving Laing to concentrate on infrastructure - including PFI - and housing through Laing Homes.
