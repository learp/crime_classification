Adolescent high jinks are being criminalised because of the "over-zealous" treatment of young people, it was claimed yesterday.Ceri Davies, of the YMCA, said a distinction was needed between normal adolescent behaviour and low-level crime. His comments came as Rod Morgan, the government's chief adviser on youth crime, said a generation of children was being "demonised".Professor Morgan told the Independent on Sunday that children as young as 10 were being labelled with "the mark of Cain on their foreheads" because of the focus on antisocial behaviour.
