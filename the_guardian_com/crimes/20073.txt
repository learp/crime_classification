The prison service is not doing enough to help prevent inmates from reoffending when they leave jail, an influential committee of MPs said today. The Commons' public accounts committee (PAC) suggested that a range of measures could reduce the number of offenders who commit further crimes when they are released from prison in England and Wales.It was "totally unsatisfactory" that some prisons were spending as little as Â£205 per head a year on education, said the cross-party committee.The MPs called for greater emphasis on improving literacy and numeracy to help inmates into work, keeping them in institutions close to home so it was easier to maintain family links and developing programmes for prisoners serving short sentences."Many of the prison service's current programmes are designed for longer term prisoners, and yet prisoners most likely to reoffend are predominantly young and serving short sentences," said the report."More emphasis should be put on providing basic literacy and numeracy for short-term offenders."Currently nearly six out of 10 inmates commit a further crime within two years of release.The committee suggested that the prison service should set targets to keep inmates near to their family home and fewer should be moved from one institution to another if they are in the middle of an education or rehabilitation programme.More volunteers should be recruited to provide education in jails, it added.The prison service should also agree targets with the NHS to reduce the amount of time mentally ill offenders spend waiting for in-patient treatment, it said.The committee also called for an investigation to establish why some jails were more successful than others at finding inmates jobs on release.For example, while across England and Wales fewer than one in three inmates enter jobs or training on release, 44% of those from Thorn Cross prison in Cheshire do.The report added: "The prison service should give greater emphasis to helping prisoners find accommodation on their release."The committee chairman, Edward Leigh said: "This is an issue of importance to the whole community but the current approach to reducing reoffending is failing both the victims and the perpetrators of crime."The Liberal Democrat shadow home secretary, Simon Hughes said: "Imprisonment should not be about killing time. Prison should be tough but rewarding for those who decide to use their time well, with a full working day of employment or education."We welcome the constructive suggestions from the public accounts committee. But it is clear that the problems the PAC describes stem from the fact that short prison sentences are often a bad choice for any judge or magistrate who is interested in reducing crime."Going to jail can mean losing your job, your home and your family. It is a recipe for reoffending. Far better to plough the money spent on non-violent, short-term prisoners into tough but effective alternatives in the community, where offenders can be closely monitored without being completely severed from mainstream life."Paul Cavadino, chief executive of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro), said: "The facts speak for themselves. Research shows that prisoners released with a job are half as likely to reoffend as unemployed ex-prisoners. "Getting released prisoners into stable accommodation cuts their likelihood of reoffending by one fifth. Prisoners who have had education in literacy and numeracy reoffend at one third of the rate of those who have not. "Prisoners released without family support are up to six times more likely to reoffend than those without it. Drug-addicted ex-prisoners who take part in treatment programmes reoffend at one fifth of the rate of those who do not. In short, improving prisoners' resettlement can play a vital part in cutting crime."
