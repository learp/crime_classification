Detectives believe a series of sex attacks in south London which target lone women at night are linked.Eight women have been assaulted in Clapham in the last month, forcing police to raise patrols.All of the women described the man as being of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern appearance with dark hair, police said. Detectives said the man is targeting lone women late at night, with all eight victims in their 20s and 30s.The latest attack was on Wednesday night when a woman was pushed into a block of flats along Sudbourne Road and sexually assaulted. Earlier that night a 28-year-old woman was grabbed by a man on Southwell Road. He ran off after she screamed.Police are urging women to be vigilant after the attacks. Supt Rob Applegarth, of Lambeth borough, said: “We are aware of eight assaults which we are linking at this early stage. We have increased police patrols in Clapham and Brixton Hill and urge women to think of their personal safety.“We are also releasing CCTV and an image of a man we would now like to speak to in connection with these incidents.”The first attack took place at 11.30pm on 9 October when a woman was grabbed and sexually assaulted on Clitheroe Road. A second incident took place in the early hours of Saturday 10 October, and on 22 October a man placed his hands up the dress of a woman at around 9pm on Trent Road.And on Monday night three assaults took place in close proximity in the space of three hours.One 35-year-old woman was grabbed at around 7.05pm, and just over an hour later another woman was also assaulted as she entered her home. CCTV footage of the attack, which took place on Rosebery Road at 8.15pm, has been released by police.At 9.36pm the same night, a man exposed himself to a 28-year-old woman on Sandmere Road who alerted police.Police are urging anyone who recognises the man in the CCTV footage to contact them.DS Gordon Barclay, who is leading the investigation, said: “Lambeth police would like to advise women to remain vigilant when travelling at night and would also ask that anybody who may have any information regarding these offences to make contact with police.“The CCTV and the still are of good quality and we are confident that someone will be able to identify this particular man. I urge anyone with any information about these incidents to call us urgently.”A man was arrested by police in connection with one of the assaults but was released on Wednesday and bailed until November.
