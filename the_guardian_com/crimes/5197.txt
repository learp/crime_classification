Two pensioners helped flood Britain with cannabis worth millions of pounds disguised as frozen chicken imports, a court heard today.Derek Mercer, of South Norwood, south-east London and John Rowe, from Bethnal Green, east London, both 70, deny "being knowingly concerned" in smuggling the drug into Britain.Three other men have admitted taking part. They are Patrick Maloney, 51, of Southwark, south-east London; Russ O'Cuneff, 51, of Poplar, east London; and Wattie Soutter, 68, from Rotherhithe, south-east London.Southwark crown court heard that the consignments were shipped from the Netherlands to a bonded meat warehouse in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. The pallets were then collected by the men and delivered to Mercer's haulage and storage company in Grays, Essex.Andrew Marshall, prosecuting, said the next stage was to "very quickly distribute" the Class B drug to customers so the "evidence disappears". He said police spent time tracking the gang's movements before raiding Mercer's company premises nearly six months ago.All five defendants were arrested at the scene. Two other men, Anthony Fraser and Neil Mulligan, who were also allegedly involved, "did a runner", according to Marshall.The barrister said a search of the premises uncovered 1.4 tonnes of cannabis in Mercer's warehouse. Another 400kg were found in Soutter's van, while 60kg of the more potent "skunk" form of the drug were allegedly found in Rowe's car."That is all worth an awful lot of money, certainly millions of pounds," counsel explained."Even this importation alone ranks as a major one, but when you look back and see how many have gone in previously you can see really quite massive quantities of cannabis resin have been brought into the country in this way. It is really a significant drug smuggling enterprise."The jury was told that of the two men on trial only Mercer had answered questions when interviewed. He told officers he had been approached three weeks earlier by a man he knew as Tony, who had asked to use his yard for a "loading and unloading exercise".Mercer said he had asked if there was anything "iffy" going on after having been offered Â£500 for this service, but asserted he thought everything was legal."I didn't really know it was drugs, I can tell you that," he said.
