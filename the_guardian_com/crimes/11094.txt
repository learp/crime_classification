A factory worker has been found guilty of murdering his girlfriend after hatching a plot with his secret lover and her uncle to secure a £120,000 life insurance payout and a share of a house.Rafal Nowak, 31, killed university graduate Catherine Wells-Burr, 23, as she slept at the couple's home in Chard, Somerset.His secret lover, Anna Lagwinowicz, 32, and her uncle, Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, 38, took Wells-Burr's body in her car to a remote spot and set fire to it.A jury at Bristol crown court convicted Nowak, Lagwinowicz and Dmytryszyn, who are all originally from Poland, of murder and they will be sentenced on Monday.The court had been told that the three defendants planned to secure a £123,000 life insurance payout and a half share of a £137,000 two-bedroom house Nowak and Wells-Burr had bought together.The murder was the result of months of secret meetings and phonecalls between Nowak and Lagwinowicz, with Wells-Burr oblivious to her part in the so-called love triangle.Nowak smothered a sleeping Wells-Burr with a pillow, before Lagwinowicz and Dmytryszyn removed her body from the house and drove it in her red Ford Focus to a countryside beauty spot. They placed the university graduate in the driver's seat and set fire to the car at 6am – 20 minutes after Nowak had clocked into work – providing him with what he thought was the perfect alibi.The defendants had spent months leaving a false trail for detectives, creating fake profiles for Wells-Burr on adult websites and sending texts to her phone from a supposed mystery lover.During the trial, a heavily-tattooed Nowak, wept in the witness box as he insisted he played no part in the death of his "true love".The father-of-one, who has a wife and teenage son in his native Poland, told the jury: "Everyone blames me for something that I never done."The court heard how Nowak showed no emotion at all when police discovered Wells-Burr's body in her burnt-out car on the morning of 12 September last year.Her mother, Jayne Wells-Burr, told the jury that he didn't mention Catherine at all — instead asking for a steak dinner after his initial release from police custody.Speaking after the verdicts, Wells-Burr's parents called for tougher immigration controls. Phil and Jayne Wells-Burr, who are no longer together, said Nowak — who has a conviction for assaulting his wife in Poland — would not have been allowed into the UK had this country's immigration rules been as strict as the those in the US.They blamed the European Union and said the UK needed to toughen up.Jayne Wells-Burr, 46, said: "There is no screening of people coming into this country. We didn't know that Rafal had had an assault charge on him while back in Poland. I kind of think this government needs to wake up a bit."Members of Wells-Burr's family wept in court as the verdicts were announced. The three murderers showed no emotion.
