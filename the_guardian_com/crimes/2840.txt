The 28-day limit on detention without charge for terror suspects should be increased to between 50 and 90 days, Britain's most senior police officer told MPs yesterday.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, flanked by Peter Clarke, the head of the anti-terrorism branch, admitted that there had not been a case in which the police had required more than 28 days to question a suspect, but argued the law should be changed now as a precaution."At some stage 28 days is not going to be sufficient, and the worst time to debate whether an extension is needed would be in the aftermath of an atrocity," Sir Ian told the Commons home affairs select committee. "The prospect we need more than 28 days in the not too distant future is so real that parliament needs to consider it."Sir Ian's intervention sets the stage for a rerun of the bruising parliamentary battle over detention without charge two years ago, in which Tony Blair suffered his only parliamentary defeat when he tried to extend the limit to 90 days. MPs allowed the limit to be doubled from 14 days to 28.Sir Ian said terrorist conspiracies and conspirators were increasing, as was the magnitude of their ambition in terms of destruction and loss of life.Fewer cases were under investigation but each was more complex in terms of documents, telephones and computers: "The pragmatic inference can be drawn that 28 days will not be sufficient." He likened the situation to dealing with an epidemic: "If you can see the epidemic moving towards you, you start to take precautions before it arrives."Sir Ian and Mr Clarke told the MPs that since the 28-day limit was introduced in July 2006 204 people had been arrested under the counter-terrorism powers. Eleven had been detained for between 14 and 28 days, with eight subsequently charged with terror-related offences and three released. Sir Ian said it was not good enough for parliament to leave the upper limit to a judge who would oversee its renewal every seven days, as that could be represented as "detention in perpetuity".The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said any increase needed to be based on evidence - not guesswork - that it was needed to protect the public: "The government already has the power to go beyond 28 days if the threat reaches the 'magnitude' Sir Ian foresees in the future."
