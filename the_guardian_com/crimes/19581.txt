The sex attacker cleared of killing two Brighton schoolgirls 20 years ago in the so-called Babes in the Wood case will not be retried under new double jeopardy laws, police said today.Sources told the BBC there was not enough fresh evidence to prosecute Russell Bishop, who was found not guilty at a trial in 1987 of killing Nicola Fellows, 10, and nine-year-old Karen Hadaway.Bishop is serving a life term in prison after being convicted of a 1990 attack in which he kidnapped a seven-year-old and sexually assaulted her at a South Downs beauty spot before attempting to strangle her and leaving her for dead.The 40-year-old had been a builder and unemployed roofer before his imprisonment, and was friendly with Nicola Fellows' family.Reversing 800 years of legal history, the government last year overturned laws preventing people being tried twice for the same crime.On Monday Billy Dunlop, who had been acquitted of murdering pizza delivery driver Julie Hogg in 1991, pleaded guilty in the first case to be retried under the new laws.The Babes in the Wood case is one of the longest running unsolved murder cases in the UK.The two girls were found sexually assaulted and strangled in a park near their home in Brighton in October 1986.The case to convict Bishop for their murder collapsed in 1987 after forensic evidence was found to be wanting and his defence lawyers accused the police of framing him.After he was imprisoned in 1990, Bishop called for the case to be reopened, and police examined whether evidence was in a suitable condition to be analysed again using the more sophisticated forensic technology now available.The BBC quoted the police as saying that the material did not amount to the "genuinely new evidence" required by the new double jeopardy laws.Assistant Chief Constable Nigel Yeo of Sussex police said the murders remained an unsolved case."We have recently carried out an extensive review ... and are satisfied that there is insufficient [evidence] to meet the necessary evidential standard required to formally seek the opinion of the CPS in relation to any possible suspects," he said."As with any unsolved case, we remain anxious for any further evidence and will regularly review what we have."
