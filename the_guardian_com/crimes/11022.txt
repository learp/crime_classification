An unemployed man who sent a "grossly offensive" threatening letter to the BBC sports presenter Sue Barker was warned yesterday that he faced up to six months in jail. The police were contacted after Ms Barker complained about the letter, which mentioned the 1999 murder of the Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando and was "unpleasant, hurtful and vindictive". Barry Tullett, 57, who has written scripts and musicals, admitted three charges under the Malicious Communications Act at West London magistrates' court yesterday. He had sent one letter to Ms Barker, 48, last February, and then two to a journalist who had written a story about the first letter. Sarah Counsell, prosecuting, said the letter to Ms Barker began by complaining about an incident Tullett believed that Ms Barker had been involved in, and then made threats to different groups of people. The court heard that the letters to the journalist were racist and intimidating. Suman Sharma, defending, said her client was of previous good character and wrote the letters as he was angry that the BBC had used his scripts without crediting him. The case was adjourned until February 10 for pre-sentence reports. Tullett was bailed.
