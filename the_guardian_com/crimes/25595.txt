The campaign to publicise the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is to extend to billboard advertising across London.Digital billboards with the strapline "Missing Madeleine - please contact Crimestoppers with any information - 0800 555 111" will be going up around the capital.The campaign, which will feature four different images of McCann, the four-year-old who went missing in Portugal at the start of the month, is predicted to be seen by more than 2 million people a week.It will be rotated across a series of nine digital billboards through Clear Channel Outdoor's network of London locations including Archway, Brixton, Finchley Road, Holland Park and Old Street.Earlier this week, an advertising industry collaboration launched a viral video ad with the McCann family's consent featuring a voiceover by My Family and Harry Potter actor Zoe Wanamaker.Media planning and buying agency ZenithOptimedia is also negotiating TV airtime for the viral ad in the UK and several other European countries.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
