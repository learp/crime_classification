A woman sexually assaulted a five-month-old girl while allowing her boyfriend to take indecent photographs on his mobile phone, a court heard.Tracy Dawber, 43, a care worker, assaulted the baby on the sofa at her home in Southport, Merseyside, Bristol crown court was told. Her hands and clothing could be seen in the pictures, which were discovered on the phone of Colin Blanchard, 38, an IT businessman whom she met on the internet, it was alleged.Dawber, who faces one count of sexually assaulting a child and five counts of permitting indecent photographs of a child to be taken, accepts she is in the photographs but denies all charges.The jury was told that Blanchard had pleaded guilty to taking the photographs.Dawber and Blanchard met online and were in a relationship for about a year, ending in September 2008, said Simon Morgan, prosecuting. They saw each other weekly. "In June 2009, a mobile phone was recovered from Colin Blanchard's possession, and images were discovered. The child involved is very young, indeed only four or five months old."We say Tracy Dawber permitted Colin Blanchard to take these photographs. The pictures looked posed, and it's clearly not a natural pose. The crown say the defendant was aware Colin Blanchard was taking photographs and put the child into poses for that purpose," Morgan said. He said an expert determined that the photos, taken in August 2008, must have been taken no more than 30cm away from the child and over a period of 64 seconds.During a search of Blanchard's property in Rochdale, Lancashire, in June 2009, a laptop computer "revealed correspondence" between Dawber and Blanchard that related to a Facebook account, he said.Another laptop seized revealed further Facebook correspondence between the two.On 11 June 2009, a mobile phone was found in Blanchard's Volvo and indecent images of children were discovered on it.Morgan said that a total of 10 images were "of interest" to the police. The first three showed Blanchard in his vehicle, the next five showed images of a young child, and the final two were of Dawber and Blanchard together.Dawber, who works as a community hospital carer for the elderly, was arrested on 17 November 2009 and immediately denied ever touching a child, the jury heard.The case continues.
