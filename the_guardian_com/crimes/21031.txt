Fresh controversy erupted in the Madeleine McCann investigation last night as Portuguese police sources suggested that DNA tests proved that the missing four-year-old's body had been in the boot of a car hired by her parents 25 days after she disappeared.The tests, conducted by the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham, are said to have found a "full match" with Madeleine's DNA in the car driven by Kate and Gerry McCann, who were last week declared suspects in their daughter's disappearance.Police told Portugal's SIC television that two out of three test results on samples found in the boot of the Renault Scenic showed they undoubtedly belonged to Madeleine, who went missing from a Praia da Luz holiday resort on May 3.Sky News quoted its own sources as saying that not only were the DNA tests an almost perfect match with Madeleine but they also were extremely unlikely to have been old specimens transferred through contact with luggage, toys, clothing or any other means - a claim disputed by British forensic scientists.Professor Mark Jobling, from the University of Leicester, said the results did not mean Madeleine's body had necessarily been in the boot. "DNA evidence shows that material from a specific person was or is at a particular place but how it got there is another matter," he said.Meanwhile Portugal's assistant attorney general confirmed that British officers could be called upon to question the McCanns on behalf of their Portuguese colleagues."This is the most usual procedure when people involved in certain investigations in Portugal are outside the country," Antonio Cluny told Publico newspaper. "That is what we will possibly see the next time the police or the prosecutor's office wish to talk to the couple."This would only happen if Portuguese detectives had additional questions for them and the McCanns broke a pledge to return if asked.Police spokesman Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa confirmed that the McCanns' return to Britain would make the investigation more difficult if police or prosecutors wished to talk to them. "If new questioning is required then the fact that the parents have returned to England would create difficulties," he said.As the couple, back home in Leicestershire yesterday, took advice from London law firm Kingsley Napley, police and social services representatives held talks about the case.Portuguese police failed to deliver papers to prosecutors in Portimao, the main town close to Praia da Luz, yesterday and were expected to do so today, Publico reported on its website. It was unclear how long it would take the main prosecutor, Joao Cunha de Magalhaes, to decide whether further action is needed against the McCanns.Repercussions from the case were spreading across Portugal yesterday.The head of the Algarve's tourism industry association, Eliderico Viegas, criticised the police and the Portuguese government for the way they handled the British media. "The police were not prepared to cope with this," he told the Diario de Noticias newspaper.The British lawyersMichael Caplan QC and his colleagues at Kingsley Napley, the law firm called in by Kate and Gerry McCann, are used to high-profile cases. Among their former clients are "rogue trader" Nick Leeson and Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet, and they advised Tony Blair before he appeared at the Hutton inquiry.Mr Caplan is a behind-the-scenes operator who largely shuns the media. While working, successfully, to prevent General Pinochet's extradition to Spain to face torture charges, his only comment on defending a man accused of such deeds was: "I have a duty to a client, just as a surgeon does to a patient." He became a QC in 2002, only the seventh solicitor to be granted the honour.Angus McBride, the other partner in the firm advising the McCanns, has built up a particular expertise in "managing and protecting the reputation of individuals and companies subject to either media or criminal investigation", according to the firm's website.He represented actor Chris Langham on charges of downloading child porn, and has acted for a number of footballers in criminal investigations, including the two Premiership players accused of rape at a hotel in 2003.Clare Dyer
