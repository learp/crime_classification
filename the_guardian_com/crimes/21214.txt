A man with a "fetish" for surreptitiously cutting women's hair murdered and mutilated a seamstress before leaving a hank of another person's hair in her hand, a court heard.Danilo Restivo is alleged to have bludgeoned his neighbour, Heather Barnett, to death with a heavy instrument and slashed her throat.Restivo, an Italian national, then mutilated her, Winchester crown court was told.He left a clump of another person's hair in her right hand and cut off some of her hair, which he placed under her left hand, it was claimed.Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Barnett's children Terry, then 14, and Caitlin, 11, found their mother's body in the bathroom of their ground floor flat in Bournemouth, Dorset in November 2002.Bowes alleged that Restivo was also responsible for the murder in Italy of a 16-year-old girl called Elisa Claps, who went missing in September 1993.Her body was discovered in a loft of a church in Potenza in southern Italy in March 2010.She had been repeatedly stabbed and locks of her own hair had been cut from her head shortly after her death and left next to her body.Her bra was cut or broken at the front, in the same way as Barnett's was, the jury heard. The presence of cut hair in both cases is "akin to a hallmark", Bowes said.Restivo, 39, from Bournemouth, denies the murder of Barnett, 48. The court heard that an inquiry into Claps's murder has been taking place in Italy but the jury was told it would not be asked to return a verdict on that case.Bowes said Barnett had been murdered in a "premeditated" manner and he warned the jury that the killing was "harrowing" and "distressing".He said: "On 12 November 2002, two children aged 14 and 11 came home from school in Bournemouth to find that their mother, Heather Barnett, had been brutally murdered and her body mutilated with a knife."She had been killed by repeated forceful blows to her head, her body had then been dragged to her bathroom in her flat, where her children found her."He added that it was believed that Barnett knew her killer. "There were no signs of any forced entry to the flat indicating Heather Barnett had known the murderer and had let him into the flat by the front door."Bowes said there was "strong evidence" from a "substantial number of women and girls" in Bournemouth and Italy that Restivo had cut their hair without their permission on buses and, on one occasion, at a cinema.He had a "fetish" for cutting hair from women, it was claimed. The identity of the person whose hair was found in Barnett's right hand was not known, the jury was told.Bowes said that in 2004 police had watched Restivo at secluded locations near Bournemouth observing or following women.On one occasion he was stopped by officers who found in his bag a "large fillet type knife" and a packet of tissues.In the boot of his car, police discovered a hooded jacket with a balaclava and gloves in the pockets. Two pairs of scissors were found in the driver's door pocket.Turning to the murder of Claps, Bowes claimed Restivo had arranged to meet her at the Church of the Most Holy Trinity in Potenza nine years before Barnett's murder. "After their meeting she was not seen again," said Bowes.He said there were "striking similarities" between the murders of Claps and Barnett.Bowes told the court that Restivo was born in Sicily. In March 2002, he arrived in Bournemouth to get to know a woman called Fiamma Marsango whom he had met on the internet and who lived opposite Barnett.He later told police he was not happy in Italy and came to England to learn English and get a good job. Restivo and Marsango married in 2004.The court heard of the harrowing moment when Barnett's children arrived home from school and found her body."Terry felt something was wrong," said Bowes. "There was a big silence, which he did not like."Terry noticed the bathroom door was closed. Caitlin opened it a little. Both children discovered their mother lying dead on the bathroom floor."Terry dialled 999 and the children waited outside. By coincidence, said Bowes, Restivo and Marsango arrived home then."It appears that Danilo Restivo appeared to comfort Terry," Bowes said.Four days after the murder, police found a pair of Restivo's training shoes soaking in bleach at his home. Invisible traces of blood were later found inside the trainers.Bowes told the jury placing the shoes in bleach was a "deliberate attempt to remove any forensic link to the scene of the murder".The jury was also told that a bloodstained green towel was discovered at the scene and in 2008 a DNA profile was found that could be linked to Restivo.After he was told of the alleged DNA link following his arrest in May 2010, Restivo said the towel had come from his house but he had given it to Barnett as a colour sample for curtains he wanted made.Bowes alleged that Restivo may have used the towel to wipe Barnett's blood from him and accidentally left it at her flat.The trial continues.
