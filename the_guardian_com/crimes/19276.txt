Police searching for the body of Kate Prout are combing an area of about 250 square metres, it was revealed on Tuesday.Kate Prout's husband, Adrian, admitted last week that he murdered his wife and was taken from his prison cell to their former home to point out the spot where he buried her body.Searching at Redhill Farm in Redmarley in Gloucestershire began on Monday but so far police have found "nothing of significance".Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson, who is overseeing the search, said: "Adrian Prout indicated to us that a plot of land measuring approximately 250 square metres was where he had buried Mrs Prout."We have subjected part of that area to ground penetrating radar testing and dug some of the ground with the assistance of a forensic archaeologist, however nothing has yet been found."We are today widening the search area, working methodically outwards. This is a delicate and painstaking process."We are seeking advice from body deposition experts and the National Policing Improvement Agency in order to further the process."This search could, however, take some time and our thoughts are always with Kate Prout's family, who we are keeping constantly updated."Adrian Prout, a wealthy farmer, was convicted last year of murdering his wife, who was last seen in November 2007.He had protested his innocence until he failed a lie detector test organised by supporters who had campaigned for his release.Prout finally broke the news that he was guilty to his fiancee, Debbie Garlick, after which he was visited by police. He confessed that he had murdered his wife and agreed to show officers where he had buried the body. He was taken to the farm on Friday and spent 25 minutes pointing out the area where the remains had been left.
