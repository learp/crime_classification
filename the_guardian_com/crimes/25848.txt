A manipulative accountant, dubbed a Lady Macbeth for her "wicked schemes", was last night facing life in jail after she was convicted of the brutal murder of her husband.Carol Croydon attacked her husband, Philip, 49, with a cheese knife at the Hilton hotel at East Midlands airport, after arranging to meet him there to boost their "flagging" marriage, Nottingham crown court was told. In his room she performed a sex act on him before stabbing him 22 times in the neck and chest. She then tied patterned neckties around each of his wrists and one around his neck, and placed a scarf over his face before showering, changing and leaving him naked at the foot of the bed, the court heard. Minutes later, she made a series of phone calls as part of an "elaborate charade" to make it appear that her husband was missing. Within eight hours, she was having sex with her secret lover, Nelson Bland, on the sofa at her home. She concocted another series of elaborate lies to try to escape responsibility for the killing. After the 37-year-old was arrested she told the police that she had left her husband in the hotel with a couple of swingers, and gave detailed descriptions of the pair. The judge, Mr Justice Treacy, dismissed her claims to have suffered sexual abuse as a child and sentenced her to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months in jail before she could be considered for parole. He said Croydon, who said she had acted out of desperation after a lifetime of sexual abuse and domestic violence, was a "cold-hearted and ruthless killer". Croydon, of Edwinstowe, Nottinghamshire, had wept uncontrollably after the jury took less than three hours to find her guilty of murder. After the trial, her lover, Mr Bland, vowed to stand by her.
