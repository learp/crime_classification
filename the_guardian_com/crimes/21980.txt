The jury in the trial of Vincent Tabak has been told it can return a majority verdict.The trial judge, Mr Justice Field, called the jury back into court one at Bristol crown court at noon after it had been deliberating for 11 hours.He told the jury to continue to try to reach a unanimous verdict on whether Tabak was guilty of murdering Joanna Yeates.But he said if they could not, he would accept a verdict on which at least 10 agreed. The jury was sent back to continue deliberating.Tabak, 33, has admitted the manslaughter of the 25-year-old landscape architect Yeates but denies murder.Earlier on Friday, the jury had passed a handwritten note scribbled on a page of a torn-out notebook to Field. In response to the note, the judge repeated parts of his summing up relating to the intention of Tabak, a Dutch engineer.Field told the six men and six women on the jury that the issue to be decided was the defendant's intention when he used "unlawful violence" against Yeates. The question they had to address was: "Did he intend to kill her or cause her really serious bodily harm?"Field told them they had to examine the evidence they had heard. "I emphasise it is the evidence you heard and nothing else."The judge said if the jury was sure that, when he strangled Yeates, Tabak had intended to kill her or cause her really serious harm, the verdict would be guilty. If they were not sure, it had to be not guilty.The jury had begun deliberating on Wednesday afternoon.Yeates's parents, David and Teresa, were not in court on Friday. Yeates's boyfriend, Greg Reardon, was in the front row of the public gallery.
