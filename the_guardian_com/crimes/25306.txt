Will she win? Inevitably the spotlight falls on Myra Hindley now that the European court of human rights, for the fourth time in 11 years, has reduced the home secretary's powers to decide how long lifers should spend in prison. The same lawyers in yesterday's case are also representing the Moors murderer. But even before her case reaches Strasbourg, two other cases heading for the law lords could make her European appeal unnecessary. Legal observers, after yesterday's ruling, are expecting the law lords to rule against the home secretary.A further failure by the home secretary raises two issues. First, whether it makes any sense for home secretaries to continue fighting to retain their dwindling powers over sentencing. Like his predecessors, David Blunkett yesterday pledged resistance. He is as muddle-headed on this as Michael Howard. Politicians have the right to establish sentencing frameworks, but no right to determine the length of sentence of individuals. This is a judicial function, not a political process. No other country in the Council of Europe allows such an approach. It is banned by the European convention on human rights, drafted by English lawyers and to which the UK was the first signatory. It rightly insists on offenders being sentenced by independent and impartial tribunals. Mr Blunkett should recognise this democratic principle and give up thirsting for tinpot dictatorial powers. The second issue is whether Myra Hindley should be released. Of course she should. What she did was horrendous, but she has served 37 years, three times the average life sentence. The only reason she has not been is that her release has been in the hands of politicians, who have not dared take on the tabloids. The body which ought to take this decision - the parole board, which assesses risk - has scrutinised her minutely, and recommended an open prison, a pre-step to release. Let the process proceed.
