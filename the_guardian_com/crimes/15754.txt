Hundreds of family members and friends gathered today for the funeral of Katherine Horton, who was murdered earlier this month while on holiday in Thailand.Local residents also stood in silence as Ms Horton's coffin, adorned with white roses, was carried into St Isan's church in Cardiff, near her home, at the start of the service. Ruth Adams, Ms Horton's best friend and travelling partner in Thailand, attended the service. Ms Horton was raped and murdered on January 1 while on a two-week trip to Thailand. The 21-year-old Reading University student was attacked as she chatted to her mother by phone while wandered along a beach on the island of Koh Samui.Her body was discovered floating in the sea by a jet skier on January 2.Two fishermen, Bualoi Posit, 23, and Wichai Somkhaoyai, 24, confessed to the killing and, in accelerated legal hearings, said they had attacked Ms Horton after drinking after watching pornographic videos.They are expected to be sentenced tomorrow.The Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has called for the killers to receive the "hardest punishment" possible,namely the death penalty. However, early admissions of guilt for murderers normally result in life imprisonment.Ms Horton's mother Elizabeth called for clemency yesterday , saying that her daughter's killers should not be executed but rather jailed for life.A service of prayer also took place at Reading university last week, attended by friends, students and staff.
