Government plans for extended drinking hours could fuel further increases in violence on Britain's railway network, the British Transport police warned yesterday.A significant proportion of violent incidents on trains are already alcohol-related, the chief constable, Ian Johnston, said, launching the force's annual report.The prospect of longer licensing hours was raising serious concerns among officers, he said. BTP fears extra patrols will be needed in the early hours to prevent drunken fights.The percentage of alcohol-related crimes has increased by nearly a third in the past year, according to the report, from 4,558 to 6,031 incidents.Overall, the force recorded a drop of 1.9% in crime during 2004-05. Robberies fell by sharply by 20%. As well as violent crime, which went up by 11%, increases were recorded in the number of sexual offences and cases of criminal damage on the tube and rail network.There were regional variations. Violent crime on railways in Wales increased by 23%; on the London underground it showed a 14% rise; while in Scotland it fell by 2%An increase in public order offences - a rise of 27% percent - was the consequence of transport police targeting antisocial behaviour.BTP said it was looking at ways of tackling violent crime through a better response to staff assaults and more intelligence gathering. "We don't know how the new regulations on licensing will pan out," a spokesman said. "It could result in more drunkenness."The big issue is that most stations close at midnight and we have problems at big stations, like Manchester Piccadilly and Leeds, where people come back from pubs and clubs to use taxi ranks and get into fights. So we may need to have more police out at two or three in the morning supervising taxi ranks."A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said:"Flexible opening hours will reduce the need to speed drink. It will end the double madness of people gulping two or three rounds of drinks to beat last orders and then all being thrown out on to the streets at the same time."
