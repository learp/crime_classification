Prison campaigners yesterday warned that a record number of female inmates are likely to kill themselves this year, after a woman serving a five-month sentence became the 12th to die at her own hands this year.Staff at New Hall prison in West Yorkshire found Mandy Pearson, 37, hanging on Monday. The number of female prison suicides has soared over the last decade, from one in 1994 to a record 14 last year. A 13th woman is still in a coma after being cut down from a noose in Holloway this summer, and activists fear that last year's toll will be exceeded. Deborah Coles of Inquest, which campaigns on deaths in custody, said: "The government is not sending a clear message to courts that women should not be sent to prison unless they are a danger." This spring the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, praised the regime at the jail but warned: "New Hall, like other women's prisons, is holding women who should not be there. They include those who are seriously mentally ill, as well as some women and girls with high levels of self-harm, linked to substance abuse." A Home Office spokesman said: "Why so many women are in prison is a matter for the courts. The home secretary has said that short sentences for minor offences may not be the answer and that courts should look at other community based sentences."
