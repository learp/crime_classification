Detectives have arrested three men on suspicion of murdering an elderly Italian couple who were found dead in their home.The bodies of Guiseppe Massaro, 80, and his wife Caterina, 77, were found by a family member on Friday.The couple's car was missing from the address in Wolverhampton. It was later recovered in nearby Wednesfield.A spokesman for West Midlands police said three men have been arrested concerning the deaths.He said: "Two men from Wolverhampton, aged 32 and 21, and a 30-year-old from Birmingham were arrested overnight on suspicion of murder and are being questioned at separate police stations in the West Midlands."Postmortems on the couple were being carried out, the spokesman said.The Massaro family have spoken of their devastation at the double murder, saying they could not "begin to grasp the evil" that has taken place.In a statement on Sunday they said: "Words cannot describe the devastation that has struck our family after discovering our beloved grandparents hurt by the hands of someone else."We cannot even begin to grasp the evil that took place in their home and how frightened they would have been."An entire generation was taken away from us that day and we cannot comprehend how something could go this far."The couple's granddaughter, Lindsey Booth, 22, who discovered the bodies, told the Sunday Mercury it was clear they had been burgled.She said she found both in their bedroom, her grandmother's body covered by a duvet."They were both still in their day clothes and I didn't see any blood or signs that there had been a struggle," she told the paper.Police have appealed for information regarding sightings of the couple's black Peugeot 307, registration number PK56 VRW.
