Police searching for clues to the murder of PC Keith Blakelock yesterday recovered a rusty metal object which could be the blade of one of the weapons used to hack him to death 19 years ago.The 40-year-old father of three was attacked by a mob, wielding knives and machetes, on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London, on October 6 1985. Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of his murder in 1987, but cleared on appeal in 1991. The judge threw out evidence against three juveniles originally charged with the three men in 1987. Detectives launched a new investigation in December. On Tuesday, police began digging up the garden of a house at 16 Willan Road, about 200 metres from where PC Blakelock died. They said the occupants were not suspects. Police refused to specify what the item was, saying it was "too early to draw any conclusions". But it is believed to be a rusty metal object which could yield DNA from one or more of the killers. Detectives recently identified six new suspects by piecing together a "virtual video" of press and police photographs taken during the riots.
