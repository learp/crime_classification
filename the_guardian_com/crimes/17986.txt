Jonathan Freedland (Judges are supposed to use their judgment, Mr Blunkett, May 10) clearly defines the fatally flawed case for maintaining our current system of justice.Like nearly everyone else, I have to endure cycles of rage induced by the inconsistent and frequently idiotic sentencing decisions of our judiciary, and I have frequently posed to myself the dilemma of desirable independence but undesirable lack of accountability. Witness recently five years for a man who believed he had successfully engineered the murder of his wife, compared to over 20 years in jail for setting fire to church curtains. The judges' area of expertise is the interpretation of the law. With notable exceptions this task is carried out well, and of necessity this role is independent of government. David Blunkett has taken some tentative steps via the proposed sentencing guidelines council, but he has allowed its teeth to be drawn. I wish he had been more courageous.  Dr Chris Mundy  Oxford Â· Very tight guidelines will no doubt remove inconsistencies in sentencing (Victims to help set sentence guidelines, May 10). Sentencing has a number of functions but its greatest achievement has to be to turn the criminal away from crime. We have seen that this government is keen to take the popular route by emphasising victims. While this is not in itself wrong, potential victims must also be considered; knowing that the burglar who broke into my house was punished the last time he was caught does not help me. It is better I am not burgled because he was given an education during sentence, found a job on release and no longer needs to resort to crime.  Roy Grimwood Market Drayton, Shropshire
