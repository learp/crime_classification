A Polish woman wanted for questioning about a murder in London nearly three years ago has been served with an extradition warrant to the UK after being stopped by gardai in Dublin's O'Connell Street.Magdalena Zajdel, 23, has been wanted by the Metropolitan Police since the death last year of a Lithuanian man who drowned after being pushed into Hawley Lock on the Regent's Canal in Camden, north London, on 8 September 2006.The Metropolitan police said there had been an altercation among a group of eastern Europeans who had been drinking at the side of the canal and Patrick Linkavicius, 30, was pushed in.London coroner's officer Alan Pearce commented at the time: "As a result of this and other actions at the scene, the deceased went under the water and failed to surface. "One of the group jumped in to find him, assisted by a passer-by. He was finally found and taken to the Royal Free hospital where he remained unconscious, dying the following morning."The Met issued a European arrest warrant bearing Zajdel's picture which was sent to forces throughout the continent. It is understood a young female garda attached to Store Street Station in Dublin recognized Zajdel from the wanted poster and arrested her in O'Connell Street on Friday.At the time of Linkavicius' death Detective Superintendent Ian Foster said: "It's vital we speak to Magda. We have spoken to some other street people who said there was an argument between these two beforehand. "We think Patrick was a reasonable swimmer and the water is not more than five feet deep. "There may be some logical explanation but we want people who saw anything or people who recognise this young lady to come forward."Zajdel appeared before the Dublin High Court yesterday and was remanded in custody pending an extradition hearing.
