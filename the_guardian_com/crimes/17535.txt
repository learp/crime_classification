The burglar with a history of violence who murdered a teacher in his home had been released early from prison after a 30-minute assessment over the phone by a probation officer who had never met him, The Observer has learnt.Staff shortages meant Yousef Bouhaddou, 28, was never assessed face to face, and was paroled after serving only half of a five-and-a-half-year sentence for a string of burglaries across London.Five weeks later, Bouhaddou murdered Robert Symons, 45, in his Â£1m home in Chiswick, west London, while his children slept upstairs.Campaigners said the details of his cursory assessment revealed 'chaos' in the capital's probation system.The Parole Board defended its decision to free Bouhaddou, insisting it could not have predicted he would kill despite his violent past. It rated him at 'low to medium risk of reoffending'. Last week he was jailed for life.Harry Fletcher, of the probation union Napo , said: 'It is completely unacceptable for an assessment to be done without a face-to-face assessment, which is critical for judging the risk of reoffending, attitude to victims and risk of violent crime.'Yet Bouhaddou's is only the latest such case. The Observer has seen emails exchanged by probation officers last month after the trial of Damien Hanson for murdering millionaire financier John Monckton at his Chelsea home. Hanson, 25, had been paroled after seven years of a 12-year term for attempted murder. He has now been jailed for at least 36 years.One email claimed staff making assessment were not allowed to visit prisoners. Another read: 'Many of us said "It's only a matter of time..." which is how it turned out [with Hanson].'Senior Home Office officials see the probation service's failure to monitor paroled offenders properly as a 'dagger at the heart' of the criminal justice system.
