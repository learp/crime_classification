An elderly couple found murdered in their home may have been the victims of a bungled robbery, police believe. The pair were discovered by a relative who called at their house in Faversham, Kent, at 8.45am yesterday. They were last seen on Saturday afternoon.Police have not formally identified the couple but it is understood they were in their 70s. Detective Chief Inspector Dean Barnes, of Kent police, said: "It could be a burglary gone wrong. It could be one of a number of things. This is something which is currently being investigated."He said he could not confirm when the couple were murdered or how they died. He added that there did not appear to be any signs of forced entry and nothing seemed to be missing.The couple's car, a Daihatsu Sirion with the registration GK54 XJM, was found burnt out in Faversham at about 6pm on Monday.DCI Barnes said police had called at the "well-liked" couple's home later that evening, but there was no reply. "Police then attended again the following morning and left a note. I believe there were several more calls to the address throughout Tuesday," he said. "There was nothing that would draw their attention to anything untoward. It could well have been that the couple were on holiday and their car had been stolen."He confirmed a double murder investigation had been launched and added: "It stands to reason this is an extremely distasteful crime ... We will do anything in our power to bring [those responsible] to book." He appealed for anyone who saw the couple after 12.45pm on Saturday or who saw anything suspicious in the area over the weekend to contact the police.
