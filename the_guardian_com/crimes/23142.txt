Speculation over the Madeleine McCann case was given new impetus last night after the emergence of a photograph taken in Morocco showing a small blonde girl bearing a resemblance to the missing four-year-old.The picture, of a girl being carried in a sling on a woman's back, was taken just over three weeks ago in Zinat, in the north of the country, by a Spanish holidaymaker. It has been passed to experts working on the investigation.It follows a series of reports of possible sightings of Madeleine in Morocco made public in recent days, but is the first time a photograph has come to light.There were two sightings of a blonde girl matching her description in Marrakech on May 9, and it was reported yesterday that there had been a third potential sighting in northern Morocco later that month. Another Spanish woman is convinced she saw Madeleine in the town of Zaio being led by a Moroccan woman in Muslim dress across a street.Lawyers for Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were passed a copy of the photograph and it is expected to be analysed by experts at the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, which is already scouring photographs taken by holidaymakers in the Algarve around the time of Madeleine's disappearance using face mapping technology.The latest photograph, which is indistinct but shows a child with a similar hairstyle to Madeleine's, was taken from about 200 metres away by Clara Torres, from Albacete, on August 31. She told Spanish radio station Cope that she called local police in Spain on Monday, after hearing about sightings of Madeleine in Morocco. Officers passed on the photograph to Interpol.There have been many reported sightings of girls resembling Madeleine across Europe and as far away as North America since her disappearance on May 3.
