It did not take long for him to get up to his old tricks - if the man who ransacked an American couple's room in one of Dublin's premier hotels is indeed Juan Carlos Guzman-Betancourt, jetsetting jewel thief and notorious global con artist.Just over two weeks ago, the 29-year-old son of a Colombian diplomat, who speaks several languages and has 10 aliases, and who has stolen a fortune by wheedling his way into five- star hotel rooms all over the world, absconded from Standford Hill jail on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Yesterday, Irish police released news of a crime with a familiar ring. A man answering Guzman-Betancourt's description tricked his way into a room at the luxury Merrion hotel in Dublin city centre on June 16, and made off with cash, jewellery and a credit card. A Garda spokesman said police had warned all Irish hoteliers to be on their guard and ports and airports had been alerted. Detectives believe Guzman-Betancourt may have netted millions worldwide.
