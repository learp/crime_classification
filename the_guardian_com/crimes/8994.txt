Police were today given a further 12 hours to continue questioning a 31-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murdering the teenager Laura Torn.The suspect was arrested yesterday and officers launched a murder inquiry even though no body has been found. A Humberside police spokeswoman confirmed a superintendent had reviewed the case and given detectives more time to continue questioning the man at Scunthorpe police station.The development came as the detective leading the search for the 18-year-old - who went missing just over a week ago - said he hoped no one was "sitting on information".Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins was speaking as the search area around the Owston Ferry area of North Lincolnshire was extended.Laura went missing after a night out with family and friends. She was last seen in the market square of the isolated village of Owston Ferry, where she lived, after leaving the Crooked Billet pub in the early hours of April 27. Mr Higgins said an intensive search of a five-mile stretch of the River Trent through the village using hi-tech sonar equipment had been completed.He said river searches would continue but the emphasis would now shift to fields, woodland and outbuildings in the surrounding countryside. The officer appealed for help from local farmers but stressed the need for people living in Owston Ferry to come forward with anything they know. He said: "We are desperate for information about Laura and what has happened to her. I sincerely hope nobody is sitting on information, perhaps out of some sense of false loyalty. We are dealing with the disappearance of a young girl. "It's a very difficult time for everyone involved and we need to hear from anyone with even a scrap of information which may be of use to this inquiry."
