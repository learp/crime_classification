Officers investigating the private life of Michael Todd, the Greater Manchester chief constable who apparently killed himself, are expected to examine whether he was a target of blackmailers.West Midlands police are to ask for access to Todd's computer and mobile phones for their inquiry into whether his performance as police chief was affected by alleged multiple affairs with subordinates and associates. The investigation, led by the West Midlands chief constable, Sir Paul Scott-Lee, will trawl through hundreds of his personal emails and text messages.Todd, the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on counter-terrorism policy, died on a Welsh mountainside this month.The Manchester Evening News, quoting an unnamed source close to the investigation, said Todd's important role in counter-terrorism meant there was a security risk from any affairs. Claims that Todd had affairs with at least five of his staff, including serving police officers and civilian workers, would be part of the inquiry "because of the risk of blackmail", the source said.Todd disappeared on March 10 after speaking of personal troubles to senior colleagues. His body was found on Snowdon in north Wales the next day with a bottle of gin nearby. The inquiry is not expected to report back for about six months.
