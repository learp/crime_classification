The first photograph of the .455 Smith and Wesson revolver that was allegedly used to kill 11-year-old Rhys Jones was shown to a jury yesterday.Liverpool crown court was told the weapon was found in the loft of a house in Croxteth, Liverpool, a month after Rhys was murdered in August last year.The search, carried out by Merseyside police at an address that cannot be identified, also found a second gun, a converted imitation Walther PPK, and ammunition. In a statement read to the jury by Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, PC Mark Andrew Gibbs, who took part in the search, said: "I noticed a red and white plastic bag in the far end of the wall. I pulled the bag back and noticed it contained something. I saw a black revolver and a black semi-automatic pistol."Sean Mercer, 18, of Croxteth, denies murder and also denies being a member of the Crocky Crew gang. The prosecution says Mercer cycled to the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park and fired three shots across the car park at alleged members of the rival Nogga Dogz gang, based in nearby Norris Green estate.The jury has been told the second bullet struck Rhys. He bled to death in the arms of his mother, Melanie. The prosecution later called as a witness a 16-year-old relative of Sean Mercer, who cannot be identified. Via a videolink, he refused to give evidence to the court. Flewitt asked him: "Where were you when you heard about the shooting of Rhys Jones?" The boy said: "No comment." The judge, Mr Justice Irwin, told him: "Everyone can see it's not easy to give evidence, but you have a duty to do it." The boy said: "I'm just so nervous and scared. I don't want to give evidence against a family member." The boy was held in contempt of court and told to return on Monday with legal representation.The trial, expected to last up to eight weeks, continues.
