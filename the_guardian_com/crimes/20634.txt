Allied Irish Bank has fallen victim to an alleged property fraud that has cost it £56m.The scam, which ran for four years until 2007, involved an unnamed individual who bought several buildings using money borrowed from AIB and then fabricated lease guarantees from a major property firm to inflate the value of the properties.The Serious Fraud Office said this morning that it raided an office and two homes in London yesterday searching for evidence connected to the alleged fraud.It appears that the fraud was discovered last year. Once it came to light, AIB was forced to take control of the properties and sell them on, incurring a £56m loss.No-one has yet been arrested, but the SFO said it was seeking a number of other people in connection with the case.The SFO explained this morning that the alleged fraud involved the creation of fabricated "overriding" leases with the "blue chip" property firm, which has not been identified. These leases were generally for longer periods and at higher rents than the existing occupational tenants' leases. The apparent existence of these additional leases increased the values of the properties.The case may have wide-ranging ramifications, as the SFO believes that other financial institutions have also been deceived by the suspects.AIB has said it is considering legal action over the case. Earlier this month it was forced to write off €1.8bn of bad loans.Seven years ago, AIB was hit by a massive fraud involving a rogue currency trader. John Rusnak eventually cost the bank almost £500m, after a series of failed bets on the yen.
