Victoria Coren asked in the Observer last week why we need a police force that has become "a tooled up army of Schwarzeneggers" if, as Tony Blair claimed at the Iraq inquiry, the invasion of Iraq has made Britain a safer place. It was a good point made in an unhysterical column written after she encountered an armed policeman in a peaceful London street. You ponder the same question after Gordon Brown's claim on crime figures made by in parliament last week: if violent crime is indeed down by 40% over the period of Labour's tenure, why are armed police deployed more often?Both main parties are busily using the fear of crime to appeal to voters, which means political leaders are not questioning the behaviour of the police in the circumstances Coren described. It is a failure of honesty. She is right to say "but they're not protecting me, and this is my home and nobody asked me if it was OK. And it bloody isn't".I have only been keeping track of this particular story for about year so I cannot make comparisons with five or 10 years ago, yet it is certainly true the presence of lethal, to say nothing about offensive, weapons on our streets is something we have had to get used to recently. What goes with it is a rather macho, disproportionate behaviour more associated with Mexican drug wars.Here are examples I have collected from the last few months, starting with the most recent. I have mentioned some of these before but I think we are beginning to see a pattern emerge, which is why I cite them again.• 7 January: Armed police crash into the bedroom of Adam Dykes of Scarborough.• 2 January: Armed police and helicopter scrambled to a home in Weymouth where people were preparing for a Fancy dress party.• 30 December 2009: Armed police attend comedy show at Bristol's Colston Hall.• 21 December 2009: Police admit armed officers stormed into a young family's home in Oldham, pinned down a father of two and wrongly accuse him of drug dealing.• 16 December 2009: Armed police swoop on Enid Penny and her seven-year-old spaniel Toby as helicopter hovers overhead. Penny has a dangerous heart condition.• 26 November 2009: Armed police and helicopter mobilised in Staffordshire to arrest member of the band Thirst when a man monitoring CCTV mistakes jump leads for a gun.• 13 October 2009: Pest controller Graham Simmonds was arrested by six armed officers at a shopping centre in Havant, after he had already informed the police of his contract to cull pigeons.• 27 September 2009: A 63-year-old musician has DNA removed from the national database after police arrested him at gunpoint in the street for being a terrorist, stripped him and forced him to put on a "Guantánamo Bay-style paper suit".• 25 September 2009: Leslie May's home in Surrey is raided by several armed officers for a second time after hoax call.• 25 July 2009: Armed police break into the Poole flat of school dinner lady, 29-year-old single mother Rachel Whitmarsh, as she bathes her six-year-old son.• 13 July 2009: Armed police arrest Kenneth Wilson while he is shooting pigeons legally on farmland in Wiltshire.I am sure there are many more. This list does not include examples of oppressive behaviour which have also become part of everyday life – the barbecues raided by riot police, the Australian photographer stopped five times in London by terror police, the partially disabled man arrested when seen opening his letter with a spatula, the ITN crew stopped by police when they were filming a story about a photographer being stopped by police, the abrasive questioning of climate change protestors and their children.To quote Coren again, "nobody asked us if it was OK. And it bloody isn't".
