A former police sergeant who helped his drug dealer brother to run a large-scale illegal crime organisation was today jailed for 11 and a half years.Salim Razaq, was dismissed by Lancashire Constabulary in June. He hid guns, intimidated witnesses and tried to use drug money to fund his gangster brother's bail. The 33-year-old had previously admitted perverting the course of justice, possessing firearms and misconduct in a public office, and was sentenced at Liverpool crown court. A senior officer described him as "a mob boss in police uniform".Razaq, of Walton-le-Dale, was sentenced alongside his brother and mother. He was caught plotting to help his brother, Hafiz – known as "the enforcer" and "Big Haf" – to escape prosecution for his role in a violent turf war between drug gangs in Preston.When police raided his home they found three machine guns hidden in a suitcase under the stairs, ammunition, more than £70,000 in laundered cash, a knuckleduster and bulletproof jacket.A list of names and amounts of money, which police believe referred to drug contacts, was also found.Razaq admitted wrongfully accessing Lancashire police's Sleuth computer database to obtain information about his family and acquaintances.Officers became suspicious and listened in on phone calls 25-year-old Hafiz Razaq made to his brother from jail, in which the pair discussed money laundering and plans to scare witnesses.Hafiz Razaq, his mother, Gulshan, and three others also admitted charges in relation to the case. He was sentenced to three years and six months in prison, and his mother was given a 44-week sentence, suspended for two years.Both admitted perverting the course of justice, and Hafiz Razaq also admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.Colleagues at Nelson police station regarded Razaq as a "copper's cop", and had no idea he had turned his home in Preston into a gangland HQ.Andy Cooke, the Lancashire assistant chief constable said: "Razaq was nothing short of a criminal in a police uniform. I am appalled that a police officer could be involved at the level he was in this criminality."We are resolute in our commitment to root out any bad apples that fail to maintain the high standards of professional behaviour and integrity which the vast majority of our staff adhere to."Razaq had joined the Lancashire force nine years ago, becoming a sergeant after serving as a traffic officer in the motorway patrol.At the same time as he was being promoted, his brother was rising through the criminal ranks of the Deepdale drugs gang.But a turf war broke out in April 2008 when Mohammed Begg, 22 – who was linked to the rival Fishwick mob – was abducted from his hijacked BMW by a masked gang.He was held captive for three hours, during which he was tortured and beaten. As a result of the kidnapping, a 26-year-old member of Hafiz Rafaq's gang was shot in the throat in a revenge attack.Hafiz Rafaq and four others were arrested over Begg's kidnapping, and he was jailed for six years.
