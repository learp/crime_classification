Robbery has risen by 1%, the Home Office said today, as it published the latest quarterly crime figures for England and Wales.The robbery figures came from the Recorded Crime Statistics (RCS) kept by police, which were released by the Home Office at the same time as the latest British Crime Survey (BCS). This survey - which ministers say is the most reliable indicator of crime trends - showed a 14% surge in theft from the person.Both sets of figures relate to the third quarter of last year, between July and September. The RCS figures are of crimes recorded by police, while the BCS figures come from a survey of the public about whether they were victims of crime.Vandalism rose sharply in the survey, up 11% to 2,918,000 incidents. Total recorded crime fell by 3% but drug offences increased 9%, in a trend previously blamed on a surge in warnings for cannabis possession.Today's figures also show that the risk of becoming a victim of crime has increased by 1% to 24%, though the Home Office insisted this was a "historically low" figure, having fallen by 43% since 1995.The Home Office said overall crime in England and Wales "remains stable" and described the BCS figures on theft from the person as an "apparent increase" which was "not statistically significant".The Home Office minister Tony McNulty conceded robbery had been of concern in recent statistics, but said there were 23,000 fewer robberies committed last year than five years ago.He said the launch of a robbery action plan allowed police to "help areas quickly get to grips with the problem".The home secretary, John Reid, whose department was recently castigated for its failure to keep track of offences committed abroad by UK nationals, is likely to have mixed feelings about the figures.He will be disappointed that the continuing rise in robbery has not been stopped or reversed; a 5% increase in robberies in the previous quarter caused alarm.But today's figures do not appear to have put Mr Reid under significantly greater pressure at a time when he has asked the judiciary to stop sending so many criminals to jail. With the prison service stretched, Mr Reid and other cabinet ministers wrote to judges and magistrates yesterday asking them to send only the most dangerous and persistent offenders to jail.Today's BSC figures show violent crime has fallen by 1% compared with the same quarter last year. The RCS figures show that in the 12 months to September 2006, recorded firearm offences fell 14% to 9,728; firearm fatalities showed no change.In a statement, the prime minister, Tony Blair, congratulated police on the figures, noting that they showed a 7% reduction in what he termed the "most feared crime", violence causing injury.Mr Blair said: "Sexual offences are down 4% and crimes involving firearms are down 14% compared with last year. Tough laws - including a minimum five years' [jail] for possessing a gun - are bearing fruit."He said neighbourhood policing teams were being put in place across the UK, with every London community now having its own team."And this has been achieved while still driving down burglary and vehicle crime. The number of burglaries has fallen by 55% since 1997 - that's 651,000 fewer homes being burgled."However, the government's campaign against anti-social behaviour was dealt a blow, as results showed that people were becoming more worried about the problem in four out of seven categories used to measure results.There was a rise in concern about people using or dealing drugs, teenagers hanging around on the streets, noisy neighbours or loud parties, and people being drunk or rowdy in public places.On Monday, the Liberal Democrats launched their new crime policies, which they intend to make a centrepiece of their campaigning in May's local elections. Party leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, said at the launch: "Shockingly, we live in a country where only one in every hundred crimes committed leads to a court conviction."
