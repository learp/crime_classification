It is usually the stuff of films: a gang desperate to retrieve sackfuls of booty from the depths of the police hold. But thieves in Scotland had their eyes set on something different â€“ radios and uniform.Burglars targeted a police station in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, in the early hours of Tuesday morning and made off with the items. A spokeswoman for Strathclyde police said: "Inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the break-in and to trace the person or people responsible."She added that the stolen radios had been disabled: "At no time has the safety of the public or any officers been jeopardised as a result of the break-in. We urge anyone with information to contact us."In November two thieves stole bicycles from a police station in Brandon, Suffolk, in the early hours, prompting officers to continue their work on foot and "alternative modes of transport".In 2009 two boys, aged 12 and 14, were caught attempting to rob employees behind a protective window at a police station in Port St Lucie, Florida. "They were either very brazen or very dumb. I think the latter," a police spokesman said.
