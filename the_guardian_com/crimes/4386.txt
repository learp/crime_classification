The fall in the annual crime rate in England and Wales is accelerating, with a drop of 9% recorded by the police in the year to September 2007, according to Home Office quarterly figures published yesterday.The continuing decline in police recorded crime, which includes a substantial 17% drop in robbery, a 16% fall in serious violence and a 9% reduction in sexual offences, is matched by a 4% fall in crime as measured by the British Crime Survey over the same period.However, these figures are marred by a 4% rise in gun crime recorded by the police and a 21% rise in drug offences.The rise in gun crime represents an increase of 427 offences to a total of 10,182 firearms offences, but Home Office statisticians said the main increase had been in incidents in which guns had been used to threaten but no one had been hurt.The number of gun-related deaths went down from 55 to 49 in the year to September 2007. Incidents involving serious injury also fell, by 16%.The 21% rise in the number of drug offences, from 46,200 in the period from July to September 2006 to 55,700 from July to September 2007, reflects the implementation of the decision to reclassify cannabis as a class C drug. The Home Office said that the rise coincided with increases in the use by police of powers to issue cannabis warnings instead of arresting and prosecuting offenders.But gun crime and drug offences form only a small proportion of the total crime recorded by the two sets of figures. The police recorded a 9% drop in the number of offences reported to them between the third quarter of 2006 and the same quarter of 2007 - the figure fell from 1.359m to 1.240m.The Home Office figures show that the fall in crime is accelerating, with a 2% drop in the final quarter of 2006 followed by falls of 3%, 7% and now 9% through the first three quarters of 2007.The vast bulk of offences recorded by the police are property crimes, such as burglary, which fell by 8%, car crime, which is down 12%, other thefts, down 6%, and criminal damage, which has fallen by 11%. But the British Crime Survey demonstrates that these sustained falls in crime have still to be reflected in the public's perceptions of crime. When the public are asked about their worries about events such as burglary, car crime and violent crime, about one in nine say they remain very concerned.About a third of the public say that there are severe problems of antisocial behaviour in their area, particularly concerning rubbish on the streets and teenagers "hanging around".The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said that the latest set of crime figures contained "some excellent results", with people's risk of becoming a victim dropping to historically low levels: "In 2008 we will tighten our grip on violence and antisocial behaviour, working with police and local partners."But Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said gun crime needed to be tackled more vigorously: "Police should be devoting more time to stop and searches for knives and guns, and the government needs to clamp down with a major new effort to stop gun smuggling," he said, claiming that there were nine times more officials involved in tackling cigarette smuggling than gun smuggling.
