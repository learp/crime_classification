Police have named two people whose deaths are being investigated as part of an inquiry into sabotaged medical supplies at a hospital in Greater Manchester where three people died and 11 other patients were affected.George Keep, 84, from Cheadle, died on Thursday after being admitted to Stepping Hill hospital, near Stockport, on 27 June. Arnold Lancaster, 71, from Romiley, Stockport, died last Monday.A third victim, Tracey Arden, 44, was admitted to the hospital in Hazel Grove for routine drug treatment for multiple sclerosis on 7 July. She died just two hours after her family left her bedside believing that she was responding well to treatment. Her funeral was due to take place on Monday but has had to be postponed due to the police investigation.George Keep's family said: "George had, in his younger years, been a hard-working man who was enjoying his retirement with family and friends in spite of his failing health."They described him as a devoted husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather who will be greatly missed. No further details of Arnold Lancaster's illness have been released and his relatives asked to be left alone to grieve.The hospital is at the centre of a major police investigation after 36 ampoules of saline were found to have been injected with insulin. Security has been intensified at the hospital after the contamination was discovered last week and detectives are searching for the saboteur. No arrests have yet been made.The post-mortem examinations that are being carried out by a Home Office pathologist are a crucial element of the police inquiry.A further 11 hospital patients, who were affected by the tainted saline solution but have recovered, are alsobeing interviewed by detectives as part of the investigation.But police were dismissive of a story in the Sunday Mirror, which claimed the investigation was looking at 120 deaths at the hospital. A spokesperson said the report was, "frankly crazy"."There are three deaths that may or may not have been caused by lower than usual blood sugar levels. They have quite simply made that figure up," the spokesperson added.Tracey Arden's parents visited her in the afternoon of 7 July but were later called back by the hospital to say she had "taken a turn for the worse". By the time they arrived she had died.Insulin was found in a batch of saline ampoules in a hospital storeroom close to Ward A1 after an experienced ward nurse reported a higher than normal number of patients with unexplained low blood sugar levels last Monday.Detectives believe the insulin was deliberately injected into the saline containers that were used by at least two wards, but they say the three deaths remain unexplained until the results of the post-mortem examinations are known.Police are methodically working their way through the hospital in interviewing doctors, nurses, porters, patients and visitors. It is understood that searches will take place as part of the increased security.The hospital has confirmed nobody has been suspended over the contaminated saline solution, but security has been stepped up to protect patients currently undergoing treatment there.Anyone entering may now be searched and police are speaking to staff and visitors.Detective superintendent Julian Ross, who is leading the inquiry, said the investigation is at a very early stage and they don't know what effect, if any, the contamination has had to the wellbeing of any patients. "There is no need for people in the community to be unduly alarmed but I would ask anyone who might have information about what may have happened to get in touch," he said on Friday.Stockport NHS Foundation Trust's chief executive, Dr Chris Burke, said: "The trust has done an initial check of all ampoules in the hospital and is carrying out a number of additional measures to safeguard patients." All saline ampoules at the hospital have been replaced.The south Manchester coroner, John Pollard, said: "I've ordered a Home Office pathologist to carry out postmortem examinations. I am awaiting the results in consultation with the police."The coroner is due to open inquests on all three of the patients deaths this week.All future deaths at the hospital that show any signs of relevant symptoms will be passed to the coroner for the foreseeable future and may be referred to detectives to investigate.Speculation has grown over the weekend that several more deaths since 7 July are being looked at and that the contamination could have taken place outside the hospital but police refused to comment on either matter.Suggestions in a Sunday newspaper that there could be up to 120 deaths have been rejected by police.
