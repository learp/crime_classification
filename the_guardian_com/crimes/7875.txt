The chief constable of Cumbria police today defended his force against criticism of its handling of the Cumbria shootings, saying nothing more could have been done to prevent the deaths of 12 people in Britain's biggest mass murder since the Dunblane massacre.Craig Mackey said that every available armed officer from Cumbria police had been deployed but at no point did they have a clear shot at the gunman, Derrick Bird"From what we know, at no stage did any police officer have the chance to end this any sooner," said Mackey.He said Cumbria has 97 firearms officers and all 42 who were available were deployed, while firearms officers from neighbouring forces were also put on standby.Mackey also revealed Bird had killed 10 people in an hour as he drove across west Cumbria, having killed both his twin brother David and solicitor Kevin Commons before 10.30am.He said that the taxi driver's "knowledge of the local roads" had enabled him to evade police as had the fact that he "was not in any one area for a significant length of time". Bird was driving down single-track roads in an "extremely secluded area" while firing his weapon, said Mackey.Bird was last seen alive at 12.30pm and his body was found by police dogs at 1.30pm.The defensive statement came at the end of a day in which more details emerged about the motivations for Bird's killings, and the prime minister, David Cameron, toured the region to check on the progress of the investigation and visit the injured in hospital.During a visit to meet survivors of the massacre and pay tribute to the emergency services and Cameron said he had heard tales of "incredible bravery".He said relatives of those killed by Bird may never receive an adequate explanation of their loved ones died.Earlier Cumbria police confirmed that detectives were looking at the killer's finances and involvement with HMRC as the investigation continued.A one minute's silence will be held next Wednesday in the town and at five other places in Cumbria to remember Bird's victims.
