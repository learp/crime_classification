Women aged over 60 who are victims of domestic violence are suffering in silence because the problem is ignored by professionals and policy makers, a new report has found.The study, Older Women and Domestic Violence, carried out by Help the Aged and the housing trust HACT, found that when older women have marks of physical injury they are often put down to falls by professionals and healthcare workers.There is a common belief that "it can't be that bad or she would have left years ago", the report found. Demand has outstripped supply at the few projects set up for older women who have suffered domestic violence.The report recommends: 路 More research to identify the extent of the problem 路 Specific services to meet the needs of older women 路 Closer working relationships between workers in adult protection and the domestic violence field  路 Training for professionals and workers on how to tackle the problemsKate Jopling, public affairs officer for Help the Aged, said: "Society has created a huge wall of ignorance around the issues of domestic violence for older women. Older women have grown up in a culture when domestic violence was not even considered a crime."
