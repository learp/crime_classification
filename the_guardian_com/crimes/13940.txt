Britain's most senior prosecutor today defended his decision to prosecute a mother who was cleared of trying to murder her seriously ill daughter.Keir Starmer, QC, the director of public prosecutions, issued a statement in which he said putting the case of Kay Gilderdale before a jury had been in the public interest.Yesterday, after Gilderdale was found not guilty of attempting to murder her daughter, Lynn, the trial judge at Lewis crown court, Mr Justice Bean, took the rare step of criticising the Crown Prosecution Service for pursuing the case.Bean became the second criminal judge to question the necessity of the prosecution.Six months before the trial another judge pointed out that Gilderdale had already admitted aiding and abetting suicide, and invited the CPS to drop the attempted murder case.Gilderdale, 55, from Stonegate, East Sussex, was given a conditional discharge for assisted suicide, which she admitted.Lynn, 31, who was struck down with a severe form of ME and became bedridden at the age of 14, had expressed a wish to end her "unimaginably wretched" life.On 3 December 2008, after a failed attempt to take her life by injecting herself with morphine, she begged her mother for help.Bean said interim guidelines on mitigation factors in whether to prosecute a relative for assisted suicide, issued by the CPS last November, should have applied in the case.The guidelines contain a checklist of 13 factors against the prosecution for assisted suicide, concerning the wishes and motivation of both parties, the majority of which applied in Gilderdale's case.In his statement Starmer said he was satisfied that there was enough evidence against Gilderdale to provide "a realistic prospect of conviction" for attempted murder.He said he fully respected the jury's not guilty verdict, adding that he recognised Gilderdale was a "devoted mother who acted out of love and devotion for her daughter".He said: "But the fact remains that, where the CPS is satisfied that there is evidence to support a charge of attempted murder, the seriousness of that charge will very often mean that it is in the public interest to bring a case to court so that a jury can consider the evidence and return their verdict, as they did in this case."He said what had begun as assisted suicide, "namely passing morphine to her daughter", had progressed to attempted murder when Gilderdale went on to administer morphine and other drugs to induce an air embolism after Lynn had lost consciousness.Starmer added: "As the CPS assisted suicide interim policy makes clear, assisted suicide and attempted murder are very different offences."Assisted suicide involves assisting the victim to take his or her own life. Attempted murder is a step further than assisted suicide because it involves attempting to take the victim's life directly."
