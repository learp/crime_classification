A man who hacked his sister's boyfriend to death in an honour killing has received a life sentence and must spend at least 18 years in jail before he can be considered eligible for parole.Waseem Afsar was enraged that his younger sister Nighat was having a relationship with Ahmed Bashir. In July 1996 he attacked Bashir, 21, with a sword, but was only charged in 2004 after a cold case review. Bashir, an Afghan refugee, died from 43 separate stab wounds.Last Tuesday a jury convicted Waseem Afsar of Ahmed Bashir's murder and of the attempted murder of Bashir's friend, Abdul Ebrahimkhail, who was seriously wounded when he tried to intervene. Afsar's friend Nisar Khan, who took part in the attacks on Bashir and Ebrahimkhail, was also found guilty on both charges.At the Old Bailey yesterday Judge Peter Beaumont, recorder of London, ordered that Afsar, who has previous convictions for robbery, GBH and false imprisonment, should serve a minimum of 18 years for murder and nine years for attempted murder. The sentences will run concurrently with the life sentence Afsar is serving for a murder committed before Mr Bashir's.Khan, described as having played a "willing part" in the murder, was ordered to serve at least 14 years for murder and eight for attempted murder.
