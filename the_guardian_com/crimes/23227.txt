Police in the UK have agreed to hand over "strong" evidence about Madeleine McCann's disappearance to her parents, halting a high court fight for the material.Leicestershire police are releasing 81 "potential new leads" to private investigators working for Kate and Gerry McCann. As a result the McCanns yesterday dropped their legal challenge demanding that the force disclose information. The evidence relates to telephone calls made to the McCanns' solicitors that were forwarded, without taking details, to the Leicestershire incident room during the early stages of the inquiry. The chief constable, Matt Baggott, has now agreed to provide contacts and a summary of the material.Clarence Mitchell, spokesman for the McCanns, told the Guardian: "The critical thing is that this is early information and potentially strong information."Mrs Justice Hogg said she had not asked for the McCanns' presence at the hearing because "they have suffered enough". The couple's counsel, Tim Scott QC, told the judge yesterday there was no proof that Madeleine was alive, "but there is not a scrap of evidence that she is not".Shortly after Madeleine disappeared, a judge in the high court family division granted the McCanns a wide order requiring anyone on whom it was served to disclose relevant information to their solicitors. The police were among those served with the order, and issues then arose about the public interest in maintaining confidentiality. The decision to release the material, 81 pieces of information out of more than 11,000, is viewed as a compromise.
