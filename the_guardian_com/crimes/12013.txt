The body of a British yachtsman allegedly murdered by three pirates was found today, the Foreign Office said tonight.Three Burmese migrants have been accused of slitting the throat of Malcolm Robertson and throwing his body overboard when they raided his yacht as he sailed with wife Linda off the Andaman sea coast off Thailand last week.The FCO said a body found today had been confirmed as that of the 64-year-old businessman, from Hastings in East Sussex.Reports in Thailand said his body was recovered by fishermen about 10 nautical miles north of Satun's Lipeh Island.An FCO spokeswoman said: "A body recovered by the Thai authorities today has been identified as Mr Robertson."Our thoughts are with Mrs Robertson and her family at this difficult time."The embassy team with them is providing consular support."The discovery ends a week of anxiety for Mr Robertson's family, who had to endure several false reports of his body being found.Three migrant workers from neighbouring Burma, who were arrested on a raft about half a mile from the couple's 44ft yacht, have been charged with kidnap, assault and theft.But Thai authorities had said they could not bring a murder charge until they found Mr Robertson's body.He owned a chain of coffee shops in and around his home town of Hastings and St Leonards but passed the running of the business to his children in recent years and was semi-retired.He was fulfilling a lifelong dream by spending the winter months sailing around warmer climes in his yacht, named Mr Bean, with his wife. They were both qualified yacht masters who had sailed round the world.The couple, who were married for 25 years, each had two children from previous relationships and had seven grandchildren between them.All four children went to Thailand to offer their support to Mrs Robertson, who escaped with minor injuries.Tonight Mrs Robertson's brother, John Clee, 63, from Battle, East Sussex, said the family felt a sense of "relief".He said it was the family's greatest fear that Mr Robertson's body would never be found."There is a feeling of relief. I had a text message from Linda saying how he was identified and how she was now feeling totally drained," Clee said. "This sorts a lot of things out. We know that charges of murder can now be laid against those responsible."Not only that, but my sister can also bring home her husband and hopefully bring some closure to this whole thing."Clee said he received confirmation that the body was that of Mr Robertson at about 5pm."The family phoned at about midday to say that a body had been discovered but that they didn't know whether it was a false alarm or not," he said."Then they didn't get the body identified until 4pm UK time. They knew fishermen found the body and it took them about three hours to bring it ashore and identify him."
