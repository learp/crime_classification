A fortune teller told the Earl of Shaftesbury that happiness lay ahead of him less than 24 hours before his death, a court heard today.Martine Dupre-Cordier said Anthony Ashley-Cooper, the 10th earl, had visited her near Cannes to ask for advice on his troubled love life on November 4 2004.The peer was in the process of divorcing his third wife, Jamila M'Barek - who is accused of plotting his murder, along with her brother Mohammed - and was having an affair with another woman.His badly-decomposed body was found in a remote ravine in the foothills of the Alps in April 2005, five months after he had gone missing from his £130-a-night hotel on the French Riviera.Ms Dupre-Cordier, from Cannes, told the court in Nice, in the south of France: "The lord told me he wanted to divorce his wife. He said he was very much in love with Nadia, and wanted to have a child with her."At this point, Nadia called him, and he put her on to me. I could tell from her voice that she was not pregnant."The fortune teller, who was paid €50 (£35) for the private consultation with the 66-year-old, said she told the earl his divorce would go smoothly and that happiness lay ahead of him.Philippe Soussi, the lawyer for the Ashley-Cooper family, asked Ms Dupre-Cordier: "Did you predict his death?" She replied: "No."Ms M'Barek, 45, and her 43-year-old brother both deny murdering the earl at her flat in Cannes on November 5 2004.Mr M'Barek has admitted killing the earl in a drunken row, but maintains it was an accident. In court yesterday, he publicly asked forgiveness from the Ashley-Cooper family and said he "loved" his brother-in-law.The prosecution claims Ms M'Barek paid her brother to murder her estranged husband so he could not divorce her and deny her the chance to inherit valuable properties in France and Ireland.Yesterday, the court heard that, in the weeks after the earl's death, Ms M'Barek transferred €150,000 to her brother's account.Alain Brunache, the commander of the judicial police in Nice, said he believed this money was the "price of the contract" on Lord Shaftesbury's life.
