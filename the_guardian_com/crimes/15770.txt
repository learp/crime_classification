A 53-year-old man was remanded in custody today, charged with the murder of a schoolgirl who disappeared more than 30 years ago.Ronald Castree, of Shaw, Oldham, Greater Manchester, appeared at Calderdale magistrates court in Halifax, West Yorkshire, charged with murdering Lesley Molseed between October 7 and October 9 1975.Mr Castree was arrested on Sunday by officers investigating the murder of the 11-year-old who disappeared on October 5 1975 after leaving her home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, to run an errand for her mother.Her body was later discovered on open moorland above the A672 Oldham to Halifax road in Ripponden, West Yorkshire. She had been stabbed 12 times.Following a major investigation in which nearly 5,000 statements were taken, and more than 12,000 people spoken to within the first three months, Stefan Kiszko, a 26-year-old tax clerk from Rochdale, was convicted of her murder.Mr Kiszko, however, was the subject of a miscarriage of justice and spent 16 years in prison before finally being released following an appeal in 1991. He died, aged 44, of a heart attack shortly after being released.The investigation into Lesley's death was reopened after Mr Kiszko's release and the case relaunched in 2001.
