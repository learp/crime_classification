Police searching for missing nine-year-old schoolgirl Shannon Matthews said today that more than 500 homes lining her route to school have been searched using specialist sniffer dogs.Although the dogs have failed to uncover any trace of the youngster, police said they will be taken into hundreds more houses in a bid to find the schoolgirl.Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan, of West Yorkshire Police, said his officers had also pieced together a full set of Shannon's fingerprints and her DNA profile to help them establish exactly where the youngster had or had not been.Shannon has not been seen since she left school exactly two weeks ago on February 19, in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. Since then an unprecedented missing persons operation has been set in motion. Some 250 police officers, including 60 detectives - around 10% of the force's operational strength - have been assigned to help in the hunt for the missing girl.Speaking at a press conference, Brennan said he continued to treat the case as a missing persons inquiry but admitted that "potentially it is something more sinister".He said that although the initial high-profile search of the local area had been scaled back, his officers continued the hunt using more forensic methods.On top of the 500 homes that have been searched, the sniffer dogs have been taken through 2,500 other properties in the locale and will continue working in hundreds more sites. The newly created fingerprint set and DNA profile were being used to search for evidence of Shannon's presence in various locations and officers were trawling through hours of CCTV footage looking for clues.Brennan made a special appeal for any sighting of a swimming kit the youngster had with her at the time but has yet to be found. He said it is believed to be a blue striped towel and a two-piece costume which is pink and blue with fish on it.
