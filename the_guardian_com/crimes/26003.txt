A youth who left a train carriage looking like a "scene from a horror movie" after carrying out a string of attacks on mainly female passengers was jailed for a minimum of five years yesterday.The 17-year-old and an older man went from carriage to carriage terrorising passengers. The youth, who can not be named for legal reasons, attacked four women, beating one with a bottle and repeatedly punching and kicking the others on a train from Dartford in Kent to Charing Cross last August. In the most serious attack a 49-year-old woman was repeatedly battered until she lay semi-conscious. The 17-year-old then swung down from the luggage rack to kick her in the face before ripping off her earrings and necklace, and telling her: "Call me Satan."Sentencing him, Judge Henry Blacksell said: "These were horrific offences, truly dreadful ... because innocent travellers were subjected to a gratuitous campaign of violence at your hands. You kicked mercilessly that woman so that she was left in a state as if you were watching a horror movie." He added: "I have concluded you do indeed pose a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public."The youth, from Battersea, south-west London, denied involvement but a jury found him guilty of two robberies, one attempted robbery, wounding with intent, causing bodily harm and two counts of common assault. He was given an indeterminate jail term, with a minimum five years before being eligible for parole.The older man, 25, also from Battersea, was judged mentally unfit to plead at an earlier hearing. A separate jury, specially sworn in to consider the evidence against him, found he had committed the acts detailed in the charges. He will be dealt with next month.
