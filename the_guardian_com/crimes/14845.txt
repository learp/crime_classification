A codeine addict who contaminated packets of Nurofen Plus to swap for uncontaminated ones to feed his habit has been jailed for 18 months.Christopher McGuire cost the manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser £2.4m and saved himself just £7 by putting strips of an anti-psychotic drug in empty packets of the painkiller, which he secretly swapped for new packets at pharmacies.He was jailed on Monday by a judge at Southwark crown court, London, for the "carefully thought out and skilfully executed" scheme, which created a "good deal of public fear and anxiety".Passing sentence, Judge Alistair McCreath told McGuire: "Your acts caused very considerable financial harm, amounting to well over £2m."The costs included recalling the product, destroying suspect stock, investigating the problem that you caused, returning new products to the market and handling the reputational damage caused by you."In short, the harm you actually caused or might have caused by your acts was very high."McGuire, who went to university at 16, took 32 Nurofen Plus tablets a day to feed his secret habit. But after losing his job he struggled to pay for his addiction.The 31-year-old's scheme saw him fill empty packets with the Seroquel he was being prescribed for schizophrenia.The court heard how McGuire then tried to buy Nurofen Plus at pharmacies using a card he knew would be declined. This created the distraction he needed to discreetly swap his doctored packet for a fresh one and walk away. However, the tampered with packs ended up in the hands of unsuspecting members of the public.Two men, Peter Letham and Paul Connor, took the anti-psychotic drugs in error, believing them to be Nurofen Plus, and were left feeling unwell, tired and dizzy. They later discovered the drug inside the packet was Seroquel and not Nurofen Plus.On 24 and 28 July last year two other consumers realised the Nurofen Plus they had bought also contained Seroquel instead, but did not take any.McGuire, of Glasgow, was tracked down to his landlady's home in Swanley, Kent, on 23 September after the origins of the Seroquel were traced. He admitted his actions and was later charged with causing a public nuisance.
