Teachers are demanding the government reconvenes a working group to investigate security in schools following the death of 14-year-old Luke Walmsley at a school in Lincolnshire. Luke died yesterday morning of a single knife wound to the heart after an argument in the school corridor with a 15-year old pupil. Police are treating the incident as murder. Today, Eamonn O'Kane, president of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, wrote to the education secretary, Charles Clarke, asking that the school security working party be reconvened in light of the death. Mr O'Kane suggests that measures already in place to prevent such incidences be reviewed to establish whether they give sufficient protection against "the growing weapon-carrying culture which is resulting in the increasing use of weapons in crime on the streets spilling over in to the relative calm and security of schools".The letter continues: "NASUWT is concerned to ensure that something positive emerges from this terrible tragedy and we believe that this would be an appropriate response." Mr O'Kane told EducationGuardian.co.uk that the working party was established after the murder of headteacher Philip Lawrence at a school in north London. "Much of today's security measures, such as proper fencing and visitor vetting, came as a result of that working party. It was stood down because it had achieved its aims. "We need to call it together again to consider the situation to see if there's any more that needs to be done. I'm quite certain Charles Clarke will respond favourably to it."A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said ministers would give "careful consideration to their suggestions".Teaching organisations, local authorities, religious organisations, governors and police were all represented on the working party.
