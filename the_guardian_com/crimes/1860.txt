Police hunting the killer of Midlothian teenager Jodi Jones are carrying out forensic tests on a knife discovered in skip near where her body was found.The knife was found by a member of the public in Newtongrange this week, less than a quarter of a mile from the secluded path where 14-year-old Jodi died. A spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders police said the knife was one of a number recovered during the eight-week investigation into Jodi's murder. Meanwhile, Jodi's boyfriend, Luke Mitchell, returned to school yesterday after being told by education officials that he had to miss the first two days of terms at St David's high school because of concerns about his safety and school discipline. Luke, 15, has been questioned twice by police investigating Jodi's death. Last week he was held for questioning for six hours, before being released without charge. Jodi had been on her way to meet Luke when she was attacked on the night of June 30. Luke was with a group of family and friends who found her body on the Roman Dyke pathway in Dalkeith. She had been the victim of a frenzied knife attack. Donald MacKay, director of education for the council, said Luke had been asked to stay away for a couple of days to allow teachers to speak to pupils about "appropriate behaviour" towards each other. His family had said they would consider legal action if he were not allowed to return to his studies.
