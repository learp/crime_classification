An MP's wife caught on CCTV stealing a kitten from the home of her husband's lover has been found guilty of burglary.Jurors at Birmingham crown court took just over five hours to convict Christine Hemming, 53, who snatched the cat three days after separating from the Liberal Democrat John Hemming.CCTV footage of the offence shows Hemming crawling on her hands and knees underneath a window before sneaking into the home of Emily Cox.Hemming, who showed no reaction as the verdict was returned, will be sentenced next month.She had acknowledged that she went to Cox's house on the night the kitten, named Beauty, was last seen.Claiming she visited the property to deliver items of post for her husband, Hemming had told jurors: "I had no intention of stealing a cat â€“ either before I went to the property, when I was at the property, when I left the property, and subsequently."She was bailed to appear at Birmingham crown court on 28 October.
