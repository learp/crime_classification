The brother of a former EastEnders actor has appeared in court accused of murdering her and dumping her torso in a canal.Gemma McCluskie's headless and limbless body was discovered floating close to Broadway Market in north-east London last week.Her 35-year-old brother Tony spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during a one-and-a-half-minute appearance at Thames magistrates court.The chair of the bench, Cliff Lynn, told the defendant a bail hearing would take place at the Old Bailey within the next 48 hours.Lynn told McCluskie, of Hackney: "You are remanded in custody. A preliminary hearing has been provisionally set for 26 March."The actor, 29, who played Kerry Skinner in the BBC soap in 2001, went missing days after attending the opening ceremony of the Â£650m Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London.Her remains were discovered on Tuesday when a member of the public reported a suspicious object in Regent's Canal.
