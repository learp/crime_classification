A man who conned Premier League footballers and the former England manager Sam Allardyce out of thousands of pounds has been convicted of fraud.Stephen Ackerman targeted West Ham staff – including the club’s then manager Allardyce, the striker Andy Carroll and midfielder Kevin Nolan – when he visited the east London club’s training ground to sell them luxury hampers in December 2014. On Monday the 48-year-old, of Loughton, Essex, was found guilty at Snaresbrook crown court of 18 counts of fraud worth a total of more than £60,000. The court heard that Ackerman, using the pseudonym Mark Kingston, took payment from a number of players and staff using a handheld chip and pin device. The luxury goods were never delivered and in the following weeks some of the victims then noticed unauthorised payments running into the thousands charged to their bank accounts. They reported the matter to police and Ackerman was arrested. Acting DS Jamie Snell, of Newham CID, said: “Ackerman preyed on the trust of people he approached and essentially told an elaborate pack of lies in order to get them to part with their cash. “He defrauded a total of £61,047 from his victims and thought that due to their fame they would never report the matter to the police. He is a confident and accomplished fraudster and we are delighted to have received this verdict from the jury today.” Ackerman will be sentenced at the same court on 25 November.
