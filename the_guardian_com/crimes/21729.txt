The parents of Damilola Taylor reacted angrily yesterday after a report found that mistakes by government forensic scientists in the early days of the investigation into the 10-year-old's murder had led to crucial evidence being missed.Experts at the Forensic Science Service failed to identify blood spots from the youngster on a trainer and jumper belonging to the two brothers who were eventually convicted of manslaughter six years after Damilola's death.Ricky and Danny Preddie, who were 13 and 12 at the time, were prime suspects within days of the stabbing in 2000, but were dropped from the inquiry because of a lack of forensic evidence.The report's authors, Alan Rawley QC and forensics expert Professor Brian Caddy, concluded that human errors rather than systemic failures were to blame.The report recommended that a new service from the FSS where different scientists double-check items - which would have added £55,000 to expenditure on the Damilola investigation - should be adopted by police without complaints about costs. It also recommended that each FSS laboratory should be evaluated at least once a year by specialist teams. They rejected a suggestion that the FSS should look again at every case on which the three experts involved worked, saying the service and the police should decide. The FSS said it would discuss with the police whether it should re-examine any cases.But Richard and Gloria Taylor said the errors had had "catastrophic" consequences, causing them years of delay and pain, and called for those responsible to be brought to account and for the government to overhaul the quality of forensic science used in court.A statement from their lawyer said: "Richard and Gloria Taylor are enormously disappointed with the report. Dreadful errors were made during the forensic examination of crucial evidence. The family have suffered beyond words during the twists and turns in the investigations."It took two police inquiries and three trials, at an estimated cost of £16m, to bring anyone to justice for Damilola's killing in Peckham, south London.The report found the blunders were made by three unnamed FSS scientists, one of whom, a reporting officer, was one of its most experienced supervisors. The reporting officer still works at the FSS but in a non-scientific role.A drop of blood on Danny Preddie's trainer, which arrived at the lab just a week after Damilola died, was not tested for DNA because of an oversight by a female assistant scientific officer and the supervisor. A male ASO failed to find a blood spot on Ricky Preddie's black sweatshirt, despite examining it with the naked eye, fibre optic light and filter paper.Three years later a scientist from another company found red material on a cuff which matched Damilola's DNA.An FSS spokeswoman said: "The organisation deeply regrets what happened and we apologise unreservedly to the Taylor family."We recognise there are significant lessons to be learned."
