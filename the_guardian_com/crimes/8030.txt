Television cameras were today allowed into the Harold Shipman inquiry as a second phase opened into the investigation of the former GP's serial murders.After protests from CNN that the inquiry was in the public interest and it needed video footage for its news reports, the inquiry's chair, Dame Janet Smith, agreed to allow its proceedings to be broadcast.An hour's delay will be built into the transmission to deal with sensitive issues.The second stage of the inquiry will examine why a police investigation in March 1998 failed to uncover suspicious deaths among Shipman's elderly patients at his practice in Hyde, Greater Manchester.After it found insufficient evidence to proceed against him Shipman went on to commit at least three more murders in the five months before his arrest, killing Kathleen Grundy, Joan Melia and Winnie Mellor.The first phase of the inquiry, which began in June 2001, looked at the deaths of around 800 of Shipman's former patients.The final stage of the second phase will look at issues arising from death and cremation certificates and proposals for change. Dame Janet will later make a decision on whether it should be televised.The inquiry will today hear how a fellow GP in Hyde raised fears about Shipman's patient death rates, prompting a police investigation.In March 1998, Dr Linda Reynolds jeopardised her career by blowing the whistle to south Manchester coroner John Pollard, who then informed police.But despite officers checking patients' death certificates with their medical histories - which Shipman had doctored - no evidence was found to justify arresting the family GP.Following the death of another Shipman patient, the former mayoress of Hyde Kathleen Grundy, a second investigation was eventually launched which trapped the doctor.Shipman is currently serving life at Frankland Jail, Co Durham, after being convicted in January 2000 of murdering 15 of his women patients.
