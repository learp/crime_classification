A man who crashed his Land Rover into a river, killing four of his seven children, had made "incompetent" changes to the vehicle, a court heard today.Nigel Gresham, 37, is accused of driving the yellow Land Rover dangerously before it crashed into the River Witham near Tattershall Bridge, Lincolnshire, on September 16 last year.Gresham, of Chapel Hill, Lincolnshire, denies causing the deaths of Willow, two, Angel, four, Thor, six, and eight-year-old Keavy.Gresham, his partner Sara Bolland, and their three eldest children, Liam, Amber and Star, survived the crash.Lincoln crown court heard that witnesses in oncoming vehicles saw the Land Rover 110 station wagon travelling at speed along the road. Timothy Spencer QC, prosecuting, said Gresham was driving the vehicle dangerously.At the time, a Renault Clio was travelling in convoy with a Transit van towing a trailer and the court heard that the driver of the van said the Land Rover was approaching "very fast"."It passed the Clio in front of him [the van driver], then passed him and, having passed him, it then swerved towards its offside towards the river, and rolled over, tumbling down the bank into the Witham,'' Spencer said."A number of members of the public, who were either there at the time or shortly afterwards, acted very bravely indeed and a number of people dived in and did all they could to assist."Some of the occupants of the Land Rover, including Mr Gresham the driver, got themselves out of the vehicle."Others had to be pulled out by, frankly, heroic efforts of the members of the public. Eventually, all of the occupants of the vehicle were pulled out but in the case of four of them sadly it was too late."The court heard the cause of death for two-year-old Willow was drowning. For the other three children the cause was given as death from the effects of being immersed in water - not technically drowning.Gresham told a police officer who arrived at the scene that he lost control after the oncoming Transit van did not move over."I was coming along the bank towards Tattershall. A van towing canoes did not pull over. I went over a bit further and lost control. The back wheel slipped and I swerved into the river."The court heard the Land Rover had passed an MoT in February last year - seven months before the crash.Spencer told the court Gresham had owned the car for about four years, during which time he had carried out a number of modifications."His major pastime was driving it off-road and it may be that a number of the modifications were intended to assist him with that,'' he said. "Sadly they didn't assist him with driving on-road. A number of the modifications were ill-judged, many were incompetently carried out and he also failed to carry out a number of repairs."The trial continues.
