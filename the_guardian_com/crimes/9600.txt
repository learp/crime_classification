Tony Blair's pledge to deport all foreign criminals automatically may be difficult to fulfil, the constitutional affairs secretary warned yesterday.Lord Falconer said that consultation was needed on the plans to automatically deport released prisoners, adding that there were some offences which would not "remotely justify deportation". His remarks echoed the warning of the former home secretary, Charles Clarke, that deportation might not be possible without the agreement of the criminal's country.The prime minister told the Commons last Wednesday that the time had come for "anybody who is convicted of an imprisonable offence and who is a foreign national to be deported".On ITV1's Dimbleby programme yesterday, Lord Falconer was asked if deportation would proceed in all cases. He said: "We need to identify the circumstances in which there is deportation. What the prime minister is saying: you need clarity."Currently if you are convicted and sentenced to 12 months or two years, whether you're a European national or not, then consideration is given to deportation and there's uncertainty about what the criteria are," he said. "There are obviously offences where it's imprisonable, but a very, very minor offence is committed which wouldn't remotely justify deportation in every circumstance." Imprisonable offences include having a dangerous dog, dodging a train fare and spraying graffiti.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said Lord Falconer's remarks revealed the prime minister's deportation pledge had been "spin and bluster".Writing in the News of the World yesterday, the new home secretary, John Reid, accused the courts of often thwarting the wishes of the government. "The public believe it is wrong if court judgments put the human rights of foreign prisoners ahead of the safety of UK citizens," he wrote. "They want the deportation of foreign nationals to be considered early in their sentence, and are aware this is overruled by the courts."
