A getaway driver who reached speeds of up to 180mph in a police chase has been jailed for nine years by a judge who branded his driving appalling and atrocious. Ben Westwood, 33, was found guilty at Wolverhampton crown court of conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to steal and dangerous driving.The court heard police struggled to keep up with his car as he fled towards the M6 after an attempted robbery at a cash machine in the city on 13 January. Westwood was leader of a gang that carried out robberies at commercial properties across the Midlands that were linked by a white Audi RS5, later resprayed black. The car, one of two of that specification in the country, had been stolen from Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire.Westwood, from Wednesfield, Wolverhampton, was arrested with four other men after the raid on the Murco petrol station in Warstones Road in the early hours of 13 January. The car was later abandoned at a block of flats and Westwood was arrested after police dogs found him inside a property.Recorder Nigel Baker QC told Westwood: "You have an appalling record for a man of 33. You are no stranger to burglaries of this type."I have come to the conclusion that the time has come to increase the level of sentencing that you have previously had."The judge added: "This was an atrocious piece of dangerous driving. You drove through the suburban streets of Wolverhampton at speeds which the police car could not keep up."Four co-defendants were jailed for conspiracy to steal: Gregory Simpson, 26, to four years, Ramesh Sharma, 38, three years, Stephen Green, 41, four years, six months, and Luke Watkins, 34, three years. Watkins was further sentenced to nine months for dangerous driving. PA
