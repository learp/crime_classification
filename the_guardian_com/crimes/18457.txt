A motorway crash in Northern Ireland which resulted in a man's death may have been caused by shots being fired into his car.The Police Service of Northern Ireland has confirmed that the vehicle was fired on along the M1 motorway between Lurgan and Portadown, in County Armagh, around 7.30am on Thursday.Security sources have told the Guardian that the victim may have worked in security in the province, possibly within the prison service.They said the ambush appeared to suggest it was the work of armed republicans opposed to the peace process.There has been ongoing tension within Northern Ireland's prison system, with inmates belonging to dissident republican groups involved in lock downs, no wash protests and short-term hunger strikes.During the incident the car left the road at the M12 junction. The motorway was closed off shortly afterwards.At first the PSNI treated the fatality as a road crash but a spokesman said that in a follow-up operation officers discovered shots had been fired into the car.The justice spokesman for the Alliance party, whose minister is in charge of justice and policing in the Northern Ireland Executive, called the incident an "ambush."Stewart Dickinson said: "I am absolutely sickened at the brutal killing of this man. It is appalling that anyone could be ambushed like this as they go about their daily business."There are no words to condemn this brutal murder, which is an attack on our whole society."I would appeal for the local community to remain calm and anyone with any information to contact the PSNI as soon as possible."This is a human tragedy and my thoughts are with the victim's extended family."
