Detectives investigating the death of a Vietnamese farmer who fell through the skylight of a cannabis factory during an alleged burglary are trying to trace anyone who knew him.The body of Tran Duy Hai, 38, was found in a converted industrial unit in South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, late last year.A postmortem showed that Tran died after falling through a skylight in the roof of the factory, and police are treating his death as murder.Tran, who was married with two children, is thought to have arrived in the UK in 2008 and was identified through fingerprint records in Vietnam.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Hall of Essex police said: "We need information about where Mr Tran lived, where he worked and who he socialised with during his time in the UK."Police believe he was one of several men living in the unit, where more than 6,000 cannabis plants were found.Hall added: "I want to try to trace the other occupants."Officers have recovered two vehicles in the Romford area which are thought to be linked to the incident and they are trying to establish who owned or used them and where they were kept.Two men have been arrested. One has been charged with burglary and the second has been released on police bail without charge pending further inquiries.A spokesman for Essex police said the force received 347 calls concerning the cultivation of cannabis last year. They ranged from the growing of a few plants to "fairly sophisticated set-ups" involving entire houses dedicated to cannabis production and illegal connections to electricity supplies.
