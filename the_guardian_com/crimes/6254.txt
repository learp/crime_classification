This week marks the first anniversary of the publication of the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, whose murderers were never brought to justice. What progress has been made in implementing the report's 70 recommendations? Sadly, the picture is a grim one, littered with broken promises, inaction and reticence.Sir William Macpherson and his inquiry panel stated "we hope and expect that implementation of our recommendations will ensure that the opportunity for radical thinking and root and branch action is seized. Nothing less will satisfy us, and all those who so passionately spoke to us during our hearings".But there has been very little feedback from the government about what steps they are taking towards implementation. There are working parties, advisory groups and, even for that matter, a task force involved. Yet so far, no public report has been issued. Surely, at very least, the public is entitled to know how many targets have so far been achieved? The core finding of the Macpherson report was that of "institutional racism" defined as "unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people". The commissioner of the metropolitan police, Sir Paul Condon, staunchly and steadfastly resisted this conclusion . But on the back of this finding the inquiry recommended "that the full force of the race relations legislation should apply to all police officers". The panel plainly wanted the "full force" to apply to indirect systemic racism as much as to direct, overt racism. The race relations amendment bill, however, did not do this until the very day on which the home secretary was faced with defeat in the House of Lords. The government's attitude thus far does not sit well with all its heartfelt declarations about race. Daily policing too remains largely untouched: Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville, and his cousin were subsequently stopped by police and questioned about their car. And one of the Lawrence inquiry panelists, Bishop John Sentanu, was stopped and ordered to open the boot of his car. There was no good reason for suspecting the bishop of committing any offence. In 1998 and 1999 black people were six times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people (compared to five times in 1998). This disparity resulted in specific recommendations in the Macpherson report. If implemented, number 61 would have entitled the bishop to a copy of the record of why he was stopped and searched. There is still an unwillingness to recognise the existence and incidence of racial crime. This attitude is perhaps exemplified in the first investigation into the murder of Michael Menson, the initial investigation into the death of Ricky Reel and, currently, it would appear, the racial harassment surrounding the McGowan hangings. Other specific and far-reaching Macpherson recommendations included : "Victims or victims' families should be allowed to become civil parties to criminal proceedings, to facilitate and to ensure the provision of all relevant information to victims or their families." This is currently the position in France. Moreover, it was suggested that the crown prosecution service ensure that a victim or victim's family should be kept informed of any proposal to discontinue proceedings, that decisions to discontinue any prosecution should be carefully and fully recorded in writing, and that normally decisions should be disclosable to the family. At all times the family should be personally informed with speed and sensitivity. In the matter of inquests, the report suggested that there should be advance disclosure of evidence and documents, as of right, to parties and that consideration should be given to extending legal aid to victims, or their families. Importantly, it was also suggested that police complaints authority reports could be disclosed to complainants, subject only to a "substantial harm" test. Yet one year on and we are no nearer the implementation of even these proposals. The most crucial aspect concerning any police investigation is freedom of information. The home secretary has not incorporated into the FoI bill the obvious and clear recommendation put forward by Macpherson that any such act should apply to all areas of policing, both operational and administrative, subject only to the "substantial harm" test for withholding disclosure. Not only has this test been watered down to merely "causing prejudice", and Jack Straw, needless to say without consultation, has recently added a new power to ban the release of any public documents; but also clauses 28 and 29 expressly exempt the police and law enforcement agencies. Therefore, Doreen and Neville Lawrence would face very similar difficulties today in their hunt for the truth as they had to face in the past. It is perhaps ironic that the only proposal that has been actively and positively pursued by the government in the last year is one that was not, in fact, proposed by any of the parties to the Lawrence inquiry and that did not receive detailed examination and debate. Sir William Macpherson did, however, suggest that consideration be given to ending the double jeopardy rule to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented. In the circumstances of the Lawrence case where the original investigation was so dilatory and defective, and where five suspects have behaved in public with arrogance and aggression, it is perfectly understandable that the panel would feel an urgent desire to enable the prosecuting authorities to pursue those responsible. Yet we must be extremely careful to guard against letting emotion sweep away some of the basic tenets of criminal jurisprudence . If an investigating authority is allowed a "second bite of the cherry" we run the risk that, in order to obtain convictions, the police may resort to the activities that bedevilled so many of the miscarriage of justice cases of the 1980's. For example "confession evidence" may be said to have been discovered for the first time after an acquittal, relating either to conversations with cell-mates, prison officers or, perhaps, passing police officers. Or evidence "overlooked" at the scene of a crime may suddenly emerge for the first time. So, with the exception of this one flawed proposal, the excellent framework so assiduously laid out in the Macpherson Report remains to be implemented. No doubt the government hopes that if enough time passes the detail will be lost in the wash. Yet a groundswell of public opinion demands action. Victims of racial crime, and their families, must be confident that they will be acknowledged, respected and consulted throughout the dark days of their grief. A failure to act betrays them as much as it betrays the memory of Stephen. Â• Michael Mansfield QC is president of the National Civil Rights Movement.
