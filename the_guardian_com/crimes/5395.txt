A fraudster who masterminded a £2m premium phone line scam, distributing thousands of scratchcards and letters telling people they had won a luxury prize, was yesterday ordered to do 200 hours of community service.To claim the supposed prize people had to phone a premium rate line which cost up to £9 a call.In reality, the only prize on offer was a reconditioned computer and even then the "winners" had to take out an expensive warranty or upgrade to claim it. The profits allowed Joseph Boll, 26, to buy a £250,000 flat, a Mercedes and a Range Rover with a personalised number plate.Boll, of Clifton, Bristol, admitted deception under the Trades Descriptions Act. At Bristol crown court, Judge John Foley told him it was appropriate he did a substantial amount of community service as it was the community he had "hoodwinked". Boll has also been made to pay £20,000 towards the costs of the criminal prosecution, the first against fraudsters behind premium rate prize scams.Boll and his partner, Mark Hunter, 41, who admitted similar offences and will be sentenced next month for his part in the scam, produced hundreds of thousands of mailshots and scratchcards, which led people to believe they had a chance of winning prizes such as a TVR sports car, digital camera, DVD player or widescreen television. Recipients were encouraged to call a £1.50-per-minute claim line, costing £9 per call, £7 of which went to Boll and Hunter, the court heard. The letters and scratchcards claimed the prize was "definitely worth more than the cost of the call" or "worth at least 40 times the cost of the call". But after hanging on for six minutes, callers learned all that was on offer was a reconditioned computer.The scam operated on the basis that 2%-3% of people who received the letter or scratchcard would call the premium rate line, and that only one in 10 of those would write in to claim their prize.Bristol city council trading standards officers began investigating Boll after authorities across the country received hundreds of complaints about the operation.Iain MacDonald, prosecuting, said it was difficult to put a value on the fraud but the two companies Boll and Hunter operated had a turnover of £2m in the two years they were operating. Mark Horton, defending, said Boll had been "negligent, naive and inexperienced" but had not set out to commit a deliberate fraud.However, after the case the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) said it had fined Boll a total of £407,000 for breaches of the code which it oversees. ICSTIS, which is responsible for regulating premium rate services, said Boll had run not only prize cons but scams in which customers were tricked into sending faxes to premium rate lines or logging on to websites via expensive lines.Outside court, Bristol city council's trading standards manager, Stephen Meale, said Boll's operation could have raised millions of pounds."I can't put an exact figure on the amount, but it would more likely be in the millions rather than the hundreds of thousands." Mr Meale said the council had received complaints about the promotion from all over Britain.
