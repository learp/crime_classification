A teenager who doused his girlfriend in petrol and set her on fire was found guilty of her "barbaric and evil" murder today.Jessica McCagh, 17, became engulfed in a ball of flames when Stewart Blackburn set her alight in the bedroom of his flat in Arbroath, Angus, in April this year.A jury took less than two hours to find Blackburn, 18, guilty of murder after a 10-day trial at the high court in Livingston, West Lothian. Judge Lord Bracadale said Jessica suffered a "terrible death" at her boyfriend's hands. He said the crime would "deeply disturb" all right-thinking people.He told Blackburn: "The jury have found you guilty of the murder of Jessica McCagh by throwing petrol over her and setting her alight."She was your girlfriend, aged 17 years, and she died a terrible death at your hands. Her family are left bereft. These acts demonstrate a degree of wickedness on your part which will leave all right-thinking people deeply disturbed."Solicitor general Frank Mulholland QC, prosecuting, yesterday told jurors: "It is difficult to envisage more cruel or sadistic treatment of another human being."He said Blackburn had committed "a barbaric and evil act against a defenceless young woman".
