The home secretary's suggestion that lie detectors should be used to help monitor sex offenders on their release from prison is likely to spark an intense debate over the reliability of such controversial technology.In the US, where the use of lie detectors, or polygraphs, is widespread among law enforcement agencies, that debate has already raged for many years.The polygraph works by tracking variations in breathing, pulse rate, the electrical conductivity of the skin and blood pressure during questioning. Subjects are connected to the machine via wires and tubes attached to different parts of their body and their physiological responses are traced onto a chart.Proponents, led by the American Polygraph Association, claim that in more than 90% of cases these charts can be accurately interpreted by examiners to indicate whether the subject is lying or not. But detractors argue that it is simply too easy to cheat a polygraph test. Chief among them is Doug Williams, a former a detective sergeant and licensed polygrapher for the Oklahoma City police department who now offers advice on "how the polygraph works and how to control every tracing on the chart".According to his website, where for $30 (Â£16.37) he offers a manual entitled Sting the Polygraph, he has trained thousands of people to cheat criminal and pre-employment tests since he started campaigning against polygraphs in the late 1970s.Mr Williams argues that rather than "helping someone get by with lying", his techniques merely teach people "how to control the physiological functions measured by the polygraph", thereby exposing and exploiting a fundamental weakness of the test."I don't accept this test is valid. Even at it's best it only works 50% of the time. The whole process is based on the faulty premise that if you lie, you always have certain physical reactions such as sweaty palms or an erratic heart beat," he told Guardian Unlimited."The problem with that is that what the polygraph records is the fight or flight response, the reaction to stimulation. Half the time it is picking up those reactions because someone is lying, but the other half is due to embarrassment, stress or nervousness at taking the test."It might even be rage at the very fact that you are being asked certain questions, or aggression in the examiners voice," he said.Examiners compare the responses to "control" questions -on everyday subjects such as what car you drive or what you had for breakfast - with the response to a "relevant" question about the case in question.But Mr Williams, who bases his conclusions on the 6,000 tests he conducted in his seven years as a polygraph examiner, argues there is a vast difference in the nature of the control and relevant questions, so there is "no way in hell" the emotional responses to them should be compared.The most recent high-profile case illustrating the apparent flaws in polygraph testing is that of Abdallah Higazy, a 30-year-old student from Egypt who was arrested as a terror suspect in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks.During an FBI lie detector test in December 2001, he admitted possessing a hand-held pilots' radio allegedly found in his hotel room across the street from the World Trade Centre.The radio, known as a transceiver, allows pilots to communicate with other pilots in the air or with people on the ground. It was later claimed by another hotel guest, a pilot who had left it in his room when he checked out.The FBI was cleared of coercing Mr Higazy into a confession, though he claimed he was worried about the threat to his family in Egypt if he did not confess during the polygraph session.Whatever the reason for his response to the questions, the case raised serious questions as to why the polygraph test had not detected Mr Higazy's lie. As his attorney, Robert Dunn, said after Mr Higazy was cleared of all charges: "We now know, he didn't have anything to do with the device. He didn't have anything to do with the attack. So what does that say about the quality of whatever the polygrapher was doing?" But Bruce Burgess, of Distress Services, which claims to be the UK's only private polygraph testing company, insists the only way to pass a test - except in very rare cases - is to tell the truth. "The polygraph is not a lie detector but a medical instrument. Successful readings depend on getting everything right - from deciding which questions to ask, through preparing and relaxing the client at the start of the session and then analysing the responses." he said.In his experience, the few times he has been unable to tell when someone is lying or not -resulting in an "inconclusive" reading - is when "the person in the chair simply doesn't care whether they are found to be lying".He admits that there are "plenty of internet sites" offering crude ways to cheat polygraph tests, but he believes such tactics only succeed in disrupting the test and rendering it void, rather than offering a way of lying without being detected."I'm not saying no one has ever cheated, but what usually happens is people make the chart unreadable. One example is to put a tack in your shoe and inflict pain on yourself to disrupt the test, resulting in lots of sudden spikes," Mr Burgess said.. "It is obvious to me when that happens and I would explain in my report that the test was inconclusive due to disruption."Mr Burgess believes that British police are "losing a lot" by not making use of the lie detectors in the same way as their US counterparts."Every US police department uses the tests as investigative tools, to narrow down the field of witnesses, though tests cannot be used in court without the agreement of the defence, prosecution and the judge," he said.But the trials that are currently taking place in this country are restricted solely to monitoring convicted sex offenders, suggesting it will be a long time before the wider use of polygraph testing is considered in UK law enforcement.A home office spokesman stressed that it was too early to draw conclusions on how successful the two-year trial, which aims to test at least 300 offenders by September 2005, will have been. A final report is not due until early 2006.But the home secretary, David Blunkett, has made it clear that - based on early indications from the voluntary pilot scheme - he is convinced of the usefulness of lie detector testing to the probation service.As he acknowledged in his defence of the proposals today, however, he may have to overcome strong public opposition. "We are all a bit sceptical because we've all been brought up with the spy films and the way in which the KGB are allegedly able to train people to avoid them. But we are talking about really modern technology in the 21st century and we are testing it," Mr Blunkett said."It won't only just pick up whether a person is lying. It will be a major deterrent to people actually telling an untruth when they are under supervision and when it is necessary to find out what they've been up to."
