Claims that Britain has never been safer are misleading, according to a study that accuses the government of massaging official crime figures. It alleges that the Home Office is promoting statistics knowing they do not include some of the fastest-rising forms of online crime, making figures significantly lower than the true crime rate.Marian FitzGerald, a visiting professor of criminology at the crime and justice centre, University of Kent, said the government's decision to exclude credit card fraud from the Crime Survey for England and Wales meant talk of an overall fall in crime was "illusory" at best and deceptive at worst.The last survey figures reveal reductions in almost every category, a trend that allowed former policing minister Nick Herbert to say that crime had continued to fall despite the challenge of reduced police budgets and "give the lie to the spurious claim that there is a simple link between overall police numbers and the crime rate".However FitzGerald told senior police officers and policymakers last week that a preoccupation with reducing crime figures year-on-year had meant that the official figures had excluded new types of crime. "The police service has been driven for nearly 15 years by the imperative to demonstrate year-on-year reductions in crime. So it has developed a mindset which is resistant to recognising new types of crime, such as card fraud and the many scams perpetrated over the internet, and has been more than happy for the Home Office to absolve it of taking any responsibility for them."The vast majority of offences committed in the UK are categorised as property crime, such as burglarly or theft, with research indicating that card fraud was three times as common as theft from the person and at least as prevalent as domestic burglary.In addition Home Office research found that only 14% had reported credit card fraud to the police, compared with 91% who had reported it to their bank or credit card company.Cybersecurity experts warn the ways in which people can become victims of online fraud continues to proliferate with experts identifying internet auction fraud, the non-delivery of items, advanced fee frauds, phishing and investment fraud among others.In addition, they warn, the continued growth of online transactions has escalated the opportunities for criminals to perpetuate online crime. Figures from the UK Cards Association show that online banking fraud leapt by more than a quarter in the first half of 2012 as criminals targeted families via the web.The amount of cash siphoned from UK bank accounts via the internet between January and June rose by 28% to £21.6m compared with the same period the previous year. The increase came against the background of a sharp rise in the number of phishing websites, with 111,396 identified in the first half of last year, a rise of almost 200%.Fitzgerald added: "New opportunities have opened up on an unprecedented scale for property crime and for many other types of crime. Arguably the internet has also massively increased the scale of psychological violence from what was previously possible."This, obviously, poses significant challenges for politicians – in particular those associated with the previous government, who took the credit for the fall in crime and repeatedly told the public that they were safer than since records began."Fitzgerald challenged the new Police and Crime Commissioners to oversee a cultural shift in the way the police detect and record crime.A Home Office spokesman said: "Crime continues to fall – recorded crime is down by more than 10% under this government. England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades."
