The two network operators who previously refused to disable stolen mobile phone handsets have caved in after facing anger from the government and consumers and will buy the necessary technology.The climbdown, days after BT Cellnet and Vodafone UK insisted there was no point in introducing the system, will be announced in the next few days and follows pressure from the Home Office, which urged them to tackle the soaring levels of mobile-related crime. Over 700,000 handsets were stolen last year. Thieves can use these phones even if the owners cancel their accounts, by inserting a new Sim card which costs just a few pounds. But if the owners know their serial or IMEI numbers, it is possible to blacklist the handset. Virgin, One2One and Orange already use the system. BT Cellnet and Vodafone lack the technology to bar numbers and previously claimed there was little point, as criminals would find a way round the system and that users would be penalised through duplicated IMEI numbers. Yesterday they attempted to play down their policy reversal. "We will look at investing in technologies that will allow us to block serial numbers, but it goes beyond that," a Vodafone spokeswoman said yesterday. "There are different ways we can make handsets inoperable on the network. We have said that the IMEI numbers are unreliable and still believe that." Industry experts said that the u-turn was a boost for users.
