Sir Menzies Campbell will relaunch his leadership today with a pledge to crack down on crime which marks a shift in the Liberal Democrats' stance.He will praise antisocial behaviour orders, call for the automatic early release of prisoners to be axed, and advocate the creation of a register for violent offenders.He will also call for fresh measures to restrict the movements of "undesirable" foreign criminals who cannot be deported due to threats to their life, in a speech that goes far beyond the party's previous claims of "tough liberalism"."A party which is serious about social justice cannot fail to be serious about preventing crime and enforcing the rules," he will tell Lib Dem councillors in London this morning.An aide said yesterday: "There's no doubt that the perception of the Liberal Democrats has been that we are soft on crime. In many ways that's unfair, but it's one we are determined to rectify."In a speech which is likely to alarm many party activists, who believe civil liberties should be at the heart of the Lib Dem agenda, Sir Menzies will say: "We believe in personal freedom and individual liberty. But we also believe that everyone should play by the rules, and the same rules."His team believes Labour can no longer sustain its claim to be "the toughest of the tough", given the Home Office's travails. "That provides a space we haven't had before," said a senior frontbencher.Sir Menzies is keen to restore his authority after disappointing local election results and faltering performances at prime minister's questions. A YouGov poll today gives him the worst rating a Lib Dem leader has received.According to the Daily Telegraph, only 8% of voters believe he would be the best prime minister, compared to 18% who wanted to see Charles Kennedy in No 10 shortly before last year's general election.Sir Menzies may struggle to implement the most drastic measures he advocates, because all Lib Dem policy is made by members.But he will reverse the interpretation of at least one policy, which opposes denying the vote to prisoners.His speech risks being overshadowed by the Electoral Commission's warning that it will reconsider the party's acceptance of a Â£2.4m gift following a police investigation into the donor. In October the watchdog said on the basis of information then available, it was "reasonable" for the Lib Dems to accept the gift from Majorca-based Michael Brown's 5th Avenue company. But after discussions with City of London police, who are are investigating Mr Brown over claims of forgery, false accounting, perverting the course of justice, perjury and deception - all of which he denies, the commission said: "It is possible further information will become available that may be relevant to whether these donations were permissible."
