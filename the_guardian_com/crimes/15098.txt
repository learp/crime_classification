The value of illegal business software has topped Â£1 billion in Britain for the first time. Figures released by the Business Software Alliance of leading technology firms shows use of illegal software rising alarmingly in just one year. The City of London police says it plans to crack down on the crime. Worldwide, software piracy is worth $33bn - up $4bn on last year's figure; 35 per cent of European software is pirated. In Latin America, prevalence of illegal software is put at 66 per cent. More than $59bn is spent by the world's businesses on computer software, says the survey. The BSA is pressing the government to act on an election promise to get tough. 'Protecting intellectual property will play a key role in the future prosperity of the UK,' said Labour MP Janet Anderson, who chairs an all-party committee on intellectual property. 'Piracy stifles innovation and creativity and has a significant impact on employment, economic growth and public spending.' The BSA says the Treasury is losing millions of pounds of tax income thanks to criminal gangs selling software. With compact disks taking huge amounts of information, pirating expensive software has never been easier or more tempting. Many small businesses baulk at paying what seem like inflated fees for the latest accounting or office software.
