Complaints against police forces in England and Wales rose by 8% last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said today.The police watchdog said members of the public made 31,259 complaints against forces in England and Wales in 2008/09, an increase of 2,296 on the previous year. The rise came despite the fact that complaints over the G20 protests on April 1 this year fell just outside the reporting period. There were more than 250 complaints related to the G20 protests alone, where newspaper vendor, Ian Tomlinson, died after an altercation with police.One in every four complaints received last year was for "neglect of duty" â€” officers being slow or ineffective when responding to calls, the IPCC said, and one in five was for officers being rude. Around one complaint in 10 is upheld, the watchdog said.Newly released data from the 2006/7 British Crime Survey revealed more than one in four of those asked said that their contact with the police had left them "really annoyed". But only one in ten of those made a complaint, suggesting even wider levels of public dissatisfaction with the police.IPCC chairman Nick Hardwick said: "The public recognise the police have a difficult job to do. However, this does not alter the fact that they expect officers to do their job politely and efficiently. These statistics show that when it is not done in this manner they are likely to complain."Each complaint can contain more than one allegation and the number of allegations was also up, by 11% to 53,534.Complaints about stop and search were up 27%, although at 680 they only accounted for a small fraction of the total.Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman Chief Constable John Feavyour said it was important to learn the lessons provided by the data."Rudeness and neglect of duty are far removed from the standards required of staff within the police," he said."Inevitably there will be occasions where we do not always get it right. When we get it wrong we should recognise the facts quickly, encourage debate and be willing to listen to the views of those who wish to engage in the policing debate and learn more from them."Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, which represents frontline officers, said accountability was "one of the strengths of British policing"."Despite many of these initial complaints not being upheld or proven, these statistics demonstrate that some forces are not learning lessons and those systemic and structural faults which hinder policing need to be addressed," he said.He added that it was important to not just focus on the headline figures because "police officers are interacting with those who would rather not be stopped or questioned by police and there is therefore an element of malicious complaints, which explains the high percentage of complaints that are unfounded".
