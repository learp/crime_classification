The former wife of Si√¥n Jenkins, the deputy head convicted of murdering his foster daughter, Billie-Jo, yesterday described how it gradually dawned on her that her husband might have killed the teenager.Giving evidence against her former husband at his appeal, Lois Jenkins said that in the frantic aftermath of Billie-Jo's death she had "no inkling" that he could have been responsible, but little by little "everything started to slot in".However, Mrs Jenkins denied she had "brainwashed" her two oldest daughters into believing her husband's guilt or lied to police about what they were saying to stop them giving evidence which might have saved him.Mrs Jenkins, 43, said she had made it a family rule that she would not discuss the case with Annie and Lottie, who had been with their father on the day Billie-Jo was killed.Painting a picture of a family deeply traumatised by the tragedy, one of the most notorious murder cases of the last decade, Mrs Jenkins said she still did not discuss Billie-Jo's death with Annie. And she said Annie had never talked about it with her younger sister, Lottie.Mrs Jenkins revealed that she had taken Annie and Lottie to see an expert in post-traumatic stress disorder. They had also been seen by a professional who had experience in dealing with children who were victims of bomb attacks in Belfast.Jenkins is serving life for battering Billie-Jo, 13, to death with a metal tent spike at the family home in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1997.A major plank of his appeal is that Annie and Lottie, then 12 and 10, were not called to give evidence at his trial even though the day after the murder they gave police accounts of their father's movements which he believes could have helped show he did not have time to attack Billie-Jo.Jenkins's defence team decided not to call them after Mrs Jenkins reported to police that they had changed their stories and were now hostile to their father.Jenkins's legal team is claiming Mrs Jenkins may have lied to police about what the girls were saying because she was convinced of his guilt and worried that their testimony could put doubt in the minds of the jurors. The idea that she may have "brainwashed" the children has also been raised.An emotional Mrs Jenkins, who now lives with her daughters and new husband in Tasmania, began her evidence by giving a vivid account of life after the murder."At the beginning it was unimaginable," she said. "There were so many people and so much happening."The media attention caused "enormous" problems. Mrs Jenkins said she could not go out to buy a loaf of bread with out a police escort. "We were trapped in the house _ it's unbelievable how scary it was."Mrs Jenkins, who was a social worker in Britain and is now a nurse in Australia, said her main concern was always her four children.She tried to get things back to normal by making sure they returned to school and by taking them out on trips. "We dealt with the whole thing by keeping going," she said.The pressure increased when 10 days after the killing police told Mrs Jenkins that blood spatters found on her husband's clothes showed he was the killer.Mrs Jenkins, who occasionally glanced from the witness box across the appeal court at her former husband who sat behind bars in the dock, said she was sitting on a bed at home when she was told."I think I went into shock. I couldn't even stand up," she said.Mrs Jenkins continued: "There was a process of dawning _ the penny dropped, everything started to slot in. You knew it could be a possibility."Asked by Camden Pratt QC, for the crown, if the children turned against their father, Mrs Jenkins said: "They chopped and changed _ we were all on emotional rollercoasters. I don't think anyone felt one thing with conviction for more than half an hour before it swung. We were scared."Mr Pratt continued: "It has been suggested _ you chose deliberately to mislead the police. Is there any truth in that suggestion?"Mrs Jenkins replied: "Absolutely not."Mr Pratt asked: "Have you ever lied to the police?" Mrs Jenkins: "No."Mr Pratt: "It has been suggested you brainwashed Annie and Lottie into believing their father was a murderer." Mrs Jenkins: "Absolutely not."Clare Montgomery QC, for Jenkins, asked Mrs Jenkins about how Lottie came to know a month after Billie-Jo's death that blood had been found on her father's clothes.Mrs Jenkins said Lottie found out from the media, but Miss Montgomery told her that no reports about the blood had appeared by then. "I suggest that the only person she could have learned that from was you."Mrs Jenkins replied: "I certainly don't recall telling her."Miss Montgomery asked Mrs Jenkins about a report she made to police before the trial that Annie was saying her father had a "peculiar look" on his face just after the prosecution alleged the murder took place.When Annie gave a statement to police two years ago for the appeal she suggested it was her mother, not her, who came up with this description.But Mrs Jenkins insisted she "vividly" remembered Annie talking about her father's odd appearance.The appeal continues.
