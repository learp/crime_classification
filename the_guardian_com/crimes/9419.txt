The parents of the Austrian kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch today said any relevant information "no matter how small" should be given to Portuguese police searching for four-year-old Madeleine McCann.Ludwig Koch said his daughter, who was held captive for eight years, might have been found much earlier if neighbours of her abductor, Wolfgang Priklopil, had reported their suspicions."As the case of my Natascha showed, any lead, however small, should be passed on, you should immediately report them, even if it might involve your best friend," Mr Koch said.He urged Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, not to give up hope and to "leave no stone unturned" in their search."When I heard about what had happened [to Madeleine] it brought all the horror of losing my own child back to me. I know that there has been an enormous show of public support for the family but I also know that no one who has not gone through such an ordeal will be able to comprehend just how badly the parents are feeling. My heart goes out to them."He said he spent much of the time during Natascha's captivity "in a trance" during which he felt helpless.Natascha was kidnapped on her way to school in north-east Vienna in 1998 when she was 10. She was held until last summer when she escaped while Priklopil, who later committed suicide, was distracted by a phone call.It later emerged that Priklopil's neighbours harboured suspicions, but ignored them as they were friends with his family."Nobody who has not been in the same situation can imagine the depths of despair they must be feeling - nothing will help that - only the safe return of their daughter. And I pray that this happens soon," said Natascha's mother, Brigitta Sirny.Natascha has recently written the preface to a German book on missing persons. "The experiences of my parents, siblings and other relatives show me that the dependants are often the overlooked victims of such strokes of fate," she wrote.
