The home secretary, John Reid, today set out the first stage in his pledge to reform the criminal justice system in favour of victims, with a plan to prevent criminals having their convictions quashed on technicalities.In a move that has alarmed civil rights campaigners, Mr Reid unveiled plans to stop the court of appeal overturning judgments because of procedural mistakes by police or prosecutors.The reforms follow Mr Reid's review of Home Office operations after he branded it "not fit for purpose".He said today's proposals were the first in a series of initiatives designed rebalance the criminal justice system "in favour of victims and the law-abiding majority".In a foreword to a consultation paper on the changes, Mr Reid said: "It is not right or in the interests of justice that offenders can go free where there is clear evidence of guilt simply because of errors in the process."We must, of course, ensure that we have an effective and robust appeals system so that those who are innocent can overturn wrongful convictions. Equally, however, we must have a system that punishes the guilty and delivers justice for victims."He added: "It is our firm view that the present system risks outcomes which are unacceptable to the law-abiding majority."The paper states that the government wants to ensure that convictions are not quashed where the court of appeal takes the view that it is "safe"."The government acknowledges that the court of appeal are (sic) not in the same position as the jury and may not always be able to form a view on whether the appellant committed the offence," it adds."However, where they have formed such a view, the government believes that they should not be empowered to allow the appeal."Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights pressure group Liberty, rejected the idea that criminals were being wrongly freed because of loopholes in the law."It's just nonsense to suggest that the court of appeal quashes convictions on 'minor technicalities'. Convictions are rarely but rightly quashed after unfair trials or where the authorities have been engaged in beatings or kidnap."Speaking on the BBC Radio Today programme she also suggested that the current system provided a safeguard against the security services acting outside the law.One case cited by the Home Office involved a man convicted of IRA activity who was freed after the appeal court found he had been kidnapped from another state in order to be brought to court, said Ms Chakrabarti."I think the government and everyone should be very, very careful not to send a signal to security services, police or other agencies that that kind of appalling abuse is acceptable," she said.The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, stressed that the appeals system would remain robust. He said: "A fair and effective appeal court is an essential element of our criminal justice system."It helps to ensure that offenders are dealt with properly, while providing a means for anyone wrongly convicted to have their conviction quashed."But the appeal system must also deliver justice for victims, and the public need to have confidence in it."
