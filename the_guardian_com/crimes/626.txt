A Chinese businessman wanted by police over the murder of a family of four in Britain is being extradited to the UK where he is expected to appear in court on Thursday.Anxiang Du was arrested in Morocco last year on suspicion of killing Manchester Metropolitan university lecturer Jifeng "Jeff" Ding, 46, his wife Ge "Helen" Chui, 47 and their two daughters Alice, 12, and Xing, 18.In May 2011, police launched a murder investigation after the family were found dead in a bloody scene at their detached home in Wootton, Northamptonshire.Ding, a popular senior lecturer in chemical and environmental science, was found knifed to death with his wife downstairs while his children were discovered dead upstairs.Both daughters played violin for their youth orchestra and Xing was described as a straight-A student who had ambitions to go to Cambridge.Last year, after disclosing that more than 2000 people had been visited, interviewed and questioned in the hunt for suspects, police increased their reward for information leading to the killers to £25,000.At the time of his death a spokesman for Manchester Metropolitan University described Ding as "a popular and dedicated member of staff".On Wednesday Northamptonshire police said Du's extradition has been approved by the Moroccan ministry of justice in conjunction with the Home Office, and he would arrive in the UK on a flight from Casablanca.Du is expected to appear at Northampton magistrates court.DCC Martin Jelley said: "On behalf of Northamptonshire police, I would like to thank all those who have been involved in this successful extradition, including Michael Ellis MP for his considerable support in progressing this with the relevant authorities."
