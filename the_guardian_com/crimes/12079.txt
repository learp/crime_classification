Karen Matthews, the mother of the kidnapped schoolgirl, Shannon, told friends and a police officer that she had arranged for her daughter to go away from home as part of a plan to leave her partner, a court heard today.Matthews' neighbour, Natalie Brown, and friend, Julie Bushby, were in a police car with Matthews when she admitted asking Michael Donovan, her co-accused, to look after Shannon while she broke up with Craig Meehan, Leeds crown court heard.The jury was told that Matthews was in floods of tears after making the admission and said: "People will hate me for what I've done and I've disgraced the kids."Detective Constable Christine Freeman, a family liaison officer, was also in the car on April 6 - three weeks after Shannon was found in Donovan's flat in West Yorkshire following a huge police hunt.Matthews, 33, and her co-accused Donovan, 40, both deny kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.Brown put it to Matthews that she devised the plan but "bottled it" and reported Shannon as missing, the court was told.Describing Matthews' reaction to this suggestion, Freeman said: "Karen took the biggest intake of breath that I've ever heard in my life and said, 'Yes, that's right'."The detective continued: "She was agreeing that she had arranged for Mike to take Shannon for a while."She said that she'd planned to leave Craig and she'd asked for Mike to take Shannon and she'd packed her bag intending to leave but then she'd ended up having to report Shannon missing to cover her back."Freeman agreed that the police response was bigger than Matthews had expected and "it all got out of hand".The witnesses told the court that Matthews began to backtrack and began blaming other people.Matthews claimed that Meehan and his mother, Alice Meehan, made the arrangement for Donovan to look after Shannon, the court heard.Freeman told the court she asked her boss for advice before arresting Matthews on suspicion of abduction and taking her to Dewsbury police station.She said: "She [Matthews] told me that she wasn't involved in the abduction, that she's asked Mick to look after Shannon until she got the strength to leave Craig."Asked about what Matthews said to her in the custody suite, Freeman said: "Totally unprompted, Karen said 'As far as I'm concerned he had abducted her off his own back. People are putting words in my mouth'."Freeman said Matthews also told her: "I wasn't involved in the abduction, I just thought he was going to keep her overnight."I didn't think he'd keep her that long."The court has heard how Shannon, who was nine at the time, was found in Donovan's flat 24 days after she went missing from her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire.The prosecution allege Donovan kept her drugged and imprisoned in his flat in Lidgate Gardens, Batley Carr, as part of a plan he and Matthews had to claim any reward money offered for information leading to her return.A forensic toxicologist told the trial that hair samples showed that Shannon had been taking the "potent hypnotic" drug temazepam regularly months before she vanished.Dr Craig Chatterton told the court that trace amounts of the drug and the travel sickness medication Melcozine were found in Shannon's urine after she was discovered.Chatterton said this meant she would have ingested the drugs up to 72 hours before the sample was taken. But he said traces of the drugs found in Shannon's hair showed they had been taken over a much longer period.He said the drug was detected in all 20cm of her hair. The scientist said the fact the drugs were present "in each segment indicates it was ingested over an extended period dating back 20 months."Earlier, the jury was told that Donovan had invited Matthews and her children to stay with him two months before Shannon's disappearance.Matthews told police that Donovan made the offer after she had an argument with her partner at a funeral last December. Matthews told police she declined the invitation, as she wanted to sort out her problems with Meehan, the jury was told.The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
