An artist who created a giant inflatable installation that flipped over and killed two people was today charged with manslaughter.The Dreamspace air sculpture broke from its moorings in Chester-le-Street, County Durham in July 2006, killing two women and injuring more than a dozen others.Maurice Agis, 76, from Bow, east London, was charged with gross negligence manslaughter following a police investigation. He also faces an offence under the Health and Safety at Work Act and has been bailed to appear at Peterlee magistrates court on February 26.Liverpool-based promotions company Brouhaha International Limited and Chester-le-Street district council have also been charged with breaching the health and safety legislation.Claire Furmedge, 38, from Chester-le-Street and Elizabeth Collings, 68, from Seaham, died when they were exploring the installation.It broke free of its moorings, rose up, tipped over and crashed into a CCTV camera post. Up to 30 visitors were thrown from the installation, with 12 needing hospital treatment.The huge, panelled PVC structure, about five metres high and the size of half a football pitch, was secured by strong ropes. It was big enough for people to climb on and explore the interconnecting coloured rooms and tunnels inside.The sculpture was on a Â£60,000 national tour, paid for the Arts Council, and Agis had taken Dreamspace all over the world since 1996 without trouble.Rosie Wright, then aged three, was seriously injured when she fell out of Dreamspaceand hit a metal air fan. Her life was saved by a passing anaesthetist and the quick actions of an air ambulance crew who flew her to hospital.Agis was seen pulling on ropes to try to stop the inflatable taking off. He said that he would never create anything like Drreamspace again after the tragedy.
