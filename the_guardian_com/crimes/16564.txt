A woman killed in a crash on a busy dual carriageway asked someone to call police shortly before her death, detectives have said.Police are investigating after the woman and a man both died after being hit by a silver Kia on the A47 in Terrington St John, Norfolk, at about 2.15pm on Sunday.Several independent witnesses reported seeing the woman forcibly pushed into the carriageway by the man.DCI Paul Durham said it was not clear how the man came to be in the road, saying it was possible he had deliberately thrown himself into the traffic, stumbled or been pulled by the woman.The couple, believed to be Lithuanian and in their 20s, had been walking along the verge of the A47 for about two hours and were not wearing shoes.Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team are leading the investigation.Durham confirmed the incident was being treated as suspicious, following accounts from some witnesses that the woman was "forcibly pushed". He said: "Although our investigation is in its early stages, initial inquiries have given me sufficient cause for concern that this was more than just a tragic accident."As a result I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and may have witnessed the collision – or seen the two pedestrians shortly before the collision – to come forward, no matter how insignificant the information may seem to them."The earliest sighting of the pair is at 12.30pm on Sunday on the A47 Elm roundabout at Wisbech. Less than an hour later, they stopped at Worzals Farm Shop on Walpole Highway and the man and woman separately asked a shop assistant to call the police. They gave no explanation and left before they were called.The man is described as white, 6ft 1in and of slim build, with short dark hair. He was wearing a grey T-shirt and blue denim shorts. The woman is described as white, 5ft 7in and of slim build, with long auburn hair. She was wearing black leggings and a bright pink T-shirt.Durham said: "They would have posed an unusual sight – the woman wearing a bright pink vest-top and the man in designer-style jean shorts – both walking barefoot along one of our busiest trunk roads on one of the hottest days of the year. We need to find out how and why this tragedy occurred."Police are tracing next of kin and will not be releasing any further details about the deceased until their family have been informed.Anyone with information should contact the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigations team on 101.
