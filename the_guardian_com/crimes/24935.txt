A seven-year-old boy who was shot in the leg on his doorstep in Salford, Greater Manchester, has asked Santa to “help the police catch the people who hurt me”.Christian Hickey and his mother, Jayne, 29, were shot at their home last month in an attack suspected to be linked to a gangland feud.A photograph showing Christian in hospital with his legs swaddled in bandages was released shortly after the shooting in the hope it would lead to information about the attackers.

The boy has written a letter to Father Christmas asking for a remote-controlled helicopter and walkie-talkies – but the plea to help police catch his attackers topped his wishlist.DCS Russ Jackson, of the Greater Manchester police serious crime division, said: “It is heart-wrenching to know that a little boy who should be writing a list filled with exciting gifts has got this at the top of his Christmas list.“What happened to Christian will stay with him for the rest of his life, but what we can do is try to make this up to him by finding those responsible and bringing them to justice.”Police are renewing their appeal for information surrounding the double shooting on 12 October, in which two men first knocked on the door and reportedly asked for the boy’s father, who is also called Christian. Detectives said the attack could be linked to the murder of gangland security boss Paul Massey, 55, in Salford in July, and a feud between rival gangs in the Swinton and central Salford area of the city, which has so far seen at least five shootings. Jackson said he was determined to find the culprits for the shooting of Christian and his mother. “These people have absolutely no place in civilised society and we remain as determined as ever to find them,” he said. “We are continuing to appeal for information and I would like to urge anybody who may know something to please get in touch.” Anybody with information should contact police on 0161 856 9775 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
