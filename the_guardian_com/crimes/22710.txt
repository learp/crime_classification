A child witness in the Rosie May murder trial broke down in tears yesterday after admitting that his evidence about the 10-year-old ballet dancer's last moments at a family party was at fault. Via a videolink the 11-year-old told Nottingham crown court that he could not be sure exactly what happened before Rosie May Storrie was found suffocated on a bed just before New Year's Eve.The trial of Paul Smith, 18, who denies killing the schoolgirl, was adjourned for 20 minutes after the boy asked for a break. He had just agreed that his earlier account to police of Rosie snatching a beer can from Smith at a party in Normanton, Leicestershire, and running off laughing was wrong. He admitted he had not seen the girl take the can out of Smith's hand. Frances Oldham QC, defending, had said: "It didn't happen, did it?" The boy said "no" quietly before asking Mr Justice Astill for a break. The trial continues today.
