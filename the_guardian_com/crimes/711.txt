Jurors hearing the case against the man accused of murdering Joanna Yeates are visiting the flat in which the killing allegedly took place and the spot where her body was found.The six men and six women will be shown around Yeates's ground floor flat in Clifton, Bristol, where her neighbour, Vincent Tabak, is alleged to have carried out the murder. Later, the jury will be taken to Longwood Lane in Failand, three miles away, where Tabak allegedly hid Yeates's body under a pile of leaves.Tabak, a 33-year-old Dutch engineer, has admitted manslaughter but denies murder.The jury has been told Yeates, 25, suffered 43 injuries as she fought for her life but was overpowered by Tabak and strangled to death.Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, told the jury Tabak then went shopping for beer and crisps – possibly with Yeates's body in the boot of his car – before leaving it on a snowy verge on Longwood Lane. The body was found under a mound of snow on Christmas morning last year.On Tuesday the trial judge, Mr Justice Field, told the jurors that as they travelled around on a coach and walked, various locations would be pointed out to them. "If you don't quite follow what you are being asked to look at or you miss something you may ask for clarification but you must not ask any other questions," he said.William Clegg QC, for Tabak, asked the jury to consider certain areas closely during the visit. Clegg said he wanted jurors to think about the time it would take to walk from a pub called the Hophouse to Yeates's flat at 44 Canynge Road.The prosecution said Yeates was seen on CCTV as she walked home from the Hophouse on 17 December last year, the night she died. They say Yeates would have taken just a few minutes to get home after passing that camera and was attacked within a few minutes of arriving at her flat.The jury has been told that someone attending a party that night at number 53, across the road from number 44, had heard screams as she walked up the path. Clegg, for Tabak, said he would ask the jury to cross the road to number 53 to ask them whether they think it would be possible to hear a scream from that distance."The defence are going to suggest that it was by no means certain that the scream that was heard was connected to this event at all because of the distance involved," said Clegg.The trial continues.
