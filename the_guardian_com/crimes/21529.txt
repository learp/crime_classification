The severed arm of a rapist who served a prison sentence in England has been found in Dublin Bay.Gardaí have confirmed that the arm of a man found on Dollymount beach is that of 46-year-old James Nolan, a sex offender and burglar who has not been seen since he was released from jail in November 2010.After the arm was found on 8 February, a DNA sample was sent to Interpol, and British police identified it as that of Nolan, a native of north Dublin.Nolan's DNA had been held on a database in the UK; there is no such database in Ireland. He was sentenced to 14 years for rape in 1986, then after his release from prison he was jailed again for 18 months in 2009 for burglary. His whereabouts since his release from the Midlands prison in Ireland on 22 November 2010 is not known.His parents have died and his family in Finglas, north Dublin, have not seen him. Gardaí are now trying to establish the circumstances in which he lost his arm and say he may still be alive, although they fear he has been killed.
