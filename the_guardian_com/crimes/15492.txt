David Blunkett, the home secretary, was accused of abusing parliament yesterday after being forced to apologise to the House of Commons for the botched announcement of a review of the law of murder.He was called to the Commons after news of the review, the first for more than 50 years, was announced by the Home Office. Mr Blunkett had been due to make the announcement in yesterday's debate on the domestic violence, crime and victims bill but Conservative filibustering meant his speech never took place. Yesterday, the Tories attacked Mr Blunkett for apparently leaking news to the media, even though he apologised to the Speaker. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said it was the second time this week he had been "dragged to the house to explain himself" and this was unprecedented. Mr Blunkett, said that if his department had been intent on news management it would not have issued the press release until the start of the third reading debate.
