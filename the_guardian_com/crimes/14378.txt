Broadcom Corp's co-founder, Henry Nicholas, was in custody yesterday on charges that he slipped ecstasy into the drinks of technology executives, maintained a warehouse to store cocaine and tried to conceal his illegal conduct with bribes and death threats.In indictments unsealed yesterday, the billionaire was also accused of committing conspiracy, securities fraud and other violations while he led the California-based computer chip company.Nicholas is accused of funding drug parties in an aircraft and homes. Much of that allegedly happened at the same time as an alleged backdating scheme, which forced Broadcom to write down its profits by $2.2bn in January 2007. That is believed to be the largest-ever accounting restatement related to improperly accounting for backdated options.Broadcom's former chief financial officer, William Ruehle, was also named in the backdating indictment and faces conspiracy, securities fraud and other charges. He is not charged with drug violations."It is critical to maintain the transparency of our financial markets, something that these defendants allegedly attempted to manipulate through the scheme, which created a false picture of Broadcom's finances," the US attorney, Thomas O'Brien, said in a statement.The 18-page indictment on drug charges alleges that Nicholas kept four properties in Orange County and Las Vegas, including a warehouse in Laguna Niguel, California, where he stashed and distributed cocaine, methamphetamine and ecstasy.The court documents also claim Nicholas hired prostitutes and escorts for himself, his employees and customers, and conspired to get illegal prescriptions for drugs such as Valium.
