A 72-year-old milkman who supplied cannabis to customers on his rounds to help ease their aches and pains was today given a suspended sentence.Robert Holding, of Burnley in Lancashire, was sentenced at Burnley crown court for supplying and possessing the drug. The court heard that his wife has Alzheimer's disease and has recently moved into a care home, where he visits her every day. He was sentenced to 36 weeks on each count, suspended for a year.Judge Beverley Lunt told him the sentence was "an act of mercy" in the light of his wife's illness. At an earlier hearing, Holding had admitted supplying cannabis resin between April and July 2008, and possessing cannabis with intent to supply on July 17 last year.Sarah Statham, prosecuting, told the court that police uncovered his activities and raided his property when his wife and daughter were at home. During the raid, Holding arrived home in the Transit van he used for his milk round and officers found nearly 167g (6oz) of cannabis split into 15 separate packets in an egg crate in the vehicle.Statham said the smallest amount the packets contained was 3g of the drug and the largest amount was 20g. She said the cannabis had an estimated street value of £450. Statham said that, during the course of an eight-minute police interview, the defendant was "extremely frank"."He said he sold the cannabis to existing customers because they were old and had aches and pains," she said."He said he sold a 9oz [255g] bar about every three weeks and sold it for a relatively cheap value."He said that customers left him notes saying, for example, 'Can I have an ounce this week or can I have an eighth'."Statham revealed that Holding sold an ounce for £30 or one-eighth for £4.10 to 17 customers. She said Holding, a motorcycle enthusiast, said he would never sell the drug to children. The court heard that Holding has been married for 53 years and has six children and 28 grandchildren.
