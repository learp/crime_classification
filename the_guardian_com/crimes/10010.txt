The police watchdog is to carry out an independent inquiry after a man was shot twice with a Taser in Nottingham city centre in an incident filmed by a bystander and posted on the internet.The mobile phone video, which had been viewed more than 35,000 times on YouTube by this afternoon, also shows the 40-year-old being punched in the head during the arrest in the early hours yesterday."Footage of this incident, which many people will now have seen, is of sufficient concern to merit a fully independent investigation," said Amerdeep Somal from the Independent Police Complaints Commission."We would urge anyone who was present and witnessed this incident at any stage, from outside the nightclub to where the man was restrained, to tell us what they saw. We will want to look at any relevant CCTV footage of the incident as a whole as part of our thorough investigation."The video shows four police officers converging on a man outside Nottingham's Theatre Royal in an attempt to arrest him. When he resists, one of them tells the others to stand back and fires a Taser at him as he lies on the pavement.As the man continues to resist arrest, one of the officers punches him in the head repeatedly.Bystanders gather round and a policeman fires the Taser again at the man on the floor, while shouting: "Taser, Taser, Taser."The video was given to local radio station Trent FM and posted on YouTube yesterday. It prompted calls from human rights groups for the IPCC to investigate the incident and review the use of Taser guns by police.Nottinghamshire police said that officers were trying to arrest the man after they were called out by door staff at one of the city's nightspots. He was later charged on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.A police officer was assaulted during the arrest and needed hospital treatment, according to a spokeswoman.She said no complaint had been made against the officers involved, but the force had passed the case voluntarily to the IPCC so it could decide whether to hold an independent investigation.
