Since the body of Stuart Lubbock was discovered in the entertainer Michael Barrymore's swimming pool in March 2001, finding out how he died has become the all-consuming focus of his father's life.Ecstasy and cocaine were found in the 31-year-old's blood, and internal injuries suggested he had been the victim of a sexual assault before his death. But no one has ever been charged over what happened to him, and his father, Terry Lubbock, has complained of being let down by police, insisting someone inflicted the injuries and they should be brought to justice.Barrymore, who has always denied any involvement, was questioned after the incident and in October that year accepted an official caution for drugs offences and allowing his home to be used for smoking cannabis – but no further charges were brought.At the death inquest the following year, the entertainer gave evidence, describing himself as an alcoholic, but refused to answer questions over allegations that he gave Stuart Lubbock cocaine just hours before his body was found. To the disappointment of the Lubbock family, the coroner recorded an open verdict.In 2006 they were blocked from launching a private prosecution against Barrymore on six offences – four related to the misuse of drugs, one alleging drunk and disorderly behaviour and one alleging assault – after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence for a hearing. Terry Lubbock vowed to "carry on" nonetheless.In April 2006 police announced they were reviewing the death as part of "routine" procedure, and in December Essex police began a new inquiry. In June 2007 Barrymore and two other men were arrested and questioned on suspicion of seriously sexually assaulting and murdering Lubbock. They were released without charge. "I'm going to keep fighting for my son," Lubbock said.At the end of the year he received £6,800 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority over his son's death, and said he would use the money to "get justice". Days later he suffered a seizure and spent time in hospital.His campaign continued last year when he staged a protest at the opening night of Barrymore's Edinburgh Fringe show, saying he wanted to raise the profile of his son's death ahead of the Independent Police Complaints Commission's report into the incident – which is released today.But the attorney general refused him permission to appeal to the high court for a new inquest. Now Lubbeck is considering suing the police, saying the report highlights mistakes made by investigating detectives.
