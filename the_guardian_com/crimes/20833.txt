Statement of Duwayne Brooks, read by his counsel, Rajiv Menon. Stephen Lawrence was one of my best friends. We met on our first day of secondary school, the Blackheath Bluecoats Church of England School. Both Stephen and I were 18 when Steve was murdered. We saw each other regularly . . . In the evening, we were hurrying to get home as soon as possible. We were just looking for a bus on Well Hall Road. We were attacked by a group of white boys, one of whom shouted, "What, what, nigger?" I can't bear to go into the details . . . As were we running from the attack, Steve fell to the floor. I stopped on the pavement. I went back and I bent down and looked at him. He was lying by a tree. He was still breathing. He could not speak. I saw his blood running away.  I ran across to the phone box and dialled 999. I asked for an ambulance. I left the phone hanging to run round the corner to see if the boys were coming back up the road. I was pacing up and down, up and down. I was desperate for the ambulance. It was taking too long. I was frightened by the amount of blood Steve was losing.  I saw his life fading away. I didn't know what to do to help him. I was frightened I would do something wrong.  WPC Bethel said, "How did it start?  Did they chase you for nothing?" I said one of them shouted, "What, what, nigger?" She asked me if I had any weapons on me. She was treating me like she was suspicious of me, not like she wanted to help. If she had asked me for more details of the boys' descriptions or what they were wearing, I would have told her. Those would have been sensible questions.  None of the uniformed officers were doing anything for Steve. They should have known what to do. They should have done something for Steve.They just stood there doing nothing.  The ambulance arrived. They carried Steve to the ambulance on a stretcher. His unopened ginger beer can fell from him on to the floor. I picked it up. I took it home and kept it in my room, until one day it exploded. The police were treating me like a criminal and not like a victim. They kept saying, "Are you sure they said, Â‘What, what, nigger?'" I said, "I am telling the truth." A senior officer said, "You mean you have done nothing wrong to provoke them in any way?" I said, "No, we were just waiting for a bus."  On 8th May, I went to a large anti-racist demonstration outside the British National Party headquarters in Welling. I went to protest against Steve's murder and the way the police were handling it. In October 1993, I was arrested and charged with offences arising out of the demonstration. They waited until the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to drop the prosecution against the killers. It was devastating.  It felt like the police and prosecutors decided to get at me to ruin my reputation - and the chance of any future prosecution for the murder. But the judge at Croydon Crown Court wasn't having any of it. In December 1994, he stopped the prosecution, saying it was an abuse of the process of the court.  I think of Steve every day. I'm sad, confused and pissed off about this system where racists attack and go free but innocent victims like Steve and I are treated as criminals and, at the outset, ignored me when I pointed out where the killers had run and refused to believe me that it was a racist attack. I never knew Steve to fight no one. Steve wasn't used to the outside world. He wasn't street-aware of the dangers of being in a racist area at night-time. I shouted to run. He had ample time to run as the boys were on the other side of the road. Steve didn't understand that the group of white boys was dangerous. I was taken to the identification parade.  I now know that the person I picked out was Neil Acourt. On the third identification parade, I now know I identified Luke Knight. Sergeant Crowley [who accompanied him] said something to the effect that I was guessing. I got angry.  I recognised the attackers from the attack and not from any outside information. I did not know how important Sergeant Crowley's lies were until I heard it on the news that the two men who had been arrested had been released and it was to do with my evidence not being good enough.
