A "covert" police surveillance balloon has been scrapped because it could not cope with the wet weather in Manchester.The helium eagle eye blimp – which had "police'' emblazoned across it in 10ft letters – was used to secretly monitor people from the air at large-scale events. It cost the Greater Manchester force £80,000.The balloon was first trialled at last summer's Heaton Park Oasis gigs and during 17 other large outdoor events, including football matches.But it was mothballed after its outer skin repeatedly ripped during rain. A police source said it had become something of a joke. The blimp, which was unmanned, had a camera mounted beneath it that could turn 360 degrees with a one-mile range.The £80,000 cost included camera equipment and the vehicle that transported the balloon and which operated as a studio where five officers viewed footage. It was given a low-key launch by officers who described it as a "covert intelligence tool" despite its colossal size and large police logo.The balloon was expected to carry out a similar role to the force helicopter, India 99, but with the advantage it did not have to return to its base to refuel.Police chiefs admit it has been a huge disappointment. It was beset by "technical problems" and was becoming too expensive to maintain.It has now been sold at a loss, but the force was unable to confirm the precise figure. One officer said: "It has become something of a joke. It just became too expensive to maintain and its operational effectiveness was questionable."Another source said: "The idea was good and it worked well in good weather. It started to encounter problems really in bad weather."The head of Greater Manchester police's specialist operations branch, Chief Superintendent Dave Anthony, said: "We experienced a number of technical and other problems with the blimp and it was decided, especially in the current climate, that it was neither cost effective nor operationally viable to maintain.
