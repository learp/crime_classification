Black people are still six times more likely to be stopped and searched in the street by the police than white people, according to Home Office research published yesterday.Black people continue to be over-represented at every level of the criminal justice system, from being three times more likely to be arrested all the way through to prison where minority ethnic groups make up 24% of the jail population.The figures, which also show Asian people are twice as likely to be stopped as white people, suggest little has changed since the 1999 Stephen Lawrence inquiry into the way minority ethnic groups are policed in England and Wales.Although the number of deaths in police custody rose from 100 to 106 last year, the number of black people dying was 10 in both years.The Home Office researchers say the evidence suggests the imbalance is not simply the result of ethnic minority people committing a disproportionate number of crimes. They say there is not yet sufficiently robust data to reach any conclusions about why this is so.The figures show Asian people are twice as likely to be stopped by the police. But they also appear to face discrimination as victims of crime. Of 59,000 racist incidents recorded by the police, 37,000 were racially aggravated offences, of which one third were cleared up.The number of recorded racist incidents has risen from 10,000 in 1996-97. The Home Office says the sharp increase is due to better recording by police, rather than a rise in the number of incidents.The Home Office said it had met its 2009 targets for minority ethnic recruitment in its key offices in London, and in the immigration, probation and prison service.More than 5% of its senior civil servants are from a minority ethnic background compared with only 1% in 1999. In the immigration service 29% of staff are from a minority ethnic background. The situation however is not so rosy in the police where only 3.5% of officers come from a minority ethnic background. In the prison service minority ethnic staff representation has reached 5.7% against a 7% target by 2009. In the probation service numbers have reached more than 10%.
