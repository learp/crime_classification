The law on murder could be dramatically changed, leading to the end of mandatory life sentences, after a major review was launched by ministers today.The inquiry could recommend that some offences currently treated as murder, such as mercy killings, should be prosecuted as lesser offences. The result could be the end of mandatory life sentences for murder in England and Wales if the definition of what constitutes a murder changes.Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said: "Murder is the most serious crime and it is essential that the law reflects this. "Whilst the government remains committed to retaining the mandatory life sentences and the murder principles set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the review will look at the overall framework of murder to ensure that the government provides coherent and clear offences which protect the public and enable those convicted to be appropriately punished."The review will focus on various elements of murder including the "partial defences" - diminished responsibility and provocation, which reduce a murder charge to manslaughter.Ministers have previously expressed concern over the current law on provocation, particularly when the alleged provocation is due to sexual jealousy or infidelity.In such cases, raising the defence can often mean the victim is blamed and the defendant is able to plead guilty to manslaughter.Under the current rules, judges are forced to give all people convicted of murder a life sentence, regardless of whether they are serial killers or have helped a loved one suffering from terminal illness to die.However, they recommend a minimum term, or "tariff", each offender should serve. Those convicted of mercy killings often receive far lower tariffs than those who have, for example, killed a stranger.Under the new review, mercy killings may be redefined along the American-style system of "Murder One" and "Murder Two", with Murder Two incurring a more lenient sentence - an idea backed by the director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, last May.The inquiry, set to last 18 months, is the first major review of the law on murder for more than 50 years. It will be led by the Home Office, independent of ministers, working closely with the Law Commission.Last August the commission condemned the law on murder as "a mess" and said a major overhaul was required because of "the breadth and depth of discontent" with the current law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - including 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every case of murder was "indefensible and should cease", the commission said. Last month the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, gave his backing to moves which would see the end of the mandatory life sentence for murder. The last review of murder laws was the royal commission on capital punishment from 1949 to 1953, which led to the Homicide Act in 1957.
