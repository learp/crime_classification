Neighbourhood policing services will feel the greatest impact from government funding cuts despite ministers insisting that the frontline will be left unaffected, according to a leading independent expert in police finance.More than 34,000 police jobs are expected to be lost in England and Wales over the next four years as a result of the cut in Whitehall police grants, Dr Timothy Brain, the former Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on finance and the former Gloucestershire chief constable, has confirmed.Brain estimates that 16,000 frontline uniformed officers will be lost to the police service, raising doubts about its capacity to cope with future disturbances on the scale of last week's riots. His authoritative analysis comes as the home secretary, Theresa May, will on Tuesday risk deepening the damaging rift with senior police officers by ruling out any postponement or rethink of either the 20% cut in police budgets or police reform programme as part of the government's "security fightback".May is to detail how by scrapping police paperwork and changing police working methods the budget reductions can be absorbed without reducing the time officers spend on the streets."There is no question the police will still have the resources to do their important work. At the end of this spending review period, the police will still have enough officers to deploy in the kind of numbers we've seen in the last week," said a Home Office spokesman.But Brain's analysis, published as a paper for the Cardiff University police science institute, challenges the claim that the cuts can be largely absorbed by "back office" efficiency savings, with little impact on frontline savings."With as many as 16,000 police officer posts going, there is little prospect of the front line being unaffected. The growth in police officer numbers since 2004-5 has been principally to enable neighbourhood, or community, policing; it is likely that it will be in neighbourhood policing where the greatest impact will be felt. Police services and officers' morale are both likely to suffer," said Brain."Coincidentally, 16,000 officers were also needed to restore order to the streets of London last week. The government has chosen to ignore the riots as a warning that they need to pause and think again on funding cuts. Ministers argue the police will be able to cope by concentrating resources – but you can only concentrate resources in one area by taking them from somewhere else."He says that detailed analysis of police spending announcements by Whitehall and all 43 forces in England and Wales shows that there is to be a £1.2bn cash terms cut in the £13bn police budget by 2014/15. His report also finds that decisions to protect central security funding and private finance initiative projects mean that the greatest impact will be felt on funding to deliver neighbourhood policing and other local police services.Brain's analysis was published as Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who leads Greater Manchester police's (GMP) Shop a Looter campaign, became the latest senior police figure to directly criticise the prime minister's plan to import US police expertise.In a series of tweets Shewan said David Cameron had not visited Manchester to learn his own lessons on gang violence and antisocial behaviour and that Shewan's trips to the US had left him feeling proud about how UK policing was "integrated with communities"."Cameron has not been to GMP to see how we have reduced crime [and antisocial behaviour], tackled gang violence and raised public confidence. He could do worse," he tweeted. A second tweet read: "Been to US twice in last year to look at policing. I have come back feeling proud of where policing is in UK – integrated with communities."
