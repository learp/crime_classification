Turkish authorities have confirmed that a waiter accused of murdering two Northern Ireland women last summer is five years older than he claimed.They said bone tests have clarified that Recip Cetin is around 22 years old and not 17 as he originally told police in Turkey.Cetin stands accused of killing Marion Graham and Kathy Dinsmore near Izmir last August. As a result of establishing his real age Cetin can be tried in an adult court.A lawyer for the women's families said if found guilty Cetin could face life in jail rather than seven to eight years in a juvenile prison.Cetin was the boyfriend of Shannon Graham, Marion Graham's 15-year-old daughter.Marion Graham and Kathy Dinsmore, both in their 50s, were stabbed to death in a wood close to Izmir. The pair from County Down were on holiday in Kusadasi, about 100km from Izmir.Shannon was on a boat trip when the killings happened. She alerted police when she arrived home and could not get in touch with her mother.
