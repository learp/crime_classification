One of the two murderers of soldier Lee Rigby has launched an appeal against his whole-life prison term, the Judicial Office has confirmed.Michael Adebolajo was sentenced at the Old Bailey in February alongside Michael Adebowale, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 45 years.The pair were sentenced by Mr Justice Sweeney for butchering the 25-year-old father of one in broad daylight near Woolwich barracks in south-east London, in May last year.Relatives of Fusilier Rigby said justice had been served after Adebolajo was given the whole-life term, which condemns him to die behind bars.When announcing the sentences, Sweeney told Adebolajo and Adebowale: "You each converted to Islam some years ago. Thereafter you were radicalised and each became an extremist, espousing a cause and views, which, as has been said elsewhere, are a betrayal of Islam and of the peaceful Muslim communities who give so much to our country."He continued: "You decided between you, and in order to advance your extremist cause, to murder a soldier in public in broad daylight and to do so in a way that would generate maximum media coverage, including getting yourselves killed by armed officers who would be bound to attend the scene in the aftermath of the murder â€“ thereby expecting that you would become martyrs and each gain a place in paradise."Adebolajo and Adebowale chose their victim because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top, running him down in a car before hacking at his body with a meat cleaver and knives in an attempt to decapitate him.Explaining his decision to give Adebolajo a whole-life term, the judge said the 29-year-old, who has two children and four stepchildren, was the leader of the murderous plot and had "no real prospect of rehabilitation".However, 22-year-old Adebowale's younger age, mental health problems and "lesser role" meant that he escaped spending the rest of his life behind bars.
