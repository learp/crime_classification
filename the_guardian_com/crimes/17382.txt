A former British heavyweight boxing champion who was shot after asking men at a bar to put out their cigarettes died today, police said.James Oyebola , 47, had been in a critical condition since the early hours of Monday when he asked the men to stop smoking at the Chateau 6 club in Fulham, south-west London. One of the men produced a gun and fired four shots, hitting Mr Oyebola in the face and leg.Last night, Mr Oyebola's solicitor, Scott Ewing, speaking on behalf of the family, said the former boxer was "completely brain-dead" and the decision had been made to turn off his life support system, with the boxer's wife and two children at his side.Mr Oyebola was pronounced dead at 12.39pm today, Scotland Yard said in a brief statement.The father of two, known as Big Bad in his fighting career, arrived at Chateau 6 at about 11pm on Sunday for a drink with the owner, following a shift as a bouncer at a nearby bar.At about 1am he intervened to help staff who had asked three men to stub out their cigarettes in a covered courtyard area, in accordance with the new smoking ban.As the men left the club, one produced a handgun and fired four shots at point-blank range. Mr Oyebola was taken to hospital but never regained consciousness. The men ran off and are being sought by police.Mr Oyebola, from Neasden, north-west London, won the WBC international heavyweight title in 1993 and was British heavyweight champion from 1994 to 1996.
