A former nanny to the stars who left a 10-week-old boy with temporary brain damage and a broken arm was jailed today for three years. Jasmin Schmidt, 34, a qualified paediatric nurse, was told by the judge, Recorder Jeremy Gold QC, that she was "unworthy" of belonging to the nursing profession.Schmidt, of Primrose Hill, north London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey in August of two charges of causing grievous bodily harm to the baby. She had been employed by his parents, who had travelled from Yorkshire to London for fashion week in 2002, to look after him at night. On September 15 2002, the parents found the boy, who cannot be named, to be "limp and pale". Schmidt told them the baby had been restless and "appeared angry" throughout the night, and she had tried to "swaddle him in a blanket but he would not settle". The boy, now six, has since made a full recovery from his injuries. Schmidt went on to work as a nanny for several celebrities, but came under suspicion again when a female pop singer accused her of assaulting her baby daughter. Schmidt was cleared in a trial in January of assaulting the singer's baby and the child of a classical musician while caring for them at night. She denied assaulting any babies.The court was told she had since taken a degree in business studies and had not worked as a nanny for two years.
