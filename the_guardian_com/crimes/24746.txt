The next phase of Steven Gerrard's season will begin in the unlikely surroundings of North Sefton magistrates court tomorrow when the Liverpool player attends the first hearing into the bar brawl that has led to him being charged with affray and assault.While the club's manager, Rafael Benítez, and the rest of the first-team squad will be training in preparation for Sunday's FA Cup fourth-round tie against Everton at Anfield, Gerrard has been excused duty to attend court amid tight security. There is expected to be a strong police presence to deal with the large number of journalists and the possibility of supporters congregating to see the 28-year-old Liverpool captain and England international arriving. Gerrard will be accompanied by his legal team although it is not clear if anyone from the club will also accompany him.Gerrard had been celebrating Liverpool's 5–1 win at Newcastle United on 28 December when the incident allegedly occurred at the Lounge Inn, a popular haunt for Merseyside's footballers, in the seaside town of Southport. Earlier in the day, the midfielder had scored in a victory that put Liverpool three points clear at the top of the league.Marcus McGee, a 34-year-old businessman and part-time DJ who was working at the bar at the time, allegedly lost a tooth in the fight and required hospital treatment after sustaining cuts to his face.Six men were arrested and Gerrard will appear in court with John Doran, 29, and Ian Gerard Smith, 19, both of Huyton, Liverpool, who are accused of assault and affray.
