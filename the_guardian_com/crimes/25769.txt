The prime minister today urges the police to use new access to DNA samples to re-examine thousands of rape and murder cases that have gone cold.Mr Blair will say that 14 police forces have already solved about 100 cases as a result of access to DNA samples. He will suggest their use may increase detection rates by 15% annually.Downing Street said yesterday that since changes introduced by the government in 2001 and 2003, there are a record 3.6m DNA records on the database.Mr Blair's office said: "Advances in DNA technology now mean old crime stains can be re-analysed using new techniques and matched against the profiles on the database - known as 'cold case' reviews. This enables the reopening of cases - not because of new evidence, but because of new DNA forensic techniques. With each advance the probability of obtaining a positive result in a cold case increases."Mr Blair will urge police to go further and faster in using DNA technology, and point out that the retention of samples had been opposed by the Conservatives.Operation Advance, also known as "waking the dead", has achieved 21 convictions, with other suspects awaiting trial or sentence. A second phase of the project will be launched, with Â£691,000 of Home Office funding.Technology being used includes tracing offenders through a relative's sample, and separation of mixed samples. The government says: "The majority of the active criminal population now have their DNA recorded."
