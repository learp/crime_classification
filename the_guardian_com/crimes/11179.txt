Police officers should routinely patrol the streets on their own rather than in pairs to make the public feel safer, the country's most senior police officer said today.Sir Paul Stephenson, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said he was also examining whether police community support officers (PCSOs) might be sent out on their own."What I'm going to tell my officers is to patrol in the right numbers," he told LBC radio. "If we feel that it is necessary to patrol in pairs for officer safety and the maximum effectiveness, then that's what we should do."But the default position should be single patrolling. That happens in parts of London but not enough. What we can't do is patrol in groups all the time because we waste a lot of public resources there."Stephenson's comments follow an inaugural address to 2,000 Met staff at Westminster Central Hall last month, shortly after his formal appointment to the post, in which he said police should be more of a "visible uniformed governance on the street"."If you think back to the 50s, 60s and 70s, there was a whole load of uniform about on the streets â€“ electric man, gas man, a whole load of uniformed governance on the streets that's all gone now," he said today."We have got to maximise that feeling that uniform is governing the streets so people feel safe to walk them."Stephenson said he was considering whether PCSOs, who have considerably less training and fewer powers than full police officers, could be permitted to patrol alone."I'm going to look at it," he said. "It's a question of where we deploy them; we deploy them in areas where their training and experience is best used."Critics of modern policing methods have questioned whether patrolling in pairs has meant fewer officers were visible on the streets, despite an increase of about 40% in national police numbers over the last 30 years.The shadow police minister, David Ruffley, called the move a "simple, commonsense reform", while the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents officers in London, said it did not object in principle."I'm not against single patrolling and I think there is a logical argument for it," the federation's chairman, Peter Smyth, told BBC Radio 4."I think our members will be a bit concerned about the safety aspect of it. I think they feel safer in pairs, particularly on night duty and particularly in some areas, and I think this has to be judged on its merits rather than a blanket policy."Smyth also questioned the notion that police on the beat were routinely visible several decades ago: "It's sort of a Dixon of Dock Green image and, to be frank, I'm not really sure it ever existed. People think it existed but I'm not sure it ever did."In his speech last month, Stephenson told officers he wanted the public "to feel that if there's uniform from the Met, they are there because they want to engage them and make them feel safer".The address did not mark an official directive, a Met spokesman said today."It's not a change of policy so much as a change of direction. There is no specific policy on officers patrolling in pairs and this was really just guidance," he said. "It is really up to local commanders. Officers will still go in pairs in high-risk areas, as will specialists like firearms officers."
