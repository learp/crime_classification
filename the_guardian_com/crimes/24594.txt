Armed police remained in a standoff with a man in north-west London on Saturday night after being told he may be in possession of “dangerous items”.A safety cordon has been put up at a 200-metre radius and 80 people have been evacuated from that area of Northolt as a precaution. Officers were called shortly before 1am on Saturday by reports of a person and hazardous articles at an address on Wood End Lane. Emergency services have not tried to enter the property for safety reasons. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: “At this stage, police believe there is one man inside the address.“While it is not known what the man has inside the property, police are treating seriously reports that the items could be dangerous and that attempts have been made by the man to prevent access to the address. There is no suggestion that this incident is terrorist-related, nor is it linked to any other ongoing investigation or operation.”Armed officers and negotiators are at the scene.
