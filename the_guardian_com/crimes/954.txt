The critically injured British tourist Benjamin Mullany has today been flown back to Britain five days after being shot in the neck by a gunman who murdered his new wife.The 31-year-old physiotherapist is comatose and on a life support machine. A doctor at Antigua's Holberton hospital has described his prognosis as poor.An ambulance arrived at the hospital's intensive care unit shortly before midnight local time. About an hour later, Mullany was wheeled out on a stretcher as consular officers from the British high commission held up sheets to shield him from photographers.Police four-wheel drives escorted the ambulance in a six-car convoy that drove carefully over potholed rural streets to Antigua's airport with sirens blaring and lights flashing.The aircraft was understood to be heading initially to the US state of Delaware for refuelling before continuing to an undisclosed destination in Britain.The Mullanys, who are from Rhos in south Wales, were on the last day of their honeymoon when a gunman broke into their holiday cottage at the Cocos hotel on Antigua's south-west coast. In an apparent botched robbery, the intruder shot Catherine in the head and Benjamin in the neck.Police are yet to charge anybody with the attack, which has shocked the community of 80,000 in the former British colony and prompted the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Spencer Baldwin, to appeal for help from Scotland Yard.A source close to the investigation said detectives had repeatedly questioned a local man who met the couple on a beach and negotiated to take them on a tour of the island for about US$150 (Â£76). The police force's media spokesman played this down but admitted he did not know the status of the inquiry.Mullany's parents, Marilyn and Cynlais, visited their son before he was moved by nurses specialising in long-distance transport. The body of Catherine Mullany is expected to be returned to Britain soon.
