Police divers are searching a lake near Heathrow airport for a car that detectives believe was used to dispose of the body of murdered Milly Dowler.Scotland Yard sent divers to Bedfont lake after police received fresh information that a red Daewoo Nexia possibly used to carry Milly's body had been dumped there.Milly disappeared in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, on her way home from school in March 2002. Her body was found six months later on Yately Heath, Hampshire. The car was taped by CCTV cameras minutes after the 13-year-old disappeared but has never been found despite exhaustive searches of scrapyards, lakes and scrubland.The prime suspect, Levi Bellfield, who was jailed last year for murdering two students, has admitted driving the car but claims he was carrying building materials.Bellfield, 42, was told last year that he would die in prison after he was found guilty of murdering students Marsha McDonnell, 19, and Amelie Delagrange, 22, and the attempted murder of schoolgirl Kate Sheedy, 18. All were attacked near bus stops in south-west London.The former nightclub bouncer and wheel clamper was arrested and interviewed over Milly's death four years ago. Officers believe they have compelling circumstantial evidence that links him to the crime.In August another man was arrested and questioned over the disposal of the car. The Crown Prosecution Service solicitors has received a dossier of evidence from Surrey police and is considering whether to charge Bellfield with murder.
