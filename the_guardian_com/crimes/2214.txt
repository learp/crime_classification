A judge made the rare step of attacking the Crown Prosecution Service today for pursuing a case of attempted murder against a loving mother who helped her seriously ill daughter to die.Stoking the debate over mercy killings, he praised the common sense, decency and humanity of the jury at Lewes crown court, who took just two hours to clear Kay Gilderdale over the death of 31-year-old Lynn.Kay Gilderdale administered a cocktail of lethal drugs to end Lynn's life in ­December 2008 after her daughter called her for help when her own attempts at suicide failed.The jury foreman smiled at Gilderdale today as he announced a unanimous verdict of not guilty, amid applause and weeping in the public gallery.The 55-year-old mother was prosecuted for attempted murder despite admitting a charge of aiding and abetting the suicide of her bedridden daughter, who had suffered a severe form of ME for 17 years.The case is the latest involving the prosecution of different mothers who acted in what they saw as a merciful way to end a child's suffering.But in the case of Frances Inglis last week, an Old Bailey jury convicted her of murder, and the judge, sentencing her to jail, said there was "no concept in law of mercy killing" in this country. A killing was still a killing, he said, "no matter how kind the intention".At Lewes today Mr Justice Bean, the Gilderdale trial judge, openly challenged prosecutors, demanding to know who had made the decision to pursue the case."Are you in a position to tell me why it was thought to be in the public interest to proceed with the prosecution of attempted murder rather than accepting the plea of assisted suicide?" he asked the prosecutor, Sally Howes QC.He said interim guidelines on assisted suicide, drawn up last November by the director of public prosecutions to reassure relatives they would not be prosecuted for helping a loved one die, should have applied in the case.Turning to the jury he said: "I do not normally comment on the verdicts of juries but in this case their decision ... shows that common sense, decency and humanity which makes jury trials so important in a case of this kind."Addressing Gilderdale, who had looked after her daughter 24 hours a day since she was struck by a severe form of ME aged 14, he said: "There is no dispute that you were a caring and loving mother and that you considered that you were acting in the best interests of your daughter."Behind her in the public gallery Gilderdale's ex-husband, Richard, her sister and other family and friends – all of whom support her – listened as the details of Lynn's increasingly wretched existence were explained to the jury.Several members of the jury gathered outside court to see Gilderdale leave arm in arm with Richard and Lynn's brother, Stephen, after the judge handed down a 12-month conditional discharge for her plea of assisting her daughter's suicide. The maximum term for the offence is 14 years in prison.On the court steps, Gilderdale's son praised the jury for their compassion and fairness. "We believe this not-guilty verdict properly reflects the selfless actions my mother took on finding that Lynn had decided to take her own life, to make her daughter's final moments as peaceful and painless as possible," he said."These actions exhibited the same qualities of dedication, love and care that mum unwaveringly demonstrated during the 17 years of Lynn's severe illness."I am very proud of her and I hope she will now be afforded the peace that she deserves to rebuild her life and finally grieve for the death of her daughter." The CPS defended its decision to ­prosecute Gilderdale, of Stonegate, East Sussex, today.Speaking to the Guardian, Simon Clements, head of the special crime division, said the decision was made by his team, who had examined the new guidelines on assisted suicide but decided they did not apply in the case because on the crown's evidence it involved a mother trying to kill her daughter. "The intent was clear, on our evidence," he said."We were in the territory of attempted murder. People are not entitled to take the life of another person, however ­sympathetic one might be of the circumstances, the state of health of the person concerned and all the surrounding circumstances."He added it would be up to parliament to change the law as it stood.Gilderdale was charged with attempted murder rather than murder because ­toxicology tests could not clarify which of the doses had proved to be fatal – the one Miss ­Gilderdale administered to herself in her attempt to take her life – or the ones given by her mother.Detective Superintendent Andy Griffiths, from Sussex police – where Richard Gilderdale was once an officer – said it was a "tragic and desperately sad case"."From the time we were called to the Gilderdales' house, Sussex police attempted to carry out a professional investigation in accordance with the law, but mindful of the tragic circumstances."The moral issues surrounding the tragic circumstances of Lynn's death are not for us to comment on. Sussex Police has a duty to uphold the law and investigate offences reported to us."
