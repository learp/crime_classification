Gordon Brown is to approve the use of evidence gathered by phone-tapping and other intercept evidence in criminal court cases.He will make a statement to MPs today on the findings of an independent privy council review, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, a former permanent secretary, which urges changes in the law to allow intercept evidence to be used.Brown will announce another review, by a civil service committee, to establish how such evidence could be used in practice and ensure safeguards are put in place. Britain is one of the few western countries which does not admit such evidence in court.Opponents of changes include MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, who have argued that it would reveal their sophisticated intercept techniques. The parliamentary intelligence and security committee said last week the agencies were "adamant that their intercept capabilities must not be disclosed in court". The security services are nervous because changes could allow defence lawyers to demand full disclosure, including transcripts, of the whole operation. Some Whitehall officials also fear any change would be vulnerable to challenge in the courts on human rights grounds.The former home secretary, David Blunkett, told Channel 4 News last night he was "very sympathetic" to the idea that intercept evidence should be allowed but there were "very major challenges".He added: "There still are, which is why I think the announcement by the prime minister tomorrow will be of a limited nature." Unless the nature of the intercept was properly recorded, defence lawyers could have a "field day", Blunkett said.But he added: "New methods of communication across the world and locally have changed the nature of way in which tapping takes place."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "This sounds like a breakthrough. We have been calling for this for years. The use of intercept has proved vital to counter-terrorist efforts almost everywhere else in the world."Chris Huhne, for the Liberal Democrats, said: "The use of intercept evidence is overdue and will help to bring many criminals to justice without resorting to desperate measures such as a further extension of the period of detention without charge or trial to 42 days." The move came as Brown and the justice secretary, Jack Straw, continued to face criticism over allegations that a government whip, Sadiq Khan, was bugged when he visited Babar Ahmed, a childhood friend and terror suspect, in prison.Brown's move will be welcomed by civil rights groups, the prosecution service, and the police.The director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, has long argued that intercept evidence shoud be admissible in court proceedings.The director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, has argued that the move would allow people, notably terrorist suspects, accused of wrongdoing to know what intelligence was being held against them.Sir Paul Kennedy, an appeal court judge who monitors communications intercepts, was sceptical.He said in his official report last week: "I am firmly of the opinion that the benefits of any change in the law [on intercept evidence] are heavily outweighed by the disadvantages."The intelligence and security committee said last week: "At its simplest, it is a question of whether using intercept material in court would result in more terrorist convictions than are already achieved through its use to generate leads, and whether these would be sufficient to outweigh the possible reduction in the capability of the agencies to identify the terrorists and disrupt the attacks in the first place."BackstorySir John Chilcot was asked last July to lead an independent review considering whether tapped phone conversations should be allowed as evidence in court. Recordings from free-standing bugs are currently admissible in a criminal trial, as are recordings where one of the speakers is an undercover police officer. Phone-tap evidence gathered abroad is also allowed to be put before a jury, but intercepts of land lines or mobile phones can only be used for intelligence gathering, and are not admissible in court. Civil liberties groups have called for the ban to be lifted, arguing that it offers an alternative to lengthy pre-charge detention, but the intelligence services fear it could expose details of their operations. Some 800 public bodies can currently request personal communications data, including every police force, prison and 474 local authorities, as well as the security and intelligence agencies.
