A multiple murder inquiry was launched yesterday after four family members were found dead in a house in a suburb of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.Police were called to the house in Hawthorn Gardens, Kenton, three miles west of the city centre, at 9am after a tip-off.The victims have not been identified by police but are thought to be a mother in her 30s, her two children - a boy aged about five and a girl of about nine - and the children's grandmother.A 33-year-old relative of the dead woman was arrested yesterday in Gateshead on suspicion of murder.Another property less than a mile away in Rydal Road, Gosforth, was sealed off but armed police and police negotiators were unable to find anyone at the address after the door was smashed down.Neighbours in the suburb of 1930s-style semis where the bodies were found spoke of their shock at the discovery. It is believed the family had lived there for about six years.Elizabeth Cessford, whose garden backs on to the family's home, said they were a lovely family."I used to see them in the garden, which was just full of toys," she said."I used to see the children playing in the garden and they were laughing and enjoying themselves. They just looked like a happy family."It's a really nasty shock," she added, "and I know all the neighbours, even those who didn't know them by name, are very distressed about it."Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, of Northumbria police, said: "I can confirm that this is a murder investigation involving the deaths of what we believe to be four members of the same family - two adults and two children."He appealed for anyone who had heard disturbances at the house from Monday evening until yesterday morning to contact police.
