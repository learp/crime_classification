A post office worker who bludgeoned his wife to death while she slept, then concocted a "pure humbug" story about an armed robbery, has been jailed for life after being convicted of murder.Robin Garbutt, 45, knew his 40-year-old wife Diana had been unfaithful and feared his theft of thousands of pounds from Melsonby village post office was about to be discovered in March last year.A jury at Teesside crown court rejected his story that a raider with a gun told him "don't do anything stupid, we've got your wife" before robbing him as he worked, and that moments later he discovered her body in bed.Garbutt was convicted after the jury had deliberated for almost 13 hours and returned a majority verdict.There was drama as hHis sister collapsed in tears as the verdict was announced. Diana Garbutt's mother, Agnes Gaylor, also wept. Garbutt merely shook his head in response to the verdict.Mr Justice Openshaw sentenced Garbutt to life in prison and told him he would serve a minimum of 20 years."There was no struggle, she never awoke," the judge said. "He struck three savage blows, smashing her skull and causing her immediate death as clearly he intended."Garbutt hid the weapon across the road, then opened the shop as normal. "He feigned cheerfulness as he served customers as he attempted to deceive them that all was well," the judge added.He said Garbutt had told the same "ludicrous story from beginning to end".The judge said the defendant had shown no remorse, adding: "He has always accompanied his lies with sanctimonious lies of his love for her. By their verdict, the jury have exposed this as pure humbug. This was a brutal, planned, cold-blooded murder of his wife as she lay sleeping in bed."Garbutt struck his wife over the head with a metal bar in the living quarters above the Melsonby village shop and post office in North Yorkshire in the early hours of 23 March 2010.He opened the shop as normal and served about 60 customers before closing again. He then dialled 999 and claimed his wife had been attacked, crying hysterically.When a paramedic later told him rigor mortis had already set in, he challenged this, insisting: "She's still warm."He told detectives that a raider had robbed him, and he had gone upstairs to find his wife motionless on the bed.Garbutt's story unravelled after officers looked into the couple's apparently happy marriage. They found the couple owed £30,000 in credit card debts and were making little profit in the shop.They were poised to go on holiday to the US, and Garbutt was thought to have feared a relief postmaster would discover the missing money while they were away.Openshaw said he believed the murder was motivated by Garbutt's fear of being exposed for stealing from the Post Office. It was significant that his wife had been looking at the business accounts on the night she was killed, the judge said.Police also discovered that Diana Garbutt had become involved with three other men.A crucial piece of evidence came from a dinner of fish and chips the couple had eaten on the night before she died. An expert on digestion told the jury Diana Garbutt stopped processing the meal around six to eight hours after she finished eating it – giving a likely time of death in the early hours rather than when Garbutt claimed the robber had struck.Detective superintendent Lewis Raw, who led the inquiry for North Yorkshire police, said: "It is satisfying that we have been able to secure justice for Diana Garbutt and her family in this most tragic and distressing of cases."I hope the murder conviction of her husband Robin Garbutt will provide a measure of comfort and closure, allowing her family to start rebuilding their lives after a very traumatic year."Gaylor said in a statement: "Diana meant the world to us and we are still struggling to come to terms with what happened to her on that awful day. We loved her with all our hearts, our loss is unbearable."
