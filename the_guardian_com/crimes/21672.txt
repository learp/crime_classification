The private Manchester music school at the centre of a sexual abuse inquiry has been accused of misleading parents about the time period covered by the police investigation into the conduct of its teachers by suggesting detectives are only looking into events that occurred two or more decades ago.Head teacher Claire Moreland contacted parents of pupils at the Â£31,000-a-year Chetham's school of music on Monday to claim that the allegations related to events dating back at least 20 years. "Our understanding is that the police investigation relates to a period of 20-40 years ago," she wrote in an email warning parents that the school's former director of music Michael Brewer was due to be sentenced for sexually abusing a pupil.However, the Guardian understands that officers from the public protection division at Greater Manchester police are looking into allegations of sexual abuse and impropriety at the school as recently as 2006.A source close to the police inquiry said detectives had asked the school for information about one particular incident alleged to have taken place within the past seven years. They are also looking into a serious sexual allegation dating back to the early 2000s made against Wen Zhou Li, a violin tutor who has taught at Chetham's since at least 1996.Li was arrested last month on suspicion of rape and has been suspended from the school pending the police investigation. He denies the charges against him and is currently on police bail.The email has angered some parents at Chetham's. One told the Guardian: "I know for a fact that the police are investigating an official complaint made by a student at the school about alleged instances of physical and psychological abuse in the last few years. I have also been told by the police that they have been approached by a number of current parents with concerns about pastoral care and management at the school."When the Guardian asked the school about Moreland's email, a spokeswoman said the school had been told not to comment while the investigation was ongoing. "As far as we are aware, the allegations of sexual abuse at the school being investigated by the police are historic, the latest being those in respect of Wen Zhou Li in the mid 1990s," she said.
