Patricia Powers knows all about the rising cost of business crime: her firm has been attacked, robbed and vandalised twice in the past 12 months. "Yes, I thought about giving up," she said. "It's very hard to explain how low you feel when you walk into your office and find it completely flattened. "Even the police could not believe how much damage had been done." Ms Powers runs Chauffeur Express, an executive taxi firm which employs nine staff, from a small trading estate in Solihull. She would like to relocate to a more salubrious area but says the rents are prohibitive. Robbers came through the roof of the building in the first attack. They removed all the computers, ripped up the floor tiles while looking for a safe, and smashed chairs and tables. The insurance company told her not to install new computers for two months in case of a return visit. She left it for six months but a few weeks after that the robbers returned. "I could not afford to hire a professional cleaner so had to clean up the mess myself. It's been terrible. "I just hope the government starts to take this issue seriously." The damage to Chauffeur Express and neighbouring firms has forced the landlord to install closed-circuit television. Now Ms Powers is paying the price of that in higher rents.
