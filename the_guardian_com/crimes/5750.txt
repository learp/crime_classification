A judge's decision to award bail to a police inspector accused of murdering his wife and subsequently believed to have killed his mother-in-law before taking his own life was "properly conducted", a coroner said today.Judge John Bevan QC was criticised after it emerged that he had released Inspector Garry Weddell on bail of £200,000 despite the objections of prosecutors.The shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, and the Conservative MP for Hemel Hempstead, Mike Penning, called for an inquiry.The prime minister, Gordon Brown, said the case raised questions over why Weddell was freed. He promised to change the law if necessary.Opening the inquest into the death of Weddell, 47, David Morris, the coroner for Luton and Bedford, said senior judges who had reviewed a transcript of the bail hearing had made "no criticism" of their colleague.Weddell's wife, Sandra, 44, was found strangled at their family home in Lancot Avenue, Dunstable, in January last year.Weddell was arrested and charged with murder but released on bail.His body was found at a Hertfordshire shooting club on January 12. Morris said Weddell had died from a shotgun blast to the head.Weddell's mother-in-law, Traute Maxfield, 70, who was found dead at her home 10 miles away at around the same time, with shotgun wounds to the groin and neck.Court transcripts containing discussions on the decision to release Weddell from custody will be published on Thursday."It was appropriate that the bail transcripts have been studied by very senior high court judges and considered that they were properly conducted and no criticism of the judge is appropriate," said Morris.He said the police investigation into the Hertfordshire deaths on January 12 was "virtually complete".Morris adjourned the hearing and said a full inquest into the three deaths would be held on March 18 in Dunstable.Earlier it had emerged that Weddell's barrister brother, Geoffrey, who had put up the bail, may be ordered to pay the £200,000 surety.At a hearing at Cambridge crown court, Justice Calvert-Smith said he would await a report from the Crown Prosecution Service before deciding whether to summon Geoffrey Weddell.Outside court today, the CPS said it would be "raising concerns" about the bail issue in its report to the judge."It is now a matter for the judge to decide," said Richard Newcombe, chief crown prosecutor for Bedfordshire.Calvert-Smith today formally closed the murder case file on Weddell.
