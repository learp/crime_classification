A chief constable said yesterday that a television documentary that exposed racism among police recruits was now being used to train young officers. The programme, The Secret Policeman, caused uproar when it was shown on BBC1 last October. It was made by an undercover reporter, Mark Daly, at a training centre in Cheshire, and featured officers from the Cheshire, North Wales and Greater Manchester forces. Two Cheshire officers have since resigned, and a third has been suspended. Five recruits from the other forces also resigned. "We were frustrated that [those filmed] could not be sacked and that the Crown Prosecution Service could not take action," said Peter Fahy, chief constable of Cheshire. He hoped use of the programme in revamped training sessions would help to root out racist attitudes. "We have used excerpts from the film in our training of new recruits," he said. "It gives us an opportunity to talk about the issues openly. There was a climate of fear in the aftermath of the programme, with people frightened of saying anything in case it could be construed as racist." Mr Fahy was speaking after a meeting of his police authority which discussed a report considering changes to recruitment systems and arrangements for monitoring diversity.
