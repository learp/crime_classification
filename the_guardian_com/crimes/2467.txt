Lawyers for customs and excise have launched a fresh attempt to force the father of one of the Stephen Lawrence suspects to sell his home to pay more than £300,000 that he made from drug dealing.The agency is determined to recover the sum even if means that Clifford Norris, whose son David was one of the five prime suspects for the stabbing, has to leave his £75,000 house in Chislehurst, Kent. Norris was released from jail last year after serving two-thirds of a nine-year sentence for conspiracy to import cannabis and weapons offences. At his 1995 trial, the judge ordered Norris should pay £386,397, by calculating the profits he had made from criminality. But a loophole meant that he walked free without having paid the money. Customs has spent the past six years attempting to recover the cash but Norris, 43, seemed to have defied them last year when his wife appealed against the confiscation of the house. The House of Lords has referred the case back to the high court to determine the interest Mrs Norris has in the house. The agency reasons that house has vastly increased in value and he should be able to pay back the whole of the debt. A hearing was scheduled for tomorrow, but has been postponed.
