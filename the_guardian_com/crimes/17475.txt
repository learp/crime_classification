A man captured on CCTV walking ahead of French student Amélie Delagrange minutes before she was bludgeoned to death on Twickenham Green, south-west London, could have crucial information about her killer.Detectives said the man was not a suspect. He is white, with short, dark hair, and was wearing jeans, a white shirt, with a dark cardigan draped over his shoulders. He may have been carrying a beer can. "He was walking ahead of Amélie, about a minute away from Twickenham Green," said Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Murphy, adding that he may have been unaware that she was behind him. Amélie was struck from behind with a blunt instrument as she cut across the green at 10pm on August 19. Police arrested a 22-year-old man in Whitechapel on Saturday in connection with the murder. He is being held under the Mental Health Act.
