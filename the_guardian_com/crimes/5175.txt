Anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) have become a common, if controversial, means of curbing the activities of young tearaways and others deemed public nuisances. But care provider Anchor Trust is threatening to seek one against relatives of an 88-year-old woman who lives at one of its residential homes.Through its solicitors, Devonshires, Anchor has written to a daughter of the resident, the daughter's husband and their own adult daughter, warning them that an Asbo will be sought if they do not desist from "abusive language, threats of violence and harassment of members of staff" at the Kirkley Lodge home, near Middlesbrough. They would be barred from the premises.The family denies the accusations and says it has only been seeking the best standards of care. It admits that the resident's daughter, an auxiliary nurse, did once lose her temper, but says this was after her mother suffered a repeat fall and broke her hip.The case, thought to be the first of its kind, throws a spotlight on the uncodified and often overlooked area of dealings between care providers and the relatives and friends of those cared for. Chris Ardill, advice line manager of the Relatives and Residents Association, which helps older people in care homes and their families, says tension may arise over expectations of what will be provided.In one instance, a woman had contacted the association after visiting her mother on her second day in a care home and noticing that her tea cup was stained. Instead of asking for a clean one, the woman had gone out and bought a set of 24 cups, one for each of the home's residents."That kind of thing just rubs the home's manager or matron up the wrong way and gets things off to a dodgy start, from which they never recover," says Ardill, though he thinks Anchor's action looks heavy-handed.Sheila Scott, chief executive of the National Care Homes Association, says the care sector will be watching the Anchor case with interest. "A breakdown of relations to this extent is very unusual, but from time to time a family can be so disruptive that it is distressing for the resident and all the other residents too."
