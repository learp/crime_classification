Two men who allegedly demanded Â£50,000 from a member of the royal family over gay sex allegations were engaged in "classic blackmail", a court heard today.Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan tried to extort the money from the royal after failing to sell "potentially damaging" video recordings to newspapers, jurors were told.The pair claimed the material included footage of drug-taking and "disparaging remarks" about the married royal, known as witness A, said Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting.The comments were made by a royal employee, known as witness D, who also claimed that A had performed a sex act on him, Ellison said.Strachan, 31, of Fulham, south-west London, and McGuigan, 41, of Battersea, south London, both deny demanding money with menaces.The pair were arrested at the Park Lane Hilton hotel in September last year after meeting an undercover police officer posing as a royal aide.In his closing speech to jurors at the Old Bailey today, Ellison dismissed Strachan's claim that he had not asked for money for the material. He said Strachan's defence that he was trying to expose the wrongdoing of D and "ingratiate himself" with A, was false."A demand with menaces can be made in many different ways other than by writing a note saying 'I hereby demand X, or else'," said Ellison. "We have, if one stands back, a pretty clear, pretty classic example of blackmail."Whatever they might say about their reasons for doing so, the defendants together gathered hours and hours of recordings of D, who was often intoxicated, much of which featured, without any doubt, salacious and potentially damaging allegations about A, his business, his personal life, and his relatives in the royal family, as well as film of D apparently snorting cocaine, and one or two snippets referring to sexual conduct."The trial continues.
