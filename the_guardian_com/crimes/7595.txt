Oyster cards, the electronic season tickets designed to reduce bus queues and cut the cost of travel in London, are being used by the Metropolitan police to track criminals, new figures reveal.Statistics obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show police are increasingly using the electronic travel records to trace people on the capital's bus, Tube and train networks. Although the Met made only seven requests in 2004 for Oyster card information, 61 were made in January this year alone. Overall, police have requested journey information 243 times, and been given it on 229 occasions.A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police said yesterday that requests to access Oyster data were a "straightforward investigative tool", and officers decided on a "case by case" basis whether to request it.
