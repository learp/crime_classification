Michael Howard today launched a pre-election five-point plan to tackle Britain's "yob culture" and said he wanted police to have the confidence to "eyeball" young offenders.The Conservative leader promised more police on the streets, a crackdown on police paperwork, the publication of weekly crime statistics, an end to government targets for police forces, and the introduction of elected police commissioners.Speaking at the party's campaign headquarters in London, Mr Howard said: "Decent, hardworking families are regularly intimidated by yobs on their streets and in their town centres."It makes me sick that people have to put up with this kind of nonsense. I've lost count of the times hardworking families have told me there's no point complaining because nothing ever seems to happen."In today's Britain, no one seems prepared to take a stand - to hold these arrogant young yobs to account for their appalling behaviour. This is making the everyday quality of people's lives worse in very real ways."Mr Howard accused the prime minister, Tony Blair, of having "lost the plot" on crime, adding: "Instead of yobs being afraid of the police, ordinary folk are afraid of yobs. I don't want members of the public looking over their shoulders - I want the yobs looking round in fear."Instead of greeting the police with contempt, I want them to fear them. I want policemen and women to have the confidence to eyeball these characters ... to confront and challenge their unacceptable behaviour.Mr Howard was highlighting Conservative proposals to recruit 5,000 more police every year and introduce elected police commissioners to give local people the power to decide how their communities were policed.He refused, however, to condemn the six-month sentence handed down to the teacher Linda Walker for brandishing an airgun at youths who had been terrorising her family. He also declined to support the suggestion that the police should be allowed to give troublemakers a "clip round the ear", saying: "No, I wouldn't support that. That's going too far. I think you can do the job without doing that."Responding to the Tory plans, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, said: "Mr Howard can have no credibility on crime when he cut police numbers when home secretary and is now committed to Â£35bn of cuts to public spending."When Michael Howard was in government, the Tories promised to increase police numbers, but while he was home secretary officer numbers actually fell by 1,132."
