Tributes have been paid to a mother and daughter whose deaths are being treated as a double murder.The victims, named locally as school meals assistant Liz Edwards and her 13-year-old daughter Katie, were found dead in Spalding, Lincolnshire on Friday.Lincolnshire detectives said two people had been arrested in connection with the inquiry, and appealed for sightings of suspicious activity near the victims’ home. The victims are reported to have been found stabbed.One woman living close to Edwards’s semi-detached property in Spalding said she last saw her on Tuesday.The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: “She was a lovely lady, very friendly and I knew her quite well. She was quite well-known because she worked at a primary school and what has happened is just unbelievable. Katie was lovely too but very quiet.”Several bunches of flowers and a teddy bear had been placed on the front lawn of the house by friends of the family, as forensic scientists continued to examine the inside of the house.In a statement, Supt Paul Timmins said the deaths had understandably generated a great deal of local concern and upset.He added: “I would like to make clear that this type of crime is extremely rare. Indeed, we believe this is a completely isolated incident.“There is still a lot of police activity in the area and extra officers in the neighbourhood and I would encourage anyone who has any concerns to please talk to our officers.“This is very much an active investigation that is in its early stages and police would like people not to speculate as to the circumstances surrounding it. We are looking at a number of lines of inquiry and doing our utmost to get to the bottom of what has happened.”DCI Martin Holvey, who is leading the investigation, said: “I would like to hear from anyone in the area of Dawson Avenue from Wednesday at 12pm to the same time on Friday and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious or that they think may be relevant to the inquiry.”Anyone with information to assist the inquiry is urged to contact police directly on 101 or pass information anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
