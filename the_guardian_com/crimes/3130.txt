Police have shot dead a man in north London after he made “threats to kill”, Scotland Yard has said. The man, described as white and in his 40s, was killed by police outside an address in Cedar Road, Enfield, at 11.50pm on Sunday. He was pronounced dead at the scene and officers later retrieved a “non-police” firearm from the address, the Metropolitan police said in a statement. No one else was injured and no arrests were made. The shooting will be referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation. Earlier in the evening, police had been called to an address in Barnet, north London, after reports that a man had a gun and was making death threats. When they arrived just after 9.30pm, the man had left the property. Officers then went to the house in Enfield, where the man was shot.A police spokesman said: “The Directorate of Professional Standards is in attendance at the scene. As a matter of routine, the incident has been referred to the IPCC for investigation.”It is the first fatal shooting by British police this year. In September 2014 a man was killed by police in Islington after threatening a woman with a knife. That was the first shooting in the capital since the killing of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, which sparked the 2011 riots.
