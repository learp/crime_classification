Detectives investigating the murder of Milly Dowler were yesterday searching for footage from motorway cameras which could show the killer.The person who abducted the 13-year-old from near her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, may have used the M3 to get to the spot in Yateley Heath Forest in Hampshire, where her remains were found. A team of officers will spend the next few days trying to find any surviving footage of the motorway from the time of Milly's disappearance on March 21. More than 100 officers from Surrey and Hampshire are now working on the inquiry. They have been carrying out house to house inquiries in the area around the forest and are talking to military personnel based at the several barracks in the area. They are also sifting through information provided in more than 400 calls from members of the public. The detailed search of the area where Milly's body was discovered by mushroom hunters last Wednesday has continued. Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Denholm, who is leading the murder hunt, said: "The search is a painstaking process. The vital clue could well be in this area and we are determined to be as thorough as possible to find that lead. "I anticipate this search to continue for some time, potentially going into days, possibly weeks." The body was dumped in the woods just 40 metres off a bridleway. The murderer may have parked in a country lane layby, walked 70 metres along the bridleway, before turning right into the woods and leaving the body among silver birch trees and deep undergrowth. Six victim recovery dogs are searching the area. Once the dogs' work is complete, a fingertip search by officers will be carried out. Among those helping are a forensic archaeologist and a vegetation and soil expert. But so far none of Milly's possessions or clothes have been found.
