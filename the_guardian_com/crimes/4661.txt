Home Office minister Paul Goggins has warned prison officers they must sign a new workplace protocol despite threats of strikes this summer.He told the Prison Officers' Association's (POA) annual conference yesterday that agreement was a condition of a strike ban introduced by the Conservative government being lifted.Last year's conference was told by the home secretary, David Blunkett, that the ban, which was introduced under section 127 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, would be lifted once the joint industrial relations protocol agreement (JIRPA) had been signed.Mr Goggins said: "I am confident, therefore, that we are now in a position to ensure the final removal of section 127 by November of this year. Your backing for this new agreement will remove the one remaining obstacle to the disapplication of section 127."The POA's national executive has recommended its membership should accept the new agreement, but its general secretary, Brian Caton, said the prison officers could well vote it down unless relations between management and prison officers improved. Mr Caton said the POA would be organising a workplace ballot of its members as soon as it could, possibly within two weeks.He also said the union wanted restoration of its right to strike, and that industrial action could take place if relations did not improve in the service. He said: "JIRPA is really no different to its predecessor. It is a no strike deal. There is no reason as far as we are concerned that we should not be treated the same as any other public service. We want the ability to take industrial action where we have intransigence from employers."We don't want, unlike some members of the prison board, industrial anarchy, but if they continue the way they are treating our officials...we will respond - if we keep getting intimidated."A Home Office spokesman said: "The importance of good industrial relations should not be underestimated. We need the protection of a joint industrial relations agreement to get this through parliament."The prison and probation services will be merged into the New Offender Management Service on June 1.
