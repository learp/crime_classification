Inappropriate or bogus 999 calls received by ambulance service operators range from the bizarre to the menacing. Recorded examples include:· an elderly West Country woman who dialled 999 because her TV remote control was out of reach · a 31-year-old who called because she had sniffed deodorant by accident · a 22-year-old woman who had a blackhead which would not stop bleeding after she had squeezed it · a south London man wanting to know how much it would cost for an ambulance to take him to a private hospital · a Surrey woman who dialled for an ambulance because she had shampoo in her eyes · a model who called Gloucestershire Ambulance Service when she broke her fingernail · a man from Suffolk who summoned an ambulance crew to remove a dead rat, which he said was smelling, from his loft · a pensioner who told a 999 crew to wait 40 minutes before taking her to hospital because she was baking a cake. Paramedics gave her a warning and left - only for the woman to ring again exactly 40 minutes later. She told a second crew that her cake had "risen nicely" and she was ready to go to hospital · other callers have demanded advice from the emergency service on managing a sick pet, booking a taxi and removing glue from their fingers, tips on how to alleviate a hangover, a cold, and even help with a crossword · in Bristol, an ambulance crew was pelted with stones by a gang of youths when they responded to a fake call about a boy who had fallen down stairs.
