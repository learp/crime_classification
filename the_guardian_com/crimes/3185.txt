An animal rights activist was jailed for 10 years after being found guilty today of planting homemade petrol bombs at Oxford University.Mel Broughton, 49, put the devices under a portable cabin at Templeton College and on the roof of a cricket pavilion at Queen's College.The pavilion device caused damage put at Â£14,000, but two other bombs failed to go off. Broughton, who spearheaded animal welfare group Speak, was protesting against the building of an animal testing laboratory at Oxford.Judge Patrick Eccles QC sentenced Broughton, of Northampton, to 10 years in jail after the jury found him guilty of conspiracy to commit arson following a four-week retrial at Oxford crown court. Broughton was originally convicted of the offences by a jury in February 2009, and successfully appealed against his conviction in February this year.The Court of Appeal then ordered a retrial. The two and a half years Broughton has already spent in custody will be deducted from his sentence.
