A rapist was given an indeterminate jail term today after he was caught when a routine DNA test linked him to a sex attack nearly 14 years ago.A judge said unemployed Kevin Stephen still posed a real threat to women despite the length of time since he committed the offence.When police stop-checked Stephen in Brighton in August last year they found he was wanted for failing to appear in court over a road traffic offence.Stephen, 43, was arrested and a DNA swab from him matched the unsolved rape of a 21-year-old student in Brighton more than a decade ago.Stephen, also known as Kimberley Stephen and Kevin Jennings, of Franklin Road, Brighton, pleaded guilty at Lewes crown court in February to rape, kidnap and indecent assault.
