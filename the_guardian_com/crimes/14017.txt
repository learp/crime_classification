Gardai believe that the murder of a 65-year-old mother of five in the Dublin suburb of Tallaght yesterday may have been a case of mistaken identity.Joan Casey was at home with her husband and brother when two masked gunmen burst in shortly after 6am. The gunmen ran upstairs and shot her through a bedroom door. Mrs Casey, who had been roused by the noise of the break-in, died shortly afterwards. Gardai are puzzled over the motive for the killing. Mrs Casey had lived in the quiet residential estate of Avonbeg Park for more than 30 years and was well liked. She was known for her work with charities and her parish church. She had spent Friday night out in the area collecting subscriptions to a church lottery. One Garda source said: 'We just don't know why she was shot. The victim was well respected; the family was good-living.' The state pathologist, Dr Marie Cassidy, was called to carry out a post-mortem examination.
