Detectives hunting for the killer who expertly sliced a skydiver's parachutes, sending him on a 4,000-metre (13,000ft) plunge to his death, are questioning a man arrested early yesterday in Leeds.The unnamed 24-year-old was held overnight at Scunthorpe police station, close to the airstrip at Hibaldstow where army cadet Stephen Hilder was taking part in free-fall manoeuvres in the final round of a national skydiving competition on July 4. Humberside police made the move two weeks after interviewing members of Leeds University skydiving club who regularly use the airfield, and were there during a collegiate week when Mr Hilder's team also took part. A spokeswoman could not confirm that the man arrested was a member of the club, but said that he had been detained on suspicion of murdering Hilder, who was 20, and in connection with a separate offence of criminal damage. Two close friends of Hilder's at the Royal Military College of Science at Shrivenham, Wiltshire, were arrested on suspicion of murder last month. Adrian Blair, 19, who was a pallbearer at Hilder's funeral, and David Mason, also 19, were released after two days of questioning and are now on bail. Inquiries into the tragedy have seen rumours about "nasty" rivalries over young female cadets at Shrivenham, as well as interviews with skydivers who were at a fancy dress party at Hibaldstow shortly before Hilder's death. The sabotage of the cadet's reserve as well as main parachute was done by someone knowledgeable, according to police, who have focused for almost five months on the British skydiving community. Only 78 skydivers were at Hibaldstow over the weekend when Hilder died and the killer appears to have been familiar with the base's collection of buildings. Officers from the inquiry, led by Detective Superintendent Colin Andrews, have informed Hilder's parents at their home in Hereford of the latest arrest.
