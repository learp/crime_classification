A former burger bar worker who became the "Mr Fixit" of a "worldwide conspiracy" to kill non-Muslims was sentenced to 12 years in prison today.Aabid Khan, who spent years building up a computer store of extremist material, became a "key player" in radicalising others, a London court heard.Those influenced by Khan, known as Del Boy to his contacts, included schoolboy Hammad Munshi, who became Britain's youngest convicted terrorist yesterday. After a three-month trial at London's Blackfriars crown court, Khan, 23, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was found guilty of three counts of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism. His cousin and right-hand man, Sultan Muhammad, 23, also of Bradford, was convicted of three possession charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. He was jailed for 10 years.Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Pontius said the material seized by police was among the "largest and most extensive ever discovered, providing vast precise information and instruction as to how to carry out terrorist activity".The material included computer files and manuals about acetone - a component of explosives - plus details of how to make napalm and various "instructional videos".The judge said the most chilling find was a "folder demonstrating in careful, methodical and lethal detail the step by step instructions of how to make a suicide bombers' vest or belt packed with ball bearings and explosives". He said Muhammad, too, had downloaded a "vast amount of material". That had "established very clearly" the goal he and his co-defendant "plainly shared"."The radicalisation arose from a warped view of Islam and, in your case, Aabid Khan, was fuelled by further contact with extremist groups in Pakistan for whom you were an all too willing recruiting sergeant."At this stage, Khan's father, Sabir, began shouting: "Have you any proof of that?"As security officers were ordered to remove him from court, he yelled: "It's all hype. This is anti-Muslim. These are anti-Muslim terror laws."Outside the court, he punched a reporter to the ground who asked him his name and was briefly held by a police officer before being ordered to leave the building.Khan recruited Munshi when he was 15, serving as his mentor, the trial heard.The 23-year-old had links to prohibited terrorist groups and ran an "online extremist support network" through which he hoped to recruit "a group of at least 12".He enrolled Munshi to take part in his "mission in life" - the destruction of western values and the wiping out of all kuffar, or non-believers.The jury was told Khan was detained when he returned from Pakistan in June 2006.A routine search of his luggage at Manchester airport uncovered the largest library of computer files promoting terrorism to have been seized by police.Video footage in the suitcase suggested he had visited the Balakot mountains, the site of a Jaishe Mohammed terrorist training camp.Anti-terror officers also found handbooks on explosives and poisons, information about transport systems in the UK and US and guidelines for "beating and killing hostages" and planning assassinations.They found personal details and addresses of members of the royal family, including the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York.Khan led police to Munshi, whose grandfather Sheikh Yakub Munshi, is a respected Islamic scholar and president of the Islamic Research Institute of Great Britain at the Markazi mosque, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.In Munshi, he saw the ideal recruit, someone desperate to go abroad and fight. Khan, described by the Crown Prosecution Service as a "Mr Fixit of the terror world", was in an ideal position to help.Munshi, of Dewsbury, was aged 16 when he was arrested on his way home from school, where he was studying for his GCSEs.He had two bags of ballbearings â€“ a form of shrapnel commonly used in suicide bombings - in his pockets, and notes about martyrdom under his bed.Leading a double life as an obedient pupil by day and a surfer of jihadist websites at night, he downloaded detailed instructions about making napalm and other high explosives.In one exchange with Munshi, Khan wrote: "What I want to do is cause trouble for the kuffar with hit and runs everywhere, cause fear and panic in their countries, make them nervous so they make mistakes."He and Munshi swapped documents about "black powder explosives". During an online chat, they discussed ways to smuggle a sword through airport security.Munshi, now 18, was found guilty of one count of possessing or making documents promoting terrorism. He will be sentenced next month.
