A key member of the gang who has so far escaped capture for his role in the £14m Hatton Garden heist is a former policeman, according to one of those awaiting sentencing for the biggest burglary in English history.The thief known as Basil was the brains behind the raid in London’s jewellery quarter over Easter last year, according to Danny Jones, 6o, from north London, in a letter to Sky News.In excerpts from the letter published by Sky, Jones said: “I can say that someone told me he [Basil] was an ex-policeman who got into security by the guy who introduced him to me.“He said Basil heard about me from a close friend on the police force, as I was arrested for a similar raid in Bond Street in 2010.”Hatton Garden heist: how an old-school working-class criminal's swan song came together Jones, who has admitted his role in the raid, sent a letter from Belmarsh prison, which said: “Basil was the brains, as I was recruited by him. He let me in on the night of the burglary, he hid keys and codes throughout the building.”Claiming he did not know Basil’s identity, Jones, who has contacted Sky before, said he would not reveal it in any case as “it’s not a done thing where I come from”.The Metropolitan police would not comment on the contents of the letter, which have not been independently verified. But they were expected to issue a new appeal for help in connection with the raid on BBC’s Crimewatch on Tuesday night. They have previously sought help in identifying Basil, who was caught on camera sporting a wig of red hair. About £9m taken in the raid has still not been recovered.Nine people have so far been convicted or pleaded guilty in connection with the raid.In January three men were found guilty of being involved in the raid. Carl Wood, 58, and William Lincoln, 60, were convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property, while Hugh Doyle, 48, was found guilty of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property between 1 January and 19 May last year.They were members of the gang, including five others, who ransacked 73 boxes at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in central London after using a drill to bore a hole into the vault wall.Ringleaders John “Kenny” Collins, 75, Terry Perkins, 67, Jones and the group’s oldest member, Brian Reader, 76, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary in September.Collins, Jones, Perkins and Reader have been in custody since their arrests.They are due to be sentenced along with Wood, Lincoln and Doyle on 7 March.
