A horse rider who worked for the Queen's trainer has been jailed for four years after attacking an ex-jockey in a jealous rage, leaving him looking like "the victim of a road traffic accident".Jonathan Nolan, 32, a work rider for the royal trainer Sir Michael Stoute, battered John Maxse after confronting him in Newmarket, Suffolk. Ipswich crown court heard Nolan objected to the friendship between his ex-girlfriend, Genevieve Hippisley, 26, and Maxse, 45, now a public relations director.When police arrived Nolan was so covered in Maxse's blood that officers thought he had himself been the victim of a serious assault. Nolan admitted grievous bodily harm with intent.Passing sentence, the judge Rupert Overbury told him: "You carried out a vicious, sustained and unprovoked attack. Simply by using your hands and feet you left Mr Maxse looking like the victim of a road traffic accident." Maxse suffered a broken nose, fractured eye socket and fractured cheekbone.Richard Kelly, prosecuting, said Nolan and Hippisley, who have a three-year-old daughter, had broken up after a long relationship and Nolan was unhappy about her friendship with Maxse.On the day of the attack, she sent Nolan a text saying: "I have tried not to hurt you but you and me are over now."

Kelly said: "He strode past Miss Hippisley and said something like 'how could you or how dare you' before repeatedly punching Mr Maxse."He continued to punch him in the face with Mr Maxse putting up an arm to protect himself."Kelly said that 1.67-metre-tall (5ft 6in) Maxse stood little chance against Nolan, at 1.85 metres (6ft 1in) and athletically built.Nolan kicked him several times as he lay on the floor, then chased him outside where he continued the attack.Charles Myatt, mitigating, presented character references to the court, including one from Stoute's head trainer Tony Crombie.Myatt said: "Extreme emotions turned this otherwise placid, kind and non-violent man into somebody governed by a blind emotional rage."There is genuine and deep remorse born out of a genuine feeling that Mr Maxse did not deserve in any shape or form to be the victim of this attack."Maxse, a former public relations director at the Jockey Club and the British Horseracing Authority, was photographed with a black eye and cuts and bruises to his face.The former jockey, who works as a communications consultant for Qatar Racing and is a work rider for Michael Bell, has said he was left looking like the film character Rocky Balboa.Nolan, who worked at Stoute's Freemason Lodge stables, used to ride the Queen's horse Carlton House when it was trained there. A work rider's normal duties include mucking out, exercising, grooming and feeding the horses.
