An inquest jury was yesterday shown prison security camera footage which appeared to record a visitor passing a package - thought to contain drugs - to his brother, an inmate at Full Sutton maximum security jail near York.The prisoner, Arif Hussain, 32, from Middlesbrough, collapsed and died in his cell a week later in March last year. A postmortem revealed an empty plastic wrapper in his stomach containing traces of heroin. There were also traces of cannabis in his rectum. Professor Alexander Forrest, a forensic toxicologist, told the jury in Hull that it was likely Hussain had "plugged" the package (inserted it into his rectum) during the visit and removed and swallowed it when placed in the segregation unit after the visit. "It is likely that the wrap was leaking for a few days and that there [was] then a sudden terminal increase," he said. "If, six hours before his death, he had been in a hospital he would have been more likely to survive." Hussain was serving six years for robbery. He had a history of heroin use and of psychiatric illness. On the day of the visit he and his brother, Liaquat, who has since died, were targeted by officers on the lookout for drugs and given a table where they could be monitored by cameras in the visiting room. In edited footage, the jury saw Liaquat reach into his trousers, lean over to Hussain and put something in his hand. Mr Hussain put his hand to his mouth, grimaced and took a long drink. Later he was seen to put his hand to his mouth, take something out and transfer it to his buttocks. But the jury heard that the manoeuvre had not been seen by James Fowler, the prison officer monitoring the cameras. "I missed the pass," he said. The hearing continues.
