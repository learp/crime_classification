A nationwide hunt for two girls allegedly abducted from their foster parents at knifepoint has ended after they were found safe and well, police said today.Salina Hafeez, five, and her sister Sarah, three, went missing from Middlesbrough on Wednesday afternoon after being bundled into a red Ford Escort by a woman and two men as they were walking home. Police said yesterday they were looking for the sisters and their natural mother, Shanaz Hafeez, 29, who officers described as being in a "depressed" state. Last night the sisters were found at an address in the town centre shortly after midnight when officers searched a number of properties, Cleveland police said. Four men and three women have been arrested in connection with the abduction and are being held for questioning.Today a Cleveland police spokesman said: "Several premises were searched at around midnight ... the children were found safe and well at one of the addresses that were searched. They did not need any medical treatment. They were fit and well." They were found after the girls' unnamed foster mother made an emotional appeal for their safe return. In a statement issued through the police, she said: "They are very happy little girls, full of fun, who enjoyed going to school where they had lots of friends. "I was holding their hands as we walked home when the car drew up. It was a traumatic, terrifying event for all of us. I was so shocked I couldn't scream."A police spokeswoman said the foster parents had been looking after the girls for about 15 months.
