A teenager who killed a Manchester United fan by trying to steal his car and running him over was jailed for life yesterday.Paul Blanchflower, 19, of no fixed address, was found guilty at Manchester crown court of murdering 46-year-old Glyn Ellis in August last year. Mr Ellis, of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, had been to watch Manchester United play a champions league qualifier against the Hungarian side Zalaegerszeg. He had parked his Ford Mondeo in his brother's garage in St Lawrence Quay, Salford. As Mr Ellis reversed the car out of the garage, he left the engine running to close the door. He was approached by a man who got into the car and tried to drive off. He tried to stop him and became trapped beneath the car. He was pronounced dead at the scene after a passerby called for help. Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting said it was a low-speed impact which Blanchflower could easily have stopped. "There was the burning of flesh," said Mr Edis. "There were marks on the chest which were characteristic of a wheel, in fact the front off-side wheel of the Mondeo, going over his body." Sentencing Blanchflower to life in prison, Mr Justice Grigson said: "You saw this car with its lights on and engine running and you must have known that the owner was nearby. But you couldn't resist the temptation to take that car. He lost his life and his family, who treasured him, suffered a grievous loss." Detective Superintendent Kevin Duffy of Greater Manchester police, who led the investigation, said: "Although the person responsible for the the events that led to the death of Glyn Ellis has been placed behind bars, it is of little comfort to his family who have lost a loving son and brother." Blanchflower had pleaded guilty to manslaughter and aggravated vehicle theft, but denied murder.
