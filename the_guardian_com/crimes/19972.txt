Police launched an investigation yesterday after two parcels were sent containing caustic soda.The packages were sent to a councillor in Blackburn, Lancashire, and a journalist in Glasgow, said Greater Manchester police.It is thought the parcels were posted from the Greater Manchester area. In each was a letter and a miniature spirit bottle which contained a liquid with a high concentration of caustic soda.Police said one of the letters was signed SNLA - possibly a reference to a previously recognised group called the Scottish National Liberation Army.A statement from Greater Manchester police said: "While we are taking this matter seriously, at this time we do not believe there is a widespread risk to the public. There is nothing to suggest any link to international terrorism."Anyone who receives a package which they think may be suspicious is asked not to touch it and to call police.Caustic soda, also called sodium hydroxide or lye, is a highly corrosive substance widely used in industry for making paper, pulp, textiles, soap and detergent.Contact with concentrated caustic soda can cause blindness and severe chemical burns. It is understood that if either of the recipients had drunk the contents of the miniature spirit bottle, they could have died within minutes without medical attention.A police spokesman said the package addressed to the councillor was intercepted at a sorting office, but that addressed to the journalist was delivered.Assistant chief constable David Thompson would not say what was written in the letters. "Because of the nature of the investigation, we don't want to go into any details about precisely what was contained in the letters," he said. Detectives had made no link between the two recipients at this stage.
