A police officer and former Mr Gay UK has been cleared of raping a man and carrying out two sexual assaults. Supporters of PC Mark Carter clapped and cheered in the public gallery as a jury cleared him of a number of counts at Leeds crown court. Carter, 28, was charged with sexually assaulting three men and raping a fourth on a Christmas night out with colleagues. He was cleared of two rape charges and two sexual assault charges. The jury failed to reach a verdict on another sexual assault charge. A decision on whether to proceed with a retrial on that charge will be made next week. When he gave evidence, the officer described the "devastating" impact allegations of rape and sexual assault had on his life.
