The government has admitted it spent over £2m renovating a new site for the UK's only residential sex offenders clinic before its relocation had to be abandoned due to opposition from local residents.The Home Office said it cost £2.4m to refurbish the Silverlands hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, as the new site for the Wolvercote clinic, hailed as providing the most effective sex offender treatment programme in Europe.Hilary Eldridge, director of the Lucy Faithful Foundation, which established the Wolvercote clinic, said Silverlands was a very good site for a sex offender clinic.She said: "It was as close as you can get to a location that doesn't overlook a residential area. We do think about local people's sensitivities so they're not distressed."The clinic, which was found to be the most successful service in reducing reoffending by sex offenders, was forced to leave Horton hospital in Epsom, Surrey, at the end of last month because the Department of Health had earmarked the site for sale to a private developer seven years earlier. Ms Eldridge said: "The message from the public was 'you're doing a good job but please do it somewhere else, extremely remote'."But over seven years we assessed and treated 305 sex offenders and none of them harmed local children. Local residents should be more worried about their relatives, friends and neighbours, as children are far more likely to be abused by someone they know than a stranger."Most sex offenders are not likely to be so completely compulsive and out of control that they're going to break out of 24 hour supervision and abuse someone at random."Donald Findlater, manager of the Wolvercote, added that the government had been too timid in response to public opposition to the clinic's relocation.He said: "We're never going to get public consensus on where to place a sex offenders clinic, the government will have to stick its neck out."A Home Office spokesman said it was "unlikely" the costs of renovating Silverlands would never be recouped, as the adaptations made were not "specific to its use by the Wolvercote clinic".He said dialogue with local communities on the location of treatment facilities was essential but added that they "do not and cannot have a veto on this".He said: "We have a duty to provide the public with this information, but they have a duty to listen. As a society we cannot complain about a lack of provision without being prepared to take some responsibility in this area."The need for more Wolvercote-style clinics has been underlined by research by the Prison Reform Trust (PRT), which found that the prison service had missed its target for treating sex offenders for the fourth year running.Just 839 of the 5,000 sex offenders in prisons in England and Wales completed treatment last year, 300 below the required number.A prison service spokeswoman said the target had been too ambitious, adding that there were also problems recruiting and training psychologists to run the programmes. A Home Office spokesman admitted that record prisoner numbers, around 71,000, "meant that some prisoners have been moved from the prison where they are going through treatment without completing the course".The report's author, Joe Levenson, said: "The fact that prisons can't even meet this modest target shows there is an urgent need for more clinics like the Wolvercote, which have a high success rate in reducing the risks posed by sex offenders when they return to the community."Director of the PRT, Juliet Lyon, added: "Unless the government acts urgently to divert less serious offenders away from prison and into supervision or treatment in the community, prisons will continue to fail to meet performance targets and public safety will be undermined."
