I understand why people were upset to learn that Vincent Tabak's liking for strangulation pornography was withheld from the jury in the Joanna Yeates trial. It just feels right, the idea that this was evidence of his guilt, even though it is, strictly speaking, hard evidence only of his distasteful personal proclivities. That's exactly why the information was deemed to be so prejudicial.But the whole debate chimed with a detail from an appalling arson case reported the week before, in which a 14-year-old had killed a former girlfriend and her sister by burning down their house. On his computer, after he was arrested, police found that he had searched "How to burn down a house" on the web the day before the attack, and installed a photograph of the destroyed building as his screensaver after it.No need for soul searching any more. Google searches, it seems, reveal dark souls much more decisively. Computer activity can even be seen as offering a version of the sinister "pre-crime" of the film Minority Report, recording criminal intent, or possible criminal intent. It seems to me that it is time for some weighty academic research into, and collation of, the sort of things that have been found on the hard discs of convicted criminals. What practical use such knowledge could ethically have is quite another important matter.
