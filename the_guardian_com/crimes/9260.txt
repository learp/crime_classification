He was later bailed to return to an east London police station on 29 April pending further enquiries.He became the second person to be held in connection with the murder of Margaret Muller, an American artist.The first suspect, an 18-year-old, was arrested in Hackney, east London, 12 days ago. He was released on bail, pending further enquiries, and is due to reappear at a police station in April. Ms Muller, who was 27, was stabbed to death in Victoria Park, Hackney, on February 3. Joggers and cyclists heard her screaming for help at around 8:30am, and found her slumped on a path between a rose garden and playground.An autopsy confirmed that she had died from multiple stab wounds, including one to the neck. Police said that there was no evidence of sexual assault. Early on in the investigation, detectives said they wanted to trace two men, described as being of Mediterranean appearance, who were seen running from the scene shortly after the attack. Ms Muller moved to London in 1998 to study at the Slade school of fine art. She had won a series of scholarships and commissions, and lived near Victoria Park.
