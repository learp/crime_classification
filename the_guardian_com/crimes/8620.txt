The prank, caught on the supermarket’s security cameras, lasted several minutes.She admitted dangerous driving.The court heard the friend did not require a wheelchair and had jumped in one owned by the store for customer use.Adams, 20, was disqualified from driving for two years, ordered to pay £1,369 prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge. She was also given a four-month curfew and a 12-month community order.Judge Penny Moreland described the driving as “a piece of stupidity”.
