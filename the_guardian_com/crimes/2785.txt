The Home Office today unveiled plans to automatically deport many foreign prisoners at the end of their sentences, and to compel non-EU nationals living in Britain to carry identity cards containing biometric data.Liam Byrne, the immigration minister, denied the tough new immigration measures contained in the borders bill were "knee-jerk" reactions to last year's foreign prisoners scandal.He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: "This has been a very, very carefully constructed piece of legislation."What it allows us to do is presume that somebody will be automatically deported if they have committed a certain kind of offence."What that allows the Immigration Service to do is start working much, much earlier on an individual's case, safe in the knowledge of what the outcome is likely to be."Under the proposals, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate - to be renamed the Border and Immigration Agency from April - will be called upon to "tackle immigration in the round"."That means securing our borders more effectively, it means tackling human traffickers and smugglers who account for so much illegal immigration," Mr Byrne said."And it also means shutting down illegal working, which we know draws people here in the first place."Now of course we cannot deport people to certain death, in some countries," he added. "We have to take into account human rights obligations and that's perfectly proper."But Jawed Lukhmani, an immigration lawyer, told the programme: "There are at least 12 people that I personally have represented who have been wrongly served with deportation orders and who have been wrongly detained, because the Home Office has failed to realise that these people have a right to be in the country because they're British."Foreign prisoners would face automatic deportation if they had been imprisoned for a "serious offence", such as crimes against children, terrorism or drugs offences, or if they had committed any other offence but been jailed for a year or more.They will no longer have the right to appeal from within the UK except under "very specific" circumstances.The failure to deport around 1,000 foreign prisoners led to Charles Clarke's resignation as home secretary last year.The bill also contains proposals for new identity documents for foreign nationals - which the Home Office calls a "biometric immigration document" or "compulsory biometric ID" - for foreign nationals.The BBC reported that this would consist of fingerprint and photographic data.Mr Byrne said: "At the moment, there are up to 60 different documents which someone can show to prove their entitlement to be in Britain. That's much too complicated."This year, I am going to increase the sanctions for businesses who break the rules and employ people illegally."And I think the very least I can do is make life easier for those businesses by giving them a failsafe, easy method to check whether someone [is] here legally and whether they are who they say they are."Failure to obtain the biometric ID could result in loss of leave to remain or a fine of up to £1,000.Phil Booth, the national co-ordinator of NO2ID, which campaigns against the introduction of identity cards, told the Press Association that the government was making a "devastating mistake"."We're talking about people who contribute billions of pounds a year in tax to our economy being told they must be fingerprinted and recorded to live and work here," he said.The government has previously announced that foreigners seeking visas to stay in Britain would be issued with ID cards containing biometric date from 2008.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats' spokesman on home affairs, said: "There may be a case for adding some new powers to the statute book, but questions remain as to why existing powers - notably against unscrupulous employers of illegal workers - are being so poorly enforced."The proposal to use ID cards for non-European migrants appears to be a test-drive for the wider ID card project, rather than an objective response to an immigration problem."The government must not try to run before it has even learnt to walk in running a firm but fair immigration system."Immigration officers will also gain new powers under the bill, including the ability to:· arrest people smugglers or traffickers even if their crimes were committed outside the UK· detain individuals they suspect of having committed a crime, or those with an outstanding warrant against them, at ports· arrest those they believe to have been fraudulently claiming asylum support· access customs information to track down illegal immigrants.A new, dark blue uniform for border staff is also officially launched today, to make them "more visible at the UK border".Under new rules, members of the public and organisations can submit evidence to parliament on some new bills, including the UK borders bill.Submissions should be sent to scrutiny@parliament.uk.
