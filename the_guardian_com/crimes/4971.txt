Delays in bringing tens of thousands of cases to magistrates courts have landed taxpayers with a £173m bill, a report by a committee of MPs reveals today.The police and the Crown Prosecution Service alone are responsible for wasting some £55m through unneccesary delays caused by not preparing cases properly, losing files or finding the defendants have decided to plead guilty at the last moment.Over 90% of CPS cases are conducted in magistrates courts. In 2004, there were 190,466 magistrates court trials and over 2.8m pre-trial hearings. But 117,922 cases, just under two thirds of trials, and some 784,000, over a quarter of pre-trial hearings, did not go ahead as planned.Edward Leigh, Tory chairman of the public accounts committee, today calls for a radical reorganisation of the management of CPS cases. He says: "The CPS needs to cast a sharp eye on its own organisational structure and improve its system for preparing for magistrates court cases by adopting current best practice. It must also tackle the cultural resistance within the organisation to 21st century working practices."The management of cases must be radically improved with fewer barriers between lawyers and administrative staff. There must be much better awareness of which cases are high risk so that evidence can be obtained in good time."An analysis by the National Audit Office, parliament's financial watchdog, reveals the first breakdown between "cracked trials", where the defendent pleads guilty at the last minute, and ineffective trials, where the prosecution drops the case at the last moment, and delayed pre-trial, showing enormous variations across England and Wales. By far the worst area is Bedfordshire where almost 20% of the combined total of ineffective trials and pre-trial hearings were delayed.The Liberal Democrat legal affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, says the police and CPS had been caught "bang to rights. They are both in the dock for good reason - and both are guilty".
