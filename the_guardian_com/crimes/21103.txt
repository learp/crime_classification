An inquiry into how a disk containing DNA profiles of 2,159 people linked to serious crime abroad went unchecked for a year has found "significant shortcomings" by the crown prosecution service.The attorney general, Lady Scotland, who released the report yesterday, said the delay in dealing with the data sent by the Dutch criminal authorities was "highly regrettable".The CPS apologised unreservedly for the failings found in the review, carried out by its chief executive, Peter Lewis.The discovery of the blunder last January led to an urgent hunt for criminals wanted in the Netherlands for offences including rape and murder, but left at large in Britain. At least 11 of those named on the disc committed crimes, including assaults, in this country while the data awaited checking on the national DNA database for matches.Lewis's report found that the disc was "unexpectedly" sent to the CPS, not the police, by ordinary business post in January 2007 and was not addressed to any individual or department. The appropriate lawyer received it in April 2007, just before starting "a lengthy and unexpected period of absence" without arranging its transfer to police.Although queries were raised about the disc later that month and in August 2007, no one wanted to disturb the lawyer concerned due to the nature of the absence, which is not explained in the report.The lawyer returned to work at the end of October but, "in keeping with the unfortunate history of the matter there followed an almost casual exchange of information over the next two months", the inquiry found. The disc was eventually collected on January 11 this year and a number of matches found against the national database.The inquiry found no evidence that the disc was copied or had left the CPS building, and blamed individual failings - now the subject of disciplinary action - not any systemic failing by the organisation.Lewis concluded: "Given the groundbreaking character of this initiative, the fact that with hindsight it is possible to identify some weaknesses in its implementation is perhaps unsurprising."The most serious of these is the extremely regrettable failure of CPS personnel to deal appropriately and expeditiously with the disk of DNA profiles unexpectedly entrusted to the CPS."Action has already been instigated to address this failure, both in terms of staff disciplinary and other management action and internal procedural changes. These should prevent any similar occurrence in the future."As a result of matches with the DNA database, "a number of individuals who may have felt they had successfully escaped justice in the Netherlands are now at risk of arrest". Fuller information could not be given because it would be "very unfortunate" if they fled, went into hiding or attempted to impede investigations.The home secretary has undertaken to report the outcome of the investigations to parliament.Lady Scotland said the inquiry had shown "potentially immense value in these exchanges of data and in the investment the UK government has made in establishing a DNA database. The exchange of information may lead to the prosecution of criminals who would not otherwise be brought to justice."
