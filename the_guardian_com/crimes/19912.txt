A lorry driver was found guilty yesterday of causing the deaths of a family of four after falling asleep at the wheel.Ian King, 61, crashed into a line of traffic near Bicester, Oxfordshire, on July 31 last year, causing a huge pile-up. One of the vehicles hit was a Peugeot 307 containing Malcolm Dowling, 46, his wife Janice, 42, and their sons Richard, 16, and George, 11 who were killed instantly.The family were driving along the A34 on their way home to Lichfield, Staffordshire, after a holiday in France.Another driver, Stephen Chance, spent three months in hospital after his neck was broken in the crash.King, a HGV driver with 30 years' experience, was driving from Leicester to Southampton when the crash happened at about 3.30pm. Oxford crown court court heard that he had been awake since 4.30am and had been driving with breaks since 7am.King's articulated lorry caused a multiple pile-up on the dual carriageway after it shunted a Ford Focus out of its path then lifted a Renault Laguna over the Dowlings' Peugeot and into the top deck of a car transporter.The 30-tonne truck then drove over the Peugeot before crashing into the rear of the transporter lorry, the court heard.Witnesses said the truck was travelling at at least 40 mph when it crashed into the cars.King denied the charges and said he had no recollection of what had happened. He only discovered the family had died when police spoke to him later in hospital.He told the court: "I knew there had been a fatality but I did not know to what extent I had been personally involved."The court was told that King suffers from sleep apnoea, a breathing condition which disrupts sleep and can cause drowsiness.John Price, prosecuting, argued that King would have been aware he was getting drowsy but he had failed to take appropriate measures to avoid falling asleep at the wheel, with tragic consequences.King maintained that he had not suffered with drowsiness in more than 35 years of driving HGVs.Tony McGeorge, representing King, said his client was not aware that he suffered from sleep apnoea at the time of the crash and did not know he could lose consciousness therefore could have been expected to take precautions for a then-undiagnosed condition.Medical experts testified that there was no reason why King would have failed to be aware that he was becoming sleepy at the wheel.Following the verdict, Judge David Morton Jack warned King that he would face an inevitable prison sentence. "It would not be fair to leave you in any real hope otherwise," he said.The jury at Oxford crown court considered their verdicts for two hours and 15 minutes before finding King guilty on four counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
