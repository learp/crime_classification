The prime minister's wife will tonight make another foray into public policy with a speech attacking the state of Britain's overcrowded prisons.Speaking in her capacity as a leading human rights lawyer at the inaugral Lord Longford lecture, Ms Booth will tell an audience of policy professionals that short-term sentences are "crippling" any efforts by prisons for constructive reform of inmates.Her intervention in the debate on prisons and sentencing comes as the Home Office was warned that Britain's prisons are within 300 places of becoming full - something that could happen within the week.But Ms Booth's speech, albeit delivered at the invitation of the Independent newspaper and the Penal Reform Trust, which are sponsoring the Longford lectures, comes at a time when the prime minister's wife has faced criticism for involving herself in political issues.Her comment last month that there would be no progress in the Middle East while Palestinians still has "no hope but to blow themselves up" provoked a predictable barrage of criticism from the Isreali lobby within Britain, and forced an apology from Downing Street.Ms Booth last week announced she would be hosting a reception for Israeli victims of terrorism at the behest of an Jewish charity following the remarks.Conservatives have also condemned the prime minister's wife it was revealed she had hosted public policy seminars in Downing Street, and also used the No 10 private residence to host meetings with clients of her law firm, Matrix Chambers.In her speech, entitled The Law, the Victims and the Vulnerable, Ms Booth will say: "It is particularly worrying that more than one in six of the current prison population is on remand - in other words they have yet to be tried or sentenced. "In fact, the majority of this group doesn't ultimately go on to receive a prison sentence."She adds: "The huge increase in numbers and the prevalence of short-term sentences is crippling to any constructive approach to prison."Ms Booth also calls on drug addicts to be given better support after they leave prison, saying: "There is little point in drying out addicts in jail only to send them unsupported back into the community."Vulnerable people leaving prison must be helped to stay away from their old patterns of life."In preparation for her address, Ms Booth visited prisons in London and Liverpool, including the all-women prison in Holloway.The prison population currently stands at a record 71,360, just 293 short of capacity.
