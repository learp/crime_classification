A man with HIV who groomed teenage boys via the internet and filmed himself having sex with his victims has been jailed for life and told he must serve at least 10 years before he is considered for release.Anthony Marsh, 53, was jailed at Sheffield crown court along with Lee Davis, 39, who was also given a life term. Davis was told he must serve at least 12-and-a-half years in prison.Judge Julian Goose QC told the pair that they were "predatory, dangerous paedophiles".Marsh and Davis, both whom are married and have children, used social networks such as Facebook and Bebo, as well as specialist gay websites, to befriend boys.After grooming teenagers as young as 13 online, the pair met their victims and sexually abused them.

The damage these two men have inflicted will last for many years to come."The detective said it was possible that there were more victims who needed help and urged those who had yet to come forward to do so.
