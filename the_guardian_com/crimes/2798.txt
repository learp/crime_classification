A pensioner who smothered his 75-year-old wife in a "mercy killing" has been jailed for two years.Yesterday, a jury at Sheffield crown court cleared George Webb, 73, of murdering his wife, Beryl, but found him guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.The court heard that Mrs Webb had suffered from a number of ailments – some real and some imagined – and had considered suicide for years. She had asked her husband to help her die.On 14 May this year she attempted to kill herself with 34 lorazepam tablets washed down with brandy and fizzy orange. Webb, fearing this had not worked, then smothered his sleeping wife with a plastic bag and a towel, the court heard.He stayed with her all night and called the police the following morning.The judge, Mr Justice McCombe, heard pleas from Webb's legal team to spare him from a prison term. But the judge said: "This was an unlawful killing and Mr Webb's responsibility for it is diminished – it is not extinguished. It cannot be thought that an unlawful killing committed in such circumstances can result in a sentence leaving the offender at liberty."He continued: "Mr Webb acknowledged in his evidence that he knew what he was doing was unlawful and that he fully understood the consequences. To pass a sentence short of immediate custody, even having regard to the mitigation, would give a wholly erroneous indication that such killings do not warrant punishment and will not be punished by the court."He quoted the court of appeal, saying any change of approach to such cases was for parliament to decide, not the courts.Opening his sentencing remarks, the judge said: "The killing of Mrs Webb was what has come to be called a mercy killing."He described how Mrs Webb had suffered a series of medical problems, including having her kneecaps removed and breast cancer. At the time of her death, she wrongly believed her cancer had returned and that another of her ailments was about to give her a massive, debilitating stroke.The court heard that Mrs Webb had also suffered from histrionic personality disorder since the 1950s, which led her to exaggerate her illnesses. The judge said her husband had come to share her delusions as they became more isolated in their flat in the Wadsley area of Sheffield.A psychiatrist told the jury that they lived in a cocoon or bubble, feeding on each other's depression.The couple had been married for 49 years and had no children.
