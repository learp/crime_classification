Suspected parts of a child's body were discovered at Haut de la Garenne in February as officers acted on information from hundreds of callers.Officers later discounted the remains as non-human, but soon found other remains in the cellars of the former care home.Specialist detectives from the UK mainland joined the inquiry as further grim discoveries were made, including "punishment rooms" in the basement of the building.States of Jersey senators have agreed to hold a full public enquiry into child abuse on the island once the criminal investigation had been completed.Built on a Jersey hilltop in 1867, Haut de la Garenne was first a school and then an orphanage before becoming one of Jersey's childcare homes.It still housed up to 60 young people with special needs when it closed in 1986, reopening in 2004 as the island's first youth hostel.It has also been used as the setting of a police station in the BBC detective television series Bergerac.
