Drunken yobs will be targeted in a police crackdown on violence in pubs and town centres starting this week, the government announced today.The national campaign will focus on hotspots for binge drinking where violence can easily break out unless there is a significant police presence.Off licences and bars which sell alcohol to under-age drinkers will face "sting operations", the Home Office announced.Town centres were considered particularly prone to drunken violence during Euro 2004, and there were a few serious incidents such as one which hit Croydon, but England's early exit from the tournament avoided the risk of repeated problems.A Home Office spokeswoman said: "It is going to be running through the summer and then intermittently afterwards. "What we are looking to do with the campaign is to kick off a change of culture, knowing that irresponsible bars and clubs can't get away any longer with encouraging binge drinking." Home Office figures show that alcohol was the cause of 44% of violent incidents and 70% of weekend night admissions to casualty.
