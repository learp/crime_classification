Police searching for the killers of a man whose dismembered remains were found at rural locations across two counties have arrested two men.The pair, in their 20s and 30s, were arrested at an address in north London on Tuesday afternoon, said Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.A man's head, arm, leg and torso were found by members of the public across Hertfordshire and Leicestershire in the last month. The victim, whom police were initially unable to identify despite having a DNA profile, was killed by a stab wound to the back.The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Michael Hanlon, said today that police had now identified him."We believe we have identified the victim of the murder and specialist officers are working closely with the family. We cannot release any more details of his identity at this stage," he said.Detectives believe the killer, or killers, drove hundreds of miles across Hertfordshire and Leicestershire dumping the body parts.The most recent discovery, which included the decomposed torso, right arm and upper left arm, was made by a walker in Standon, Hertfordshire, two weekends ago, three weeks after the first remains – a left leg and a foot – were found in a green holdall in a layby on the A507 in Cottered, also in Hertfordshire, on 22 March.Only the victim's hands are still missing. Police believe that the victim was killed in the 48 hours before the first find, and that all the body parts were dumped at about the same time.
