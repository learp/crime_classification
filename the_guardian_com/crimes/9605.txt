A boy aged nine has admitted burgling a house and stealing the keys of a car that crashed moments later, police said.The child is too young to be prosecuted because he is under the age of criminal responsibility.Cleveland police investigated a break-in at a house in Hartlepool on 16 May, after reports that a red Vauxhall Vectra had been taken and crashed soon after with a parked white Renault Megane.A force spokeswoman said: "A nine-year-old boy has admitted taking the keys from the property and enquiries are ongoing into the incident."The Vauxhall owner, who was not named, told the Hartlepool Mail newspaper: "It is unbelievable what has happened, but it doesn't look like anything will happen apart from probably a slap on the wrists."The owner said hundreds of pounds worth of damage had been caused to his car, and the other vehicle suffered worse damage.
