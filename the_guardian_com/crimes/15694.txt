Five men have been given jail sentences totalling more than 28 years after a 13-year-old girl who ran away from home was trafficked for sex while she was missing for more than a week, police said.The teenager, who had only just had her 13th birthday, left her home in Sheffield in August last year and ended up in Bradford, where she came under the influence of a group of adult men, Sheffield crown court was told during a four-week trial that ended on Thursday.Police said that the child suffered a “horrendous ordeal” at the hands of a group of adult men who “transported and harboured an innocent young girl with the intention of committing sexual abuse”.Shakeal Rehman, 26, was jailed for 12 years after he was found guilty by the jury of raping the girl in a Bradford hotel and trafficking, South Yorkshire police said.Mohammed Shapal, 22, was jailed for four years and Yaseen Amini, 37, was given a five-and-half year sentence after both were found guilty of sexual activity with a child and trafficking.Usman Ali, 21, was given three years in prison for sexual activity with a child and Bekir Rasheed, 37, was jailed for four years for trafficking.The offences took place over a period of eight days in August 2013. The teenager was moved to several different addresses by the group, subjected to sexual abuse by each man before being found by police in the centre of Bradford.The girl’s disappearance sparked a police appeal for help to find her and she was discovered in Bradford more than a week after she went missing.Rehman, of Haworth Road, Bradford; Shapal, also of Haworth Road, Bradford; Amini, of Broadway, Bradford; Ali, of St Mary’s Road, Bradford, and Rasheed, of Ulverston Road, Woodseats, Sheffield, denied all the offences but were found guilty on Thursday.Detective Inspector Helen Tate, leading the investigation, said the verdicts marked “the conclusion of a complex and protracted investigation into the sexual exploitation of a vulnerable young girl”.“What happened to the victim has had a huge and profound impact on her life and the lives of her family,” Tate said. “I cannot put into words what this child experienced at the hands of these men.“To be the victim of any sexual offence is horrendous, but to then have to engage in a process where you have to relive that ordeal and disclose in detail the intricacies of the painful event is hard to comprehend.“It’s bad enough for an adult, but we are talking about a 13-year-old child who has had to engage with people in authority and retell her story as part of the judicial process.“Crown court is a necessary but daunting experience for the victim of any sexual offence.“Because these men continued to deny their guilt, the child has had to go through a long trial process and it is admirable that this child has shown the strength of character to see this through to the end.“I would also like to thank the officers on the investigative team for their exhaustive efforts over the past year to bring the perpetrators of this vile crime to justice.“I can only hope the verdicts reached today will give the victim and her family some small degree of comfort in knowing those responsible are behind bars.“This is just the start of a long process for the family to try to put this horrendous ordeal behind them.“This kind of criminality can only be addressed by partnership working and with the help of communities as a whole to stand up and not accept this abuse.”South Yorkshire police said officers used human trafficking legislation for the second time in a case of child sexual exploitation.Tate continued: “We felt that trafficking offences more accurately described the actions of these men – they transported and harboured an innocent young girl with the intention of committing sexual abuse.“This [legislation] has become yet another tool in our arsenal to tackle child sexual exploitation. We hope that by securing convictions for this crime today we send a warning to those individuals still choosing to exploit young people. You will be found and brought to justice.”
