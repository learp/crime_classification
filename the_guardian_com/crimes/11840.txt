The campaign being waged by David Davis against Sir Ian Blair has now rightly been condemned by both Ken Jones, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), and Glen Smythe, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation. It is important for Londoners to understand why Mr Davis' campaign, by undermining policing, undermines their own safety in the fight against terrorism.The cynically irresponsible character of the campaign against the commissioner is shown by the fact that David Davis has himself called the prosecution of the Metropolitan police under health and safety legislation "frankly bonkers". Mr Davis therefore calls for the dismissal of the head of the police force over a case he himself condemns!Furthermore, as regards personal responsibility, as Sir Ian Blair had only been in post five months at the time of the De Menezes tragedy the idea that he could, in that time, have overhauled all the structures of the Metropolitan police for dealing with such a serious issue as terrorism is absurd - let alone deal with possible prosecutions from health and safety legislation dealing with entirely different purposes. As Ken Jones has put it: "This legislation was designed for a different era, for a different purpose and fundamentally around factories and building sites." To use such a case as a justification for dismissing the head of the Metropolitan police is unbridled political cynicism.It is also in marked contrast to the position of Mr Davis' predecessors in 1983, when police shot the wholly innocent film director Stephen Waldorf, and in 1999 when the equally innocent Harry Stanley was shot dead - both in situations of far less strain for the police than following two waves of terrorist attacks, and when the resources of the Metropolitan police were scarcely strained at all by comparison.The most fundamental problem that has been faced by the police force was the run down of police numbers under policies supported by Mr Davis prior to 1997 - when police numbers were reduced from 28,000 in 1992 to 26,667 in 1997. It was the run down of the police that that led to rapidly rising crime in London, which only the rapid build-up of police numbers after 2000 has reversed. Police numbers have since risen to 31,000 police officers and over 4,200 PCSOs - that is more than 35,250 uniformed officers, with the result that crime has fallen each year for the last four years, with now a reduction of over one in eight crimes, and last year's fall being the highest ever.The real contrast Mr Davis is trying to avoid is the run down in the police force, and rise in crime due to policies supported by Mr Davis, and the increase in police numbers and decrease in crime under Sir Ian. That Mr Davis is prepared to attempt to avoid the real record and do this by means which inevitably make police officers engaged in anti-terrorist activities more concerned about their position and the risk of prosecution for taking split second decisions - when under the strain of great danger both to the public and themselves - and thereby increasing the danger to Londoners, represents a new political low by Mr Davis on an issue that is a literal life or death one for Londoners.
