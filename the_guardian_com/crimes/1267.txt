Tweeting is to be allowed from hearings at the highest court in the land, it was announced yesterday.Supreme court justices are "content" for journalists, members of the public and legal teams to use "live text-based communications" to let the outside world know what is happening in the courtroom. Consent was given because cases before the court do not involve interaction with witnesses or jurors.Exceptions include family cases involving the welfare of a child, cases where publication of proceedings might prejudice a pending jury trial and those where reporting restrictions apply.
