A mother cleared of killing her children in a house fire wept as she walked free from court and said she just wanted to start piecing her life back together.Fiona Adams, 24, was found not guilty by a jury at Nottingham crown court of murdering daughter Niamh, five, and two-year-old son Cayden in the blaze in Buxton, Derbyshire.She escaped from the house in Edale Way with youngest child Kiernan by jumping from an upstairs window just before midnight on 23 April last year.Speaking outside the court yesterday, where a jury cleared her of murder, arson and grievous bodily harm, Adams said she was happy with the verdict.A statement, read on her behalf as she stood in front of press weeping and supported by family members, said: "Today's verdict has been long awaited by Fiona and her family and is, of course, welcomed."She would especially like to thank her family and her wellwishers who have provided her with so much support throughout."Fiona will be most grateful if the press and the public will now give her and her family time to pick up the threads of their lives and establish some kind of normality."During the trial, prosecutor Timothy Spencer QC said Adams started the blaze because she wanted to create a drama to get the attention of her then partner, James Maynard.The court heard that Maynard, who is the father of all three children, had cheated on her several times, which led to her attempting suicide on a previous occasion.Spencer said Maynard was repeatedly late home from his job as a waiter and bartender at the Buckingham Hotel and would often fail to reply to his partner's text messages.Speaking after the verdicts, Maynard, who is no longer in a relationship with Adams, said he never doubted her innocence.He said: "When you've been in a relationship for a length of time with someone you know them inside and out and I just knew she wasn't responsible."He said he "never for one moment" believed any of the allegations against her and said he was horrified when she was charged."I was disgusted by it," he said, "We'd just lost everything and, to go through that, was awful. As a mum she was absolutely brilliant, couldn't have asked for a better mum."Maynard said there were also no lasting injuries to Kiernan and he was now in talks with social services to allow Adams to have access to him.As the jury delivered its verdict, Adams sobbed loudly and held her hands up to her face.Members of her family shouted "yes" as Adams was cleared.During the trial, the court was told Maynard should have returned home from work on the night of the fire between 9pm and 10pm but did not. Spencer said it was not long after this that Adams began complaining of an intruder in the garden.The court saw CCTV footage, taken from a neighbour's house around that time, in which banging and crashing could be heard before a woman's voice shouted: "Hello, hello."Adams' father, Michael, said he had "got his baby back" and vowed not to stop fighting until Niamh and Cayden's killer was caught.When asked who he thought was responsible for the fire, he said: "We have got an idea. Can't give names."Jasmine Maynard, the children's aunt, said: "There's still somebody out there who's murdered my niece and nephew and we're not going to stop until we've found them and they're convicted."Derbyshire police said the force would appoint an independent team to review the case in light of the verdicts.The force said: "The role of the police was to investigate the deaths of Niamh and Cayden Maynard and to achieve justice for the children and their families."The evidence was heard by the jury, who felt it was not sufficient enough to find Fiona guilty. During our inquiry, we found no evidence to suggest that anyone else was responsible for the fire."Derbyshire constabulary would like to offer its deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Niamh and Cayden Maynard, particularly to James Maynard and all the grandparents."
