Roy Hattersley is right to condemn the manner in which newspapers have covered the Soham trial (Soham has turned us into voyeurs, December 8). But the people of this country are not, as he implies, collectively guilty of "sedentary voyeurism" just because they buy the newspapers that print the distasteful details that have emerged from the Soham trial. The true voyeurs are those in the media who decided to cover this trial in the way that they have.There is a widely held misconception that the public gets the media that it wants. But people can only choose from what is on offer. To avoid being force-fed the minutiae of the Soham case, one would have to avoid the mainstream media in its entirety - radio, television, print and online; in other words, withdraw completely from any engagement with current affairs whatsoever. That, of course, is exactly what growing numbers of people seem to do, to the distinct disadvantage of democracy and us all.Tom RobbinsNottingham
