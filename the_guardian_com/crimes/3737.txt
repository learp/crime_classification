The village of Emneth Hungate came to stand for remote rural communities across Britain which complain of being under-policed. Villagers said criminals were travelling from far away to target their homes while police did little to protect them.Has that picture changed in the two years since the shooting at Bleak Farm? Many local people say not. David Barnard, who lives near Martin's home, said: "We had a cash machine stolen in a ram raid a little while ago. The police response time was 51 minutes. They said because the burglars had gone they didn't see any point in rushing." Pat Weston said: "I caught a chap trying to break into our house the other week, but it was 20 minutes before I could even get put through to the right police department to report it." But police claim an initiative called the Fens project, launched with Home Office money, is helping to improve response times. They also claim that more police officers are in place in west Norfolk - 374 in September compared with 327 a year before.
