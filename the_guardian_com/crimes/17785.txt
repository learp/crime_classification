The child was the only one unable to escape and died in hospital from 95% burns.The court heard that her brother Abdul Hamid, 21, had aroused fury by dating Meherun Khanum, 15, who lived nearby. Meherun is the sister of Hussain Ahmed, who was cleared.Another of her brothers, Mohammed Foaz Ahmed, and a close friend of her family, Jabed Ali, are wanted by police for questioning about the fire but are thought to have fled to Bangladesh.Tuzzio was cleared of murder but was convicted of arson with intent to endanger life.
