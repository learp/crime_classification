We know who the killers are, We have watched them strut before us As proud as sick Mussolinis, We have watched them strut before us Compassionless and arrogant, They paraded before us, Like angels of death Protected by the law. It is now an open secret Black people do not have Chips on their shoulders, They just have injustice on their backs And justice on their minds, And now we know that the road to liberty is as long as the road from slavery.The death of Stephen Lawrence Has taught us to love each other And never to take the tedious task Of waiting for a bus for granted. Watching his parents watching the cover-up Begs the question What are the trading standards here? Why are we paying for a police force That will not work for us? The death of Stephen Lawrence Has taught us That we cannot let the illusion of freedom Endow us with a false sense of security as we walk the streets, The whole world can now watch The academics and the super cops Struggling to find the definition of institutionalised racism As we continue to die in custody As we continue emptying our pockets on the pavements, And we continue to ask ourselves Why is it so official That black people are so often killed Without killers? We are not talking about war or revenge We are not talking about hypothetics or possibilities, We are talking about where we are now We are talking about how we live now In this state Under this flag, (God Save the Queen), And god save all those black children who want to grow up And god save all the brothers and sisters Who like raving, Because the death of Stephen Lawrence Has taught us that racism is easy when You have friends in high places. And friends in high places Have no use whatsoever When they are not your friends. Dear Mr Condon, Pop out of Teletubby land, And visit reality, Come to an honest place And get some advice from your neighbours, Be enlightened by our community, Neglect your well-paid ignorance Because We know who the killers are This poem was written for Channel 4 News and will be performed by Benjamin Zephaniah on the 7pm bulletin tonight
