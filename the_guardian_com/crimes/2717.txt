The policy of releasing prisoners early on electronic tags was under fire last night after it was claimed that 1,400 offences were committed by prisoners on early release schemes.Home Office figures show that more than 40,000 prisoners were released on home detention curfew between January 1999 and December 2001. About 2 per cent of those released under the scheme - designed for non-violent prisoners sentenced to less than four years - were convicted, cautioned or awaiting prosecution for offences committed while on early release. Prisoners can be released two months early under the scheme and Home Secretary David Blunkett had hoped to extend this to three months and develop a version of the scheme for young offenders. Shadow Home Affairs spokesman Oliver Letwin said: 'There is obviously a very serious problem. We must review the system.' Home Office figures show that 893 offences were committed by tagged prisoners. The additional 500 offences may be explained by breaches of curfew conditions, which automatically end in a return to a custodial sentence. Some offenders have been known to cut off their tags to continue their criminal behaviour. 'This is a very successful scheme and only a very small proportion of offenders on home detention curfew commit a further offence,' said a Home Office spokeswoman. She added that all offenders on the scheme were strictly risk-assessed and no prisoners convicted of violent or sexual offences were eligible. More than 90 per cent complete the order and two-thirds of recalls are a result of breaking the curfew conditions or eviction from the curfew address. The alleged crimes committed included four rapes, 38 serious woundings and 82 serious assaults. In a separate development, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, has ordered the early release of 30 child killers no longer believed to be a risk to the public.
