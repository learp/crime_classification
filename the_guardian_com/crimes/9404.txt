Two men were convicted yesterday of killing three generations of a family in a ruthless revenge fire-bomb attack on a terrace house.Shaied Iqbal, 26, was convicted of the murder of five young girls, their grandmother, mother and uncle.Only the uncle, Mohammed ateeq-ur-Rehman, 18, had given Iqbal any cause for grievance, a six-week trial at Leeds crown court was told. The teenager's rumour-mongering about Iqbal's affair with a woman whose parents disapproved led to the hurling of four firebombs into the terrace house in Huddersfield, after petrol had been poured through the letterbox.Iqbal was the organiser of the carefully planned, late night "punishment" while the family slept. His accomplice, Nazar Hussain, 24, was cleared of murder but was convicted of the manslaughter of Tayyaba Batool, 13, Rabiah Batool, 10, Ateeqa Nawaz, six, Aneesa Nawaz, two, Najeeba Nawaz, six months, their mother Nafeesa Aziz, 35, their grandmother, Zaib-un-Nisa, 54, and Mohammed ateeq-ur-Rehman.The court heard that the house was destroyed within the four minutes it took for fire engines to arrive, after neighbours were woken by the petrol bombs crashing through the front windows and exploding.Zaib-un-Nisa, 54, died in hospital a week later after she leapt from an upstairs window. An interfaith memorial service after the funerals filled Huddersfield's football stadium with mourners.Iqbal and Hussain, both from Huddersfield, were also convicted of conspiracy to commit arson in the attack in Birkby, Huddersfield, on May 12 last year.The modest stone-built house was left a blackened shell, after screaming survivors of the attack had leapt from windows broken by heat and blast.The jury was sent home until tomorrow when it failed to reach a verdict on a third defendant, 23-year-old Shakiel Shazad, also from Huddersfield, who is accused of eight murders and conspiracy to commit arson.A fourth man from Huddersfield, 22-year-old Anwar Hussain, was cleared of conspiracy to commit criminal damage to cars by arson.The trial was told that Iqbal and Nazar Hussain had never shown remorse, but had blamed one another and given specious excuses for the terrible attack. The court heard Iqbal claim that he thought the house was empty, although his petrol bombs had been filled with nuts and bolts.He was also said by witnesses to have laughed, joked and even boasted about his role in starting the inferno, telling a friend: "Shit happens." He had also bragged to a fellow inmate about the attack while on remand at Leeds prison.Hussain said that he had been under the impression that he was only going to "torch a car". But police found his fingerprints on a petrol can used to "prime" the house.The family is well-known in Huddersfield's Asian community. The children's grandfather, Abdul Aziz Chishti, whose wife was killed in the attack, was bundled out of the blazing house by Mohammed ateeq-ur-Rehman's sister, Siddiqah Aziz.Another of her brothers, student Mohammed Shafique, also survived but lost the skin on one arm as he tried to persuade his mother, Zaib-un-Nisa, to jump with him from a window.Paul Worsley, prosecuting, said: "This was an ordinary family with no enemies - or so they thought. They never stood a chance as their home was engulfed in flames."The trial of Shakiel Shazad will continue tomorrow.
