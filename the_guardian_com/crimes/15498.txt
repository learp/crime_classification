There were no corpses, and no bloody prints made by size 12 Bruno Magli loafers, only a field in rural Lincolnshire.OJ Simpson it wasn't, nor even Louise Woodward. More like an interminable planning inquiry from which all but the most diehard nimbys had fled.Cameras perched among the dark oak panelling of Court No 4 at the Royal Courts of Justice in London's Strand were recording history in the making, but it was a low-key affair.Filming was taking place for the first time in an English courtroom. If the six-week pilot is deemed a success, highlights of cases could become a nightly feature on the TV news.Broadcasters involved in the experiment will mock up news items, not for broadcast but to be viewed by judges and ministers to help decide whether courts should be opened more widely to the cameras.But on day one of the first hearing yesterday, there were no obvious soundbites for the news, just: "If your lordships could turn to page 763." It was hard to see anything that would compete for airtime with battles, hostage-taking, hurricanes and train crashes.The courtroom ennui is due to a decision to restrict the pilot to appeal court hearings, where there are usually no witnesses. The most dramatic courtroom moments come when witnesses are crossexamined.But ministers and judges are nervous of televising trials for fear it could deter witnesses from giving evidence or affect what they say.In yesterday's case, Jim Speechley, the ex-Lincolnshire county council leader given an 18-month jail term last April for misconduct in public office, was trying to clear his name. His wife was there, too, as were two-dozen onlookers, including six reporters.The cameras were trained mainly on the wig-wearers, the three judges with the power to quash Speechley's conviction and the lawyers. Members of the public were told they should sit outside the central area covered by the cameras, marked out with red sticky tape, if they preferred not to be filmed.Speechley, a Tory county and parish councillor for nearly 40 years, allegedly suggested an alteration to the initial proposed route of the Crowland bypass in Lincolnshire because it would enhance the development value of one of his fields. The alteration would ensure the four-acre field would not be cut off from the village by a busy main road.His counsel, William Harbage QC, said the crucial issue was whether Speechley had been motivated by self-interest or was acting for the good of the community.If he acted primarily for the public good, in line with his long-running campaign to have a new road for Crowland, while at the same time spotting a potential benefit for himself, then a very careful summing-up on the motive was required.Mr Harbage argued that Judge Lawler's summing-up to the Sheffield crown court jury did not adequately cover the issue of "mixed motives"."The fact that he saw a benefit for himself along the way does not make him dishonest," Mr Harbage told Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Bell and Mr Justice Hughes.Martin Wilson QC, for the crown, said it was obvious from the verdict that the jury found Speechley dishonest.He said it would be absurd and against public policy if a person accused of this sort of "quasi-corruption" conduct could be acquitted by saying: "Well, at least some part of my motive was for the good."The hearing continues today.
