Two high-profile murders of young women which took place more than 30 years ago have been linked by DNA evidence. Scotland Yard are hoping that the link could lead to the solving of the murders of a Playboy bunny and a schoolgirl.Eve Stratford, 22, who worked at the Playboy club in London, was last seen walking near her home in Leyton, east London, in March 1975. A short while later a loud thud was heard from her first-floor flat and her body was found in her bedroom by her boyfriend. She had a nylon stocking tied round one ankle and a scarf round her hands, and her neck had been cut. No weapon was recovered but a forensic examination of her clothing has provided a DNA profile.Six months later Lynne Weedon, 16, was raped and killed on her way home in Hounslow, west London.The case was reopened in 2004 by the Metropolitan police's murder review group, which re-examines unsolved cases. Fresh DNA tests were conducted and the link to the Stratford murder was found."Advances in forensic science mean that we are able to re-look at certain older cases with the very real possibility that some progress can be made that would not have been possible previously," said Detective Chief Inspector Andy Mortimer, the officer heading the investigation.Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, 75, says on BBC Crimewatch tonight: "Not a day passes without a thought of Lynne going through my mind, even after all this time."
