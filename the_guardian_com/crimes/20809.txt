Police investigating the murders of two Chinese graduates in Newcastle have discovered a drowned cat in their bathroom.The bodies of Xi Zhou and her boyfriend, Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, were found in their flat in Newcastle's West End on Saturday. They had suffered severe head injuries caused by a knife and another sharp weapon.A motive has yet to be established for the killing of the Chinese nationals, who were both described by academic staff as friendly and very hard-working.Police were today trying to establish if the cat's death was linked to the attack on its owners.The black and white pet was found submerged in a washing bowl under the sink covered with a towel and kitchen gloves. It was taken from the flat by police for a post-mortem examination."Officers are keeping an open mind as to the significance of this find," said Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, who is leading the inquiry."However, one possibility being considered is that the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders."Detectives said they would speak to experts in Chinese culture to explore any significance in a murder victim's pet also being killed.Forensic scientists continued to check the ground floor flat for any sign of forced entry. One theory was that the couple, who met at Newcastle University and graduated two years ago with good degrees, might have known their attacker and let them in."It was a vicious attack, there was a lot of blood and I think in any interpretation that was something frenzied," said Wade."We will work around the clock to catch those responsible. We have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case, we have the support of the local community, the area command policing and the people of Newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime."Wade told a news conference Yang suffered extensive bruising to both forearms before he was killed, perhaps up to an hour prior to the fatal attack. He said the injuries were likely to have been inflicted as Yang tried to protect his head."He has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault, which has caused very significant bruising to the forearm."Police said they had checked the dead couple's bank accounts and found no reason for such a violent attack. They reviewed airport and port passenger lists for suspicious movements since Zhou was last seen on Thursday and ruled out any links to Triad gangs or drugs."At this stage we have no motive as to why these two people have been killed which could be properly put forward as a reason why they should be attacked with such brutality,'' Wade said."Sometimes the police hold news conferences like this and go through the motions with the media when they already have it in the bag, but this really is an undetected homicide."We are beginning to make inroads into their friends and associates, but we are a long way short of establishing a motive for this crime, and we are a long way short of arresting anyone."Wade said an offender profiler would be brought in to help the investigation. "He will take a look at the sequence of events and give us some assistance into what happened."Relatives of Zhou, who was a popular member of staff at the local Wagamama restaurant, were traced to Hunan in southern China with the help of friends in Britain. She finished her MA in applied linguistics in September 2006 - the same time Yang took an MA in international human resources. They had valid visas until the end of this year.Police spoke to the family of Yang, who was also known as Kevin, over the phone in Dalian City, China.Wade appealed to Newcastle's Chinese community to come forward with potential reasons for the attack.Pastor Eddy Tang of the city's International Christian Fellowship, who is helping police liaise with members of the north-east's 10,000-strong Chinese student community, said: "People are very subdued at the moment. They are in mourning."
