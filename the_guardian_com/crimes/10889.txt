Plans by police to put posters of a "prolific" convicted burglar around his hometown were halted after the criminal claimed the campaign infringed his human rights. Essex planned to put up posters of Gary Ellis in prime spots in Brentwood today as part of a groundbreaking crime prevention scheme. But lawyers for Ellis, 27, who is serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for burglary and vehicle crime, won a high court injunction banning the posters. Police, who hoped the campaign would shame Ellis, discourage others from crime and show law-abiding citizens that criminals were being caught, may fight the court order. Forty posters were due to appear on commuter railway station platforms and at Little Chef restaurants this morning. Eight other forces were also planning campaigns. Sergeant Piers Quinnell, of Essex police, explained that Ellis had been chosen because he was a "prolific offender". He said the aim had not been to humiliate him but to make him think twice about reoffending. Sgt Quinnell said: "From our experiences few criminals will want to see their name and face displayed to their neighbours in this blatant manner." A risk assessment had been carried out before Ellis was chosen as a subject for the posters. This took into account the impact the campaign might have had on Ellis's mental health and examined whether it could make vulnerable relatives targets. But the campaign has attracted criticism from prisoners' support groups. Lucy Gampell, director of Action for Prisoners' Families, called the campaign "utterly misguided" and "a serious infringement on the right to privacy for the family of the prisoner". She said: "The real victims of this initiative will be the family members of this offender and other families to be named in future campaigns." Ellis was originally sentenced to three years for burglary and vehicle crime, but on December 9 he reappeared in court on further charges and had six months added to his sentence.
