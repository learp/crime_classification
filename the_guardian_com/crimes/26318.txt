Scientists at the Forensic Science Service (FSS) are set to develop technology that will allow police and governments around the world to improve the storage and analysis of DNA profiles for criminal investigations.The FSS was awarded Â£450,000 yesterday by the government's public sector research exploitation (PSRE) fund, to commercialise a technique, under development for several years, which cuts the time and effort needed to match DNA profiles from crime scenes with those in DNA databases."The UK has always been the world leader in DNA for criminal investigations and this money has given us the opportunity to take our skills and knowledge and develop tools for international laboratories who maybe don't have the background and resources," said Martin Bill, a research manager at the FSS."When we produce a DNA report, you get a trace or signal, which has to be converted into a person's profile," he said. "An expert may look at a fingerprint, for example, and look at a suspect's results and say that I believe these two images are the same and they'll do that on the basis of the pattern itself. DNA is also a pattern - it looks very different but similar approaches are applied."Twenty-nine projects received grants from the PSRE yesterday. They included a technique to fit marine animals with monitoring devices to track shipping, buoys and sea platforms; a new type of sealed oxygen-free picture frame developed by the Tate gallery to protect artworks from damage; and a project run by the National Physical Laboratory on better detection of waste emissions in industry.
