A police officer who claimed long-term sick leave for a back injury from the Greater Manchester force was yesterday convicted of deception after being caught in alternative employment as a parachute instructor.Former PC Andrew Hesketh, 43, went off sick in November 2000, claiming his injury had been aggravated by a slipping on a wet floor in Bury police station, Manchester crown court was told. After his sick pay was cut to half salary five months later, he started claiming incapacity benefit and attempted to sue the force for damages. But an anonymous tip-off led police to start inquiries that found Hesketh was teaching members of the public to jump from planes, 120 miles away in Lincolnshire. The inquiries revealed that Hesketh had given evidence to a coroner's inquest after one of his students died when a parachute jump went wrong. Hesketh collected £2,560 in benefits between May 2001 and January 2002. When he was notified by the benefits agency that he was under investigation, he informed it he had earned a further £1,950 as an instructor for Target Skysports during that time. He said it had not occurred to him this might affect his benefit claim as he was still unfit to undertake his normal job as a police officer. Hesketh formally resigned from the force in May 2002. Manchester police said if his legal bid for full pay had been successful he would have been paid a further £21,000 before retirement. Hesketh, of Hibaldstow, Lincolnshire, who had served as a police officer for 22 years, pleaded guilty to eight counts of deception. He will be sentenced next month. Chief Inspector Mike Freeman of Manchester's discipline and complaints branch said: "Today's result shows that we are determined to crack down on those who believe they can cheat the system for personal gain."
