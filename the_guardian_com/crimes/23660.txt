She was quite difficult to talk to, but the little girl always seemed to be happy."Another resident, who lives in nearby Sedgeborough Road said: "The little girl was really cute. She had curly brown hair and was beautiful. I used to see her playing with other girls and she was always pushing a little pink trolley. She did seem to be quite withdrawn.

There was a lot of banging, and we all knew that something was wrong."A post-mortem examination was due to take place to establish the cause of death."Enquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding her death are ongoing," a spokesman for Greater Manchester police said."A 31-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in police custody for questioning."
