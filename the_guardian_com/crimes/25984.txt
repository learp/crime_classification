A leading human rights expert, Anne Owers, was yesterday named by the home secretary, Jack Straw, as the surprise successor to Sir David Ramsbotham as chief inspector of prisons. Penal reformers praised Ms Owers's appointment, saying her respected campaigning record over the past 20 years, particularly on refugees and reform of the criminal justice system, proved she would bring the independence of mind needed to resist ministerial interference. She will take up the job in August. The appointment of Ms Owers as the first female chief inspector prompted comparisons with Elizabeth Fry, the 19th century Quaker whose prison inspections led to better conditions across Europe. She follows in the footsteps of Sir David and Sir Stephen Tumim who both clashed with home secretaries over their critical reports. Some critics had feared that Mr Straw would prune the powers of the chief inspector of prisons, but Ms Owers's appointment and unchanged terms of reference dispelled those anxieties. Ms Owers, 53, is the director of Justice, the all-party human rights and law reform organisation, in which job she has repeatedly expressed concern about Mr Straw's criminal justice policy. She played a key role on the government task force overseeing implementation of its human rights law, and also served on the commission on the future of multiethnic Britain. Ms Owers said: "I am not just interested in what happens to people in prison but also what happens to them afterwards." Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, welcomed the appointment, saying Ms Owers had great integrity. "It is a very brave and interesting appointment and I hope that Anne will continue the tradition set by Sir David."
