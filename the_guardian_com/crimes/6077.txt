Footballers who punch, elbow, headbutt or racially abuse each other during matches are likely to face criminal charges under new plans to treat on-field misbehaviour in sport as seriously as street brawls.The Crown Prosecution Service is drawing up a new policy to deal with such thuggery in response to growing public concern that sports people are usually fined and banned by their clubs and governing authorities rather than prosecuted.The controversy surrounding Lee Bowyer's fracas with Newcastle United team-mate Kieron Dyer during a game last month shows that a clear, consistent new approach is needed, said Nazir Afzal, the CPS's sector director for London West. 'The growing feeling among the public is that players are getting away with crime, that footballers in particular escape punishment by criminal justice, and that that's wrong,' he added.'It's unlawful to assault or racially abuse someone on the street, and we prosecute for that. But when it comes to events on the pitch, we don't get involved usually because there's no complaint and no police investigation.'The CPS's existing policy on violence on the pitch is 'very ad hoc; there's no clarity or consistency,' said Afzal.A new, clear policy, which would help police decide whether to investigate an incident and CPS lawyers to press charges or not, will be in place by the autumn. It will include guidance on how to treat incidents of elbowing, headbutting, spitting, verbal abuse of officials and racist insults by fans.'It's a widely and strongly held view that the law isn't deterring criminal activity on the pitch or punishing it', Afzal added. 'The CPS prosecutes in the public interest. If the public want us to get involved in this, we will.'The CPS will discuss the issue at a conference on sport and crime next month. Leaders of sports governing bodies will argue for the current system, where they discipline offenders, to continue.The Football Association said police did not need to take a closer interest in on-field controversies. 'Incidents such as violence on the pitch, and racist behaviour on and off the pitch are few and far between and we have a fast-track disciplinary process for dealing with them,' said a spokesman.Some senior officers believe players should be arrested if the police are to satisfy the government's desire to stamp out racism, and anti-social behaviour. After the Bowyer-Dyer bust-up, Chief Superintendent Chris Machell of Northumbria Police said: 'If it had been on Friday night in the city centre we would have had two people in the cells.' Both players were banned, and Bowyer fined Â£200,000.But other police chiefs say they have enough to deal with and, as one put it, 'football should not be expected to become like The Lion King'. However, forces already charge offenders over some incidents at amateur soccer matches.It is thought that no player has been prosecuted for on-field criminality since 1995 when Duncan Ferguson, then with Rangers, spent six weeks in jail after he headbutted an opponent, and Manchester United's Eric Cantona was given 120 hours community service for attacking a spectator.denis.campbell@observer.co.uk
