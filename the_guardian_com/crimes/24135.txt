David Cameron was said to be "pretty hacked off" yesterday after his bike was stolen from outside his local branch of Tesco.The Conservative leader left the bicycle locked to a short bollard outside the supermarket in Portobello Road, west London, at around 6.30pm on Wednesday while he was "picking up a few bits of salad". But when he found it had disappeared after the thief apparently lifted it clear.An onlooker, Gary Yankee, 38, told the Mirror that Cameron looked perplexed and repeatedly said: "But I locked it." Cameron yesterday appealed for the bike to be returned. "If anyone has seen it I would very much like it back. To me it was absolutely priceless," he told the London Evening Standard.He added: "I was cycling home and stopped to pick up some things for supper. I chained the bike through the wheel then put it around one of those bollard things. I have reported it using the police's new online facility but I'm not expecting to get it back any time soon." James Theophile, 60, spoke to Mr Cameron moments after he emerged from the Tesco store: "It was quite ridiculous of him to lock his bike against such a short post." A spokeswoman for Cameron said: "He was pretty hacked off and definitely not happy about the situation but it happens in London. He's going on holiday on Saturday so will probably wait until he gets back to get a new one. In the meantime maybe he'll borrow one."
