A rickshaw driver who caused £5,500 of damage to the Houses of Parliament during an overnight rooftop standoff has been spared further time in custody after admitting criminal damage and trespassing.Braydon Liam Anderson, 23, sparked a major security alert after he drunkenly scaled the building and ranted about supporting Islamic State (Isis) to bemused crowds.During the incident on 7 March, he yanked a golden ornamental crown from the top of a colonnade and used it to smash a stained glass window, shattered 11 other windows and battered a CCTV camera.He used a broom to jab at officers who attempted to rescue him from the 30-metre (100ft) high perch and told them he got there “by magic”. Anderson was first spotted on the parliament roof on CCTV just after 8pm and was bundled off at 5am the following morning after he fell asleep and was arrested.At least 26 people were sent to the scene, including trained negotiators, the London ambulance service and members of the rope-access support team.At Southwark crown court, Anderson admitted charges of criminal damage and trespassing on a protected site.He was jailed for 32 weeks but walked free s he had already spent more than half his sentence in custody following his March arrest. He was released on licence for the remainder of his term.Judge Michael Grieve noted that Anderson, who had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder, was “clearly highly intoxicated” throughout the protest and had no recollection of it.“This was a very serious public disturbance in which you put your own life at risk and caused very real disruption to scarce public resources,” he said.Man on Westminster roof charged trespass criminal damage “What I have to deal with is an alarming public disorder on your part, although of course I do so in the context of what I know about you.“It seems to me that you got very drunk on that particular day … and the result was you behaved in a frightening and dangerous way, as to which you yourself have very little recollection and can give no coherent explanation.” Karen Dempsey, for Anderson, said he had suffered previous manic episodes. “He does not accept in any way he is linked to, or has any sympathies with, Isis. On any view, he was clearly unwell at the time, 100ft up and not only endangering himself but others. Looking back at it, he finds it embarrassing. It all could have ended very badly.“The police did their job and he would like to thank them because without them he might not be here today.”Anderson, who is from Northampton and works in London’s West End as a rickshaw driver, suffered a “pretty torrid” upbringing, including the death of his father from an overdose when he was 12 and multiple suicide attemptson the part of his mother.His criminal record includes several incidents of violence as a juvenile and frequent breaches of licence and bail conditions.
