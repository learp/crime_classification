The neo-Nazi nail bomber David Copeland, who killed three people in a series of attacks, will stay in prison for at least 50 years, a high court judge ruled today.Copeland was originally sentenced to a minimum of 30 years for the bomb attacks, which happened in London in April 1999 and injured 139 people.However, Mr Justice Burton today announced the increased term after reviewing the case of "exceptional gravity" under new legislation.The explosions ripped through Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho during in the space of 13 days. The judge said the bombs, which were packed with nails in order to maximise injuries, were a "really exceptional case of deliberate, multiple murder".Andrea Dykes, 27, who was pregnant, and her friends John Light, 32, and 31-year-old Nik Moore, died in the final blast, at the mainly gay Admiral Duncan pub in Soho.Copeland, now 30, was given six life sentences at the Old Bailey in June 2000 for three counts of murder and three of causing explosions in order to endanger life.He stood trial for murder after the prosecution refused to accept his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia."A defence was put forward by the defendant of diminished responsibility, which the jury rejected, but it was in any event clear that the defendant suffered from a serious mental condition," Mr Justice Burton said."A consultant psychiatrist from Broadmoor hospital concluded that he suffered from 'a serious mental illness, the nature of which is psychotic and the diagnosis schizophrenia'."The judge said there was only one mitigating factor - the age of the defendant, who was 22 at the time of the blasts.It emerged that Copeland quit the British National party because he believed the far-right group was not hardline enough in refusing to countenance a "paramilitary struggle".A year later, he joined the National Socialist Movement, thought to be the political wing of Combat 18.Mr Justice Burton said Copeland could serve longer than 50 years if it was "necessary for the protection of the public"."When the defendant has served the minimum term, and if the parole board decides to direct his release, he will remain on licence for the rest of his life and may be recalled to prison at any time," he added.
