The former QE2 steward accused of murdering five Ipswich prostitutes insisted today it was merely a coincidence that he may have been with the women on the nights they disappearedSteve Wright told a jury it was a coincidence that he was familiar with the remote spots where four of the bodies were discovered, that his DNA was found on three of the dead women, and that fibres from his clothes, home or car were on all five bodies.Furthermore, the 49-year-old forklift truck driver said it was coincidental that blood from two of the women was on one of his coats.Wright denies murdering Gemma Adams, 25, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, 24, Annette Nicholls, 29, and Tania Nicol, 19, whose naked bodies were found in remote locations in Suffolk over a 10-day period in December 2006. Two were found with their bodies posed in a cruciform shape, with arms outstretched.Today at Ipswich crown court Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, suggested to Wright: "It would seem that in terms of picking up prostitutes in Ipswich you have been singularly unfortunate."Wright replied: "It would seem so, yes."The prosecutor then listed dozens of coincidences relating to the case, including the fact they disappeared shortly after Wright moved to a flat in Ipswich's red light district.Again and again the prosecutor asked: "Is that a coincidence?" More than 50 times Wright replied: "It would seem so, yes", "It would appear so, yes", or "If you say so, yes."The prosecutor went on: "The fact is, there are a number of coincidences in this case, aren't there Mr Wright? The fact is you murdered each of these women." Wright replied: "No, I did not."Wright told the jury he was not "any random psychopath" subjecting Ipswich prostitutes to "any campaign".He has admitted he could have had sex with Adams, Alderton, Clennell and Nicholls on the nights they were last seen. He also told jurors he may have picked up Nicol on the evening she vanished but denied having sex with her.Wright said he first became aware towards the end of November 2006 that prostitutes had gone missing from Ipswich's red light district. He said he did not tell police he had seen the women before their disappearance in case it led to his partner, Pam Wright, finding out he had used them for sex.Despite a growing police presence he continued to pick up prostitutes, saying: "I just had, at the back of my mind, it wouldn't affect me because I wasn't responsible for the deaths."The jury at Ipswich crown court heard that Wright's car was twice captured on CCTV in the town's red light district on the night Alderton disappeared. The Ford Mondeo was seen at 11.18pm on December 3 and heading out of Ipswich at 1.41am the next day.Wright said he was "going out for a drive because I couldn't sleep".Jurors were also told that a CCTV camera in the red light district had captured a woman approaching a dark car late on October 30, the night Nicol disappeared. Wright said it was "quite possible" that the footage showed Nicol walking towards his blue Mondeo.He said he had picked her up with a view to having sex but changed his mind because he was "put off" by "acne" on her face.Wright said he recalled having sex with Adams in his car in Ipswich in mid-November. He accepted it could have been on the night of November 14 or the early hours of November 15, when Adams disappeared.Wright said he recalled having sex with Alderton on the bedroom floor of his home. He admitted it could have been on the night of December 3, when she disappeared, but said he was "not really sure".Wright also admitted picking up Clennell and Nicholls at about the time they vanished, on December 10 and 8 respectively.Wright has said he had been paying for sex intermittently for 25 years but insists he had nothing to do with the disappearance and murder of the five women. The trial continues.
