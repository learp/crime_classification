Gratuitous violence used in street robberies in Britain is increasing and getting more severe, according to a study by criminologists based on interviews with 120 convicted violent offenders. The researchers report that the level of violence used is now often way beyond what is needed just to take cash, a mobile phone or other personal belongings from the victim.The study published today says that robberies are just as likely to be prompted by anger, the desire to start a fight, to increase "street cred", as an act of informal "street justice" - or even just for kicks.The findings explode the traditional explanation that street robbers are motivated mainly by financial gain and suggest the police also have to tackle cultural factors associated with criminal streetlife.Ministers and the police, faced with an 8% rise in street robberies in the last year to 98,000, have pointed to increased ownership of mobile phones and other high value gadgets. But the research suggests other factors are also at play.Professor Trevor Bennett of Glamorgan University and Dr Fiona Brookman interviewed the offenders in prison. A third said they had been arrested 50 times or more. More than 90% had used illegal drugs and a third said they were involved in gangs or criminal groups. A quarter said they had carried guns and a further 35% said they usually carried a knife.
