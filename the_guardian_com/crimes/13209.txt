Gary Glitter has appeared in court to deny a string of historical sex offences against three girls.The 70-year-old, from Marylebone in central London, faces 10 charges relating to alleged crimes from the 1970s and early 1980s.The former pop star, whose real name is Paul Gadd, listened to proceedings at south London’s Southwark crown court with the assistance of a hearing device and spoke to enter not guilty pleas to the charges.Sporting his trademark goatee, he arrived in court wearing a fedora hat, navy blue double-breasted jacket, grey trousers, a white shirt and a silk pink tie.Gadd is accused of one count of attempted rape and another of indecent assault on a girl under the age of 13 in 1975.In relation to a second complainant, he faces four charges of indecent assault when she was under the age of 13 in 1977.Gadd is also accused of plying the girl with drink with the intention to “stupefy or overpower” her to have sex with him between January and May 1977.He also faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with a girl aged under 13 between the same dates in relation to the same girl.In relation to a third complainant who was under the age of 16, he is charged with two counts of indecent assault between October 1979 and December 1980.Judge Alistair McCreath told Gadd he would face trial on 12 January in a case that is expected to last three weeks.The judge said: “You can go now on the same bail you have had up until now to return as and when you are required to but you are aware that your trial has been fixed for 12 January.”
