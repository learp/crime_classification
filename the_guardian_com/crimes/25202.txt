A businessman whose suburban lawns were home to peacocks and champagne parties was exposed yesterday as a benefits cheat who robbed taxpayers of thousands of pounds.Terence Pendleton created a double life by repeatedly lying to social services staff, posing as a depressed invalid living in a squalid bedsit when he was actually driving around in a Rolls-Royce.Pendleton, 46, was jailed for 27 months yesterday at Liverpool crown court for swindling more than £50,000 in fake benefit claims. Judge Henry Globe QC said the sum was "undoubtedly higher" but impossible to assess because government computer records pre-1999 had been erased.Pendleton was condemned for running a "prolonged and deliberate fraud" which fooled officials for more than seven years.The court heard he had had made a fortune from selling household tools at a market stall in Manchester, and had bought himself and his partner a £500,000 home in Knowsley village, where his neighbours included the Earl of Derby.But staff at Liverpool benefit offices were meeting a very different character, who was depressed, disabled and unable to work. The tale of woe earned Pendleton at least £22,420 in income support, £16,020 in housing benefits and £9,734 in disability allowance since 1998.Pendleton has paid back half of the falsely claimed benefits and the court heard that he had offered cheques yesterday morning to cover the outstanding balance.
