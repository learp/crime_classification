 Jacqui Smith's announcement today suggests that the political battle for control of the so-called "respect agenda" is back on.Part of Tony Blair's electoral success lay in his willingness to adopt an aggressive, "rightwing" approach to crime, particularly low-level disorder and street crime.Asbos, antisocial behaviour orders, were the centrepiece of his approach. In his final years he started talking about the "respect agenda" in an attempt to get all parts of Whitehall, not just the criminal justice system, to focus on dealing with the problem.When Gordon Brown took over, he abandoned the "respect" language. Partly this was for presentational reasons, but partly Brown and his allies, particularly Ed Balls, seemed to be cautious of criminalising young people for behaviour that they might in due course grow out of.Whatever their motives, the consequence was to leave a gap for the Tories to exploit. This is exactly what Boris Johnson did in his London mayoral campaign.Johnson focused on crime in London. He talked about knife crime and gun crime, but – in a policy platform that was rigorously tested on focus groups – he also talked about the aggravation caused by hooliganism and bad behaviour on the buses and the tube.Ken Livingstone, who seemed to have a more traditional Labour view that such low-level disorder constituted a relatively minor problem, had little to say in response. But if the results are anything to go by, Johnson's approach went down better with the voters.Since taking office on Monday, the Conservative mayor has stepped up the pressure on this issue.He has proposed sending disruptive teenagers to boot-camp-style schools at weekends, which, in a hijacking of Blair's language, he has described as "respect" schools.He has also announced a ban on alcohol on public transport. Questions have been raised about the feasibility of the ban, although the RMT union, which has described the policy as impractical, has also admitted that its members suffer violence at the hands of drunk passengers.Smith's announcement today is not directly comparable. But it does show that, on the subject of unruly teenagers, the government does have something to say.
