An act of parliament passed in 1984 to police the DVD and video games classification system, which has led to thousands of prosecutions, was never enforceable because the government of the time did not inform the European Commission, it emerged last night.The government admitted that the previous Thatcher administration had never informed the Commission of the existence of the Video Recordings Act 1984, as required under an EC directive, meaning that the criminal elements of it were never enforceable in British courts.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said that since 1995, 1,995 people had been prosecuted under the act – which imposes the statutory age classifications and requirements for videos, DVDs and some video games – with 1,703 of those found guilty. It is thought a similar number were taken to court in the preceding 13 years.While nobody was jailed, for offences such as supplying video recordings of unclassified work and video recording unclassified work for the purposes of supply, fines thought to average between £300 to £400 were imposed on those found guilty.However, it said that those already found guilty would have no legal recompense."Those previously prosecuted will be unable to overturn their convictions," a spokeswoman said.She added that the government would not proceed with any more prosecutions under the act had been re-enacted.In a letter to retailers, Barbara Follett MP, the parliamentary under secretary in the DCMS, said the "unfortunate situation" had been discovered during preparatory work for the forthcoming digital economy bill, which will establish a new video games classification system.She asked stores to continue to abide by the age classification system on a voluntary basis until the matter was rectified as soon as possible."We are doing all we can to ensure that there is a robust system of classification for films and video games," she said.
