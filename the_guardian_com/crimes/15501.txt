More than 1,500 motorists have been stopped and questioned in the hunt for the missing Yorkshire schoolgirl Shannon Matthews, police said today.The news came as the search for the nine-year-old entered its second week.Officers questioned the motorists yesterday as police launched a major publicity drive a week after Shannon failed to her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, from school.Detectives spoke to motorists at five locations near to where Shannon was last seen, as well as putting up large electronic boards appealing for information from the public.Officers were preparing to visit more than 2,000 houses in the Dewsbury area.The incident room has received over 500 calls since news of Shannon's disappearance was made public last Wednesday."What concerns me greatly at this point is that Shannon is a vulnerable nine-year-old who may have fallen into the wrong hands," Detective Inspector Andy Brennan, leading the investigation, told reporters yesterday.Brennan appealed to anyone who was in the Dewsbury Moor area on February 19 to think back to anything unusual they had seen either that day or since. "Did you see anybody in the area who may have looked out of place or you may not have seen previously?" he asked. "Similarly, did you see any vehicles in the area that you haven't seen previously or looked out of place?" He said officers remained "gravely concerned" for the schoolgirl.Yesterday, Shannon's mother, Karen Matthews, and her stepfather, Craig Meehan, joined around 300 local people to march through the streets near their home.They carried flowers and a large banner asking for help in finding Shannon, chanting her name and releasing multicoloured balloons outside their home.Shannon was reported missing by her family last Tuesday evening after failing to return home from West Moor Junior School. She was last seen as she left school at 3.10pm.
