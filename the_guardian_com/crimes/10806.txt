Police are investigating whether any criminal offence took place over the £50,000 loan the former Northern Ireland MP Iris Robinson secured for her teenage lover to help open a restaurant.The investigation into the financial dealings of Robinson, who was expelled from the Democratic Unionist Party and quit as an MP after the scandal broke, will be carried out by the organised crime branch of the police service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).Robinson is alleged to have obtained £25,000 each from the two wealthy Northern Ireland property developers, Kenny Campbell and Fred Fraser, to help her lover Kirk McCambley, then 19, establish his business, the Lock Keeper's Inn on the banks of the river Lagan in south Belfast. She is alleged to have kept £5,000 for herself.Robinson, the former MP for Strangford, is currently undergoing acute psychiatric treatment after trying to kill herself last March when she confessed to her husband Peter Robinson, the leader of the DUP, about her affair.Mr Robinson stepped down as Northern Ireland's first minister in the wake of the scandal and is under investigation over allegations that he failed to report the loan given to his wife, which is a breach of the ministerial code, and also broke the pledge of office. He has insisted he is confident his name will be cleared.It has also emerged that Mrs Robinson lobbied for three planning applications on behalf of the two developers.Fraser died last year. McCambley, now 21, has repaid £20,000 to Campbell. Campbell has said he contributed between £4,000 and £5,000 to the DUP several years ago, but denied personally donating any money to Robinson or her husband. It is alleged that she did not declare her interest in McCambley's business affairs.In a statement the PSNI said its "remit is to investigate potential criminality, nothing else"."Police will be making no further comment on the investigation at this time," it added.
