The Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate for London, Brian Paddick, pledged to cut crime in the capital by a fifth over four years as he launched his campaign today.The former Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner said he would take personal command of the fight against crime by chairing the Metropolitan police authority as mayor."I have a track record of performance against Londoners' number one concern: crime," he told a news conference at Brixton town hall."Ken Livingstone has said he cannot do anything about gun and knife crime. Boris Johnson has admitted he doesn't have the experience to deal with it. It's time for someone who can stop the slaughter on our streets."Paddick, who resigned from the Met last May over several disagreements with them including the De Menezes shooting, said that if he failed to cut crime by 20% while he was in office he would not stand for re-election."This weekend saw the third stabbing in a year which is barely two weeks old. Another young life lost, just across the road from where we are standing. It's time for the bloodshed to stop," Paddick said.On transport, Paddick said he wanted to change the Oyster card rules so that the card would allow unlimited travel for one hour. He also pledged to increase the reliability of tube and bus travel.On housing, he said money spent on temporary accommodation should instead be used to build permanent social housing.The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said Paddick cut crime by almost a fifth when he was a police commander in Lambeth."This man is a leader and an achiever. He is serious, focused and determined to deliver the results that Londoners need," Clegg said.
