In a letter to Education Guardian today, a senior doctor has admitted he burgled his school twice aged 16, but that it did not stop him having a successful medical career.The consultant paediatrician, who is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, made the confession in light of the case of an 18-year-old who has had his offer of a place at medical school withdrawn because he admitted committing a burglary two years previously.The paediatrician, who does not want to be named, said he stole in to his school tuck shop twice at night and took Â£40 from the till with two accomplices in 1943.One of his accomplices also went into medicine.They were threatened with expulsion but eventually pardoned by their headteacher. He was speaking after it emerged that Majid Ahmed, a teenager from one of the poorest parts of England, had been barred from Imperial College London Medical School for admitting he committed a burglary aged 16. Ahmed was given a four-month referral order for community service. Since his crime, he has obtained four As at A-level and turned his life around by working with disability charities and in GP surgeries.The paediatrician said: "I think that Majid could still become a successful doctor. At the age of 16 one is allowed to go astray and one is quite capable of redemption. I think it completely unfair to rule him out as a doctor because of this."He said he would not be surprised if others in the medical profession had committed similar crimes.In another letter, a university professor also told the Guardian he took part in an "abortive burglary" in his student days.The professor, also anonymous, said: "I am now a university professor and my accomplices have retired with distinctions from their posts as a senior civil servant and head of human resources for a large multi-national firm. Presumably Imperial College would have preferred us to do something more humble?"Imperial College said it had made its decision to withdraw the offer to uphold trust in the medical profession.But would you be treated by a doctor who had committed theft or burglary in their teens? Or did you stray off the tracks before building a career in academia or medicine? Have your say.
