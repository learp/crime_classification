The trial of two former lovers charged with the murder of British student Meredith Kercher will be held in public, an Italian judge ruled today.American Amanda Knox, 21, and Italian Raffaele Sollecito, 24, appeared in front of an eight-member jury in a courthouse in the university town of Perugia at the opening of the trial this morning.A lawyer for Kercher's family sought to have the proceedings closed to the public and media to prevent the publication of sensitive evidence and protect the victim's dignity, but the presiding judge ruled the trial would remain open.He reserved the right to hold some sessions behind closed doors and will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to do this.Knox and Sollecito are accused of murdering and sexually assaulting the British student.One man has already been convicted of the killing. Last October, Rudy Guede, a 21-year-old born in the Ivory Coast, was given a 30-year sentence after opting for a fast-track trial.Giuliano Mignini, the prosecutor who has overseen the investigation, claims that Knox, from Seattle, and Sollecito, a computer studies graduate, played an active part in the killing. Kercher's half-naked body was found in a pool of blood on 2 November 2007, in a house she shared with Knox and others.The Leeds university student, who was in Italy on an exchange scheme, bled to death after 47 bruises and knife wounds were inflicted on her body, according to forensic evidence.Earlier this week, the Kercher family applied to have a book about the case impounded.The book, by the Corriere della Sera reporter Fiorenza Sarzanini, is based largely on Knox's diaries, which were confiscated by the police. The book depicts the student's lifestyle in Perugia, where students at the University of Foreigners have a reputation for partying and drinking.Sarzazini said yesterday she had been called to a meeting at Italy's privacy safeguards authority on 26 January. Her lawyers have argued that, since the diaries form part of the evidence submitted to the court, their publication cannot prejudice the trial.The outcome may not be known until the autumn, as more than 250 witnesses have been lined up. In Italy, trials are not held continuously through the week; in this case, there are likely to be between one and two hearings a week.Knox and Sollecito, who have been held in jail for the last 14 months, were indicted at a pre-trial hearing that ended on 28 October. They deny involvement in Meredith's murder.The trial was adjourned until 6 February. In line with Italian practice, it will not be held continuously and is expected to last until at least the summer.
