The constitutional affairs minister today suggested a scheme using victim impact statements in courtrooms should be extended.The minister, Harriet Harman, said the pilot scheme that was first introduced last April, may be extended to other crimes such as death by dangerous driving.She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the scheme could also be rolled out to more courts than the five in which it now operates: Old Bailey, Birmingham, Manchester Crown Square, Cardiff and Winchester.Since the scheme was introduced, 21 families of murder or manslaughter victims have made statements describing their loss.High profile examples have included Adele Eastman, the fianc√©e of the murdered London lawyer Tom ap Rhys Pryce, who said before his killers were sentenced at the Old Bailey that her heart had been "ripped out" and torn into "little pieces" by his death.On the same radio programme, a judge attacked the use of victim impact statements in courtrooms, saying they misled families into believing they could influence sentencing decisions.Judge John Samuels, of the council of circuit judges, said allowing families to make statements might give them the impression they could influence the judge's sentence when that was not the case.The use of the statements raised the emotional temperature in courts and complicated judges' responsibilities, he said.Judge Samuels said: "It is the judge's responsibility to lower the emotional temperature. Judges are human and to impose on the judge an increase in the emotional atmosphere as a result of this kind of response is to make the judge's role that much more difficult."The problem that we saw with the scheme, and which has not yet been sufficiently addressed to our satisfaction, is that the presence of a victim advocate suggests to the public - although this was not the overall intention of the scheme as we understand it - that the advocate can influence the judge in his sentencing," he said."We think that would be quite wrong, because a judge must impose the appropriate sentence for the case which comes before him."Ms Harman defended the "experiment", saying it was "patronising" to suggest families would not understand that the judge must take a whole range of other factors into account when sentencing."Listening to what the victims' relatives said before this experiment, they say it made it worse for them that nobody gave them the opportunity to speak about the person who died."Let's take the view about whether it is made worse emotionally from the people who are most affected by crime, which is the victims' relatives, not the judge."According to the Department for Constitutional Affairs, the statements are designed to give the offender, the trial judge, barristers, the police, prosecutors and the public an opportunity to understand the crime from the perspective of the victim's relatives.Yvonne Davenport, whose partner Lee Pickles was murdered in Manchester in 2006, told Today: "People need to hear the real effects of what (the murderer) has caused. He has not just taken that person's life; he has devastated an entire family."You should have a choice and the right to say this crime has done this to my life."
