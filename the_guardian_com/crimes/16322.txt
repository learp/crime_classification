Conditions at Britain's most overcrowded prison are likely to get even worse as it struggles with "decrepit" buildings, a government inspector warned today.The chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, said numbers at Preston prison were unlikely to go down despite the severe problems it experiences due to its large population.She said: "Preston's problems are common to many local prisons: historic, somewhat decrepit buildings, underinvestment, a history of poor industrial relations, and an ever-rising number of prisoners, many of them challenging and needy."Her report revealed the prison has a weak anti-bullying policy, poor strategies for dealing with potential suicides and a lack of healthcare resources, particularly for severely disturbed inmates. Inspectors found chronic staffing problems and said that around a third of prisoners were unemployed, with few opportunities for training.But the report praised the relationship between inmates and staff, as well as race relations and resettlement work at the jail."It is commendable that Preston has made some headway, and has a clear vision of what needs to be done to provide positive outcomes for its prisoners," it said. "It deserves some breathing space to achieve this, but that is what it is unlikely to get, given the current population crisis."  Responding to the report, Phil Wheatley, director general of the prison service, said: "The chief inspector rightly recognises that the physical environment of Preston is not ideal, and suffers from all the problems associated with prisons built in the Victorian era."He said that many of the problems identified were being tackled.Mr Wheatley said: "Healthcare will be fully staffed by the middle of January, there is now an integrated mental health in-reach team and a large number of prison staff have been trained in mental health awareness for prisoners." Brian Caton, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said: "Preston was the most overcrowded prison in Europe at one point and is still the most overcrowded in the country."Many of the Victorian prison buildings are crumbling and can't cope. There has been poor maintenance for years and some of them are in a real state. He added: "For officers there, walking into work each day is like being slapped in the face." The Home Office confirmed there were no plans to carry out improvements on all older prison buildings, but said repairs and renovation at each site were assessed individually.
