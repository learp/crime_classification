A murder investigation is under way after an elderly couple died in a suspected arson attack on their home early on Saturday morning.Albert and Kath Adams, both 77, were asleep in their sheltered housing in Rugby, Warwickshire, when a mobility scooter parked outside was set on fire. The flames spread to the property, engulfing the house, and the couple suffered severe smoke inhalation.Albert Adams died in hospital a few hours later and his wife died on Sunday afternoon.Police said today that a second fire, started in the early hours of yesterday morning, may be connected to the attack on the Adams's home. No one was injured in the second blaze, but both incidents are being treated as arson.On Sunday one local resident told reporters that the couple had previously tackled teenagers in the area who had been playing loud music and threatening elderly residents."Although there has been speculation about the incident being linked to antisocial behaviour in the area, at this stage we have no evidence to substantiate that," said DCI James Essex, from Warwickshire police."No calls have been made to us to report incidents of this nature and no members of the public have come forward to us to confirm this supposed link."A police statement said detectives are keeping "an open mind" regarding the motive behind the fire.Steven Shanahan, head of housing for Rugby borough council, said he was "appalled" by the two incidents."Clearly this is a distressing time for them, so patrols by the police and the council's community safety wardens will focus on sheltered housing in the borough, and our wardens are working hard to reassure tenants," he said.
