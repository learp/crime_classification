Police were last night hunting a gang of art thieves who raided a Manchester gallery and stole paintings by Van Gogh, Picasso and Gauguin valued at an estimated Â£1m.The robbery was discovered at noon yesterday when staff at the Whitworth Art Gallery arrived for work. It is thought that the paintings had been taken overnight. "This was a well-planned theft and we have launched a major inquiry. We are now trying to piece together what has happened," a spokeswoman for Greater Manchester police said. The Fortifications of Paris with Houses by Vincent Van Gogh, Poverty painted by Pablo Picasso, and Paul Gauguin's Tahitian Landscape had been hanging on the same wall on the ground floor of the world renowned gallery, near Manchester city centre.It is understood that all paintings were often on loan to other galleries and it was rare for them to be on view together. Police declined to say how the robbery had been staged but indicated that damage to the premises had been minimal. Although the motives behind the theft remained unclear, art experts said paintings of this kind were usually stolen for ransom because their high profile made it too difficult to sell them on the open market. The missing paintings were part of the Whitworth's collection of 40,000 works of art, which is designated as of national significance. It includes 3,000 watercolours, mainly by British artists, including Turner. The gallery also has an important collection of textiles and wallpaper.
