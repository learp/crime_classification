Around 800 police officers raided more than 50 properties today as part of a major drugs and stolen property operation.Around 25 people were arrested as part of Operation Phoenix - the largest pre-planned drugs and stolen goods operation to take place in Hampshire.Police officers and staff, including specialist house entry teams, took part in the raids across Southampton, London, Solihull and Slough.The operation followed an 18-month investigation run by officers from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, involving staff from Southampton OCU (Operational Command Unit).It targeted criminal activity, including the supply of Class A drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, money laundering, theft and firearms offences. Hampshire police raided 37 premises in the Southampton area after 5am. Officers from the Metropolitan police executed warrants at 15 addresses in London, and one address in both the Solihull and Slough areas.Those arrested in Hampshire were taken to police stations around the county and the remainder were due to be transferred into Hampshire custody.The first two phases of Operation Phoenix took place in October 2005 and January 2006, when a total of 88 people were convicted of a variety of drugs and theft offences.
