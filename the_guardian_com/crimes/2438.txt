Enhanced powers to tackle fly-tipping, litter, and flyposting come into force today as a new study urges ministers to focus on the causes of such antisocial behaviour and not just the symptoms.Under the Clean Neighbourhoods Act people caught dumping cars could face a maximum fine of Â£50,000 or five years in prison. The act reminds people that chewing gum and cigarette butts are litter and there are penalties for dropping them on the street. It also gives new powers to councils to deal with fly-posting, and the sale or repair of vehicles on the road.The act comes into force on the day when research for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that two-thirds of people thought preventative action was the best way of dealing with antisocial behaviour.Only 20% of those asked thought tougher action on perpetrators was the preferred solution.The study, carried out by the institute for criminal policy research (ICPR) at King's College, London, collated a survey of adults by the Office for National Statistics with the results of focus group discussions in three neighbourhoods.It found that antisocial behaviour was a significant problem for one in five people, who said rowdy teenagers had a "fairly big" or "big" impact on their lives. Young people causing trouble were seen as the biggest concern, with problems of drug and alcohol abuse evident on the street. In the three neighbourhoods, a combination of preventative action and enforcement when necessary was being carried out.The study endorsed this combined approach, which only resorted to antisocial behaviour orders (asbos) when "less draconian" options had failed. Professor Mike Hough, the director of the ICPR and one of the authors of the study, said the solution to antisocial behaviour was more complex than the government's current stance suggested."The public want policymakers to balance tough enforcement with strong, high profile action to prevent problems and offer young people constructive alternatives to hanging around on the streets," he said.Prof Hough added: "Visible enforcement action may provide leverage to break the vicious cycle, but measures to rebuild the community's own capacity to respond are crucial."A Home Office spokesman defended the government's stance. He said: "The home affairs select committee inquiry into antisocial behaviour said recently that the overall balance of the government's strategy is about right."It's important to bear in mind asbos are, in fact, preventative orders, requiring individuals to refrain from antisocial behaviour. They are not criminal penalties and are designed to keep people out of the criminal justice system where possible." The spokesman said there were many other options available, including staged warnings, acceptable behaviour agreements, fixed penalty notices and various parenting interventions.
