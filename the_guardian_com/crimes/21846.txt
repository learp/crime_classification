Tony Martin, who was jailed for shooting dead a teenage burglar at his farm, was arrested yesterday on suspicion of stealing number plates.Mr Martin, who was released from jail in July after serving three years for shooting 16-year-old Fred Barras, was arrested on his way to a farm show after police found the number plates in the back of his car. Mr Martin was kept at a police station for eight hours before being released on police bail. Last night Cambridgeshire police said a 59-year-old man from the Wisbech area had been arrested for suspected theft of number plates. Mr Martin was jailed for life for shooting Barras and wounding another burglar, Brendon Fearon, during a bungled raid on his farm in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk, in August 1999. His sentence was reduced to five years for manslaughter on appeal. He could have been released sooner but his refusal to express remorse meant he was declared unsuitable for early parole and he spent another six months in jail. Fearon attempted to sue Mr Martin but later dropped his claim. Last night a friend of Mr Martin told the Daily Mirror: "Tony is in good spirits considering the circumstances. But not surprisingly he is rather unhappy about all this." Since his release Mr Martin has become a figure head for campaigners protecting homeowners rights. His period of probation expired in December so even if he were convicted of any offence he would no longer have to return to jail.
