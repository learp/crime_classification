Concerns over moonlighting police officers intensified yesterday as it emerged nearly 80 in Norfolk alone have second jobs.Inspectors and sergeants are among those supplementing their income with extra positions which have included work as caretakers and car salesmen.According to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act, 79 police officers, including 22 sergeants, seven inspectors and two superintendents, currently have second jobs.Norfolk Police Authority chairman Malcolm Reeve defended the situation by arguing that 'a police officer is like anyone else and has got to live and pay the bills'.Reeve blamed the government's decision in 1994 to remove rent and housing allowance. 'Many probationers just could not make ends meet. As long as the job is allowed by the chief constable, then there is no issue,' he said.Last month Essex Police said that more than 200 of their 3,300 officers had second jobs, with some working as magicians, therapists, entertainers and florists. The Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, recently pledged to work with the Police Federation on how to cut the need for officers to take second jobs.
