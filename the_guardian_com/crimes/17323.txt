The number of people convicted of cruelty to animals rose by 24% last year, the RSPCA says today, as it blames "our throwaway society" for making dogs, cats and horses helpless victims. Fifty-four people were given prison sentences, including an owner who stabbed and tortured his 10-month collie dog and another who kicked his cat to death because she had muddy paws.In all, 1,149 people were convicted in 2007 for crimes against animals, up from 927 the previous year, the RSPCA said. Convictions for cruelty to dogs went up by 34% to 1,197, to cats by 15% to 277 and to horses by 13% to 119. The number of jail terms rose by 42% while suspended prison sentences rose by 39% to 71.Other cases reported by the charity included the decaying body of a starved dog found chained to a radiator and a dog with a deep neck wound from a collar more than four inches smaller than its neck. But there were remarkable survival stories too - for the tortured collie, who also suffered broken legs and ribs, for the Staffordshire bull terrier whose owners cut off its ears and for the dog so thin that RSPCA staff could not identify its breed. All are enjoying new lives in new homes.New animal welfare legislation allows the charity to step in earlier. There was an increase in the number of orders banning those convicted of cruelty from keeping animals. Magistrates now have to give reasons for not disqualifying owners. There were 861 such orders issued by the courts last year, an increase of 28%.Tim Wass, chief officer of the RSPCA inspectorate, said: "These animals are the helpless victims of our affluent, throwaway society."
