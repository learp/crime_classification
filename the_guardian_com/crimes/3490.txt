An 18-year-old man who was arrested after an incident that prompted two evacuations and a controlled explosion at a university has been charged with manufacturing an explosive substance.The teenager was one of two Russian students from Newcastle University who were arrested after "suspicious material" was found last week.The north-east counter-terrorism unit confirmed on Monday night he had been charged with the manufacture of an explosive substance, contrary to section 4 (1) of the Explosive Substances Act 1883, and possession of a bladed article in a public place.He has been remanded in custody and will appear before magistrates in London on Tuesday. The venue for the hearing has yet to be confirmed.The other student arrested last week, also an 18-year-old man, remains on police bail pending further inquiries.Police asked students to leave their accommodation on Tuesday last week and carried out a controlled explosion.Roads surrounding the INTO accommodation building were closed off as specialist bomb disposal experts were called in. A specialist robot was seen entering the building and, eventually, a controlled explosion was carried out on Newcastle Town Moor.A second temporary evacuation was ordered on Thursday but students were allowed to return after searches concluded.
