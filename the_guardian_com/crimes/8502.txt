Two 11-year-old boys who were convicted of trying to rape an eight-year-old girl were each given a three-year supervision order at the Old Bailey today.They were aged 10 last October when the girl told her mother that she had been assaulted in Hayes, west London.In May the boys became two of the country's youngest convicted sex offenders after a jury found them guilty of two charges of attempted rape but cleared them of rape.Jurors rejected claims by defence barristers that the boys – one of whom was described as a model pupil by his teacher – were just being naughty and playing a game like doctors and nurses.Sentencing them today, Mr Justice Saunders said: "I do not accept that what happened was a game, but I do accept that you did not realise how serious what you were doing was."But he added that a custodial sentence would be counter-productive and not in the best interests of the boys.The boys, who had been told in advance that they would not be locked up, chatted excitedly and looked around the court as they were brought in at the start of today's brief hearing.The judge told them: "Because you are so young, the court is mainly concerned with doing what is best for you with the aim of ensuring that you do not do anything like it again."That means you must be helped to understand the seriousness of what happened."The best way to achieve this is to give you the assistance of trained social workers to help, guide and educate you. This will also help your family come to terms with what happened."He said the sentences in the case of each boy would be a three-year supervision order but that if "satisfactory progress" was made this could be shortened.There would also be a "parenting order" for 12 months.The judge said both boys would be ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for two and a half years but directed that "notification" requirements would be placed on their mothers and not the children.But he added that it was important that the victim and her ordeal were not overlooked in the administration of justice."Everyone will sympathise with her for what she has gone through," he said."I hope that she will be given all the help that she undoubtedly deserves to get over her experiences. I very much hope that she and her family will not be forgotten by the authorities."During the trial jurors heard how the boys had lured the girl into some flats, then taken her into a stairwell, a lift and a bin shed before continuing their assault in a field.At one point, the girl told the court, they threw her scooter into a bush and refused to retrieve it unless she did what they told her.The jury was also shown a recorded interview shot by trained police officers the day after the alleged assaults. In it, the girl played with a teddy bear while she told one of the officers how the boys had exposed themselves, pulled down her pants and raped her.However, the girl's story changed when she was cross-examined via videolink. She said she had lied to her mother as she had been "naughty" and was worried she would not get any sweets.In a series of questions, she was asked if any parts of her body had been penetrated by the boys. She replied each time: "No."But the judge refused to throw out the case, saying it was up to the jury to decide whether a witness could be trusted.The case drew heavy criticism from campaigners, who called for changes in the way children are dealt with in criminal courts.Michele Elliott, director of children's charity Kidscape, described the legal process to which the children had been subjected as horrific, adding: "I think it reflects horribly on our whole system that a case like this with children should be tried in this way."NSPCC chief executive Andrew Flanagan said today: "The circumstances of this case are such that the age of criminal responsibility should now be reviewed by the Government."Mr Justice Saunders also agreed that lessons needed to be learned from the trial.Although special measures were put in place for the two-week hearing — the judge and barristers dispensed with their wigs and gowns and the defendants were allowed to sit next to their mothers and solicitors in the well of the court, rather than the dock — Saunders said the system was not perfect.This afternoon, he said that the case had provoked a debate on a variety of issues."A number of the questions which arise from the case are not for a judge to comment on," he said. "For example the issue of the proper age of criminal responsibility is a political question and one which parliament had already decided. Similarly, questions as to whether to prosecute and if so, for what charge, are questions for the Crown Prosecution Service, not for judges."What is of concern to judges is that justice is done if and when it is necessary to bring young people to court — and that includes how they are treated."He noted comments made by Lord Justice Hughes at the court of appeal last month — where the boys lost their bid to overturn their convictions — and said he would be writing to the Lord Chief Justice with his own observations on the case."The court of appeal has already expressed its surprise that this case was tried in the crown court rather than in the youth court, which is better equipped to deal with cases involving young children," he said."Without adding to what the court of appeal has said about this case, there will be very rare cases involving allegations against young children which have to come to the crown court for trial. It is important that we learn from this case what lessons we can to ensure that where that is necessary the trial is dealt with as fairly as is possible."
