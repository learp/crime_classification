Three members of a "Fagin-style" gang of ram raiders, who targeted a glittering £5m display at the exclusive jewellers Tiffany's, were each jailed for five years today.They were part of a 50-strong criminal collective behind 47 similar crimes, London's Blackfriars crown court heard. Their orders came from an identified criminal mastermind who "meticulously planned and carefully crafted" lucrative thefts thought to have made him a millionaire.But had his foot soldiers involved in the latest incident got away with the valuable haul on show at the international chain's flagship London store in Sloane Street last October, their take would probably have been no more than £200 apiece.In the event, not only were police lying in wait for the sledgehammer-wielding gang, but one of them died in the short high speed chase that followed. The court heard that Misha Neering's getaway motorbike spun out of control, hurtling into the path of a pursuing patrol car. Another man on the bike was "seriously injured".Philip Bennett, prosecuting, said that suspect - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had since recovered sufficiently for "proceedings to continue against him". Since the incident, the epidemic of raids has stopped.In the dock were 19-year-olds Anthony Bates and James Nicholson from Islington, north London, and Nicholas Walters, 21, of no fixed address.All admitted one count of burglary, while Walters, who was also involved in a high speed police pursuit, further pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving. In addition, Bates and Nicholson asked for four similar jewellery thefts to be taken into consideration.Passing sentence Judge Deva Pillay told the trio it was clear the Tiffany's raid had been "expertly executed".He said he agreed with the lord chief justice, Lord Taylor, who described a similar incident as an "affront to civilised society".He had gone on to brand it an "outrageous offence" which "transcends the ordinary type of attempted theft".Judge Pillay said: "With that judgment I respectfully agree."He said the minimum custodial sentence he could impose was five years in each case. Bates and Nicholson would serve the first part of it in a young offenders institution before being moved to an adult prison.Walters was told that, in addition, he would not only be banned from driving for a similar period but would also have to take an extended test before being allowed back behind the wheel of a car.
