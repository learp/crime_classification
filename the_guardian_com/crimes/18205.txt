Teachers have been asked to go on night-time patrols with police officers to help them identify young troublemakers. The Lancashire Constabulary initiative - Operation Summer Nights - will try to clamp down on children as young as nine in Burnley and Pendle from Friday. The officers are taking seriously the prime minister's message of bringing back respect for authority.But the move has caused concern among teachers. Ken Pearson, secretary of Burnley branch of the National Union of Teachers, said: "I think it could be quite a good idea if it is done properly - but this was just dropped on us. They are expecting teachers to give up part of their holiday time and make themselves available."
