Â· The first two days of the trial were taken up with legal arguments.On day three, the first day of evidence, the prosecution opened its case.Former school caretaker Ian Huntley is "unlikely to dispute" that Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells died in his home at Soham, Cambridgeshire, when they were there alone with him, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Huntley is also unlikely to deny that he moved the girls' bodies to where they were found, the court heard. In the day's most dramatic moment, Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said: "We understand from those representing Huntley that it is unlikely to be disputed that the girls went to his home shortly after 6.30pm that evening, that Huntley was the only other person there, and that they died within a short time of going into his home."Mr Huntley, 29, denies murdering the two 10-year-old friends.Maxine Carr, 26, his former girlfriend, "repeatedly lied" in helping him with a dishonest account of events, Mr Latham said. Ms Carr, who sat in the dock with Mr Huntley, with the two separated by a security guard, denies conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and assisting an offender. Mr Latham said the girls, described as "two little Beckhams" in their football shirts by one witness, "fell into the hands" of Huntley shortly after they left Holly's home in Soham on Sunday August 4 last year. Mr Huntley then "chose to murder them" for a reason "known only to him", the barrister said. Mr Huntley was "calculating and manipulative" and Ms Carr was "cold-blooded" in helping him with a false account, the jury was told. Mr Latham outlined the movements of Holly and Jessica, and later those of Ms Carr, who was 110 miles away visiting family in Grimsby. He then described Mr Huntley's movements. Mr Huntley had not been seen for around four hours until 10.30pm, when he appeared on the fringes of the search for the girls. He later showed a police officer around the school at around 1am. The trial continues.
