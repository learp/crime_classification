Liberal Democrats have openly warned David Cameron for the first time that any decision not to scrap control orders would jeopardise the coalition's civil liberties credentials.Senior Lib Dem backbenchers and peers have also written to Downing Street pressing for the limit on detention without charge to be cut from 28 days to 14 days, arguing that two-weeks is a "wholly adequate" time to bring charges, even in the most complicated cases of multiple terrorist attacks.The issue of control orders, under which terror suspects are placed under "virtual house arrest", is the one of the most sensitive civil liberties issues for ministers as opposition to Labour's authoritarian counter-terror policy was seen as part of the glue that made the coalition possible.The intervention from Lib Dem MPs and peers comes after an intense lobbying campaign by the security services. Jonathan Evans, the head of MI5, recently wrote to Cameron saying that he could not guarantee the safety of the public if the control order regime was scrapped. Whitehall officials confirm that MI5 has played its "full part in the debate".The review of counter-terrorism powers was set up immediately after the general election, with a specific remit to look urgently at the future of control orders and the wider matter of counter-terror measures and programmes.The home secretary, Theresa May, was thought to have recently reluctantly swung behind the retention of control orders as a necessary evil despite repeated interventions by Nick Clegg, whose Lib Dem manifesto clearly called for them to be scrapped.But with the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, and the attorney-general, Dominic Grieve, both believed to be sceptical over their effectiveness, it is believed that fresh complications have emerged in the internal Whitehall debate over their future. It is now believed that final decisions on the review of counter-terror powers have been delayed until the second week of December at the earliest.The home secretary is due to make her first major speech on counter-terrorism next week but only further details on the review of the future of the prevent anti-radicalisation programme are expected to emerge.Tom Brake MP, the co-chair of the Lib Dem home affairs parliamentary party committee, and author of the party's letter to Cameron, said there was no evidence to suggest that control orders were effective in preventing terrorism. The other signatories of the letter, Baroness Sally Hamwee, and Lord Martin Thomas, represent Lib Dem peers."We have been delighted by the coalition government's commitment to reclaiming our civil liberties," they told the PM. "You will appreciate of course that the continuance of control orders is quite inconsistent with the thrust of those assurances. In principle, as we argued many times during the administration of the last government, control orders should be scrapped."They say that even if a marginal security advantage is gained from their use, it would be wholly negated by their adverse impact on Muslims both as individuals and as a community.The Lib Dems argue that an alternative package of measures including the withdrawal of travel rights, more surveillance, unannounced home visits, and the use of intercept evidence to enable more prosecutions to go ahead would be more effective and have less impact on civil liberties.There is much greater consensus among coalition ministers over the proposal to reduce the current limit of 28 days detention without charge to 14 days â€“ which the home secretary herself has already said she favours.The Lib Dem MPs and peers strongly endorse this move. But they go on to warn that it would not be acceptable for them to be accompanied by a back door attempt to retain control orders by introducing bail conditions with similar restrictions for periods beyond the new limit of 14 days."We believe a maximum of 14 days pre-charge detention gives wholly adequate time to bring charges, even in the most complicated cases of multiple attack. We will regretfully advise opposition to the introduction of draconian bail conditions, which would seek to impose restrictions equivalent to control orders as they currently exist," says the letter.Whitehall sources confirm that this is one option on the table in the review of counter-terrorism powers.
