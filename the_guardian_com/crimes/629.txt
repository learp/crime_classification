Uneducated youngsters are becoming "ideal fodder" for pimps and drug dealers to recruit for a life of crime, the education secretary, Alan Johnson, will warn tomorrow. They are wasting their lives in and out of prison or turning to prostitution in a "spiral of despair" hitting the least educated in Britain, he will say.The stark assessment from the minister, who left school at 15, comes after a spate of killings of teenagers in south London. He said: "There is a spiral of despair which starts with disinterest at school, turns to disillusionment with society and ends with huge problems for society."The evidence demonstrates that the younger a person leaves school, the more likely he or she will be to use drugs; become engaged in prostitution; commit crime to wind up in prison, unemployed or homeless, and usually all three."Mr Johnson will tell the Sector Skills Development agency that better education is not about acquiring skills just to help the economy but also to make social progress. The minister is using reports of increased prostitution and drug dealing to argue the case for the Â£2bn cost of raising the school-leaving age from 16 to 18. The policy is one of Gordon Brown's spending pledges.But the pledge is coming under fire from the right. The Reform thinktank says today a pledge to raise the school age to 18 should be scrapped, arguing that not enough has been done to educate people properly to the age of 16.Andrew Haldenby, director of Reform, said yesterday: "Andrew Adonis [the schools minister] said in the Guardian in November that five GCSEs at A*-C, including English and maths, should be a minimum target for every child; last year, only 44% reached that. On current trends we will achieve his ambition in 2062."Reform is concerned that the extra money will be a burden on taxpayers without achieving results. Nick Bosanquet, professor of health policy at Imperial College London, said: "The Treasury has the right analysis of the challenges facing the UK but absolutely the wrong answers."Heavy public spending increases have already gone a long way to mortgaging the future of a generation who will have to pay for enlarged public spending as well as for their own pensions and higher education. Further tax increases will increase the pressure on young people and middle income families without helping the poorest groups."The real road to growth and opportunity lies in empowering individuals to invest in their own futures."Children aged 11 or over would soon have their fingerprints taken for a child's passport if Home Office ministers approved the plan, Liam Byrne, the immigration minister, confirmed yesterday.This would enable them to be included on the national database being drawn up by the government for national ID card and biometric passports.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "This borders on the sinister and it shows the government is trying to end the presumption of innocence."
