A centre-right thinktank today embarrasses the government by saying that planned cuts to the police will be a boost for criminals.Policing minister Nick Herbert condemned the report by Civitas, called "2011: the start of a great decade for criminals?"The report says the public will face a greater risk of crime because the government has decided to cut its contribution to police funding by 20% over the next four years, leading to a fall in the number of police officers.The report's author, Nick Cowen, said: "While police numbers and resources are far from the only contributor to police effectiveness, it seems highly unlikely that the swingeing cuts now being enacted will be made without significantly decreasing detection rates."Herbert said the report "makes a simple link between crime levels and police numbers which the evidence does not support."In New York, police numbers have fallen but crime has fallen faster still, while in Sweden and Spain, crime has risen even though police numbers have risen. What matters is how well money is spent and how effectively officers are deployed," he said.The Police Federation claims the cuts will cost up to 40,000 officers their jobs. It emerged yesterday that 1,000 Metropolitan officers could go.Vernon Coaker, Labour's spokesman, said: "It is absurd to pretend that the number of police officers doesn't make a significant difference in preventing and tackling crime. It is no coincidence that under Labour police numbers rose and crime fell, even during a recession."
