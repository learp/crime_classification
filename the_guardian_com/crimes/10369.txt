More victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys came forward yesterday as investigators began probing how one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders remained free to attack over six years. A "significant" number of women contacted a Scotland Yard hotline set up for those who suspect they were drugged, raped and assaulted by Worboys, a licensed London taxi driver.On Friday, the 51-year-old from Rotherhithe, south London, was convicted of attacking 12 women but officers believe he may have assaulted several hundred in total. An Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry is focusing on why officers from Plumstead police station held Worboys on suspicion of sexual assault on 27 July 2007, but then released him. Worboys is thought to have struck up to 30 times after he was freed on bail. Officers received the first complaint against him in 2002.Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for North Southwark and Bermondsey, says he will meet urgently with the new Met commissioner to ensure police "sharpen up their detection and prosecution work".
