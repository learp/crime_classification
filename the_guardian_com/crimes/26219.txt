Crime emerged as one of the main battlegrounds in London's forthcoming mayoral election yesterday as the Conservative candidate, Boris Johnson, pledged to put more police on the capital's transport network, punish youngsters who abuse their free travel entitlement, and introduce maps giving a local picture of crime levels.Launching his crime manifesto, Johnson attacked what he called the "fatalism and defeatism" of the current mayor, Ken Livingstone, and unveiled a US-style plan to tackle petty crime. "I believe that by systematically tackling small crimes we can drive out more serious crime," he said. Johnson said he would take the £3.1m earmarked by the Metropolitan Police Authority for publicity and advertising and use the money to pay for 50 more British Transport police officers to patrol London's trains, tubes and buses. He also repeated his vow to introduce live CCTV on buses and said that £2.6m could be taken from the MPA's reserve funds to buy hand-held scanners and knife archways for transport hubs.Young people who "abused the privilege of free travel" by behaving badly on public transport would have that benefit withdrawn. But they would have an opportunity to win it back by performing community service.Johnson said he would introduce crime mapping to give the public "a real sense of the true level of crime in our neighbourhoods" and put pressure on both the police and the mayor to deliver results.His policies drew rapid criticism from his two main rivals. The Liberal Democrat candidate, Brian Paddick, said Johnson was "clueless" on crime and policing. "Live CCTV operates in all our town centres and does little to deter antisocial behaviour or speed up a police response - how will it make any difference on the buses?"Paddick said making young people earn back their free travel entitlement by doing community service would be "unenforceable and unrealistic" unless they had committed a crime, and said the crime maps would "further isolate the most disadvantaged in London, who already suffer disproportionate levels of crime".Livingstone said crime had fallen for five years in a row, despite the Conservatives voting against every budget which boosted police numbers.He added: "For Boris Johnson and the Tories to now present themselves as in favour of increased police numbers is therefore breathtaking hypocrisy."
