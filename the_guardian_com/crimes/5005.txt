An international cocaine smuggler who plotted his next deal at the funeral of one of his couriers - killed when a drug package burst in his stomach - was jailed for 16 years yesterday.Stephen Livingston, a 28-year-old Jamaican, moved to Britain four years ago and established himself as the biggest drug dealer in the Midlands, conspiring with major players in the US and Caribbean. He targeted jobless addicts, paying for them to go to the Caribbean and act as "mules", swallowing dozens of wraps of cocaine before flying back to the UK, where the drugs were cooked up to make crack cocaine, increasing its street value from £60,000 to £100,000 a kilo. Livingston was caught after a major undercover operation by the National Crime Squad, and admitted arranging 15 trips and bringing in 6.5kg (14lb) of cocaine. But detectives suspect that even before they started surveillance in April last year, he had financed at least 50 trips, involving more than 30kg, netting between £1.8m and £3m.After he was sentenced at Derby crown court yesterday, Detective Inspector Kev Mulligan told of how Livingston arranged his next consignment at the funeral of 42-year-old Leroy Hutchinson. Hutchinson collapsed on board an LA-to-London flight in September 2002 and was dead before the plane made an emergency landing in Denver. He had swallowed 30 bags of cocaine, one of which burst in his stomach, triggering a fatal seizure. "He targeted the most vulnerable men he could find, commonly recruiting unemployed addicts who had little choice but to accept his money," Mr Mulligan said. "He cared little about the risks he exposed the couriers to and it is a measure of his callousness that as those around him mourned the death of his associate, he was plotting details of another consignment on the order of service." Livingston's wife, Rachel, 37, received a two-year suspended sentence yesterday for her role in her husband's operation.
