Nineteen suspected criminals have been arrested after they were tricked by police who lured them in with a hoax offer of free beer.Derbyshire constabulary sent letters to dozens of suspects who had evaded detention for several months, inviting them to ring a marketing company offering a free crate of beer. But when suspects called the number, they were unwittingly put through to Chesterfield police station.A time and date was arranged for the promised free alcohol to be delivered to them, but those awaiting it, at locations in Chesterfield, Staveley, Alfreton, Ilkeston, Sheffield and Nottingham, were duly arrested.The sting was carried out as part of a month-long campaign targeting serious crime across north Derbyshire. Alleged offences committed by some of those arrested ranged from burglary and robbery to serious sexual assault.Chief Inspector Graham McLaughlin, leading the operation, said: "These suspects are people who have managed to evade arrest for some time, so we have used different tactics to find them. It has been very cost-effective as it can take a lot of time and money to track people down."We use a variety of methods to arrest those suspected of committing criminal offences and we will continue to use new tactics when necessary."
