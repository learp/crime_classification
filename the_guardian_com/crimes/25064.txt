A charity fundraiser famed for running marathons with a fridge on his back has been convicted of assaulting a former employee. Tony Morrison, better known as “Tony the Fridge”, denied attacking Andrew Mallaby and three of his relatives at Mallaby’s home in Sunderland in June 2014.Sunderland magistrates court heard that Morrison was in a state of heightened emotion as he believed he had caught Mallaby selling the “crown jewels” of his business to a competitor.After Morrison was let into the house, an altercation took place in which he slapped Mallaby and bit him on the arm as they grappled on the stairs. Morrison, 51, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, was also convicted of assaulting Mallaby’s father, George, by punching him as the family tried to eject him from their home. Charges of assaulting Mallaby’s sister and mother and a charge of using violence to secure entry were dismissed. Morrison told the court that his trousers split open during the struggle, leaving him exposed as he was not wearing underwear. He said he had known Mallaby for years and loved him like a son, and felt betrayed by his actions. The judge Roger Elsey said: “The sirens of the police officers could be heard but he did not wait for their arrival. If he thought he was an innocent man who had been assaulted he would have waited for the police.”Morrison was named fundraiser of the year at the Pride of Britain Awards 2014 and he has covered more than 1,000 miles with a 42.5kg (6st 10lb) fridge strapped to his back, raising more than £100,000 for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. The judge said he would take into account “the contribution he has made to charity” when passing sentence.
