A senior detective ordered a constable to alter a statement which had questioned the integrity of a young woman who was later strangled in an alleged honour killing, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.PC Angela Corne told the jury that Detective Inspector Caroline Goode, the officer investigating Banaz Mahmod's disappearance, told the constable to erase details from computer records of an incident in 2005 when the woman had claimed her father tried to kill her. PC Corne was called to the incident, but the court heard how, after speaking to Ms Mahmod, the constable did not report her allegation, and instead considered prosecuting her for criminal damage to a broken window.An order preventing reporting of the evidence, heard in court on Tuesday, was lifted yesterday after an application by the Guardian and the Times.Ms Mahmod, aged 20, vanished in January 2006. Three weeks previously, police were called to a cafe in Wimbledon where Ms Mahmod had fled from her grandmother's house claiming that her father, Mahmod Mahmod, had tried to kill her. Her hands were covered in blood because she smashed a window to escape.Giving evidence, PC Corne said that when she gave her statement to Det Insp Goode, the detective asked her to remove sections branding Ms Mahmod calculating and melodramatic. The court heard how, when PC Corne complained to a colleague, Det Insp Goode told her to leave the statement as she had written it.PC Corne admitted thinking the woman was drunk and acting up to persuade her boyfriend to visit the hospital; she said that she did not make any record of the allegation also made by Ms Mahmod's boyfriend that her father had tried to murder her. The prosecution claims that her father plotted the killing with brother Ari Mahmod, 50, and other friends, because she had wanted to marry an Iranian Kurd, Rhamat Sulemimani.Mahmod Mahmod, of Wimbledon, and Ari Mahmod, of Mitcham, each deny murder. The trial continues.
