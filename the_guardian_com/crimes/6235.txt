Michael Howard today claimed that the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, had pledged his "total support" to the Conservatives' bid to give householders greater rights to fight back against burglars.The Tory leader met Sir John this morning, ahead of a Westminster press conference to promote the householder protection bill. The meeting came after the Daily Mail published details of the difficult relationship between the home secretary, David Blunkett, and the Scotland Yard chief.Mr Howard told reporters that the bill, which would make it legal for people to take violent action to defend their property, would put the law "on the sides of the victim, not the burglar"."If a burglar breaks in, attacks you and you defend yourself, you can find yourself in the dock," he added. "Most people think that's absurd, typical of the topsy-turvy, politically correct world in which we live."Last weekend, Sir John called for those who attack burglars to face prosecution only in "extreme circumstances", even if the actions result in the death of an intruder. His comments came after City executive John Monckton was knifed to death and his wife seriously injured by two intruders in his Chelsea home last week.The Tory homeland security spokesman, Patrick Mercer, has drawn up the household protection bill to ensure that people are not prosecuted if the police conclude that they used more than "reasonable force" in resisting intruders.His private member's bill would make prosecution possible only if the police judged that their response was "grossly disproportionate" to the threat posed by the burglars.Speaking alongside Mr Howard, Mr Mercer claimed that the bill would deter criminals from breaking into people's homes. With little chance of making it on to the statute book, the bills is seen as an attempt to undermine the government claim to be tough on crime and apply further pressure on the beleaguered Mr Blunkett.The Daily Mail's latest embarrassing extract from Stephen Pollard's biography of the home secretary suggested a "frayed relationship" between Mr Blunkett and the Met chief.According to Mr Pollard, Mr Blunkett considered Sir John to be a "weak commissioner, lacking judgment, who could talk a good game but was rarely able to deliver".Today's extract described how the two men clashed over the deployment of armoured cars at Heathrow airport following an intelligence service security warning.It quotes Mr Blunkett as saying: "They [the police] used their operational freedom to go over the top ... It was male, macho, silly laddism, Boy's Own comic stuff. They couldn't help themselves."
