The country's first dedicated rape intelligence unit has been set up within the Metropolitan police promising to identify and track down serial attackers, in response to a series of high-profile failures that left prolific sex offenders free to prey on hundreds of women.The unit of 27 officers trained in techniques usually used to tackle organised crime and terrorism will become part of what Scotland Yard says is now the biggest rape investigation squad in the world.Responding to widespread criticism earlier this year when shocking failings in investigating serial rapists were exposed, the Met says it has revolutionised and raised the status of its rape inquiry unit. The new commander of the specialist team of 400 officers, Detective Chief Superintendent Caroline Bates, has secured an extra £1.4m to fund the UK's only team of intelligence officers dedicated to rape investigations.The Yard says it will identify and gather evidence on serial attackers, who have often been left at large for years because of poor detective work, a failure to prioritise rape inquiries and a tendency not to believe victims. "It is unique to have a dedicated intelligence team for rape," said Commander Simon Foy, head of homicide and serious crime at Scotland Yard. "This is about surveillance … intelligence-related analysis of mobile phones … interception, undercover work, all those things."What we also believe is if intelligence around serious sexual offenders is held in one place you can do a great deal with it and make a much greater contribution to the knowledge about sex offenders and their detection."The changes come into place as victims appear to be calling police to account for repeated failures in the investigation of rape across the country. Against the backdrop of a national conviction rate which hovers at around 6%, the Guardian reported how a woman successfully sued Cambridgeshire police after discovering her rape had not been recorded as a crime.Cmdr Foy said the Cambridgeshire case underlined once more that rape investigations had to be victim-centred.The two cases which were the catalyst for change involved serial rapists who remained undetected for years because of appalling failures by officers.John Worboys, a black-cab driver and Kirk Reid, a chef and football referee, sexually assaulted and raped hundreds of women before they were caught.In both cases police ignored evidence and intelligence which could have led them to the rapists years earlier. In the Worboys case victims said they were simply not believed when they said they had been attacked by a black-cab driver. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating 14 officers as part of their inquiries into the two cases.The revelations about the failures brought senior Scotland Yard figures up short. They were all the more embarrassing because the Met's Sapphire rape units have always been held up as the gold standard throughout the country.Yvonne Traynor, chief executive of Croydon Rape Crisis, welcomed the changes. "We are absolutely delighted they are taking rape more seriously," she said. "We always encourage women to come forward to talk to the police in order to give them intelligence even if they don't want to go through the court process, so that if that person does strike again they can piece together the intelligence."But Lisa Longstaff, of support group Women Against Rape, said it was too early to judge. "In the past they have not responded to intelligence, the connections were not made and that is why people like Worboys and Reid went on to attack so many women."We hope that this intelligence unit will do what it says and concentrate on rape offences and not pursue suspects for other things like drug dealing or burglary. It is galling for a victim of serious sexual attack to see the perpetrator charged with a more minor offence."The new approach comes at a time when targets for rape are being introduced for forces across the country and the Yard knows its unit will be judged on results.In a drive to increase the historically low level of rape convictions, which currently stands at just 6.5%, a new "rape performance group" led by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service will monitor each police force and CPS area in England and Wales on a quarterly basis and chief constables will be called to account if the figures are deemed too low.The Met's conviction rate is around 8.7%, higher than the national average.Cmdr Foy said: "It is really difficult for people to understand how for every 100 that come forward somewhere between three to six end up with a conviction."The Met's announcement comes as Lady Stern, who is carrying out a review on how rape victims are treated, calls for women to come forward to give evidence to her in order that she hears individual victims' experiences.
