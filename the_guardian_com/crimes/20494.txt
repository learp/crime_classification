Gary Younge compares democracy in the European Union unfavourably to the US (Compared to Europe, the US can at least make a pretence of democracy, 15 February).But the facts of the matter are these. The imposition of strict EU conditions on the management of the Greek economy is sanctioned by the elected heads of government of 27 member states (not excluding, for all his protestations back home, Greek prime minister Mr Papandreou). EU powers to act like this derive from the Lisbon treaty adopted unanimously by the 27 states and supported by the directly elected European parliament. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, is accountable to all the central bank governors of the EU plus the European parliament, to whose economic and monetary affairs committee he regularly reports.Greece has failed to undertake its long-standing commitments to reform its economy by cutting its public sector and by opening its economy to EU competition. It has also cooked the books, spends far too much on its armed forces, and allows its rich businessmen to evade taxes. The tolerance of Greece's fellow eurozone members has come to a stop.The EU has the power and the will to help Greece avoid default – but only if it recognises its duty to fiscal rectitude and European solidarity. That is what being a member of the EU is all about.Andrew Duff MEPConstitutional affairs spokesman, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe• Whatever one's views on the relationship between globalised markets and democracy as discussed by Gary Younge, there is more to say about the "democratic deficit" at EU level than he suggests. His quote from a book by Sue Wright, published in 2000, states the European parliament "has little power"; this was not true then and is even less true now, particularly since the ratification of the Lisbon treaty.Last week the European parliament used its new powers under the treaty to throw out the EU-US Swift agreement, which would have allowed millions of personal financial transactions to be tracked as part of a programme of measures to counter terrorism. Your report (MEPs block US security access to personal banking data, 12 February) mentions Hillary Clinton and Timothy Geithner's lobbying of MEPs ahead of that vote. This suggests they too might take issue with Mr Younge on the level of influence of the European parliament.It is also wrong to suggest that the head of the ECB "will face no cross-examination by elected representatives". The treaty specifically provides for him to appear before the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, where MEPs can hold him to account.Michael ShackletonUK office of the European parliament• Why must the workers take wage and benefit cuts to extricate Greece from its financial crisis? The country's main problem is that the rich evade taxes and keep their money in Swiss bank accounts.Peter CrookstonLondon• It is a concern that international issues that even those sceptical of the EU want to see tackled – people trafficking, drug trafficking, serious organised crime, cyber and hate crime and inter­national terrorism – should become a key ideological battleground for a possible incoming Conservative government (Tory plans to cut joint EU policing would threaten Britain, say critics, 15 February).As a former Europol rapporteur, I know the agency is, and will remain under the Lisbon treaty, a surprisingly small intelligence-sharing organisation, increasingly scrutinised by the European parliament. As cross-border crime affecting the UK reaches "phenomenal" levels, according to the CPS, people increasingly make the links between organised crime, drugs and gun crime and their cross-border origins.Voting against Eurojust (which the UK uses disproportionately) and Europol, and against greater parliamentary scrutiny of both, on the grounds that we are heading for an "EU FBI", is not credible and illustrates how a blanket Eurosceptic approach should be a dividing line when voters look at the political parties' attitudes to EU issues that matter.Claude Moraes MEPLabour, London
