Fewer criminals are to be jailed under government plans, which also propose special treatment for mentally ill offenders.Cabinet papers leaked to the Independent today suggest the government wants to put more emphasis on rehabilitating offenders. The policy will be outlined in proposals to be set out in the prime minister's six-month policy review next week.The proposals include special courts for the mentally ill and "hybrid" prisons for serious offenders with mental health problems.The review also suggests non-custodial sentences and support for offenders with mental health problems who commit less serious crimes; more therapy and less reliance on drugs to treat mentally ill offenders; and an expansion of treatment for criminals with drug and alcohol problems.Other proposals include more community sentences, such as removing non-cash assets and driving licences; more rehabilitation in jails; programmes to keep prisoners in contact with their children; and earlier interventions to steer children from crime.According to the Independent, the leaked papers say: "The government is now in a position where it can focus on retaining stability in sentencing, and increasing the focus on rehabilitation."Around 100,000 offenders are responsible for half of all crimes in England and Wales, with 5,000 of them responsible for one in 10 offences.The review suggested the government must "tackle the underlying causes of crime through preventative interventions and rehabilitation, addressing social exclusion, dysfunctional families, drugs and alcohol abuse."It added: "The actual and perceived level of antisocial behaviour remains unacceptably high."
