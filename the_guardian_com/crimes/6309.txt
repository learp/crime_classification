A former church minister was found guilty today of entering into a bigamous marriage. Roderick Sangster, 58, wed Janet Pollard while still married to his wife Jill. He has not been present during the trial, but previously denied a charge of bigamy and a charge of forgery. A jury at Warwick crown court found him guilty on both counts after deliberating for about two hours. There were cries of joy from the public gallery, where the three women who "married" Sangster - Frances Tait, Jill Sangster and Janet Wallace - were sitting. Judge Marten Coates adjourned sentencing to give police time to find Sangster, who did not turn up to his trial. The court heard that a bench warrant for his arrest had been issued. Prosecutor David Jones said: "We do not know where he has gone. Extensive inquiries have been made."
