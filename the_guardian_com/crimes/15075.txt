A man was this afternoon released on bail after being questioned in connection with the murders of two teenage girls who were killed outside a new year's party in a suspected gang shooting.Police refused to identify the man, but it is understood that he is Marcus Ellis, who is in his early 20s and is the brother of 18-year-old victim Charlene Ellis. West Midlands police said a man was arrested yesterday afternoon in connection with the shootings of Latisha Shakespeare, 17, and her cousin, Charlene Ellis, 18. He was held until this afternoon, when he was released without charge.The teenagers had stepped outside from a party in a hair salon in the Aston area of Birmingham to get some air when they were shot down in a hail of more than 30 bullets fired from at least three weapons, including a 9mm submachine gun. Charlene's twin, Sophie, and Cheryl Shaw, 17, were also injured during the attack, which was in the early hours of January 2, and focused attention on gun crime in Britain's inner cities.Last week Detective Superintendent Dave Mirfield, who is leading the murder inquiry, said potential witnesses had been cooperative and that some gang members had come forward with information.
