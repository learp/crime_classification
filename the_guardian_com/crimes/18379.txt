A 35-year-old man will appear in court today charged in connection with the abduction of a nurse, who was found in the boot of her own car, after being missing for more than a week.Magdeline Makola, 38, was discovered on Boxing Day, dehydrated and suffering from hypothermia, in the boot of her red Vauxhall Astra in Airdrie, more than 20 miles from her home in Livingston. She had not been seen since leaving Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where she worked as a nurse in the cardiology unit, on 15 December. Colleagues reported her missing when she failed to turn up for a shift on 18 December.A spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said yesterday a man had been arrested and charged in connection with the incident and was expected to appear at Linlithgow sheriff court today.Ms Makola, who is originally from South Africa, is recovering in Monklands hospital in Airdrie. She is said to be extremely traumatised, and although a number of specially trained officers have been able to interview her, police said it could take several days to finish questioning her. Two police officers searching the streets of Airdrie heard Ms Makola's cries for help from the car, which had been parked at the end of a cul-de-sac. They smashed the car windows to gain access to the boot and free her. She was wearing only nightclothes, and police said it was fortunate that temperatures had been reasonably mild for the time of year. Temperatures dropped to around -4C (25F) the night after she was discovered. Police said Ms Makola is a very committed nurse with a close circle of friends and what had happened appeared to be "completely out of the blue".
