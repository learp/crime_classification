A government drive against low-level crime and anti-social behaviour to be showcased by Tony Blair tomorrow is at risk of facing a human rights challenge in the high court.A legal opinion from Matrix Chambers, the human rights experts, says that part of the crackdown is "nothing short of a nationwide curfew on young people under 16" which breaches four articles of human rights legislation. The child curfews are part of "an anti-social behaviour action plan" to be launched by Mr Blair and the home secretary, David Blunkett, tomorrow, based on measures expected to reach the statute book in January. The legal opinion from Anthony Jennings QC of Matrix Chambers, questioning whether the crackdown complies with human rights legislation, was obtained by an alliance of children's charities including the Children's Society and Barnardo's, and Nacro, the crime reduction charity. Mr Jennings singles out clause 29 of the anti-social behaviour bill for particular criticism, saying it contains "some breathtaking provisions". The clause gives a police officer the power to disperse groups of teenagers on the streets and impose a blanket curfew on them for up to six months. The launch of the campaign by Mr Blair is designed to persuade local authorities and the police not to hesitate to use the powers in the anti-social behaviour bill going through the House of Lords. Mr Blair will urge them to use £40-£200 fixed penalty notices for intimidating behaviour, noise nuisance and graffiti, and compulsory parenting classes.
