A former army chef, Tony Jasinskyj, was yesterday jailed for life for the murder and rape of 14-year-old schoolgirl Marion Crofts more than 20 years ago.A jury at Winchester crown court took three hours to convict Jasinskyj, 45, of Leicester. DNA from semen on Marion's clothing and body matched that taken from him after he was arrested on an unconnected matter last year. He was jailed for life for murder and 10 years for the rape, to run concurrently. Passing sentence, Judge Michael Brodrick said: "The anguish that your action must have caused her parents, her family and friends probably cannot be imagined by anyone who hasn't had to suffer that loss for nigh on 21 years and hasn't had to contemplate those final brutal moments of her life." Marion was cycling from her home in Fleet, Hampshire, to band practice at Wavell school, North Camp, Farnborough, on the morning of Saturday, June 6, 1981, when she was attacked. Jasinskyj's DNA sample was taken last year as part of a routine police investigation after he was arrested on suspicion of an assault on his second wife Michelle. The court heard that the probability of somebody unrelated to Jasinskyj also having the same profile was one in a billion. Marion's sister, Sally, said after the verdict: "Today marks the end of 21 years of agony for our family. The pain of her death remains - no verdict will bring Marion back to us." Marion's other sister, Shirley, added: "Nevertheless, we're grateful that Marion's killer has been brought to justice." Press Association
