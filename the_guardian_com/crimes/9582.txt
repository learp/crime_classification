Nine lesbian prison officers were awarded substantial compensation yesterday after the Prison Service settled their claim of sexual discrimination.The women, who were transferred from Holloway prison after allegations that they ran a regime of sexual harassment and intimidation, received an apology from the Home Office for unfair treatment. An employment tribunal in central London has heard that the group had been dispersed to prisons across the country in March 2002 after a five-month inquiry. At the time Martin Narey, the then director general of the Prison Service, said there was clear evidence of sexual harassment. "The sort of behaviour which we wouldn't dream of tolerating between men and women. I'm not tolerating it between women and women." But two weeks into the hearing both sides agreed to settle. Judy Stone, counsel for the prison officers, had claimed they had been the subject of sexual discrimination by the Prison Service. As part of the settlement the Home Office accepted the allegations of sexual harassment had been completely unfounded. The total compensation paid amounted to a six-figure sum. A spokesman for the Home Office said: "The case was settled by mutual consent. There was no admission of discrimination."
