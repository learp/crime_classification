An illegally parked car. Photographer: Steve Parsons/PAThree British magistrates have now resigned in what may be a growing revolt against a new surcharge on fines.The government imposed the Â£15 surcharge in order to fund services for the victims of crime.But is it fair to collect this money from people convicted of motoring offences, say, or failing to buy a TV licence? Some magistrates say the scheme is flawed, morally wrong and turns them into unofficial tax collectors.What do you think?
