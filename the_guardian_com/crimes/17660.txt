Conservative MP Priti Patel, a rightwinger and former PR executive who has endorsed the death penalty, has been promoted to the Treasury as exchequer secretary dealing with tax policy.Patel, 42, whose parents were driven out of Uganda by Idi Amin, was thought to be the Conservatives' first Asian female MP when she won her seat in Witham, Essex, in 2010.Despite being a member of David Cameron's A-list which was a key part of his modernising project, Patel's views are firmly on the right of the party. She has spoken up frequently for a tougher stance on crime and immigration, and rejected plain packaging for cigarettes. She caused controversy in 2011 after saying she still thought the death penalty had a place in a civilised society during an appearance on the BBC's Question Time.There was also a minor furore in 2013 when Ukip trumpeted that her father would stand for the party as a council candidate.Before she became an MP, Patel was employed by Weber Shandwick, whose clients included International Financial Services London, a bank lobby group and a tobacco company. However, she threatened legal action when described as a lobbyist, telling her local Essex Chronicle earlier this year: "I worked in consultancy for 10 years and worked with charities, car companies, not-for-profit organisations, I had hundreds of clients. Consultancy is exactly what it says on the tin, I provided advice, but to say I was a lobbyist is completely inaccurate."During her time in parliament, she has sat on the 1922 committee of backbenchers, before being appointed to the No 10 policy board last year.Educated at a state school and then Keele University, she has described her particular interests as business, trade and ensuring that British businesses flourish.
