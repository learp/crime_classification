Children under 10 who show signs of anti-social behaviour are, for the first time, to be helped to avoid crime, the youth justice board chairman, Lord Warner, said yesterday.Home Office ministers disclosed yesterday that the power of courts to impose parenting orders on such children's mothers and fathers would be extended. The change would include youngsters pleading guilty to a first-time offence. The criminal justice minister, John Denham, will also step up the youth crime campaign today when he accuses social services, housing and education staff of allowing public nuisance and other anti-social behaviour by young children to go unchallenged. The scheme for early intervention, which will see children between eight and 13 and their families pinpointed for help, is to run over the next six months in the 10 street crime hotspots of England and Wales. New youth inclusion and support panels, made up of police, teachers, health, social services and youth justice workers, are to be asked to identify eight- to 13-year-olds who could offend. Their families will be offered help with dealing with anti-social behaviour, drug misuse, and mental health problems, but their attendance will not be compulsory. Lord Warner said the children involved would already be well known to local agencies. "It is my ex perience that families would welcome support with children if only it was available before problems escalate," he said. The idea has been piloted in a youth inclusion project in Bristol which has dealt with 50 youths over the past two years resulting in reduced school exclusion and crime rates. · An 11-year-old arsonist from Anglesey, with a history of disruptive and inappropriate behaviour, is to live in a secure unit designed just for him at a cost of £130,000 per year.
