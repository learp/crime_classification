A schoolboy admitted yesterday sending a letter apparently containing a deadly poison to Prince William.Paul Smith, 17, from Dumbarton, also sent a bottle of aromatherapy oil laced with caustic soda to the prime minister's wife at 10 Downing Street. At Glasgow high court he admitted sending letters containing a powder, which he claimed was either anthrax or ricin, to various people and organisations. These included Prince William - whose letter was sent to his hall of residence at the University of St Andrews, the House of Commons, Scotland Yard, the Scottish parliament, the Home Office, and the BBC.The 44 letters sent between August 20 2001 and February last year alarmed those opening the envelopes and inhaling the contents, the court was told. Smith also pleaded guilty to sending packages containing a substance claimed to be eucalyptus aromatherapy oil, along with instructions to rub it on to the face and hands. It contained sodium hydroxide - caustic soda, which can burn the skin and damage the throat and stomach lining if inhaled. These packages were sent to Cherie Blair and to Margaret Ashcroft, an aide to the Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles. Smith appeared with a youth of 16, also from Dumbarton, whose not guilty pleas to the two charges admitted by Smith and one other charge were accepted by the crown. Sentence was deferred until October 31 for reports. Press Association
