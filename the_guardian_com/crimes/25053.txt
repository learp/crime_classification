Manchester's new magistrates court building was thrown into chaos yesterday after a knife was found taped to the inside of the dock in Court 17.All people who arrive at the building have bag searches and have to pass through a metal detector. The checks should have picked up on the presence of a large knife. The court, which opened last month, was a Â£30m private finance initiative project aimed at improving the outdated facilities at Crown Square. The building was supposed to have improved security as well as proper access for disabled people and separate waiting rooms for victims of crime and defendants. It also emerged yesterday that the controversial court complex is already overstretched and is having to offload cases to courts in neighbouring areas. John Foley, head of divisional operations for courts across Greater Manchester, said the decision to transfer cases was not a knee-jerk reaction. "We have known for two to three years that the court would be running at near capacity."
