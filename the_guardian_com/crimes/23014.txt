One of the victims of alleged torture by six Metropolitan police officers claims his head was thrust down a toilet which was repeatedly flushed over him as he was interrogated, the Guardian has learned.The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating allegations that the officers, all of whom worked for Edmonton CID, used water torture on up to three suspects arrested last November on drug importation charges.One of those who claims he was maltreated is David Nwankwo. The 24-year-old, who is understood to be Nigerian-born, was arrested at a house in Tottenham, north London, during drug raids on 4 November.Nwankwo told a friend that officers thrust his head down a toilet in the house as they questioned him, and repeatedly flushed water over his head. He also claimed that when officers arrived at the house he was assaulted and kicked several times.Another suspect arrested at the house, Ajah Mpakaboari, 33, arrived at the police station in Edmonton bloodstained and with visible signs of having been assaulted, it is claimed.A third suspect who was allegedly tortured was charged with assaulting a police officer when he put up a struggle.The water torture allegations were made by a fellow officer who told superiors that suspects had their heads thrust into water while officers demanded to know where drugs were hidden.The whistleblower's claims led to a full inquiry by the Met's internal investigations unit, the Department of Professional Standards, which began late last year. In February this year 10 officers from Edmonton CID were suspended. Eight remain suspended, including the six allegedly involved in torture. The internal investigators have uncovered allegations that detectives within the Edmonton crime unit stole property, fabricated evidence and maltreated suspects.The Met referred three cases to the IPCC, the most serious of which was the torture allegation, which the police watchdog is investigating independently.The suspects involved have so far remained silent on what took place that day. But the Guardian spoke today to solicitors acting for four of the five.One of the suspects, Victoria Sea­brook, told her lawyer that Mpakaboari had arrived at the police station in Edmonton after his arrest with blood on his clothes, looking like he had been beaten up."She told me that another of the suspects, David Nwankwo, whom she knows as David, had told her that the officers pushed his head down the toilet and flushed water over him during his arrest," said Shenel Johnson, Seabrook's solicitor.Seabrook and her boyfriend, Nicholas Oforka, who was also arrested on November 4, have not made allegations of maltreatment.The five arrested – Seabrook, Nwankwo, Mpakaboari, Oforka and Bernasko Adji – were due to face trial in March on charges of importing cannabis. But when they arrived at court the Crown Prosecution Service successfully made a public interest immunity application. During two days of hearings behind closed doors – which police officers involved were barred from – the CPS outlined the corruption allegations against the officers and said it was dropping the drug case.The CPS said todayit had done so because the trial – and the allegations of torture – would have compromised a wide-ranging criminal inquiry into the activities of a number of police officers.The Met said it was treating the allegations extremely seriously and would take the strongest possible action if such behaviour was found to be substantiated. But there appear to have been attempts to play down the issue. In March the borough commander in Enfield, Chief Superintendent Adrian Hanstock, told a local newspaper that the investigation into his officers was based on "mishandling and procedures … we're not talking about Life on Mars-style corruption. This is about procedural compliance."Yet a month later when referring the torture allegations to the IPCC, the Met used the term "waterboarding". The torture technique involves continuously running water over the head of a suspect to make them feel like they are drowning.All six officers, who include a detective sergeant, are to be questioned as criminal suspects by investigators as part of the IPCC inquiry.The wider investigation being carried out by the Met's internal investigations department is continuing. It is understood that the allegations include officers fabricating evidence and stealing property, including flat screen televisions and iPods, seized from the homes of suspects.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, said the allegations, if true, were "appalling and shocking".A Metropolitan Police Authority member, Reshard Auladin, who works as a magistrate in Enfield, said the claims were being "thoroughly investigated". He said: "The authority is concerned about these allegations and we are now looking towards the IPCC to finish the inquiry and take whatever steps need to be taken."
