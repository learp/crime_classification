An inquiry into an officer who held a key position in the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation was thrown into chaos yesterday after a surprise legal challenge by lawyers acting for the teenager's family.Detective Inspector Benjamin Bullock, 51, arrived at the disciplinary hearing in south London ready to deny seven counts of neglect of duty. But the tribunal chairman, deputy assistant commissioner Des Flanders, was forced to adjourn when the high court faxed a statement stating Imran Khan, for the Lawrences, had been granted leave to seek a judicial review of the proceedings. He is disputing section 28 of the police tribunal procedures, which states the Lawrences may have a friend present at the hearing but not a journalist or lawyer to ask questions. Speaking afterward, Neville Lawrence said: "Mr Bullock has got his solicitors, why should I not have mine?" Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: "I find it quite incredible that a man with all his experience has left it to the last minute to drop this bombshell." He said that Mr Bullock, who has served 30 years in the force, could have avoided the hearing and retired on grounds of ill health, but was determined to clear his name. "We feel very angry, and that the adjournment has been unnecessary." Mr Khan said: "I made this application weeks ago. The order only came this morning." The officer was accused in Sir William Macpherson's inquiry report of failing to follow up vital evidence from a key informant. The report said: "The major responsibility for the team's failures lie with those who supervised Mr Bullock but, as deputy investigating officer, he bears his share of responsibility for the team's failures. This officer, who is an honest man and a very long serving policeman, was appointed to act above his true station and in a position beyond his abilities."
