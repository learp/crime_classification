Today, changes to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 come into effect that will reduce the length of time for which some individuals are required to disclose any criminal conviction to employers.Many employers are carrying out checks unlawfully. It will soon also be a criminal offence to require a job applicant or an existing member of staff to obtain, on behalf of their employer, a copy of their police record.Nacro, the UK's largest crime reduction charity, works with employers to help them recruit fairly and safely. It is clear that far too few businesses – big and small – are aware of the amendments to the legislation.Nacro successfully lobbied for changes, which will help to create a more level playing field for those who have put their criminal past behind them and wish to enter the workforce. Any organisation in need of help or advice should contact our employer advice service www.nacro.org.uk.Graham BeechActing chief executive, Nacro
