Patrick Collinson (Why have I been called up for jury service for the fifth time?, Money, 20 August) identifies a paradox in our jury system: many of us would be happy to do our civic duty, but are often cited at times that, for work or personal reasons, are inconvenient. Here’s an alternative. Why not offer those balloted for jury service a choice of time periods – several months in the future – when they guarantee their availability? They could then plan personal and work commitments around these dates. Currently the courts ask potential jurors to indicate the times at which they won’t be available over the coming months. They are then cited with a couple of weeks’ notice. This is too inflexible and doesn’t recognise the ever-changing nature of our personal and work commitments. In other words, instead of “citing” us to appear at court why not “invite” us to participate?Ian WatsonGlasgow• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
