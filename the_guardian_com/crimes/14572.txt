Parents of child offenders who fail to complete their sentence will in future face fines, compulsory parenting orders and possibly even prison under proposals outlined by the government yesterday.Ministers want to make parents legally responsible for their children completing a community sentence and say this would be similar to their current statutory duty to ensure their child goes to school. The idea will also mean parents will be issued with a court summons when their child appears in court to ensure they both attend. A Home Office spokesman said enforcement action against parents who failed to take responsibility for their children could be focused on those who refused the offer of parenting support. "As with truancy measures, prison would be very much a last resort. Instead, action against parents would consist of fines, parenting contracts and parenting orders," he said.But Harry Fletcher of probation union Napo said the idea was impractical and would only result in thousands of parents being in court themselves.Ministers also want judges and magistrates to be urged to use their discretion to name greater numbers of 16- and 17-year-olds convicted of crimes and to bring high-risk offenders back into court during community sentences in order to monitor their progress.The proposals are contained in the government's £100m youth crime action plan published yesterday which confirmed the new official emphasis on a "welfare orientated approach", with early intervention programmes targeted at the 20,000 worst problem families whose children are at the greatest risk of becoming prolific offenders.Home Office research published yesterday suggested a third of all children are involved in antisocial behaviour at some stage but that those who start as young as eight are far more likely to go on to become serious offenders.But new data on youth crime from the 2006 offending, crime and justice survey of 10- to 25-year-olds, also published yesterday, reports that there has been little change in levels of youth crime since 2003. It records that the proportion of young people carrying a knife remained stable at 3% although this rose to 6% among 14- to 17-year-olds. More than 50% of teenagers carried a knife only "once or twice" during the 12 months, for their own protection. In most cases it was a penknife.The detailed youth crime action plan confirms the expansion to every area in England and Wales by 2010 of the family intervention projects announced yesterday by Gordon Brown. It makes clear that this will mean about 40 families in each local authority will be involved in the programme, which involves elements of compulsion including possible eviction. The promised expansion of "intensive fostering" schemes as an alternative to custody for some offenders is to be limited to existing pilot schemes.The youth crime action plan also makes clear that the £100m of new money promised by the prime minister is spread over two and a half years, and that many of the key elements of the "action plan" are actually proposals out for consultation until October this year. The plan has been hammered out between the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, the children's secretary, Ed Balls, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, and Downing Street.Two major themes that run through the 84-page document are an attempt to reduce the number of children going into custody and a stronger role for local authorities, particularly the new children's trusts, in preventing youth crime. But it is clear that ministers are still discussing the mechanisms to achieve these aims.The plan says that local authorities will be given a new duty to fund and commission education of those in juvenile custody and a much stronger role in providing accommodation, jobs, education and training for those leaving youth jails.The action plan confirms some widely trailed initiatives such as removing at-risk children and young people from the streets late at night.It also confirms that proposals for the public to get involved in adult sentencing by nominating useful projects to be undertaken by those on community punishments are also to apply in youth courts.Reaction to the plan was mixed. The Children's Society said the government missed an opportunity for reform that put welfare at the heart of the system: "What is missing is an explicit commitment to reducing the number of children in custody," said Kathy Evans, policy director.Action plan· Expand family intervention projects to 20,000 families· Remove at-risk children from streets late at night· Visible after-school police patrols· Public say on reparation work by offenders on community sentences· Parents to face penalty if their child fails to complete sentence· Duty on local authorities to fund education of those in youth custody· More comprehensive support package for young people leaving custody
