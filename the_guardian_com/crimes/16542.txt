A major police investigation has begun after the bodies of two elderly women were discovered in their homes in a seaside resort, after apparently being the victims of separate botched burglaries.Merseyside police said both the victims, who were found at their homes in Southport, Merseyside, were believed to be in their 80s.The first woman, who was found on Tuesday afternoon, has been named in the Liverpool Echo as Margaret Biddolph. It is understood she had lived in her house in Lonsdale Road for 36 years.On Wednesday, police said a second woman had been found dead in nearby Birch Street. She was named locally as Annie Leyland, but has not been formally identified by detectives.A 43-year-old man from Southport has been arrested on suspicion of murder, and will be further interviewed in connection with the inquiry. He has not been identified by police, but unconfirmed local reports suggested he could be a taxi driver.Police said on Tuesday that they believed the Lonsdale Road incident might have been a "burglary gone wrong".The force's major incident team is leading the investigation and house-to-house inquiries are taking place. Both properties remain sealed for forensic examination.Detective Chief Inspector John Roberts said on Tuesday: "This a tragic incident that has resulted in the death of an elderly woman."While we are at the early stages of the murder inquiry, we are investigating a possible connection with a burglar. We urge anyone who may have seen anyone acting suspiciously in the area in the days and weeks prior to the incident, or have any information about burglaries in the area, to call us."No matter how small that piece of information may seem, it could be vital to our investigation."Anyone with information isasked to contact Merseyside police or the confidential Crimestoppers hotline.On Saturday, a 76-year-old woman in nearby Janes Brook Road was followed into her house by a stranger. The man reportedly terrified her into handing over cash and jewellery before fleeing the scene. Detectives would not speculate whether that incident was also linked to the murders of the elderly women.
