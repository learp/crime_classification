A man was found guilty of murdering two sisters in their flat in Birmingham. Mohammed Ali was convicted by Birmingham crown court of the murders of Yasmine and Sabrina Larbi-Cherif. The court heard Ali had been in a relationship with Yasmine, 22, before killing her and Sabrina, 19, in September last year. He had denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at a hearing in March, claiming he was provoked during a loss of self-control. Ali, who was not in court, will be sentenced later. The family of the sisters expressed relief that their "barbaric" killer had been found guilty of murder.Â­ PA
