Magistrates courts in London and 20 other centres are expected to grind to a halt tomorrow because of the first ever strike by clerks and managers, according to a confidential report by Whitehall managers.They have warned Lord Falconer, lord chancellor, and other ministers in the Department for Constitutional Affairs that they expect "significant support" for strike action, which is expected to close courts and delay hearings and put an additional strain on the overstretched judicial system.Among courts facing potential closure tomorrow are Horseferry Road, Thames, Camberwell, Bow Street and Highbury in London, and courts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester and Stoke on Trent.These are named in the document as "hotspots" where significant support for the one-day strike has been detected by area managers.Other areas that could face serious disruption include the Medway towns in Kent, Guildford in Surrey, South Wales, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Hull, Preston, Bristol, Plymouth, and Exeter.The document admits that the strike - called by two Whitehall unions, the Public and Commercial Services Union, and Prospect, which represent senior managers - is "an unprecedented situation for magistrates courts staff". It adds that managers have been "surprised by the depth of feeling among staff that has become apparent over recent weeks".The managers say there has been considerable unrest following the creation of the new body to run the courts, Her Majesty's Court Service, and that staff say they have been "let down" and that "promises have not been kept".The document prepared for management and ministers looks at various scenarios for future strike action. It admits it is very likely that one-day strikes could be followed by a prolonged work-to-rule by clerks withdrawing goodwill. This includes refusing to do extra training outside working hours or to work longer to finish busy court lists, and a threat to withdraw from "focus groups" set up by the agency to discuss improving the service's efficiency.The only saving grace in the report is that managers do not think staff would engage in a prolonged national strike, and say some staff - especially in rural areas - may be too loyal to the service to walk out for a day.The unions say the reason for the action is that ministers are offering staff below-inflation pay rises and have not put enough resources into the courts to make the new body function properly. Teething problems with computers have added to the problems.Mark Serwotka, PCS general secretary, said: "Members have grown increasingly angry over a pay deal that should have been settled months ago, and now feel compelled to take this historic step of strike action. With support for strike action strong, management need to negotiate meaningfully if they want to avert closure of courts and postponement of cases across England and Wales."
