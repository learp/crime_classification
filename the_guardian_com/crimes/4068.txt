A woman who had her eyes gouged out in a horrific attack by her then boyfriend has allegedly been the victim of another assault by a different man.Tina Nash, 32, was blinded by her boyfriend Shane Jenkin as she slept at her home in Cornwall two years ago.He has been jailed for life while Nash has written a book about her experience and campaigned on the issue of domestic violence.It emerged on Wednesday that Nash is the alleged victim of another assault said to have happened in Penzance, Cornwall earlier this week.Roland Alli, 32, of Plymouth, appeared at Truro magistrates court on Tuesday charged with common assault.Alli pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody until 25 June, when he will appear before the same court via videolink. A trial date has been fixed for 12 August.Nash was blinded by Jenkin, 34, who gouged her eyes with his fingers as well as throttling her and breaking her jaw and nose in the attack in April 2011.Last year, Jenkin, who is 6ft 4in and weighs 17-and-a-half stone, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of six years after admitting grievous bodily harm with intent against the mother-of-two.In a Guardian interview at the time of the publication of her book, Out of the Darkness, Nash told how she asked her family to "finish me off", believing her blindness would mean she would lose her children.She said: "I thought I was going to lose my kids, I had lost everything. I asked my family to finish me off because I didn't want to be here any more. When I found out I could keep my kids, that it would be discrimination if they were taken away from me, I thought: 'I can do this. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I can'."
