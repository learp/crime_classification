An independent inquiry is to be launched into the care received by a paranoid schizophrenic, who was jailed for life yesterday for stabbing a policeman to death.Tennyson Obih killed PC Jon Henry in Luton in 2007 as the 36-year-old officer attempted to arrest him. In convicting Obih of murder, the jury at Luton crown court rejected his plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but Mr Justice Bean said the 29-year-old was suffering from schizophrenia at the time he stabbed Henry.East of England strategic health authority is to conduct an independent investigation into the care Obih received in the community.Henry, described by Bean as "a dedicated and courageous officer", was called to George Street just after 7am on 11 June 2007 after Obih had stabbed window cleaner Stephen Chamberlain. As he tried to arrest him, Obih knifed Henry, then stabbed him with the 11.5cm knife a second time as he lay on the ground.A second policeman was saved from attack when another window cleaner, David Knight, hit Obih over the head with a pole. A baton round and Taser shot failed to stop Obih, who was finally brought down by a second Taser discharge.Bean told him: "You are at present a highly dangerous man and there is a very serious risk to the public of your committing further specified offences of violence if released. Indeed, it is possible that it will never be safe to release you at all."Obih was also convicted of the attempted murder of Chamberlain and the wounding with intent of Knight.He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2005 after abusing alcohol and cannabis. The court heard that Obih was often not home when nurses called and that he had stopped taking his medication five months before he killed Henry, after his father advised him that olive oil and prayer would be suitable.In mitigation ahead of sentencing, Obih's barrister, Bernard Richmond QC, said the case raised serious concerns about the care of mental health patients in the community."What on earth was happening when a man who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had told his doctors in the winter before this tragedy that he would take olive oil and prayer, and was actively not co-operating with psychiatric professionals? What on earth was going on that this man was not seen regularly either voluntarily or under compulsion?" said Bean.In a statement issued after the verdict, Henry's widow Mary said she faced a future of watching her daughter's "little heart break again and again"."In a world that can be a scary place for a child anyway, she will have to live with the first-hand effects of what evil people can take from you," she said.A spokeswoman for Bedfordshire and Luton mental health and social care partnership NHS trust said today that the trust extended its deepest sympathies to all those affected by Obih's actions. She said an internal investigation had been carried out but an independent review would commence now that the court proceedings had concluded.Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said "classic warning signs" relating to Obih were not acted upon and the case raised "urgent questions about how people with severe mental illness can live safely in the community".
