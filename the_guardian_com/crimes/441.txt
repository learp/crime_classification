A suspected serial attacker was responsible for two murders and four assaults on blonde women in south-west London, police believe.Fears that a potential serial killer was at large emerged after detectives yesterday formally linked the murders in south-west London of Am√©lie Delagrange, a French student, and Marsha McDonnell. The Metropolitan police had been anxious not to cause alarm after Delagrange, 22, was bludgeoned to death with a blunt object on Twickenham Green last month. But they have now merged investigations in the light of similarities in "the times, the nature of the venues, and the mode of attack" in six incidents within a five-mile radius. A team from the Met's specialist crime directorate will examine the unsolved murders of Delagrange and McDonnell, 19, who was murdered with a blunt weapon, possibly a hammer, in February last year after getting off a bus near her home in Hampton, and four other assaults in the past 20 months. All six victims were blonde women walking alone after dark. They were all attacked from behind with a blunt instrument. Delagrange, a Spanish and English graduate who had just arrived in London to improve her English, looked similar to McDonnell. The man once regarded as the prime suspect in the McDonnell case has been held in a secure hospital under the Mental Health Act since last year, so police know he could not have carried out the four linked attacks that have occurred in the months since he was locked up. Detectives will also examine assaults on a 28-year-old in Feltham on August 23, four days after the murder of Delagrange; an attack on accountant Edel Harbison, 34, in Twickenham on April 18; an attack on Dawn Brunton, 36, in Hounslow on November 5 2003; and an assault on a 17-year-old girl in Strawberry Hill shortly before the murder of McDonnell in January 2003. A police spokeswoman said there were no personal links or forensic evidence connecting the victims, but they were "linking" the six incidents.
