The defendant's actions were reasonable in the circumstances."Smith had admitted he threatened his wife with the gun but said he knew the battery in the device was dead.He said: "She just flipped out and got up like a woman possessed and threw over the coffee table."She also threw the parrot cage towards the plasma TV. There was bird seed everywhere."He said he threatened her with the stun gun after she smashed him over the head with the mirror."The device was dead though. I'd taken the battery out of a smoke alarm and put it in there. There wasn't enough charge in it to work."Defending Smith, Terry McCarthy said Smith bought the device for his wife as a deterrent against thieves when she was in their convertible car in Spain.
