Police have condemned looters who raided a flooded cycle shop as "despicable" exceptions to community spirit in the aftermath of devastating damage to a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne.A man and a woman have been arrested and nine bikes recovered after the overnight theft in Newburn of an estimated £30,000 worth of stock in a street piled high with debris, abandoned cars and mud.Many areas remained on high alert, especially in North Yorkshire where Boroughbridge, Tadcaster and other communities beside rivers swollen by run-off from the Pennines were still at risk.The main bridges in Boroughbridge and Tadcaster have been closed, with water in the rivers Ure and Wharfe lapping the top of their arches. But residents in a nearby care home, including a 101-year-old, had their tea as usual while Environment Agency staff pumped out their cellar.New properties close to rivers have emerged again as an issue for flood control, along with concern at the very rapid build-up of flood water in urban areas. Although much of the north of England saw the heaviest September rain for 30 years, doubling the average for the month in many places, it was prolonged and steady for two days, rather than falling in the sudden torrents typical of extreme weather.The centre of low pressure responsible for the downpour has moved south but with much lower rainfall and most of the UK is expected to have quieter and dryer conditions before unsettled weather and potentially more rain returns, primarily to northern areas, next week. Heavily disrupted transport links between Scotland and the the Midlands have been largely restored, although the A1 Great North Road remained closed northbound for 40 miles through the Vale of York.The thefts from KB Cycles in Newburn have led to extra police patrols and Acting Ch Supt Dave Byrne of Northumbria police said: "The safety of business owners and residents is paramount and it is despicable if people are thinking of taking advantage of the bad weather and using it as an opportunity to break in to properties. It is also important that people remember to take their own steps to ensure the security of their premises and belongings and make sure they lock doors and windows and use alarms where they have them."Pumps have been set up to rid shops and houses of up to six feet of water and temporary bridges have been built between dry islands in the main street, where water continued to gush from damaged culverts. Major clear-ups were also under way at Morpeth in Northumberland, where 40 houses were flooded for the second time in five years, Sunderland, Stockton on Tees, Durham and York – the last a city inured to flooding in the centre from its twin rivers the Ouse and Fosse.The latest drenching worked its way chronologically through the York Dungeon museum, according to general manager Helen Douglas who said: "At 9am the water first appeared in the Viking area, then it spread into the torture chamber, the executions exhibit andthe witches space. By the time it reached the Dick Turpin exhibit, we had to stand and deliver the closed sign."Talks between the insurance industry and the government over future cover for properties in flood risk areas have been given further urgency by the latest damage.The Association of British Insurers said the latest bill had not yet been estimated but promised that members would "be pulling out all the stops to help customers hit by bad weather".There is growing concern at the lack of progress on a new agreement to provide cover for some 200,000 homes at serious flood risk when the current arrangements, agreed after widespread damage in 2008, end in June next year.The Environment Agency continued overnight work on clearing drains and watercourses and monitoring danger points, especially in North Yorkshire.More than 100 flood alerts and 57 flood warnings remained in force on Wednesday night, more than half of them in the north, while the total number of houses sent individual warnings by the Environment Agency since Sunday topped 105,000.
