Granada Television provided the five suspects in the murder of Stephen Lawrence with two weeks' free accommodation in Scotland after filming their interviews for the current affairs programme Tonight with Trevor McDonald.Despite public assurances that the suspects would not benefit in any way from the interview, it emerged yesterday that the five men were chauffeur-driven from Devon to Scotland, and stayed for 15 days in a farmhouse on the outskirts of Perth. Jamie and Neil Acourt, Gary Dobson, David Norris and Luke Knight were charged in connection with but never convicted of the killing.Publicist Max Clifford, who has received death threats after helping to set up the programme, confirmed the details of the trip to the Guardian. Last night a spokesman for Granada said: 'We discussed this matter with the police, who advised out of a public order perspective the five should be in a neutral location following the interviews and prior to and up to the transmission of the programme.'The suspects were not living in luxury, the spokesman added. He refused to divulge how much the farmhouse cost to rent.Imran Khan, lawyer for the Lawrence family, said yesterday: 'Neville and Doreen Lawrence were led to believe that the five suspects would not receive any benefit as a result of appearing on this programme. They are extremely concerned to hear that some benefit has been received and will be seeking an explanation from Granada Television.' There was more bad news for Tonight With Trevor McDonald yesterday as it emerged that ratings for the programme that was supposed to revolutionise television news have plummeted after only the second week.Despite the hyped launch with Martin Bashir's interview with the five Lawrence suspects, Thursday night's programme averaged only 3.4 million viewers just 18.2 per cent of the viewing share.It suffered against They Think It's All Over, BBC1's comedy sports quiz, which attracted 9.5 million viewers.
