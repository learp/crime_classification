A judge arrested for drink-driving while on bail for a similar offence has resigned, the Ministry of Justice said today.Crown court judge Bruce Macmillan, 63, of Sefton Park, Liverpool, was arrested last Thursday on suspicion of being drunk at the wheel in the Toxteth district of the city.After his arrest last week, a spokesman for Merseyside police said: "A 63-year-old man from Sefton Park has been arrested in Hill Street, Toxteth, for being drunk and in charge of a motor vehicle on Thursday 17 September."He has been given conditional police bail pending further inquiries."Macmillan had previously been charged with drinking and driving on 27 August after being stopped on the M6 in Lancashire when his Vauxhall was spotted driving erratically.The Ministry of Justice said today that the judge had resigned with immediate effect.Macmillan was appointed to the northern circuit in 1993 and sits at Liverpool crown court.By stepping down, he loses his Â£128,000-a-year salary, but avoids being disrobed by the lord chief justice and lord chancellor.Macmillan also hit the headlines in January when he sentenced a Liverpool man who was found naked and stuck in a supermarket chimney following a bungled burglary.Passing sentence,he told the man: "Were this matter not so serious, the facts would be decidedly comic."Macmillan was called to the bar in 1969 and appointed as an assistant recorder in 1984. He became a recorder in 1988 and a circuit judge 16 years ago.He is due to appear before magistrates in Chorley on September 30 to face the original charge of drink-driving.
