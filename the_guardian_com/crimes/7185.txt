A forklift truck driver accused of murdering five Ipswich sex workers had "prolonged physical contact" with three of the women, a court heard today.Forensic scientist Peter Hau said there were "extensive" samples of Steve Wright's DNA, unlikely to have come from "casual contact", on the bodies of Paula Clennell, Anneli Alderton and Annette Nicholls."I would say it would be more likely to be a prolonged physical contact," said Hau.Wright, 49, of Ipswich, denies murdering Clennell, 24, Alderton, 24, Nicholls, 29, Gemma Adams 25, and Tania Nicol, 19.Their naked bodies were discovered near Ipswich over a 10-day period in December 2006.Earlier, home office pathologist Dr Nat Cary finished giving evidence on the likely cause of death of each of the five women.He told the court that all five could have been asphyxiated - possibly after being put in some form of headlock.Cary said yesterday that the women may have been unable to fight off their attacker because they were on drugs.He said toxicology tests on the bodies of all five women showed they were intoxicated with heroin or cocaine."Someone may have been so intoxicated they simply would not resist," he said.The trial continues.
