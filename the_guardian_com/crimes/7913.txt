The killer of Milly Dowler is suing the prison service for Â£30,000 after he was assaulted in jail, it has been reported.Levi Bellfield, 42, who was jailed for life in June for the murder of the schoolgirl in 2002, suffered cuts after he was attacked outside a bathroom in prison, according to the Daily Mirror.A Prison Service spokesperson said: "We have paid no compensation to this man. The vast majority of prisoners' compensation claims are dismissed at an early stage."All claims are robustly defended, and would only be settled on the basis of strong legal advice, and in order to seek the best value for the taxpayer."Bellfield's random attacks on lone women at night earned him the nickname the "bus stop stalker" and made him one of the Britain's most dangerous serial killers.It also earned him a whole-life sentence in 2008, when he was convicted of the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18.
