Two men convicted of the murder of a rookie police officer during an armed robbery have been charged with stabbing a fellow prisoner.Muzzaker Imtiaz Shah and Yusuf Abdillh Jamma, who were jailed for the murder almost two years ago of PC Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford, have been charged with wounding with intent.They will go before magistrates next week for the alleged attack on a 22-year-old inmate at Durham's Frankland prison, a maximum-security jail.Durham police would not officially name the two men who have been charged, but an unnamed source confirmed their identities to the Press Association.The prison attack allegedly took place in the victim's cell in March. The injured inmate, serving life for murder, suffered wounds to the stomach and face and required hospital treatment.Shah and Jamma have since been sent to separate prisons.Frankland houses around 730 of the country's most feared criminals, and there has been a spate of reported inmate-on-inmate attacks.Last month, the British al-Qaida terrorist Dhiren Barot had to be treated at a Newcastle NHS hospital after he was badly burned at the prison.Barot, who was jailed for life last year for plotting "dirty bomb" attacks, was understood to have been scalded by another prisoner.Days later it emerged that the cell of Hussain Osman, one of the July 21 would-be bombers, had been set alight at Frankland.Shah and Jamma were jailed for life last year and told they must serve a minimum of 35 years each for the police officer's murder.Beshenivsky had been a PC for just nine months when she was shot outside the Universal Express travel agent in Bradford city centre on her daughter's fourth birthday.Her colleague, PC Teresa Milburn, was also gunned down in the street and seriously wounded as the robbers escaped with little more than Â£5,000.Shah, from Kenton, greater London, admitted murder but denied firing the shot which killed PC Beshenivsky.Jamma, from Small Heath, Birmingham, was convicted of murder after he told the court he shot the officer by accident.His brother Mustaf was thought to have been part of the bungled raid and is believed to have fled back to his native Somalia.
