Remains have been found on Saddleworth Moor, where the Moors murderers, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, buried their victims, but police said the discovery was not thought to be linked to the case.West Yorkshire police said the remains were not believed to be those of 12-year-old Keith Bennett, who was murdered by the pair and whose body has never been recovered.Officers were called to the moor, east of Manchester on the border with West Yorkshire, at about 1pm today after reports that remains had been found.A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said it was not clear whether the remains were human, but that inquiries were ongoing.David Kirwan, a solicitor acting for Keith's mother, Winnie Johnson, said police had not been in touch with her about any discovery.Keith, 12, was murdered in 1964 by Brady and Hindley, one of five young victims of the couple.In 1966, the pair were convicted of the murder of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. Brady was also convicted of killing John Kilbride, 12.Twenty years later, they also confessed to killing Keith Bennett and Pauline Reade, 16. Reade's body was recovered from the moor but Bennett's has never been found.Earlier this year, Greater Manchester police revealed officers had been searching the moor over the last three years in an effort to find the boy's body.Brady is currently an inmate at Ashworth high security hospital. Hindley died in prison six years ago.Â· This article was amended on Tuesday July 29 2008. We mistakenly referred to Lesley Ann Downey as Lesley Ann Downing in this article. This has been corrected.
