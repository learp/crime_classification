A former royal butler who was convicted of assault is being allowed to remove his electronic tag so that he can continue to perform his duties for an aristocratic family.Gary Lindley was ordered to wear the tag after he was convicted of assault to make sure he was at home between 9pm and 9am.But Lindley, 34, argued that the device was hindering his duties at the Countess of Arran's Palladian mansion in Devon. Magistrates in Torquay agreed that the tag could be removed for when he has to work at the estate at night.Speaking after the hearing, the countess said she would stick by her employee of 10 years despite his conviction.She said: "He is the sort of butler a lot of people would like to have. He is extremely hardworking and a very good cook. He cooks the best breakfasts every day and the best scrambled eggs."Gary has worked for us for more than 10 years and we have seen him grow up and get married. He is the most wonderful butler and these things can happen to anyone. We all adore him up here and will support him through thick and thin."Lindley, of Brixham, Devon, had a curfew imposed on 27 February at Barnstaple magistrates court for assault.But he returned to ask for it to be removed, telling the court he was an "honest person" who had acted out of character when he committed the crime.Magistrates heard Lindley, who combines his work as a butler with a job at a supermarket, needed to sleep overnight at Castle Hill on a number of dates in May, which would put him in breach of his 9pm to 9am curfew hours.They agreed he could take the tag off during the special occasions he was required as a butler but continue to adhere to the sentence at other times.The countess said the duties of a modern butler involve "more than standing in the corner of a room waiting on tables".She said Lindley's duties included everything from "making breakfast to driving the countess and earl on appointments".
