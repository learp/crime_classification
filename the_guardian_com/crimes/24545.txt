Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer jailed for killing a teenage burglar in his home with an illegally held pump-action shotgun, was today denied an early release from prison.A parole board meeting in London called to consider his case rejected his application for freedom.He will now be released in July when he will have served two-thirds of his five-year sentence.Martin's plea - that he opened fire in self-defence - stirred fierce public controversy after he was initially convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. In October 2001, however, three appeal court judges accepted fresh evidence that he had been suffering from a paranoid personality disorder.The original conviction was quashed and his sentence subsequently reduced to five years for the manslaughter of 16-year-old Fred Barras and the wounding of his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, 30.Martin told the court that he had been disturbed in the middle of the night by burglars at his home near Downham Market in 1999.He remains at Highpoint low security prison in Suffolk.
