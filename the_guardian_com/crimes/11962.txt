A blackmail gang who threatened to shoot a wealthy farmer in the head and forced him to pay them almost £200,000 in 17 days have been jailed. Police investigating brothers Dennis and Bernard McGinley and co-accused Christy Stokes discovered CCTV footage of Dennis’s wife, Bianca, laden with designer-label shopping bags after a trip to Harrods with some of the proceeds.

He borrowed money from friends and family and even sold his tractor to meet the gang’s continuing demands for cash.Dennis McGinley, 40, from Fivehead, near Taunton, Somerset, was jailed for seven years and four months. Bernard McGinley, 35, of the same address, was jailed for four-and-a-half years. Stokes, 44, from Micheldever, Hampshire, admitted conspiracy to blackmail and was jailed for three years and nine months. Bianca McGinley previously received a six-month suspended sentence after admitting possession of criminal property.
