Antisocial families who have been evicted by their landlords are to be sent on residential courses before they are allowed to be rehoused, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced today. The programme will be designed to teach them about good behaviour and neighbourliness. Describing how the scheme will work, Mr Blunkett said: "You have got to go in for residential support for some time before we reallocate you a house." It would help stop new generations learning lessons in yobbish behaviour from their parents or guardians, he added. Mr Blunkett announced the scheme during a visit with the prime minister, Tony Blair, to a crime and disorder reduction partnership in Brighton ahead of his keynote speech to the Labour conference this afternoon.The "neighbours from hell" measures were first mooted by Mr Blunkett during a Labour party "big conversation" event in Oxford in May.He said the courses would be compulsory rehabilitation programmes after acknowledging that relocating antisocial families was simply moving the problem elsewhere.Offenders will be expected to take courses in parenting skills, financial management and anger management in return for a new council house or housing association property, he said. Mr Blunkett said the lessons would take place in a dedicated "secure" council block with about half a dozen problem families at any one time. A similar voluntary scheme, known as the Dundee family project, has run in Scotland since 1996 and another has operated in north Manchester. Families are expected to sign up for a strict behaviour code, including no returning drunk late at night or noisiness. In exchange they get 24-hour support and counselling from social workers, including assistance with getting up in the morning, preparing breakfast, getting children to school and helping with homework in the evening.
