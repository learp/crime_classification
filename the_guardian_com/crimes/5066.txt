The police could have prevented part of the "terrifying ordeal" of a three-year-old girl sexually assaulted by paedophile Craig Sweeney, a watchdog said today.The Independent Police Complaints Commission launched an investigation into the case after the girl's father complained about the speed with which South Wales police responded to her abduction.Reporting back today, the IPCC partially upheld the complaint and recommended that officers face a misconduct panel for failing to be conscientious and diligent in the execution of their duties.The girl's mother made a frantic phone call to police moments after her daughter was snatched. She gave officers Sweeney's name and told them he was living in Newport, South Wales. But Sweeney was able to drive his victim back to his accommodation on Caerleon Road, Newport, and repeatedly sexually assault her. He was only caught by chance following a high-speed chase in Wiltshire after local officers saw him go through a red traffic signal with his lights turned off.The victim's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: "The only thing the police couldn't have stopped is her being taken from her house but the rest could have been prevented."They could have been where Sweeney was staying before he even got there."The child's father alleged that despite the police being made aware of Sweeney's address and identity shortly after the abduction, their response was ineffective and too slow to prevent the assault on his daughter.IPCC Wales Commissioner Tom Davies said he and a senior investigator had met with the child's parents today and informed them of their findings and recommendations.Mr Davies said: "The commission has partially upheld the complaint from the child's father."Having carefully considered the complaint made by child A's father, we find that his complaint is substantiated in part, in that it concludes that had there been prompt and appropriate action as the reported child abduction required, there was a potential to prevent child A being subjected to a further terrifying ordeal when Sweeney was able to leave his home address and cross the Severn Bridge into England. "Whilst the investigation considers there may have been potential to attend Sweeney's home at an early stage, it finds that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation that this would have prevented the assault that took place at the house."The IPCC could not say how many officers could face a misconduct panel. One officer involved has since retired.The IPCC said that during its investigation it identified "deficiencies" in the force's procedures and policies for dealing with child abduction and "inadequate" procedures and policies for dealing with critical incidents.The watchdog has identified policy and training issues for the force to deal with on abduction cases and has made recommendations about the use of and access to intelligence about known sex offenders for control room staff dealing with a major incident.The body said that it welcomes the force's "positive response" to its organisational recommendations and will ensure that they are carried out.It said that it has also identified national issues around data sharing for the Violent and Sex Offender Register held by police forces and has shared these with the Association of Chief Police Officers.Sweeney had already been convicted of sexually assaulting a six-year-old child when he snatched the girl. His licence period for the earlier attack had expired just days before he struck again. He had been living in Newport, south Wales, following his early release from jail.Mr Davies said South Wales Police made the error of not considering the abduction was carried out for sexual motives when the incident was first reported to them.He said: "The early decision to follow the procedures for dealing with the incident as a 'kidnap for gain' rather than a 'child abduction with possible sexual motives' was arrived at incorrectly and followed by officers of increasing seniority during the early crucial part of the incident."He said the investigation also found that "failings in the transmission of information, the interpretation of information and the scrutiny of information available to officers led to a delay in the apprehension of Sweeney".Mr Davies said the IPCC had made a series of recommendations so lessons could be learned from the abduction.The IPCC recommended that South Wales Police take immediate action to sharpen and clarify its policies on dealing with this type of incident; improve awareness at appropriate levels through training and live exercise of its procedures for following these policies; and consider methods of improving the access appropriate members of personnel have to the intelligence systems available to the force while dealing with such incidents.The IPCC also recommended to Acpo that the police computer users and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary revisit some of the policies and monitoring of systems dealing with registered sex offenders.Mr Davies said that of the three officers whose conduct the commission had referred to the chief constable of South Wales Police, one has already retired.He said: "Given that none of these alleged actions are in any way subject to criminal proceedings he is not subject to any further action because he has retired."The other two officers are at Inspector and Superintendent level within the force. Mr Davies said: "It will be for the chief constable to balance the expectations South Wales Police would require of officers with this level of seniority and experience against the circumstances described about in terms of the incident and the practices prevailing at the time."Mr Davies added: "Finally and most importantly I turn to the family of child A. Throughout they have endured the grief this incident has brought in the glare of national publicity, I would like to thank them for the help they have given to the inquiry and for the patience they have shown over the length of the inquiry."I now hope that both child A and her family can be left in peace to continue the monumental task of helping that child put her life together."
