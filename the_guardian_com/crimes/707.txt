The mother of an ITV talent show winner pleaded not guilty today to charges of dumping his fan mail. Lesley Sampson denied failing in her duty of care to ensure waste was properly disposed of when she appeared at Warrington magistrates court. The charge was brought under the Environmental Protection Act. Her son, George Sampson, 16, won Britain's Got Talent last year. She pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing to a charge of flytipping between 11 September last year and 14 January. It is alleged that she left 16 bags of rubbish, containing fan mail for her son, in a wooded area backing on to her home.
