Police have linked full moons to a rise in aggressive behaviour among drinkers on the streets of Brighton.Senior officers have decided to deploy more police this summer to counter trouble they believe is linked to the lunar cycle.A Sussex police spokeswoman said today: "Research carried out by us has shown a correlation between violent incidents and full moons."Another monthly factor which police chiefs identified as fuelling violence in pubs and nightclubs in Brighton and Hove was pay days.Inspector Andy Parr told the Brighton Argus evening paper he would be interested in discussing the police findings with academics. He said: "I compared a graph of full moons and a graph of last year's violent crimes and there is a trend. People tend to be more aggressive."I would be interested in approaching universities and seeing if any of their postgraduates would be interested in looking into it further. This could be helpful to us."Brighton bouncer Terry Wing agreed with the theory. "It's so true. When there is a full moon out we look at the sky and say: 'Oh no, all the idiots will be out tonight.' I will start looking at the back of people's hands for hair next time." The link between full moons and extremes of human behaviour has been identified in past studies.In 1998, a three-month psychological study of 1,200 inmates at Armley jail in Leeds discovered a rise in violent incidents during the days on either side of a full moon.During the first and last quarter of each lunar month there was a marked increase in violent incidents.During the remaining part of the month there were far fewer incidents and none at all on some days.The Oxford English dictionary defines "lunatic" as "affected with the kind of insanity that was supposed to have recurring periods, depending on changes of the moon".However, any link between the lunar cycle and human behaviour has yet to be explained scientifically.
