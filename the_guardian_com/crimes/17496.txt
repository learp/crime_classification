It was a typically busy day in Birmingham magistrates court. All human life was there: a vagrant up on begging charges, a 22-year-old accused of using false number plates on his car, a few drink-drivers, five cannabis growers and two men who had allegedly mistreated their dogs. But one of the most common crimes taking up the court's time on Friday was shoplifting. Nine suspected shoplifters were due to face justice, accused of pinching everything from a jumper from New Look to bacon worth £55 from Iceland.According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) crime survey released this week, while overall crime has fallen significantly, shoplifting is up 6% on average, year on year.Across England and Wales, police recorded 317,027 shoplifting offences in 2013, with 34 of the 43 force areas recording an increase compared with the previous year.The 2013 Commercial Victimisation Survey (CVS) puts the figure even higher, at 3.3m incidents of theft by customers in the wholesale and retail sector: a fall from 12.2m in the 2002 CVS survey. The steepest rise, according to the ONS, was in the West Midlands, where shoplifting offences were up 20%, keeping the lower courts busy.Of the shoplifters in front of the bench at Birmingham magistrates court on Friday, one man, a 32-year-old from Stechford, said he'd stolen £115.73 worth of confectionery from Asda and £180 of chewing gum from two petrol stations because of benefit payment issues.He had little choice but to plead guilty after being caught on CCTV, and could hardly claim the goods were not for his own consumption. But his solicitor said in mitigation: "There are no underlying issues as far as the police are concerned and this man is not stealing to feed a habit. He did have problems with benefits but there would be no need for him to re-offend because those problems are now resolved."The defendant was ordered to pay £295.73 in compensation and placed under a curfew order for three weeks.On Friday afternoon in the magistrates court, a 31-year-old defendant from Sparkhill pleaded guilty to stealing £53.60 worth of meat from Aldi to feed his drug addiction.He said: "It was stupid really, it was nearing my wedding anniversary and I am separated from my wife of nine years. After I lost my job I was going through a bit of a tough time and I ended up having a lapse but before that I hadn't committed a crime for five years.His solicitor said: "This man has been struggling with his drug habit and committed the offences in order to feed it. After losing his job in December last year he has unfortunately gone in to a downward spiral."It was nearing his children's birthdays and wedding anniversary to his wife from whom he is separated. He is desperate to get some assistance to kick the habit completely."His case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.Earlier this year a prolific local offender, Danny Smith, ended up in the dock after delivering a shoplifting masterclass on the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street.The 31-year-old father of three somewhat foolishly revealed his tricks of the trade on camera, such as lining a carrier bag with foil to stop security tags triggering alarms as he strolled out of the store with his ill-gotten gains.By March, Smith had been locked up for 14 weeks by magistrates for trying to pilfer wine from a supermarket, despite giving media interviews beforehand saying he was determined to turn his life around.The British Retail Consortium (BRC), a trade association, said shops last year suffered the highest level of theft for nine years, costing £511m – up 166% up from 2007-08. The BRC's latest retail crime report suggests many retailers have lost faith in police and the courts as just one in 10 shop thefts was reported to police last year.Laura Davies, the BRC's crime policy adviser, said the biggest and most worrying increase was in "sophisticated, organised offending – gangs of shoplifters who steal to order and come equipped to lift high value goods such as designer items and electronics". That was why the BRC reported a 62% increase in the average value of customer theft per incident, £177 against £109 in 2012, she added.BRC members have also reported offenders increasingly toting foil-lined bags, like Smith, with others wearing electronic devices around their necks which emit an electronic signal which can block some store alarms.Bob Jones, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, last month suggested that the increase in shoplifting was partly caused by benefit cuts and job losses, which have pushed "desperate" Birmingham parents to steal food and nappies to feed and clothe their families.He told the Birmingham Mail: "This could be put down to levels of unemployment, cuts to benefits and difficulties in coping with the rising cost of living. We are seeing shoplifting of food in particular."The results suggest that the patterns of criminality are poverty-related where people are stealing food and essential items as opposed to higher value good like electrical items or items like perfumes."Experts from the ONS, which compiles the annual crime survey released this week, hypothesise that the recent rise may not simply be due to an increase in offending but could also be caused by changes in the way police record offences or "an increase in reporting, whereby retailers may adopt new strategies or approaches to deal with shoplifters … which in turn means the police record more shoplifting offences".
