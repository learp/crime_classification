Official red light zones are not the right way to tackle the problem of prostitution or control the sex trade, police chiefs in England and Wales warned today.Chief constables have dismissed the idea of regulated "toleration" zones, where police turn a blind eye to prostitution, as ineffective.A new report by the Gloucestershire chief constable, Tim Brain, which has the backing of all 43 chief constables in England and Wales, said that toleration zones would not work because they require a change in the law, and there is no conclusive evidence of their success in other countries. The report concluded that: "The evidence that such zones work in other jurisdictions is equivocal."Plans to set up England's first prostitution tolerance zone are underway in Liverpool and in August Edinburgh council leaders gave their backing to a private members bill to allow tolerance zones for prostitutes. Edinburgh operated an unofficial prostitution tolerance zone in the docks area of the city for 15 years, but it was abandoned in 2001 after complaints from local residents.Mr Brain's report also warned that police forces must work harder to tackle prostitution. He said it had to become a bigger priority for the police forces and public policy makers. "The status quo is not an option," he said. "For too long policing prostitution has been a neglected area of not only policing policy but also public priority."The report will govern the way police officers deal with prostitution until the results of a government review into the law on prostitution are made public."The government review may result in new laws and priorities, but any outcome is at least several months away, if not longer. We need to deal with priority operational problems now," said Mr Brain.
