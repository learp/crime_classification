Orenthal James Simpson, better known as OJ Simpson, acquired the nickname The Juice for his fluid running style during his American football years.He retired from his sports career in 1979, after a successful career with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers. Simpson went on to appear in minor roles in a number of films, including The Towering Inferno and The Cassandra Crossing.There were also stints as a sports announcer, as well as a starring role in a TV ad campaign for Hertz rental cars. Simpson would have remained a B-list celebrity had it not been for the brutal murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, her friend Ronald Goldman, and the sensational trial that followed.Simpson was arrested a few days after the murders at Nicole's home, while fleeing his house in a car driven by his friend Al Cowlings. The low-speed police chase on the Los Angeles freeways was filmed by a TV helicopter and beamed live into millions of homes.The subsequent "trial of the century" in 1995, was also televised live and transfixed the American public for nine months. In a decision that stunned the country, Simpson was acquitted of two counts of murder, thanks to the masterly tactics of his main defence lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, who coined the phrase: "if the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit."As part of his closing argument, Cochran pulled on a pair of gloves similar to those the prosecution used to try to link Simpson to the murder scene. The act, a reminder to the jurors of the apparent difficulty Simpson had in getting the gloves to fit during a courtroom demonstration, was a brilliant distillation of the inconsistencies of the prosecution's case.In 1997, however, he was held liable in civil court, where the standard of proof was lower, for both deaths. No one else has ever been charged with the deaths of Nicole Simpson or Ron Goldman.Simpson resurfaced in the public eye last year when he wrote If I Did It, which purported to be a first-person fictional account of the murder had he actually committed it. But HarperCollins pulled the plug on the book at the last minute after a public outcry.In an odd coincidence, the book was published today after a Florida bankruptcy court awarded the book rights to the Goldman family to partially satisfy the unpaid civil judgment. Comments have been added to the original manuscript by the Goldman family, writer Pablo Fenjves, and prominent investigative journalist Dominick Dunne.
