A 14-year-old boy killed a man with one punch to the head in an unprovoked attack after giving him directions on New Year’s Eve, a court has heard.Kyle Major followed Paul Walker, 52, and felled him from behind shortly after wishing him a happy new year.The father of two was thought to be unconscious before he hit the ground and died shortly after in hospital.He was found face-down in the street in Blackpool, Lancashire, by a passerby in the early hours of New Year’s Day this year and his hands were still in his pockets when paramedics arrived.The teenager, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter at a previous hearing, was ordered to be detained for three years at Preston crown court on Friday.The recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, lifted reporting restrictions on naming the juvenile following an application from the Press Association, which said the public interest in identifying him outweighed the child’s welfare.Walker, who was described by his family as “a lovely man with a big heart”, had lost his way after leaving a party thrown by his sister.He came across a group of teenagers who told him where he was, including Major, who was heard to wish him a happy new year.Moments later the defendant and a male friend followed Walker.Major ran off after the attack and texted another friend, saying: “I’m scared. Don’t want to go to jail. Two/four years. Don’t say anything.”He initially denied any involvement in the incident when he was arrested.The court heard Major had consumed six bottles of Budweiser and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniel’s on the night.He regularly drank to excess and was also a habitual user of cannabis, the court was told.Major had seven previous convictions for non-violent offences, including burglary and theft.He had been under the supervision of a youth offending team since December 2013 following various court orders, but his response was said to have been poor and he was described in reports as acting in “a reckless and carefree manner” with no regard for the consequences.Major’s childhood was said to have been “out-of-control”. He was previously in foster care. The judge told him: “Your upbringing was unfortunate. You have been allowed to run wild.“This sort of unprovoked attack in the street is a regular feature of towns and cities in this country, regrettably. Unprovoked violence of this kind is completely unacceptable and will be punished.”Walker’s estranged wife, Gina, his two sisters and one of his sons were among family members in the public gallery on Friday.His sister Harriet, in whose home Walker celebrated the new year, said she had not only lost a brother but “her best friend”, in victim impact statements partly read by the prosecutor.She said he “could not have been happier” as he left the party.Harriet Walker added: “The boy who killed him needs to know what he has done, not only to us but the rest of us who have to live without Paul in their lives.”DCI Pete Simm, of Lancashire Constabulary, said: “Kyle Major has today been sentenced for his reckless and violent actions which tragically cut Mr Walker’s life short and left devastating consequences for his family and friends.“It took just one punch to kill Mr Walker and this case serves as a stark warning to others, showing just how much damage a single punch can cause.“Thankfully, Mr Walker’s family have been spared the ordeal of having to sit through a trial and although nothing can compensate them for their loss, I hope that the conclusion of this case offers them some form of closure. My thoughts very much remain with them at this time.”
