Police apologised to a 14-year-old girl after accidentally shooting her with a Taser, it was revealed today.Officers in Nottingham were aiming at a 20-year-old man as they tried to arrest him, but accidentally hit the girl who was standing nearby.The incident was referred to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which passed it back to Nottinghamshire police to investigate.A force spokeswoman said the incident happened in Stapleford, Nottingham, at about 10.35pm on Wednesday.Officers were called to reports of a group of people being antisocial in the area, and when they arrived were faced with around 15 people, she said."A 20-year-old man became aggressive to one of the officers, who attempted to arrest him," the spokeswoman said."He resisted arrest and assaulted the PC. After a short struggle, the officer tried to restrain him by discharging his Taser."The Taser did not connect with the offender and struck a 14-year-old girl who was standing nearby."As soon as the officer realised he had missed the intended target, he cancelled the discharge."She said the Taser had then been fired again and the man had been arrested for police assault and a public order offence."The teenage girl did not require hospital treatment but the incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, due to the involvement of a juvenile," the spokeswoman said."Officers have been liaising with the girl and her family and have apologised for what happened."A spokesman for the IPCC said it had completed its assessment of the incident and would have no further involvement.He said: "The matter has been passed back to Nottinghamshire police for them to continue any investigation."
