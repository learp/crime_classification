Details emerged Thursday of fresh police errors in domestic violence cases that saw two women murdered by former partners after they had complained to officers of threats and that they feared violence.New information about the failings was released by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and comes amid concern about a series of cases where women have been killed by partners or former partners despite seeking protection from the police.In one incident involving Dorset police, an officer has been dismissed for beginning an affair with Katarzyna Ryba, aged 26, after he was assigned to her case following her complaints about her former partner. She was later killed by Piotr Zasada, who stabbed her to death in front of their three-year-old daughter after discovering the affair. Dorset police also made other errors in handling a series of complaints by Ryba, including bungling risk assessments of the danger she faced before she was murdered.Ryba was murdered while staying at a friend's house with her daughter in Bournemouth on 2 October 2009. Zasada was later sentenced to life imprisonment.Pc Richard Allan began an affair with Ryba, and after discovering she had been murdered, deleted text messages the two had sent each other. Despite being removed from frontline duties while under investigation, he was able to carry out "unauthorised" searches on the police computer.The IPCC, which has not published its full report, said in a summary that Pc Allan and other officers made errors in the case. It also found Dorset police's domestic violence policy and procedures were out of date. Zasada had been in police custody the day before the murder but the IPCC said it had concluded, "it was felt that these failings did not directly impact on the eventual tragic outcome".In a second case, Lincolnshire police also bungled their assessment of the risks faced by Isabella Trindade after she complained to them about her estranged husband, Antonio Goncalves, who went on to stab her 21 times in Boston, Lincolnshire in October 2010. He was convicted of attempting to murder her new partner, Christopher Ayres, who was stabbed while trying to protect her.He was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder and his trial heard Trindade had complained to police that Goncalves had threatened to kill her. One such threat to kill, a fortnight before the murder, saw police fail to take even a written statement, and after Goncalves denied the allegation, no further action was taken.Officers classified her reports of domestic violence as antisocial behaviour. This error and others, the IPCC found, "led to specialist domestic abuse officers being unaware of a pattern of increasing harassment, and an opportunity to identify an escalation of risk to Ms Trindade was missed".Two Lincolnshire police constables are facing misconduct meetings.In another example of women being failed by the police, it has emerged that three Metropolitan police officers have been disciplined after failings in two rape cases.One woman was told by an officer that she did not say "No" enough to the suspect on the spot, and that would make gaining a conviction difficult.Another woman who complained to police of rape, had a statement taken by an officer who wrote that she had had consensual sex.The IPCC found the officers who were attached to the Sapphire unit, supposed to specialise in tackling sexual violence, behaved in an "unprofessional and insensitive manner", and two were given written warnings and the third officer a final warning.The incidents dated from 2009 and the IPCC said the Met's "systems and processes have changed significantly since these events".
