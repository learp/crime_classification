Ian Griffin, 40, held over the murder of Kinga Legg, 36, in a Paris hotel room, failed to appear before Westminster magistrates in London today for an extradition hearing. The court was told prison staff declared him unfit to attend, and a psychiatric report would take up to a month to prepare; he was remanded in custody until 26 June. Griffin was arrested while living rough in Cheshire on 1 June, a week after his fiancee's body was found; his lawyer said he and Griffin's family had been prevented from visiting him because of his mental condition.
