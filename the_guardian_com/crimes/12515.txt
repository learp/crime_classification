Detectives hunting the killer of Sally Anne Bowman today released a new efit of the suspect.Ms Bowman, an 18-year-old part-time model, was murdered in Croydon, south London, six months ago. Her attacker stabbed her several times, bit her and seriously sexually assaulted her.DNA found at the scene forensically linked the killer to an indecent assault committed in nearby Purley Cross in July 2001.In that incident, a man exposed himself to a woman who was making a call in a phone box. The man masturbated and attempted to open the phone box door before running off.Today's efit was created by the 2001 victim, who police said had made "every effort" to recall the man's description."It is now six months since Sally Anne was brutally murdered," Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Cundy, who is leading the investigation, said."The victim of the 2001 attack is the one person I know who definitely saw the face of Sally Anne's murderer. Please take time to look at this efit ... the attacker may have looked like this in 2001."Mr Cundy said the man might appear quite normal, and may never have been in trouble with the police, but added: "He is also out and about in the side streets of South Croydon during the early hours, he has carried a knife, he has exposed himself before, his behaviour may even have changed since September last year."If you think the efit looks like someone you know, I would urge you to call us."The previous efit - put together with the help of a person robbed near the murder scene less than an hour before Sally Anne was killed - has been criticised by Ms Bowman's mother, Linda.The 43-year-old told the Daily Mail she believed "mistakes" had been made in the investigation and asked why "the wrong suspect been on the wanted poster for months and months".Detectives believe it is likely the robber went on to kill Ms Bowman, with the scenes of the two incidents being less than one-third of a mile apart.The murder investigation is one of the largest inquiries being conducted by the Metropolitan police.Last month, detectives set up a DNA screening centre in South Croydon and asked local white or light-skinned men born between 1965 and 1985 to provide DNA voluntarily.So far, 771 men have come forward, but thousands more remain to be screened. Detectives want to screen 4,000 local men matching the general description of the suspect.Police said it was possible that the suspect had committed other crimes between 2001 and Sally Anne's murder. They urged anyone who had been a victim of a sexual offence and had not already informed them to do so.Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 0208 7214005 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
