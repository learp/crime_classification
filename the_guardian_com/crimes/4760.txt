A Â£200m scheme to treat some of Britain's most dangerous killers should be abandoned as it is too expensive with no positive results, and in some cases left prisoners more aggressive than before they entered jail, according to a leading academic.In a paper published today in the journal Medicine, Science and Law, Peter Tyrer, professor of psychiatry at Imperial College, London, said almost a million pounds per person has been spent to keep 240 prisoners deemed to have dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) in four secure units but with "scarce evidence" there was any improvement in outcomes.Tyrer said the DSPD programme appeared to be "about locking people up" rather than treating the mentally ill. "It has been incredibly expensive. We cannot say it has made any difference to the public and it seems patients have not been helped."Instead, the academic said the diagnosis of personality disorder was suspect and research showed many people had been detained unnecessarily."About 85% should not be detained under these circumstances. Many are in prison for homicide or violent offences and should have been released at the end of the sentence. Instead, many are moved into the DSPD programme as they are about to leave for the community."He also said that prisoners in the scheme spent only 10% of their time doing anything resembling therapy. Despite government denials, the main point of the programme appeared to be protecting the public rather than treating the patient. "It certainly looks like we are 'warehousing' these people because we are afraid of releasing them," said Tyrer.His work showed that "the substantially higher costs (of the programme) were accompanied by an observed deterioration in functioning, quality of life and aggression, suggesting that the additional benefit of DSPD assessment is unclear and needs further exploration."The controversial programme was set up at Frankland and Whitemoor prisons and two high-security hospitals, Rampton and Broadmoor, in 2001 after the government said it would "deal with the most dangerous offenders" .Labour introduced a new classification of "dangerous people with severe personality disorders" which attracted opposition from many working with the mentally ill who feared it would see people who had not offended, but who exhibited what has been regarded as an untreatable condition, to be detained as a preventative measure.It followed a row when the former home secretary Jack Straw claimed that psychiatrists refused to treat Michael Stone, diagnosed with a personality disorder and convicted of two murders in 1996.Mental health charities called for a radical review of the DSPD programme. Paul Jenkins, the chief executive of mental health charity Rethink, said: "The principle of preventive detention without an actual offence being committed is dubious from an ethical perspective and open to abuse."In addition, there is no evidence that the large sums of money invested have delivered improved outcomes in terms of either health or reoffending. At a time of pressure on public spending, this money would be much better used in improving services in the community for people with a personality disorder and in finding ways to ensure that people affected by mental illness are kept out of the criminal justice system."The scheme has never been able to fufil expectations: when it was launched it was said that up to 5,000 prisoners could benefit from the programme. Tyrer said that it would be "better to abandon (the programme) and spend the money elsewhere. Some of the new units look like five-star hotels. But there are many mentally ill people that could benefit from hundreds of millions of pounds."Tyrer said it is impossible to know if the multimillion pound experiment reduces the risk of re-offending because the government refuses to change the selection process needed to make proper evaluation possible.A Justice Ministry spokeswoman last night said that there would be a "review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the resources used to support the programme".
