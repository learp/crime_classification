The television presenter Ray Gosling has said that he did give police the name of the former lover he confessed to killing last week.Gosling, 70, was arrested on suspicion of murder after telling BBC East Midlands Inside Out that he had smothered an ex-lover, who was dying of Aids.He was released on bail and without charge last Thursday after being interviewed five times by detectives investigating the death, which is understood to have occurred about 20 years ago.Gosling told the Nottingham Evening Post that he had felt he had little choice but to give police the man's name."If I'd not told them who it was, I'd still be locked up now," he said.However, Gosling said he would not reveal his ex-lover's identity to protect the dead man's family, adding: "It was a private love affair."The veteran broadcaster also said he had been surprised by the publicity that his declaration had attracted."I don't regret saying what I did on the television," he told the paper. "The BBC didn't use me. They let me decide what I wanted to say. They told me the risks of doing it."It emerged at the end of last week that some of Gosling's friends had known for more than a decade that he had killed his dying lover.Although Gosling had claimed to have kept the killing secret, close friends revealed that he had he confided in a small number of them. At least one of them has been interviewed by police.They said he told them the killing took place about 20 years ago and that, although Gosling has so far described the unnamed victim as "a bit on the side", he had known him before he contracted Aids and during his illness. One friend also revealed that Gosling's pact with the man was two-way so that "if either of them were in a bad situation the other would do it".The BBC said last week that it felt Gosling's report had been handled "sensitively and appropriately".A spokesman added: "We kept him fully informed about our representation of his story in the report and he understood that a revelation of this nature could have a number of consequences."The BBC is under no legal obligation to refer the matter to the police in these circumstances and since transmission we have been approached by the police and are co-operating fully."Nottinghamshire police declined to comment.
