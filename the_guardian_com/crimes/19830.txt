Simon Jenkins is right to argue that we should focus more on the policy than the politics of U-turns (Comment, 29 May). The short-term consideration of negative press must not outweigh the long-term benefits of sound policymaking.And, in a week of reversals, Victim Support is calling on the government to consider one more. The Ministry of Justice is consulting on proposals that could change the way that help is given to victims and witnesses of crime. In particular, it is proposing that funding for victim and witness services be channelled through the new police and crime commissioners. These changes risk exchanging a well-regarded, secure and locally based way of helping victims and witnesses in favour of a system which will be fragmented and inefficient. It could also waste as much as Â£21m of taxpayers' money on red tape. The government must listen to organisations such as the NSPCC and the Police Federation, which are asking it not to go through with these plans. Surely a better outcome for victims of crime is worth a little hurt pride?Javed KhanChief executive, Victim Support
