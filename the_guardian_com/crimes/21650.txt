The murderers of Tom ap Rhys Pryce were caught on CCTV, apparently committing another knifepoint robbery in London only 20 minutes before the attack on the 31-year-old lawyer, police believe.Detectives yesterday released images of two black men robbing an Asian man on the platform of Kensal Green station just after 11pm last Thursday.They believe them to be the men who stabbed Mr Pryce about half an hour later, 100 metres from the home he shared with his fiancee.Detective Superintendent Julian Worker, who is leading the inquiry, said yesterday: "These are two people that clearly have a propensity for serious violence, and there is a danger that they will commit further offences."The CCTV footage shows the two suspects, both wearing hooded tops, getting off a northbound train on the Bakerloo line. They approach a man, who is sitting on a bench, indicate to him that they have a knife, and take his mobile phone, tube travel card and cash. They then leave the station about 10 or 15 minutes before Mr Pryce's arrival, which was shown on separate CCTV images also released by police yesterday.Mr Pryce was attacked a few minutes after he left the station, even though he apparently gave his belongings to the muggers and was heard to tell them "you've got everything of value", or words to that effect.Det Supt Worker appealed for anyone who saw the suspects, described as being in their late teens or early 20s, board the northbound train. He also asked people who might know the suspects personally to speak out."Those people who I believe will know the identity of the suspects need to examine their consciences and come forward," he said.Mr Pryce's family and his "devastated" fiancee, Adele Eastman, would not speak to the media yesterday, but on Sunday Mr Pryce's family released a short statement."It was the happiest time of his and Adele's lives when they became engaged in October 2005. They were so looking forward to getting married in September this year," it said.
