The report into the police shooting of Mark Duggan will finally be completed next month, over a year later than it was first promised, the police watchdog has announced.The investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been mired in controversy and has been criticised by Duggan's family. The shooting in August 2011 in north London triggered days of riots across England.At a hearing on Monday before an inquest into Duggan's death, the IPCC faced withering criticism from Michael Mansfield QC, who is acting for the dead man's family.Mansfield said the watchdog was "not fit for purpose", was close to being in contempt of court and had made basic errors.Robin Tam QC, for the IPCC, said the report into the shooting would be completed in April. The IPCC had previously refused to set a date. The report will be given to the Duggan inquest in May, the hearing was told.The IPCC will also hand over a second report covering the gun Duggan had collected on the day he was shot, amid allegations the Metropolitan police missed an early chance to take it off the streets after it was used in a violent crime.The judge presiding over the inquest, Keith Cutler, said the inquest would begin on 16 September.Duggan, 29, was shot twice in north London by Met police officers who say they believed he had a gun.Duggan's fingerprints were found on a shoebox which police believed contained a gun he had collected 15 minutes before he was confronted by officers and shot dead.There is no trace of Duggan's DNA or fingerprints on the gun or sock in which it was contained. Tests have found no gunshot residue on Duggan's hands or waistband.
