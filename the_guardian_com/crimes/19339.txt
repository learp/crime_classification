The Portuguese attorney general overseeing the investigation into Kate and Gerry McCann has ruled that there is not enough evidence to justify further questioning of the couple about the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine.In a statement released last night, Luis Bilro Verao, the Evora district attorney general, said: "No new evidence justifying further questioning has emerged since September 7 [when the couple were designated arguidos, or official suspects, in their daughter's disappearance]." He said the couple would remain arguidos for the foreseeable future, adding that "no line of investigation" had been excluded.The couple's spokesman said: "Clearly this information will need to be assessed very carefully by Gerry and Kate's Portuguese lawyer, but on the face of it, it appears encouraging."The attorney general's statement came just over a week after a 4,000-page dossier of evidence was handed to a judge for examination. The judge had until today to decide whether to authorise police to carry out further examinations; he also had the authority to change the conditions of the couple's bail or to recommend criminal charges against them.Mr and Mrs McCann returned to their Leicestershire home 11 days ago from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz where their daughter disappeared on May 3. But the Guardian has learned that they believe their electronic communications, including their mobile phones and emails, are still being monitored.Portuguese sources have indicated that part of the police dossier amassed against the couple includes telephone and email intercepts and monitoring of the locations of their phones during the four-month period when they were in Portugal. A number of potentially key sites have been identified by investigators using satellite technology to pinpoint where mobile phones were used, a source said.The couple's claim to be under surveillance is thought to stem from information put to them during the investigation that could only have come from covert surveillance.Portuguese law allows investigators to set up covert surveillance if a judge deems it crucial to solving the case. Mr Lourenco confirmed that bugging would potentially be permissible in the case because the sentence for manslaughter, a possible charge, was more than three years.In a separate development yesterday, it emerged that Mr and Mrs McCann believe they can explain the "scent of death" allegedly detected in the rear of their hire car by a pair of British police sniffer dogs, and the sample of bodily fluids, reportedly bearing their daughter's DNA, also gathered from the boot of the Renault Scenic, not hired until 25 days after she disappeared.The couple have told friends that there was no rubbish collection at the hired villa into which they moved some weeks after Madeleine vanished, meaning they had to use their car to transport all the household waste to a local rubbish tip. This included rotting meat, decaying food and soiled nappies belonging to Madeleine's two-year-old twin siblings. It is thought that Mr and Mrs McCann will seek to argue that this material could have contaminated the car and confused the police dogs.
