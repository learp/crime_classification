One of the men at the centre of the Victoria Beckham kidnap trial that collapsed last week said today the plan was "just a joke" and he was the victim of a "set-up".Adrian Pasareanu, 28, said he intended to sue for compensation after being wrongly imprisoned for 220 days after the plot was "uncovered" by the News of the World.Mr Pasareanu, a Romanian asylum seeker who came to Britain last October, claimed his co-defendants were merely acquaintances whom he met "for a couple of beers and to play pool" every week.In an interview with BBC Radio 5 today he said he was not part of any gang planning to abduct the football star's wife and two children. And he said he thought the idea that anyone was seriously planning such an audacious plot was laughable. The trial of Mr Pasareanu and four other men accused of conspiring to kidnap Mrs Beckham collapsed last week when the crown prosecution service said it could no longer offer evidence because the main witness, Florim Gashi, had been paid Â£10,000 by the News of the World.Mr Pasareanu said he always felt that Mr Gashi, a Kosovan parking attendant, was "a puppet" and somebody else had "masterminded" the whole operation.He said he and his co-defendants thought Mr Gashi was just "a clown" and someone who they laughed about.He said he had never met Mazher Mahmood, the News of the World's investigative reporter, who revealed the sensational news that an alleged gang were planning to kidnap Mrs Beckham last year.Mr Pasareanu said he was "miles away" from the car park in which his co-defendants were arrested and the first he knew of any police investigation was when he went home one afternoon with his girlfriend to find armed police with alsatian dogs at his door, at which point he said he "froze".Since the collapse of the trial the News of the World has mounted a vigorous defence of its scoop, branding the CPS "tawdry" for trying to shift blame on to the newspaper for the collapse of the trial.Mr Pasareanu's father has already said he will be suing the News of the World for libel and although today the Romanian did not say against whom he would be taking legal action his lawyers are almost certain to consider making a case against the police and prison authorities.He told the BBC he was "not ashamed to say that I was naive" to believe that justice would have been done earlier. "Nobody believed I was innocent."Bob Satchwell of the Society of Newspaper Editors said he did not think it was necessary to introduce new laws to ban papers paying for stories. "On occasion, it's the only way to get information; to get someone to talk. It's not just journalists, it's not just tabloids who pay for information, the police often do it," he said.
