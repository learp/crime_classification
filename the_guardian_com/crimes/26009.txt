A classroom supervisor had sex with a 15-year-old pupil at a school where three teachers had already been convicted of having relationships with pupils, a court heard yesterday.Headlands school, in Bridlington, east Yorkshire, had been blighted by "sexually inappropriate conduct", Helen Hendry, prosecuting, said.She told Hull crown court that Christopher Reen was the fifth member of the school's staff to face criminal proceedings in recent years.Reen, who covered classes for absent staff, had replaced a female member of staff who was suspended following allegations of inappropriate behaviour and whose case was still going through the courts, Hendry said."In recent years, Headlands school has been blighted by members of staff who have let the school down very badly," she told the court."Three teachers have been given prison sentences for sexually inappropriate conduct of various sorts with pupils."Reen had pleaded guilty to breach of trust but said in a statement he had no idea that the girl was under 16. He said he had been "tricked" into believing she was not underage.The class supervisor, who was 30 at the time of the alleged offences, denies six counts of sexual activity with a child under 16.The relationship started last year after the girl applied to join a martial arts club run by Reen and not connected to the school, the court heard.He had sent her an unsolicited text message and a full sexual relationship developed.Hendry said police found evidence of 800 text messages or calls to the girl from Reen's mobile phone between July and October last year, and told the court he was telling "utter lies" about not knowing her age.Her date of birth was on the form for the martial arts club, and he had taken a year 10 class that she was in, she said.Hendry said Reen had also received a full induction that stressed issues of safeguarding children and appropriate behaviour because of the previous problems at the school."To try to exculpate himself, he's in fact trying to blame this girl for the predicament he finds himself in," she added.The case continues.
