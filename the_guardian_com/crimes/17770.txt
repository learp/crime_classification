A raft of murder cases could be reopened after a judgment yesterday highlighted a catalogue of serious flaws in the evidence of a Home Office pathologist. The appeal court yesterday delivered a damning analysis of evidence given by Michael Heath at the trial of Steven Puaca, whose conviction for killing his partner was quashed on November 10.Dr Heath faces a Home Office forensic pathology board disciplinary hearing next June over his role in the Puaca case and in the case of Kenneth Fraser, who was arrested and charged with murder after Dr Heath concluded that he had killed his girlfriend by hitting her over the head.Mr Fraser was freed after four other pathologists decided that she had died falling down stairs."You can bet your life lots of convicted criminals will now come out of the woodwork and try to jump on the bandwagon and say 'my conviction ought to be looked at again'," said one QC."Potentially dozens of cases need to be reviewed," said Mr Puaca's solicitor, Chris Brown. "Our concern, having dealt with this case, is that there may be several other Steven Puacas out there."Dr Heath has been a Home Office pathologist for 14 years and carried out postmortems in a number of high-profile cases, including those of Myra Hindley after she died in 2003, and Lin and Megan Russell, for whose killing Michael Stone is serving life.There have also been questions about the advice Dr Heath gave relating to the case from 2002 of Stuart Lubbock who was found dead in the entertainer Michael Barrymore's swimming pool.Mr Puaca, 36, spent three years in jail after being convicted in November 2002 of murdering Jacqueline Tindsley, 55, who was found dead in bed at their Lowestoft flat. Dr Heath put the cause of death as smothering but two defence pathologists - backed up by five more pathologists at appeal - said there was no pathological evidence for that conclusion. They thought she had died from a drugs overdose, perhaps coupled with a fit.Ms Tindsley was found in a foetal position face down on the bed. Dr Heath said her attacker had pressed her face into the bed. But giving the court's reasons forquashing the conviction on November 10, Lord Justice Hooper said: "We confess to a certain surprise that the deceased could have been suffocated in this way, but that was the evidence which Dr Heath gave."Ms Tindsley had been drinking and had a history of drug overdosing. Tests showed she had taken five different prescription drugs, one at "levels associated with fatalities".The judge said Dr Heath had failed to draw attention to the lack of pathological evidence supporting his findings.Lord Justice Hooper also outlined the appeal judges' "strong criticism" of the way Dr Heath gave evidence, which could have confused the jury.
