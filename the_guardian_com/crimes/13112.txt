The response of the Cumbria police to the shootings by Derrick Bird is to be "peer reviewed" by senior officers and national firearms experts, David Cameron told MPs today.He disclosed that the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) is to set up two rapid inquiries into last week's murders, looking at the response and tactics of the Cumbrian police and at the operation of firearms licensing.The prime minister said that the police reviews would be made public but he cautioned against leaping to conclusions or introducing knee-jerk legislation.The senior police inquiries are being set up at the request of Cumbria's chief constable, Craig Mackey, after he formally wrote to the Acpo president, Sir Hugh Orde, asking for help.Questions have been raised over whether the police could have done more to stop Bird, particularly after it emerged that unarmed officers chased him in a van but had to abandon their pursuit when he pointed his gun directly at them.Cameron also gave the first indication of the terms of reference of the official Home Office review of the gun laws.At the start of prime minister's questions in the Commons today, MPs observed a minute's silence in memory of those who died last week.Later in the session, Cameron indicated that he thought mental health issues and the question of police visits to those who kept guns and ammunition at home needed to be examined.But he also went out of his way to reassure MPs who raised concerns about the impact on the use of guns for sport. He said when he served on the Commons home affairs select committee he recalled hearing evidence from Acpo that there was very little "leakage" of legal weapons into the illegal market.Cameron told MPs: "It is right to reflect on this appalling tragedy and think how best we go forward. Specifically on the gun laws, we need to be clear first about the full facts of the case."We also need to determine the type and the scope of reviews that will take place after this tragedy. Of course the Home Office will look again at the gun laws in the light of that."And I can announce today that the chief constable of Cumbria has already written to the Acpo president asking him to support a peer review to be conducted by national police experts on firearms licensing, the police firearms response, and firearms tactics."I do believe we shouldn't leap to conclusions. I don't believe in knee-jerk legislation. We do have some of the tightest gun laws in this country. But of course we should look again in terms of this issue at what sort of review is right for people in west Cumbria."Cameron said he was meeting two MPs representing the affected area after question time and invited the acting Labour leader, Harriet Harman, to join him and the home secretary, Theresa May, for the talks."In the end what we must do is make sure we do the right thing by the people of west Cumbria and make sure they are properly served in the things we decide as a government."
