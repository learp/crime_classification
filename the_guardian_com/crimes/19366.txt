An 11-year-old girl who was rescued from the building is in a critical condition.The two suspects, a 27-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman, were arrested late last night at an address in south London, Scotland Yard said.Fire crews used thermal imaging cameras and breathing apparatus to rescue the five people trapped in the flat. All were unconscious and suffering from smoke inhalation.They included two women, aged 45 and 23, the 11-year-old girl, a four-year-old boy and the toddler, all of whom were related. The two women and the boy were said to be in a serious but stable condition in hospital."This fire has wrecked the lives of those involved, and I am appealing to anyone who may have witnessed this incident to contact us and help piece together what happened," Acting Detective Chief Inspector Rick Murphy said.Eight ambulances and four fire engines were sent to the blaze, which is being treated as suspicious following initial investigations.
