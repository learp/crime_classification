A book by the former lover of Anthony Allen finally brought the mothballed murder inquiry back to life, the jury at Plymouth crown court heard.But the publication of Presumed Dead by wealthy restaurant owner Eunice Yabsley was only part of a snail's pace crawl towards action over the suspected murder of Mr Allen's second wife and their two children. Superintendent Paul Davies, head of the renewed inquiry, admitted that police had been slow to act on Mrs Yabsley's autobiography, despite the fact that it contained new evidence. The book was published under her maiden name of Eunice Chapman in 1992, five years after she broke up with Mr Allen, but the case was not reopened until 2001. Spare time detective work by a police sergeant intrigued by the mystery also failed to trigger immediate action, although his conclusions were circulated to colleagues in two papers. Peter Wycliffe-Jones gave one of the papers the same title as Mrs Yabsley's book, Presumed Dead, and called the other Vanishing Angels. Mr Davies said the sergeant's work had contained inaccuracies but had been seen by officers who decided to reopen the case. Mr Allen was rearrested and interviewed and Mrs Yabsley was also asked for a new statement about a passage in her book. "There was reference in it to her seeing the defendant with scratch marks to his arms when he visited her on the morning of May 27 1975," he told the court. "That had not been contained in her original statement." John Aspinall QC, defending, said evidence showed that the police were aware of the book as early as 1993 when it was openly on sale. Mr Davies agreed with him that "no police officer made any endeavour in 1993 to make any inquiry of [Mrs Yabsley] with a view to taking a witness statement".
