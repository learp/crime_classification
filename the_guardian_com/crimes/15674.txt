Sion Jenkins will be freed on bail pending his retrial for the alleged murder of his foster daughter, Billie-Jo, it emerged today.The former teacher was this morning given conditional bail during a short hearing at the Old Bailey, which he did not attend. His father, David Jenkins, attended court and is providing a £250,000 surety for his son. Mr Jenkins' brother is providing a further £50,000 surety. The conditions stipulate that Mr Jenkins will live with his father in Aberystwyth, Wales, and report to police daily. Another condition is that he must not talk to his children about the forthcoming retrial, including mentioning it in any letters or emails he might send to them. He will also not take part in any press conferences on order of the judge, Mrs Justice Rafferty. The website, Justice for Sion Jenkins, will be taken off the internet, and Mr Jenkins will give up his passport.The 46-year-old was jailed for life six years ago for murder, but his conviction was quashed last month. He is due to be retried at the Old Bailey later this year following an appeal court ruling that new forensic evidence made his original conviction unsafe. Mr Jenkins was expected to be released from Belmarsh prison, south London, at some time today.Today's bail application by his barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, was held in chambers without the press or public being allowed in. In July 1998, Mr Jenkins was convicted at Lewes crown court of battering his 13-year-old foster daughter to death with an 18-inch metal tent spike as she painted a patio door at their home in Hastings, East Sussex, on February 15 1997.
