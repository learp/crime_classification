Four men have been jailed for life for killing a 17-year-old boy who was chased out of a birthday party by attackers carrying champagne and brandy bottles.Kelvin Chibueze was fatally stabbed inside the club where the party was being held.He was chased again and attacked with glass and broken bottles, the Old Bailey heard. As he collapsed, Kelvin clutched his chest and said: "I can't breathe, I can't breathe."Dale Williams, 21, was given a minimum term of 26 years, Lerone Boye, 26, was given 28 years, Roger Damali, 31, received 23 years and Hugo Nwankwo, 18, was given 16 years. The men, all from east London, were found guilty of murder last month.The death followed a clash between two groups of males at the Arteflex Club in Ilford High Road, east London, in the early hours of 15 August last year.Judge John Bevan condemned the wall of silence which surrounded the case. He said: "The veil of silence which has fallen over the main participants in this case speaks volumes as to the cowardice and moral bankruptcy on both sides of the parties."Witness after witness refused to speak out and avenge the death of their 17-year-od friend."Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, said that inside the club Kelvin had been confronted by youths brandishing knives.A woman working at the bar saw people pushing backwards towards the bar.Whittam said: "She then saw a number of 'boys' picking up champagne and Hennessy brandy bottles from the bar and running out of the club with them."Outside the club, Kelvin's friends ran off and Kelvin was stabbed again by two men in an adjoining car park near Ilford police station. Police recovered four knives from the area which had traces of Kelvin's blood on them.Whittam said: "The killing was brought about by the endemic carrying of knives by young men."A postmortem examination found Kelvin died from the stab to the chest but he had also been stabbed on his left forearm, left buttock and on one of his palms.Detective Sergeant Mark Romain, of the homicide and serious crime command, said later: "Kelvin Chibueze was ruthlessly attacked, chased and left to die."The violence used brutally ended a young man's life and showed scant regard for the safety of others in this busy venue."
