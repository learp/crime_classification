A third biker has been found guilty of murdering Hells Angel Gerry Tobin, who was shot in the back of the head on the M40 after a motorcycle festival.Malcolm Bull, 53, of Milton Keynes, was convicted by an 11-1 majority verdict by a jury at Birmingham crown court after six days of deliberation. He was also found guilty of possessing a shotgun.Simon Turner, 41, a mechanic from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, and Dane Garside, 42, a lorry driver from Coventry, were convicted yesterday of murder and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.The jury has yet to pass verdicts on three other men, Garside's brother, Karl Garside, 45, Dean Taylor, 47, and Ian Cameron, 46, all from Coventry. They all deny murder and possession of firearms.A seventh man, Sean Creighton, 44, from Coventry, pleaded guilty at the start of the seven-week trial.Tobin, a 35-year-old mechanic from Mottingham, south London, was not known to the men but was singled out simply because he was a "fully patched" member of the Hells Angels, the court heard. On August 12 last year he was riding a Harley-Davidson back to London after the annual Bulldog Bash festival in Long Marston, Warwickshire, when he was shot dead from a green Rover which pulled alongside as he rode down the motorway at about 80mph.The killing was well planned and demanded a high degree of precision, Timothy Raggatt, prosecuting, told the court.Creighton was described in court as the sergeant-at-arms of the south Warwickshire chapter of the Outlaws bikers gang, to which all seven men belonged. They regarded the Long Marston area as part of their patch, the prosecution said.Dane Garside had admitted driving the car but said he thought it was only a surveillance operation. Turner, the court heard, had been jailed for 10 years in 1993 for stabbing and throwing petrol over a man he had never met before who owed money to a friend.
