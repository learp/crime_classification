The son of the former health secretary Patricia Hewitt has been charged with possession of cocaine.Nicholas Hewitt Birtles, whose father is Judge William Birtles, will appear in court later this month after being charged with possession of a class A drug.Hewitt Birtles, a 21-year-old retail sales representative, was arrested in Camden Square, north London, on Saturday evening.He was one of two people detained after uniformed police approached three men in a car at 8.15pm and found small amounts of powder.Both were taken to a north-west London police station and Hewitt Birtles, of Rochester Square, north London, was charged and bailed yesterday.A Scotland Yard spokesman said he would appear before Highbury Corner magistrates on 30 September. The second man, aged 22, was bailed until 6 November.A spokesman for Hewitt told the Sun it was "a private matter that the family are dealing with".Hewitt, who has been the MP for Leicester West since 1997, announced in June that she intended to leave parliament at the next election, saying she wanted to spend more time with her family."The truth is that, after 13 years as an MP and 10 years in government, I have not seen enough of my family," she told the Leicester Mercury. "They have paid a high price for that."In 2007, Judge Birtles spoke out against plans for a new pharmacy with a needle exchange programme near the family home in Camden, telling the Chemist & Druggist magazine the area had "a serious drug problem" and drug dealers operated at the end of the family's road.
