Local newspaper journalist Sally Murrer pleaded not guilty today to obtaining police information illegally.Murrer, a part-time reporter for the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper, entered a not guilty plea on the three counts of the same charge of aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office.She is accused of helping Mark Kearney, a former detective for Thames Valley Police, to leak police secrets over the period of November 2006 to April 2007.At the same hearing today at Kingston crown court in south-west London, Kearney pleaded not guilty on eight counts of misconduct in a public office.It emerged last month that Kearney was the police officer who bugged the conversations of Labour MP Sadiq Khan, although Murrer's charges are not connected to this.Kearney's son, Harry, also pleaded not guilty on a single count of aiding and abetting his father's activities, and to a separate charge of possessing a class A drug.Another defendant, private detective Derek Webb, pleaded not guilty to five counts of aiding and abetting Kearney's alleged misconduct.It is alleged that Kearney supplied information to Murrer for three stories. She was arrested in May last year.Even though Murrer's charges are not connected to the MP bugging row, she has previously said she believes it is the "missing piece" in the jigsaw puzzle of her case.Murrer has said that she believes that concern on the part of the police that Kearney - who she describes as a friend - would blow the whistle on the Khan bugging may explain the investigations into both of them, launched last year.A trial has been scheduled to start in November and it is expected to last five weeks. A pre-trial hearing was also fixed for September 5.Legal teams have been given 28 days to listen to the taped conversations between Kearney and Murrer which form part of the evidence.The court heard that some of the evidence in the trial was of a sensitive nature."There is the issue of the sensitivity of some of the evidence and the propriety of that being heard in public," prosecuting barrister Christopher Foulkes told the court.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
