A teenager who was jailed for the rape of a schoolgirl two weeks ago was given a second life sentence yesterday for killing a father of two in a flash of temper.Joseph Ekaette, 19, stabbed Stevens Nyembo-Ya-Muteba, 41, a mathematician who was awaiting a place at Cambridge University, through the heart when he told Ekaette and his gang to be quiet as they caused a disturbance in his block of flats. After being found guilty of the murder by an Old Bailey jury, it emerged that Ekaette had also taken part in the rape of a 14-year-old girl that was filmed on a mobile phone.Detectives investigating Nyembo-Ya-Muteba's killing were alerted to the rape after they discovered the mobile phone footage. The victim had suffered amnesia and could not remember the attack.Ekaette, who came to Britain from Nigeria in 2003, and Sebastian King, 20, were each given indefinite sentences for the rape at Blackfriars crown court on November 23, with minimum terms of five and six years respectively.Yesterday, Judge Richard Hawkins sentenced Ekaette to youth detention for life with a minimum of 14 years. He said: "The crime was committed in a sudden flash of temper on your part over a trivial incident when Stevens was trying to get you and your group to leave a block of flats so that he could get a decent night's sleep."Nyembo-Ya-Muteba's wife, Veronique, 30, told the court in an impact statement that their daughters, five and eight, have nightmares and have needed counselling since the murder of their father. "He was ambitious for himself and family. He wanted to better himself and set a good example for his children," she said.
