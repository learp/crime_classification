Three men who murdered the son of a sub-postmaster were jailed for life with a minimum of 34 years today by a judge who branded them "parasitic criminals".Christopher Morrissey, 32, his brother Declan Morrissey, 34, and Anselm Ribera, 34, murdered 29-year-old Craig Hodson-Walker during an attempted robbery at the post office he ran with his parents in Fairfield, Worcestershire.The gang, all from Birmingham, also attempted to murder Mr Hodson-Walker's father, Ken, shooting him in the leg in the January raid.Sentencing the trio at Birmingham crown court, Mr Justice Colman Treacy said he had been shocked at the "wicked and ruthless" crimes."Even after many years in law, I confess that on first seeing the CCTV of the murderous raid, I was shocked by what I saw. The effect of what the raiders did has been catastrophic to the Hodson-Walker family and his fiancee, Lisa Bundy."
