The protester who threw a foam pie at Rupert Murdoch has been jailed for six weeks.Jonathan May-Bowles, 26, pleaded guilty last week to assaulting the 80-year-old media tycoon as he gave evidence to the House of Commons culture committee about the phone-hacking scandal.May-Bowles, also known by his stage name Jonnie Marbles, disrupted proceedings by launching a paper plate of shaving foam at Murdoch.Passing sentence at City of Westminster magistrates court in central London, district judge Daphne Wickham said May-Bowles would serve three weeks in prison. She also ordered him to pay a £15 victim surcharge and £250 costs.The judge condemned his actions in interrupting the evidence Murdoch was giving to the committee, which she said was "of huge importance" to many people."This is a parliamentary process, which as you know conducts itself with dignity and in a civilised fashion," she said. "Everybody else in the room expected that, with one exception – you. You attended those proceedings with only one intention, to disrupt them."The judge said she had taken into account the fear of injury felt by Murdoch, who could not have known what was in the foam pie.The incident came towards the end of Murdoch's appearance alongside his son, James, before MPs in the Wilson Room at Portcullis House on 19 July.The prosecutor, Malachy Pakenham, said May-Bowles smuggled the foam pie into the building hidden in an old shirt, which he discarded in bins in the men's toilets. Inside the committee room May-Bowles seemed to show little interest in the Murdochs' evidence, the court heard, even appearing to doze off at several points.But shortly after the committee chairman, John Whittingdale, announced that the session was drawing to a close, May-Bowles got up from his seat, walked over to Murdoch and thrust the foam towards his face.Murdoch's wife, Wendi Deng, leapt to his defence, first pushing the protester away and then throwing the plate at him as he was led off. Murdoch confirmed in a statement to police that the shaving cream made contact with his skin and clothes.One police officer described the "bedlam" that followed the attack, with journalists pushing forward and the public trying to get out of the room.The officer said Murdoch's bodyguard looked "as if he wanted to hit" May-Bowles, while the Tory MP Louise Mensch was "wide-eyed and open-mouthed" at what had happened.The protester was arrested and taken to Charing Cross police station where he was interviewed but did not answer officers' questions.The court heard that Murdoch did not support the charge of assault but the Crown Prosecution Service decided to proceed with the case.May-Bowles, of Windsor, in Berkshire, admitted assault and causing harassment, alarm or distress at a hearing on Friday.Tim Greaves, defending, said the part-time standup comic intended to "make a statement" through his actions."Slapstick and throwing pies dates back to the 1900s as a recognised form of protest," he said."He intended to express how he was feeling and how he believed the British public were feeling, and he sought to do that in the least harmful way he could."He said May-Bowles was an educated father of a young son who was involved in protest groups and had no previous criminal convictions.
