The government's policing reforms are failing to make serious progress and officers are spending no more time on the beat now than they were two years ago, the police's "red tape tsar" has said.Jan Berry, the head of the reducing bureaucracy practitioners group, said the introduction of 27,000 handheld computers for beat officers had not helped because the machines' functionality was so limited they couldn't be used to file crime reports and officers had to return to the police station to process each incident.The devices currently only allow officers to clock on or off and receive emails. Only a few forces allow officers out-of-station access to essential databases.Berry also said plans to roll out a pilot scheme, under which constables are given the discretion to deal with minor juvenile offenders by a proverbial "clip round the ear", were being resisted by senior officers because they did not count towards their official detection rates.Meanwhile Alan Johnson, the home secretary, made no pretence today that his policing white paper – which rejects any enforced mergers of the 43 police forces in England and Wales or the introduction of new forms of local accountability – was about consolidating his predecessor Jacqui Smith's attempts to set up neighbourhood policing teams and to introduce national minimum standards of service.Instead, the white paper proposes ways of finding 5% efficiency savings in the £9.5bn annual police service budget producing £100m savings in 2010/11 rising to £545 million by 2014.The savings are to be partly achieved by a £70m-a-year cut in overtime within five years and by introducing the central purchasing of helicopters, police cars and uniforms. The Home Office estimates a national approach could cut the number of police helicopters and other aircraft from 33 to 27, saving nearly £23m a year.Similar arrangements could lead to the provision of a standardised beat patrol vehicle in police livery with blue lights available for use across all 43 forces. The scheme will also to be applied to police uniforms – currently each force has its own variation with helmets or caps – and to the provision of body armour.The white paper highlights possible changes to patrols, including moving to officers patrolling singly rather than in pairs in safer areas such as town centres where a visible presence is required. The white paper said patrolling in pairs could be expensive and discourage the public from approaching officers.But this option, along with using more special constables on Friday and Saturday night patrols, is left to the discretion of individual chief constables.The document confirmed the previous decision to drop plans for direct elections to local police authorities saying they could prove expensive and risk politicising the police. Instead police authorities are to adopt a higher public profile with a police authority member for each local police division by April. Forces are to be encouraged to hold several public meetings a year.The white paper ruled out compulsory mergers between forces in England and Wales but instead spoke of removing the barriers to voluntary mergers where it would be in the public interest. These included equalising the police council tax precept for different forces over time. Four more regional partnerships are to be set up to tackle organised crime.The Police Federation said a drastic cutback in overtime would "lead to a police service in carnage that cannot deliver. Next the government will try to schedule where and when crime happens."The Association of Police Authorities said they it was disappointed the government had shied away from strengthening local accountability arrangements for local partnerships. The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank said the government had ducked the chance for any real reform of the police.
