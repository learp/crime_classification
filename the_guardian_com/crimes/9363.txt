Antisocial neighbours could have their housing benefits curtailed if they refuse rehabilitation classes, under a crackdown announced as part of the government's "Respect" agenda today.Following a one-off "open cabinet" meeting this morning addressed by victims of drug dealers and yobs, the work and penions minister, John Hutton, unveiled the scheme, saying pilot schemes would be up and running by 2008. Legislation could follow shortly after.Mr Blair, back from a week's holiday in Italy and keen to seize the domestic agenda, went into the meeting warning local councils they may face financial penalties from next April if they do not draw up antsocial behaviour action plans.The PM said there were "gaps" between those councils implementing their new powers, and those who were failing to do so.After the Downing Street meeting, Mr Hutton said people evicted from their homes for antisocial conduct will have their housing benefit "sanctioned" unless they undergo rehabilitation."Communities are fed up of the disruption caused by people who show no respect for their neighbours."The threat of sanctioning housing benefit will send a clear signal to the handful of people evicted each year for antisocial behaviour that they must address their problem behaviour and engage in rehabilitation."It is not right that people who get evicted should be able simply to move to another area and continue their bad behaviour. These antisocial neighbours must realise they have reached the end of the line."The right to housing benefit must and will carry a responsibility to be a decent neighbour."Under the proposals, members of a household evicted for antisocial behaviour will be offered "appropriate rehabilitation".If they refuse, the local authority will be able to issue a warning notice, advising them that they will be "sanctioned" when they claim housing benefit.The penalties will rise incrementally - beginning with a 10% loss of benefit for four weeks, rising to 20% for the next four weeks followed by total removal for up to five years if they still do not co-operate.Lower rates will apply to those in hardship and normal payments will be resumed if, at any stage, rehabilitation is accepted.Unusually, part of the meeting held in the cabinet room at No 10 was thrown open to the cameras and reporters.Ministers attending - including the home secretary, John Reid, Mr Hutton and the local government secretary, Ruth Kelly - were briefed on the progress being made by police and council chiefs.Opening the meeting, Mr Blair told them: "My impression going out and talking to people about this is that there is a real difference being made, especially where the powers are being used and people get behind it."But at the same time there are gaps."But the Liberal Democrats, who under Sir Menzies Campbell have reversed their opposition to the controversial Asbos, said the meeting was a "smokescreen for a government in turmoil"."It is a sad reflection on nine years of Labour government that Tony Blair has started financially threatening deprived areas which are already in need of every available penny to tackle crime and the causes of crime," Sir Menzies said.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said today "no amount of talking up this Respect agenda will drive down crime on the streets".Adam Sampson, director of the housing charity Shelter, also questioned the effectiveness of such a plan.He said: "There is no strong evidence that hitting people in the pocket achieves the desired effect and until we know whether people are actually refusing to cooperate ... it is impossible to support such a measure."Worst of all, innocent children are likely to face homelessness because the desire to get tough with the parents and withdraw their housing benefit happens before there are services for people to turn down in the first place."At Labour's local election campaign launch in April, the PM revealed he was in favour of "naming and shaming" Tory and Lib Dem councils which refused to use their new powers to combat antisocial behaviour.The initiative under discussion today is a move to force every council to have a formal "local area agreement" in place by April setting out its strategy to combat antisocial behaviour."Everyone deserves the right to be protected from thugs and yobs in their local neighbourhood," a Downing Street spokesman said."From next April funding from Whitehall for local authorities will be dependent on them implementing detailed plans to tackle antisocial behaviour."New laws to ensure unruly children can be dealt with at a young age before they become a serious menace and action against "neighbours from hell", will also be in the agendaThe spokesman said: "Today is an important landmark in the campaign to restore Respect and tackle antisocial behaviour."We have seen genuine progress on the ground with the new powers making a real impact. "Action to tackle antisocial behaviour has been driven by those who are dealing with it on a daily basis."That is why the PM has invited them into the cabinet room to brief him and colleagues on the progress which they made and hear where they need further support from central government."Mr Blair launched his Respect action plan in January, promising it would "restore the liberty of the law-abiding citizen" by cracking down on yob culture.It included a raft of measures from increased on-the-spot fines for disorder, powers to shut down problem properties and a national parenting academy.Today's meeting is designed to review the effectiveness of efforts so far and examine ways to improve them in the future.
