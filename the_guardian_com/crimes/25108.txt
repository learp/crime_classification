A wealthy landowner jailed for murdering his wife is believed to have finally revealed where her body is buried almost two years after he was convicted of the killing.Adrian Prout was found guilty of murdering retired teacher Kate Prout, who went missing in 2007, even though the body was never found.Gloucestershire police confirmed on Thursday it had received "significant information" about the case. It is understood Prout has owned up to murdering his wife. There were unconfirmed reports that the spot pinpointed is a wood close to where the Prouts lived in Redmarley, Gloucestershire.A police spokesman said: "Police who investigated the murder of Kate Prout have received significant information about the case. Gloucestershire officers are reviewing this information and will be following up the matter with some urgency. It would not be appropriate to comment any further at this stage."Prout, 47, killed his 55-year-old wife during an acrimonious divorce. A trial at Bristol crown court was told that, shortly before she vanished in November 2007, Mrs Prout increased the amount of money she was asking for as part of the settlement.The court also heard that Prout, who had a pipe-laying business and ran a pheasant shoot, may have fallen in love with a house-sitter.Sentencing Prout in February last year to at least 18 years in prison, Mr Justice Davis said: "One of the pieces of evidence that sticks in my mind is Kate Prout used to remember her parents by placing flowers on their grave."I expect her family would like to place flowers on her grave but they can't, and they can't because of you."Ms Prout's family have appealed for Prout to reveal the location of the body.The Prouts' former home, Redhill Farm, was excavated by detectives in their fruitless search for the body of Kate after she vanished.
