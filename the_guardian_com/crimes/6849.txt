Videos of police officers in action are being broadcast on an internet site more used to Beadle's About style footage, in a bid to improve the force's image and attract new recruits.Videos of West Yorkshire officers patrolling the streets and talking about their work nestle alongside clips titled "policeman shoots himself in foot" and "fuck the police" on the YouTube site which has tapped into the legal side of the "happy slapping", video phone carrying youth culture.But the force's web communications manager, Patrick Brooke, says the police no longer feel threatened by such juxtaposition."There was a time when we would have insisted our videos were safely tucked away on our own site, but not now," he said."This has certainly opened up a different audience for us. People going to the YouTube tend to be younger and not fully aware of policing issues. This enables us to communicate with them in a new way."The West Yorkshire force created the videos for its new website 999TV, which is being piloted before a formal launch in the new year.The force has teamed up with fire and ambulance services and local authorities in the county to create the site, but so far is the only one to feature real officers talking about their day-to-day work.After seeing Greater Manchester police's appeal for witnesses in the Jessie James murder case streamed on YouTube, the force launched its videos there too and in just one month these have already prompted inquiries about policing jobs.The force's acting chief constable, Julia Hodson, said: "Communication is a vital part of policing and we are always looking for new ways to reach people."West Yorkshire is an innovative force. The video 'shorts' enable officers and police staff to speak directly about their work in their own words. Their enthusiasm is compelling."Viewers learn about real policing, whilst it gives those interested in a police career a taste of its challenges and rewards. This is early days, but we are delighted with the public's response."A survey of those visiting the site showed more than 90% wanted to "see more" and three-quarters felt the video messages were "valuable in helping the public to understand policing issues".Ms Hodson added: "Our initial aim was to highlight our neighborhood police teams. On the NPT website you can use your postcode to find local information and subscribe for free updates from local officers."But we are already developing the TV idea to include a broader range of issues and candidates."This is not the first foray into online publicity using real officers for West Yorkshire police; earlier this year, the force developed blogs from a special constable and police community support officer. The force's main website also features podcasts.Plans to further develop the force's use of new and unusual media are already in the pipeline with a separate project to display dynamic messages on plasma screens in places such as Leeds railway station and Leeds/Bradford airport.And the force has been demonstrating models to the Home Office to bring together all these channels - plasma screens, online videos and podcasting - under one umbrella for use with coordinated safety and emergency bulletins on a regional and national scale.As part of this work, WY police has just commissioned research from outside specialists on how it can improve the way it provides information direct to community groups, particularly in light of growing trends of DIY media such as blogging, podcasts and citizen journalism.
