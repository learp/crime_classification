Usually at least a little bit of digging is required before a multi-million pound banking scam is uncovered. But when an auditor peered into the safe at financial adviser Graham Price's office, the evidence leapt out at him in an IOU note reading: "Borrowed £7m from the Halifax."Price, it emerged in court yesterday, had stolen £7m to bankroll an unsuccessful gambling habit and had pocketed another £3m from private clients. Price, 58, a businessman in Gowerton, near Swansea, faces prison after admitting 43 counts of theft and deception and asking for 263 other offences to be taken into consideration. Asked whether he admitted the charges he said: "Each and every one."For more than two decades he had built up a reputation as an honest and reliable businessman, running an estate agency before becoming an agent for the Halifax Bank. But in 2001 he began siphoning cash from the bank and from his private clients. Swansea magistrates court heard that in November last year a Halifax auditor arrived unannounced at Price's office.When he opened the safe he found only three empty boxes and a piece of paper. Price had written on it: "Borrowed £7m from the Halifax" and had even signed it.
