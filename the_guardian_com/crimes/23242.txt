David Cameron has put the brothers who carried out the Edlington attack at the centre of his argument about Britain's "broken society". He insisted it was not an "isolated incident of evil" but part of what he described as a "social recession".Speaking at an event in Gillingham, Kent, Cameron said: "I think when things like this happen it is right to stand back, reflect and ask ourselves some deep ­questions about what is going wrong in our society."I don't think it is right every time one of these events takes place to say that it is just some isolated incident of evil that we should look away from and regret."Are we going to do that every time there is a Jamie Bulger or a Baby Peter or a Ben Kinsella or a Garry Newlove or what has happened in Doncaster? We shouldn't. We should ask about what has gone wrong with our society, and what we are going to do about it."His intervention drew comparisons with Tony Blair when the then shadow home secretary made a high-profile intervention on the murder of James Bulger.The Tory leader is intent on keeping up pressure on Gordon Brown over the issue, having already accused him of presiding over a "cover-up" in the response of social services to the incident.Defending himself against accusations he was "playing politics" with the issue, Cameron said: "I think it is right to raise it in a responsible way and it is right to have this debate about how we can strengthen our society."Liam Byrne, the chief secretary to the Treasury, called Cameron's speech "unpleasant" and suggested that by trying to draw political lessons from the case, the Tories were "tarring the people of Doncaster, if not the people of Britain, with the same kind of standards and I think people will recoil from that".Cameron and the government have battled this week over whether or not the full serious case review needed to be published, with the NSPCC confirming it had advised the government it was inappropriate to make available more than the executive summary.But Cameron said the publication of summaries in the past had inhibited proper remedies being implemented.Anne Longfield, chief executive of the charity 4Children, appeared to support Cameron's call saying: "Strengthening the serious case review process has to be a priority – to publish more intelligent, informative and reflective reports that draw out findings, failings and strengths in the history of the case, to help practitioners understand what happened and what needs to be improved to prevent further cases happening."
