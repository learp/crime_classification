The Liberal Democrats would slash police and prosecutors' powers by restoring the right to silence, preventing the use of hearsay evidence in trials and removing the DNA of people arrested but not charged with crimes from databases, they will announce today.Sir Menzies Campbell will unveil his plans for a "freedom bill", arguing that Labour is addicted to legislation and pledging to repeal unnecessary and often illiberal laws.The Lib Dem leader will also promise to restore rights to protest removed by the government and allow whistleblowers to claim a public interest defence again.But Labour is likely to seize upon the proposals as evidence that the Lib Dems are "soft" on crime, an argument which Sir Menzies's party has sought to shake off in recent years by promoting a policy of "tough liberalism".Speaking in London this morning, Sir Menzies will set out proposals to make repealing laws easier, warning: "This government is addicted to legislating."In its rush to respond to tabloid headlines Labour has undermined civil liberties, stifled business with red tape and created crises in our public services."He will add: "When it comes making new laws, it is quality, not quantity, that counts... We need to remove excessive laws, and show that by legislating less, we can legislate better."The Lib Dems have calculated that parliament has passed 114,366 pages of legislation since 1997: the equivalent of 205 copies of War and Peace, or, by weight, two John Prescotts."That's the equivalent of 33 pages of legislation per day... This is legislative madness," Sir Menzies will say.A Lib Dem spokesman said that the bill marked an important shift in the party's own thinking, adding: "Perhaps in the past we have been guilty of seeking a legislative solution to every problem... [But] often it's the cause of problems rather than a solution to them."According to the Lib Dems, the government has created more than 3,000 new crimes, at a rate of nearly one a day.The party has singled out ten measures it believes should be axed immediately, including identity cards, control orders and the US-UK extradition deal approved by parliament on Tuesday night.But changes to police and prosecution powers are likely to be particularly contentious. At present, juries are able to take a defendant's silence into consideration when reaching a verdict. Proposals to restrict the DNA database to people convicted of offences would also be controversial, as the police argue that cross-checking can help to connect persistent offenders to unsolved crimes.The Lib Dems say officers would still be able to check suspects' DNA samples against the database before destroying the samples."The government is increasingly moving to a position of suspects being presumed guilty rather than innocent," said a spokesman.The Lib Dem left scored a double victory yesterday, as Paul Holmes defeated Jenny Willott for the chairmanship of the parliamentary party and Evan Harris, the backbencher, was re-elected to the party's policy-making body, beating the environment spokesman, Chris Huhne.MPs suggested that the Lib Dem leadership was keen to keep Mr Holmes inside the tent, while leadership hopefuls were anxious that Mr Huhne should not be given too great a platform for a future candidacy.
