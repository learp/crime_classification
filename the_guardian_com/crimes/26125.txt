A 15-year-old army cadet has suffered burns in an unprovoked attack after selling poppies for Remembrance Day.The boy, who was wearing his camouflage uniform, was waiting at a bus stop at 6pm on Saturday in Manchester city centre when a man approached him with an aerosol can and lighter and sprayed him with lit fumes. He suffered minor burns to his face and right forearm, Greater Manchester police said.The attacker, described as black or Asian, 5ft 8in tall and wearing a dark hooded top, walked off from the bus stop by the Manchester Art Gallery opposite George Street without saying a word.Police said the man appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and staggering. They appealed for anyone with information on the attack to come forward.DI Liam Boden said: “This is an absolutely appalling attack on a young man who was raising money to help remember all those who gave their lives fighting bravely for their country. At this stage of our inquiries, we’re keeping an open mind as to what motivated the offender to commit such an act.“Given the initial description we have of the offender, it may be that he was under the influence of something, but whatever his motivation, his violent actions could have scarred this young man for life. Although he has suffered some minor injuries, it is pure luck that he did not sustain more serious burns to his face and body.“Understandably both he and his family are in a state of total shock and cannot believe someone would do this.”
