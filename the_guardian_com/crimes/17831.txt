A Welsh pub has been banned from selling alcohol for a month as part of a series of tough measures to reduce bad behaviour, the local council said today.The ban is just one of several conditions imposed on the Forest Hotel in Treforest, south Wales by Rhondda Cynon Taf council's licensing committee in a fight to curb the pub's "negative impact" on the community.Officers have frequently found underage drinkers at the pub, and received reports of crime and violence.Committee members also requested the removal of the pub's landlord with immediate effect. Other measures being introduced to help improve the behaviour associated with the pub include the installation of high-quality CCTV cameras, the closure of the beer garden after 9pm, and a ban on customers drinking from cans and bottles.Councillor John David said: "This is an important piece of work as it shows the power the licensing authority has when it comes to dealing with premises that are causing community concern. "This process has allowed us to work with the establishment to identify its shortcomings and put into place stringent measures that allow people to enjoy the Forest Hotel in a safe and legal manner, while not causing suffering or upset to the wider area."
