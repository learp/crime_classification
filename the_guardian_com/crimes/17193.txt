While the Press Complaints Commission and the courts are used to dealing with cases where the press have defamed or harassed members of the public, it is not every day a court grants an order preventing the public from harassing the press.A case at Doncaster magistrates court witnessed this role reversal when justices banned a man from further contact with the Barnsley Chronicle. David Pearce, 52, has been issued with an anti-social behaviour order preventing him from contacting anyone at the paper or putting up and distributing leaflets about the paper or any of its staff between now and 2010.Mr Pearce's campaign against the Barnsley weekly started last year while he was appearing on charges at the local magistrates court. He targeted the Chronicle's court reporter Ian Harley, putting up a series of posters in the public area of the court. These contained various defamatory claims about Harley and were drawn to the attention of the police, who questioned Mr Pearce.At a subsequent hearing for failing to comply with the community punishment order his previous court appearance had left him with, Mr Pearce was again spotted pursuing his poster campaign. This cost him a further court appearance in Doncaster, where magistrates issued the Asbo along with a fine-and-costs order for the offence itself.Asbos are civil orders that were introduced through Section One of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. They are issued through magistrates courts, normally at the request of local authorities or police to help deter anti-social, undesirable or disruptive behaviour. Latest figures show that since their introduction there have been over 7,300 Asbos issued in England and Wales.The irony of this case is that Mr Pearce's attempts to name and shame a member of the press has resulted in the press being in a position to name and shame him. Concerns have been raised over the freedom of the press to report on Asbos, especially where juveniles are concerned and the normal reporting restrictions associated with criminal proceedings do not apply - but such freedom is largely accepted as being part of the social framework in which anti-social behavoiur operates.Breach of an Asbo can result in criminal penalties, so if Mr Pearce ignores the order and pursues his campaign against Harley or the Barnsley Chronicle he could be faced with a custodial sentence of up to five years.It's just as well papers get sued for publishing defamatory claims rather than issued with Asbos - otherwise the prospect of editors being banged up behind bars could be a real one.·Edgar Forbes is a senior lecturer in media law at Bournemouth Media School· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
