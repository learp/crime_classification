Video clips of al-Qaida-inspired terrorists beheading people have been found on the mobile phone of a 12-year-old boy, a senior police officer revealed yesterday.The footage was found by teachers who reported the child, who is white, to police after he sent clips to his classmates. The discovery was revealed yesterday to show how children of all religions could be attracted to al-Qaida. West Yorkshire's chief constable, Sir Norman Bettison, said terrorist propaganda was spreading like a virus, and warned that every Muslim child in Britain could be at risk. He raised the example of the 12-year-old during a speech at the Association of Chief Police Officers annual conference in Liverpool. The boy has been referred to a project to divert people from extremism before they turn violent. His parents are not Muslim.Bettison said: "The white child we are working with has been downloading jihadist beheading videos ... He is not a Muslim. He is not driven by ideology - he is too young to spell the word. But he is being influenced and intoxicated by the imagery and appeal of jihadist ... violence." Bettison is running a programme to divert those flirting with violence from carrying out terrorist acts. He told his fellow chief officers: "The AQ [al-Qaida] brand of violent extremism continues to spread like a virus infecting young minds." The 12-year-old, known as BC, is being assessed by the Channel Project. Three police forces are piloting the scheme to try to build links with communities and gather details about possible extremists. Two other cases highlighted by Bettison were of Muslim youths, known as NH and YH, who were reported by their communities because they showed extremist tendencies.
