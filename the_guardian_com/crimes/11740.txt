Terry Venables has emerged as an unlikely potential witness in a Serious Fraud Office investigation into a huge suspected investment scam.The former England football manager is understood to have spoken to SFO investigators about a meeting he held to discuss investment opportunities with Shinder Gangar, the Leicestershire accountant at the centre of the probe. Gangar has repeatedly been questioned on suspicion of cheating investors out of tens of millions of pounds in an allegedly fraudulent scheme offering fabulous returns to those with Â£100,000 or more to spare. He strongly denies wrongdoing.The SFO suspects that Venables is one of several celebrities to whom Gangar tried to sell investments. But the two men, who had not met before, struck no deal and nothing came of the meeting. There is no suggestion of improper conduct by Venables, who declined to comment yesterday.Lord Lloyd Webber, the musical impresario, has also said he rejected a business proposal by Gangar, whose accounting firm, Dobb White, was wound up by the Financial Services Authority in 2003 on suspicion of running an unauthorised investment scheme.Yesterday Gangar denied any unlawful conduct: 'I am an accountant, I have never operated an investment scheme.' He said he was the victim of a vendetta orchestrated by the SFO, which has been investigating the affair for four years and has never charged him. Gangar added that he had recently defeated separate money-laundering charges in court.He said he remembered being introduced to Venables by a mutual acquaintance over lunch at Langan's Brasserie in London. 'We discussed a proposal to develop property in Spain. But I wasn't interested ... I didn't offer him anything.'
