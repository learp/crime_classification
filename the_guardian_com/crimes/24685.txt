The home secretary, Charles Clarke, last night cleared the way for the creation of two new regional "superforces" in England and a single police force to cover the whole of Wales.Outlining his plans to merge 15 existing police forces, the home secretary told chief constables and police authority chairmen that a full-scale merger was now the "only acceptable option" in Wales and the north-east and the west Midlands in England.But he has drawn back from creating a fourth regional superforce in the north-west. Instead he is proposing that Cheshire police merge with Merseyside and Cumbria with Lancashire, but Greater Manchester will remain a standalone force."It is vital that we close the gap in policing serious crime and major incidents identified by Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary last year," Mr Clarke told MPs yesterday.The chief constables and police authorities of the 15 forces involved in this first wave of mergers have until the end of the month to respond to the proposal. If they agree the merger will go ahead straightaway, but if they object it will trigger a four month consultation before a vote in parliament settles the issue.The three new forces will be:· West Midlands: merging Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands forces.· North-east: Cleveland, Durham and Northumbria.· Wales: Dyfed-Powys, Gwent, North Wales and South Wales to merge.A Home Office spokeswoman said yesterday that it did not need all the forces in a single region to agree for a merger to be approved at the end of this month. A staggered approach could be adopted with, for example, Durham and Northumbria merging immediately with Cleveland joining them later.A full report on the financial implications of the mergers, including their impact on council tax bills, is yet to be completed.The mergers would reduce the number of forces in England and Wales from 43 to 33.Mr Clarke said he will hold further talks with police chiefs in the five other regions in England and Wales where the mergers are proving more problematic to see if it is possible to agree a way forward. The most controversial is likely to involve the Yorkshire forces.The situation in London, where it is proposed the City of London police and the British Transport police merge with the Met, will be dealt with later.The mergers announcement provoked a strong reaction from the Conservatives whose police reform spokesman, Nick Herbert, claimed the government was forcing through the mergers without proper local consultation and to an unnecessarily tight timetable."Regional forces covering up to 6,000 square miles will erode local accountability, and most of the £175m cost will be met by local people, adding £33 to council tax bills," he said.He claimed that the West Midlands merger was a hostile takeover of the West Mercia force and the decision to bar the merger of North Wales with a neighbouring English force betrayed the government's regional political agenda.
