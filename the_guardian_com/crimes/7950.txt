Police today arrested 12 men during a series of dawn raids in London and the south-east aimed at disrupting a major drug trafficking network.More than 100 officers were involved in the early morning raids on 19 addresses across London and Kent. The operations followed a two-year investigation into three suspected gangs.Scotland Yard suspects the three networks - one Colombian, one white British and one British Asian - had formed an alliance to import and distribute cocaine and other class A drugs.Detectives believe the Colombian criminal network brought in "vast amounts" of cocaine, which the two London-based gangs would then sell on the streets.They think the gangs had been operating across the capital since 1998 and were run like businesses, with those at the top using vast profits to fund lavish lifestyles.The 12 men arrested, thought to be the ringleaders of the gangs, are being questioned at police stations in London.Police said the arrests marked the culmination of a two-year inquiry, codenamed Operation Alpington, which was led by Scotland Yard.A total of 25 people linked to the networks have already been convicted and sentenced, and a further 16 are awaiting trial.During the investigation, detectives seized 233kg of cocaine, 50kg of heroin, more than 7kg of amphetamine sulphate, 20kg of cannabis, more than £230,000 and two semi-automatic handguns.The operation was launched as a spin-off of Operation Anuric, which targeted an international drug smuggling empire estimated to have brought more than £1bn of cocaine into Britain over a decade. That investigation concluded in January this year.
