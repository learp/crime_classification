Police investigating the murder of the British exchange student Meredith Kercher in Italy have found mystery traces of DNA on her bra, it was revealed today.The three traces - believed to be from two males and a female - do not match up with any of the three suspects currently being held over the 21-year-old's death.The discovery will prompt speculation that somebody else could have been involved in the killing, although one of the suspect's lawyers said police were not making that assumption.Kercher's American housemate, 20-year-old Amanda Knox, her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 23, and 21-year-old Ivorian Rudy Guede, are all in prison near Perugia.They are accused of murdering Kercher, a Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey, on November 1 last year. She was found at her home in the city with her throat cut, and police said there was evidence of a violent sexual encounter.The new discovery was made by forensics officers analysing one of Kercher's bras, found at the house, in Via della Pergola. They had already identified DNA belonging to Guede and Sollecito on the garment."We received information from the police that they had found three more traces of DNA on the bra, two masculine and one feminine," Vittorio Lombardo, one of Guede's lawyers, said."They said the traces do not match up with Rudy or the other two suspects, but are not jumping to the conclusion that it indicates the presence of another killer."It is more likely to have come from cross-contamination. Meredith shared the house with other people, so the traces could have come from any of them or their visitors. As far as we are concerned, it doesn't change our case."Police said the discovery of Sollecito's DNA on the bra earlier this month meant they now had evidence putting all three suspects at the scene of the crime.Guede's DNA was found on Kercher's body. His handprint was found on a cushion, as well as his DNA being on the bra. Traces of Knox's blood were found on a tap in the bathroom.
