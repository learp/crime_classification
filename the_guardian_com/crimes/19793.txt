The British newlywed accused of paying to have his bride killed on their South African honeymoon is to be held in jail after an appeal was lodged against the granting of Â£250,000 bail.Shrien Dewani, who was arrested last night on a South African extradition warrant, was initially granted bail when he appeared at City of Westminster magistrates' court today.But the South African authorities lodged an immediate appeal, which means the businessman, from Bristol, will be held in custody pending a high court hearing.Dewani, whose wife Anni, 28, was shot dead last month as they visited a township, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to murder her. He denies any involvement in her killing.The 30-year-old was accused of ordering her death by taxi driver Zola Tongo as he was sentenced for his part in the killing in a South African court yesterday.Acting for the South African authorities, lawyer Ben Watson told today's extradition hearing that Dewani had met Tongo at Cape Town international airport and arranged for him to take him and his new bride to their hotel and to act as their tour guide.As their guide, Tongo collected the couple from their hotel and took them out for dinner at a seafood restaurant.On their way back, they passed through the dangerous Gugulethu township, where the allegedly pre-ordered hijacking took place, Mr Watson said.Before today's hearing, a statement was released by Clare Montgomery QC, Shrien Dewani's lawyer. It said: "Shrien Dewani had no involvement in the death of his wife Anni. He is devastated by her murder and the false allegations that have been made against him and welcomes the chance to clear his name through the courts."
