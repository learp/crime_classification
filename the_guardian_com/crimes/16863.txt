A lorry driver who caused a fatal accident while talking on his Bluetooth headset was jailed yesterday for four-and-a-half years. Haulier Mervyn Richmond, 49, was so distracted during a conversation with his mother that he ploughed into a line of stationary traffic, killing father-of-two Michael Buston.Richmond's Scania HGV van ran into the Transit van Buston was sitting in without braking. Now road safety groups are calling for a blanket ban on phone calls at the wheel after a jury convicted Richmond of death by dangerous driving.Roger Vincent, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: "When you are using any mobile while driving you are four times more likely to have an accident." The crash happened when a driver stopped on the side of the A631 at Corringham, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, to look at a map, causing traffic to build up. Prosecutor Robert Underwood said although it had been a "poor place" to stop, it did not excuse Richmond's driving.
