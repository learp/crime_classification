Two convicted criminals who claim they were denied a fair trial because the juries which found them guilty included a police officer will take their case to Britain's highest court next month. Their appeal to the House of Lords will be heard in July, along with a third case in which one of the jurors who delivered a guilty verdict was a lawyer working for the Crown Prosecution Service, which brought the prosecution.All three men who were convicted claim the participation of jurors closely involved in the prosecution system denied them a fair trial, breaching their human rights.Article 6 of the European convention on human rights guarantees a trial by "an impartial tribunal".Until May 2004, police, judges, lawyers and others in the justice system were barred from sitting on juries. It was thought that their inside knowledge of the system would conflict with the principle that a defendant must be tried by a jury of his peers.However the government decided to change the rules to end what was seen as a "middle-class opt-out" from jury service. Since then, judges, lawyers and police have routinely sat as jurors, but the latest case will be the first challenge to the principle to reach the House of Lords.In the first case, it emerged during the trial for attempted murder that the foreman of the jury was a serving police officer when he asked the judge for guidance about reporting for work on a bank holiday Monday. He was concerned that he might come into contact with officers in the case and the judge told him not to go to work.Defence lawyers raised no objections at the time but appealed against the conviction afterwards.The defendant in the second case, a drug addict, was accused of allowing an officer who searched him to put his hand in the defendant's pocket knowing there was a danger of a prick from a needle.The defendant's lawyers learned only by accident after the trial that a police officer from the same borough had been one of the jurors who convicted their client.In the third case, a rape, the CPS lawyer summonsed for jury service wrote to the judge seeking guidance about whether he should serve. The defence counsel tried to challenge him off the jury, but the judge ruled that he should stay.In each case, the court of appeal ruled that there was no breach of the defendant's right to a fair trial. Lord Woolf said there was always a danger that jurors would be unconsciously prejudiced, but the fact that there were 12 jurors, of whom at least 10 had to agree on a verdict, was a real protection against prejudices resulting in unfairness.The judges stated, however, that the cases raised "questions of law of general public importance", which will now be considered by five law lords.Matthew Scott, a criminal barrister, said: "In the case of any other juror, once the case is over that's the end of the matter. That's not necessarily so for a police officer."If he finds the defendant not guilty he has to go back to work and quite possibly confront the very same officers who brought the prosecution. He may have to work with them in the future. Some may even have a say on his prospects of promotion."For these reasons alone one might think that it would be particularly unfair if the jury on a case included a policeman from the very police force bringing the case before the court in the first place."
