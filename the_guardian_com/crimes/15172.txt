A man has admitted murdering Irish vet Catherine Gowing.Gowing's body has never been fully recovered, although remains were found at two rural locations near her home in Flintshire, north Wales, and near Chester.Clive Sharp, 46, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to her murder at Mold crown court on Monday.Flanked by two prison officers, Sharp, unshaven and wearing a grey pullover and grey jogging bottoms, sat in the dock with his head down for most of the brief hearing.Yards away, the victim's sister, Emma Maguire, sat listening intently as the hearing continued.Sharp is understood to have been friends with a woman who shared a house with Gowing, though no evidence was given in court.After pleading guilty to the murder of Gowing, sometime between 11 and 17 October last year, Sharp was warned he faced life in jail.But Mr Justice Griffith-Williams said he would not sentence Sharp immediately as he had to determine the minimum term he must serve before he could be considered for release.He also said there were a "number of concerns" about the murder that he needed to consider before setting a minimum term of imprisonment.The court heard in a report on the defendant that Sharp had "expressed his fantasies" and the judge asked for a complete history of his criminal record to be prepared.Adjourning sentencing until next month, the judge told Sharp: "There is only one sentence I can impose upon you for this offence, as you well know."I have to indicate the minimum term you will serve before the Parole Board will consider your release â€“ if you are ever to be released."Sentencing is adjourned until Monday 25 of February. You can be taken down."Gowing's family left court without commenting.
