A 20-year-old man was arrested in Surrey today in connection with the murder of Richard Whelan on a bus in north London, Scotland Yard said.The man is currently being held for questioning at a police station in east London. Police are still appealing for witnesses, particularly those travelling on the bus behind the one on which the murder was committed.Mr Whelan, 28, from Kentish Town, died after being stabbed six times on the No 43 bus in Holloway Road last Friday.He had been trying to prevent another passenger from throwing chips at his girlfriend.Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald, leading the inquiry, said: "It was a totally unprovoked attack - the worst thing about it is that the couple could have been anyone - any one of us on a night out."Mr Whelan had lost a close friend, Ciaran Cassidy, in the July 7 attacks on London three weeks earlier. Mr Cassidy, 22, died in the bombing of a bus in Tavistock Square.Closed circuit television footage from the No 43, which ran between Upper Street, Islington, and Holloway Road, showed Mr Whelan had initially ignored the passenger when he began throwing food.After most other passengers had moved downstairs, the man began to throw chips at Mr Whelan's girlfriend. Mr Whelan stood up to protest and was stabbed.The killer calmly walked off the bus in Holloway Road, near the junction with Wedmore Street, and crossed the road towards the Esso petrol station, as his victim tried to pursue him.Mr Whelan's girlfriend, who has not been named, also tried to restrain the man. Mr Whelan was taken to the Whittington hospital where he died shortly after arrival.Police are asking for any potential witnesses to come forward."There was a second No 43 bus behind when the attack took place. We would also appeal for anyone on that bus, particularly on the upper deck, to come forward with information," said a spokesman.Anyone who can help is asked to call the incident room on 020 8345 3985, or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 to leave anonymous information.
