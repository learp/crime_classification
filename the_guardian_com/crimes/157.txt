Tenants guilty of antisocial behaviour will lose housing benefit if they also refuse to take state help to address the underlying causes of their bad behaviour, a cabinet committee agreed yesterday.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Respect committee, chaired by Tony Blair, which was open for the first time to non-ministers, including five practitioners in the field, a police constable and a mother of two who has campaigned against gangs in her city. A small group of journalists was allowed to attend parts of the meeting.The practitioners said the government's current programmes were struggling to reach out to problem families resistant to state help. It was also pointed out that too many state agencies were not cooperating with one another.The new measure will sanction housing benefit where a person has been evicted for antisocial behaviour and refuses to address the problem using the support and help offered.The work and pensions secretary, John Hutton, stressed the proposal would not change the eviction process but was about getting people to change their behaviour. It will operate only where the household has chosen not to cooperate, a compromise on previous proposals to simply withdraw benefit. Mr Blair said it might be necessary to set up a database of tenants guilty of antisocial behaviour.Mr Hutton said: "Communities are fed up of the disruption caused by people who show no respect for their neighbours. The threat of sanctioning housing benefit will send a clear signal to the handful of people evicted each year.If the household does not engage with the referral and rehabilitation process a local authority will be able to issue a warning notice to cooperate with rehabilitationIf the household then does not comply without good cause, it will be sanctioned when they claim housing benefit. The sanction will increase incrementally.The education secretary, Alan Johnson, said the government was filling the gap in the lack of services on parenting, and added if you want to change behaviour, you sometimes have to challenge it.At yesterday's meeting Elaine Holland, a 38-year-old mother of two, sat across the cabinet table from Mr Blair and told him how after years of being intimidated she actually complained, with disastrous consequences. "I ended up being the one that was basically kept a prisoner in my home, verbally abused, intimidated, and I was totally blanked by the rest of the residents."Such was the fear in parts of the city, she launched an advice line for residents so they could secretly complain about the behaviour of the gangs. She said: "A lot of residents don't want to go to the council, they won't report it to the police because what is the point, they are not doing the job, they won't do anything about it".With Mr Blair nodding, Ms Holland explained: "The problem families are not coming forward, they don't want to deal like with the mediation, everything, education and that, they just don't want to know."Ms Holland argued that antisocial behaviour was not confined to tenants on benefit, but also included those in work.
