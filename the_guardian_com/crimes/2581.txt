Tony Martin, the farmer jailed for killing a teenage burglar, today lost his high court battle over the parole board's refusal to allow his early release from custody.A judge rejected an application for a court order forcing the board to reconsider the case of Martin, 59, who is serving a five-year sentence for killing 16-year-old Fred Barras.Mr Justice Maurice Kay, sitting in London, said that although there was an initial error of law when his application was first considered, that had been corrected and there were no grounds for allowing his challenge. In January this year, the board turned down Martin's plea to be set free, and refused to review its decision a month later, even though it had received new psychiatric reports. Probation officers said there was an "unacceptable risk" that Martin might again react with excessive force if other would-be burglars intruded on his Norfolk farm, Bleak House, as Barras had done. Bitu Bhalla, appearing for Martin, argued during the two-day high court hearing that the farmer was "not a nutter" and there was no serious risk of him reoffending. His counsel argued Martin was entitled to release because statistically there was more chance of "winning the lottery" than the "simple farmer" reoffending.However, Pushpinder Saini, counsel for the board, argued that it had not acted irrationally and burglars were entitled to protection from violent homeowners and were not to be treated as "fair game". The jailing of Martin, who is due in any event to leave prison on July 28 after serving two-thirds of his manslaughter sentence, led to a national debate over the rights of people to protect their property - as opposed to "burglars' rights" not to have "lethal force" used against them.Barras, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, he broke into Martin's remote farmhouse in August 1999 with accomplice Brendon Fearon, 33, also from Newark. Fearon was shot in the leg by Martin, who was convicted of murdering Barras and wounding Fearon by a jury at Norwich crown court. He received an automatic life sentence but the murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter and the sentence to five years by the court of appeal in October 2001.
