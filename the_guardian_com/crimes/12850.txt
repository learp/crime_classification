Two gunmen were today found guilty of murdering a schoolboy after mistaking him for his brother.Michael Dosunmu was hit by four bullets from a submachine gun as he slept, wrapped in his duvet, at his home in Peckham, south London.The men mistook the 15-year-old for his older brother, whom they were seeking, the prosecution at the Old Bailey alleged.The teenager "had no chance of surviving", Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, said.Mohammed Sannoh, 19, of Peckham, and 22-year-old Abdi Omar Noor, of Camberwell, also in south London, denied murder and possession of a submachine gun that could fire more than 1,000 rounds a minute. They were convicted after nine days of jury deliberation.Michael's sister, Shakira, was in another room and was woken by the gunfire on February 6 last year.She hid under the duvet but later emerged when she heard Michael gasping for breath, entering his bedroom and raising the alarm.The prosecution alleged that the men were after Michael's brother Hakeem, 26, who they believed had cheated them out of proceeds from security van robberies, and also wanted revenge following the murder of another man a few days earlier.Hakeem Dosunmu had been out at a club where he was trying to sell drugs when his brother was killed, the court heard. In April, he was sentenced to two years in prison for his part in the security van robberies. He had been acting as the getaway driver for the robbers and hoped to use the money to deal drugs.Laidlaw told the jury that Sannoh was part of a gang that carried out a series of armed raids on security guards.He said Hakeem had been involved in drug dealing and in three robberies from security firms.Following the last robbery, Sannoh's friend Javarie Crighton, one of the robbers, had been stabbed to death after confronting the organiser, Orando Madden, about money, the court was told.Madden later surrendered to police, leaving only Hakeem as the target for revenge, Laidlaw said. There were rumours that Madden had cheated the younger robbers and that Hakeem had the money, he added.Firearms residue was found on Noor's clothing and a partial DNA match was found on a casing of one of the bullets fired from the machinegun, the court heard.Scientists also found low traces of gunpowder on hooded tops belonging to Sannoh.Michael had been staying at the house with Shakira while their mother was in Nigeria and their father was in hospital. "This boy's brother killed my friend," Sannoh told police."I don't care about the murder. I don't care what happened to that boy."Hakeem, who had once been a Sunday school teacher, found his life going downhill as he struggled to adapt after five years in the army.He served in 32 Engineers during the invasion of Iraq, and later in Bosnia, and was well-regarded by officers, but was court-martialled over an assault following what he claimed was a racial incident.When he left the forces he struggled to hold down a job and fell in with a group involved in robbing transit vans.After his brother's killing, Hakeem admitted his part in the robberies and gave evidence in the murder trial.He also helped secure the conviction of former friend Madden for the murder of Crighton.He wept in the dock as his defence barrister, Robin Barclay, told the court how he carried around the guilty feeling that "it should have been him".Judge Brian Barker, the common serjeant of London, told Hakeem he had served his country "with distinction".He said he took into account the "obvious guilt and regret that as a result of your activities your younger brother is now dead".
