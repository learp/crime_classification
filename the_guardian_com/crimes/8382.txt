A window cleaner was stabbed with a samurai sword after asking a neighbour to give back his son's football, police said yesterday.Witnesses said David Martin, 40, was also beaten with cricket bats, golf clubs and metal poles in the fatal attack on Sunday evening, which was seen by his wife and two children. The row erupted when he asked for his 10-year-old son's ball to be returned. It is believed he eventually died from a stab wound from the samurai sword.A resident in Rutter Gardens, Mitcham, south-west London, said Martin's father had died in similar circumstances more than 20 years ago, when he tried to protect his son from a gang.Five people, including a 14-year-old girl and three women, one in her 60s, have been arrested over the incident. A man in his late 30s was arrested yesterday when he attended a south London police station voluntarily.Detective Inspector Stewart Kingston said: "At about 7.10pm on Sunday there was an argument between two parents over a game of football, which has tragically resulted in the death of a man."It's still early days, we are still investigating what did happen, but it appears the father of a boy came over to the house to resolve an argument about a football. It seems one parent would not give a ball back to the boy and an argument escalated extremely quickly into this incident."One female witness said: "I have known David since he was a little boy. He was a lovely, decent bloke always doing good in the community."Everyone around here loved him. He was a hard grafter and a kind man. It's absolutely devastating because his dad died 23 years ago, exactly the same way."Martin had lived in the area all his life. He leaves his wife, Angela, 39, a 12-year-old daughter and his son. The family were keen Fulham supporters.Another witness said: "It was awful. A man has lost his life, all for a nothing argument."
