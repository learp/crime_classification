A soldier has been found guilty of murdering his comrade in a vicious attack at their barracks earlier this year.In a majority decision, the jury at Birmingham crown court on Thursday returned its verdict against Lance Corporal Richard Farrell, after 19 hours of deliberations.Throughout a four-week trial, Farrell had denied killing fellow member of the Royal Irish Regiment 32-year-old Corporal Geoffrey McNeill in his room at Clive Barracks, Tern Hill, Shropshire in March.But the jury agreed with the prosecution’s case that the 23-year-old soldier, from Dublin, had murdered Cpl McNeill “inflicting a series of heavy blows” according to prosecuting QC Christopher Hotten, breaking the older man’s neck in three places.Farrell claimed he remembered nothing of the night’s events, having drunk at least a litre of Disaronno liqueur, after having been punched by McNeill in a pub in nearby Market Drayton earlier in the evening. He will be sentenced later.
