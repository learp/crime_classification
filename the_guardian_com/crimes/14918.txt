The supermodel Naomi Campbell is facing the prospect of community service under a possible plea bargain to settle allegations that she threw a jewel-encrusted mobile phone at her maid.The 36-year-old catwalk star made a brief appearance before a judge in Manhattan yesterday for a hearing over the assault charge that was swiftly adjourned until January. In a figure-hugging grey dress and a black jacket, with four inch high stilettos and seamed stockings, she cut a striking figure as she sat among rows of petty criminals to wait for her case to be called.Prosecutors told the judge, Evelyn Laporte, that behind-the-scenes legal discussions were continuing over the alleged attack on a former employee, Ana Scolavino, in which a Blackberry device is said to have been used as a weapon. Ms Scolavino claimed Ms Campbell threw a mobile phone at her after accusing her of stealing jeans the model had wanted to wear on Oprah Winfrey's television show.Ms Campbell has denied second degree assault. If the case goes to trial and she is convicted she could face up to seven years in prison and deportation.Outside the court the model's lawyer, David Breitbart, said she would prefer to go to trial, but might be deterred from doing so by the prospect of a media circus. Speaking of a possible plea bargain, he said: "It wouldn't surprise me if community service were part of that option."But he said the task would have to be "palatable", something like fundraising for cancer or aids research, rather than sweeping the streets as the pop star Boy George did in August as a punishment for wasting police time."Naomi's life is one of community service," he said, listing a string of charities she worked with.Mr Breitbart pointed out that Boy George had been swamped by photographers during his five-day task. "I'm not willing to have that kind of situation with regards to Naomi," he said.Ms Campbell's legal troubles grew this week with a fresh lawsuit from another former maid, Gaby Gibson, who alleges that the model attacked her on January 17 and hurled abuse in a dispute about a missing pair of Stella McCartney jeans. She allegedly told the maid: "Romanians are not usually as dumb as you."The new lawsuit, which describes Ms Campbell as a "violent super-bigot", came three weeks after the model was arrested during a trip to London for allegedly assaulting her drugs counsellor.Mr Breitbart said the new suit was a "cheap ploy" to embarrass Ms Campbell on the eve of her court date.
