A Liverpool football fan jailed in Bulgaria for the attempted murder of a barman, which he denied, arrived at Heathrow yesterday to complete his 10-year sentence in a British jail. The family of Michael Shields, 20, welcomed his return but called it "only the first step" and promised to continue campaigning for his release and a quashing of the conviction.The engineering student was accompanied on the plane by two prison officers from Wandsworth jail in London, where he will be assessed for two months. His mother Marie arrived back on an earlier flight after a final visit on Wednesday to Varna prison in Bulgaria where Shields has been held for 18 months. She said: "He has no idea what it will be like inside a British prison because he's never set foot in one. But more than anything he's just glad to be going home."Shields left his home in Wavertree on Merseyside in May 2005 to watch Liverpool play in the Champions League final against AC Milan in Turkey. He was holidaying in Bulgaria's Golden Sands resort after his team's victory when he was arrested for an attack on barman Martin Georgiev, who was almost killed after being battered with a paving slab.Shields has said that he was asleep at the time of the attack. Another Liverpool man, Graham Sankey, made a written confession to the attack after returning to the UK, although his solicitor claims he was referring to a different brawl.Shields's MP Louise Ellman, Labour member for Liverpool Riverside, said: "We must continue the campaign for justice and an appeal to the European court of human rights is being filed."
