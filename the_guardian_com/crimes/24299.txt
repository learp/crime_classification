A nurse who killed two of his patients "to satisfy his lust for excitement" was jailed for life today.Judge Mr Justice Crane told Benjamin Geen, 25, that he would serve a minimum of 30 years for a "terrible betrayal of the trust of others in the medical profession and his patients".Green received life sentences for two counts of murder and 15 counts of grievous bodily harm. The staff nurse injected 17 victims with drugs including muscle relaxants, insulin and sedatives to stop them breathing.Although doctors revived 15 of his victims, two did not survive. David Onley, 75, from Deddington, Oxfordshire, died on January 21, 2004, and Anthony Bateman, 65, from Banbury, died on January 6, 2004, shortly after they were admitted to casualty at Horton general hospital in Banbury, where Geen worked.Mr Justice Crane told Geen at Oxford crown court: "Your purpose was to cause a collapse of the patient in order that you could take part in the revival of the patient. It seems that you relished the excitement of that feeling of taking control but you must have known quite well that you were playing with their lives."He said he had "no doubt" that Geen, who was found with a loaded syringe in his pocket when he was arrested, was planning to continue with his lethal attacks."This was a terrible betrayal. You betrayed your nursing and medical colleagues and the vital profession of which you had been a member. Most of all, you betrayed the trust of the patients. They were in your care and you intentionally caused them huge damage."During the trial, the jury heard how Geen "came alive" and looked "elated" as his patients went into respiratory arrest.Geen even "boasted" about the regular resuscitations during his shifts, telling one doctor: "There is always a resuscitation when I'm on duty."One nurse told the court how Geen said, "Oh no, here we go again" as one of the murder victims turned blue and began to fight for breath.Geen's crimes were eventually detected after an alcoholic admitted with stomach pains ended up in intensive care and doctors decided to launch an investigation.He was arrested as he arrived for work the next day, with a full syringe of vecuronium, a muscle relaxant, in his pocket.During his closing speech, prosecutor Michael Austin Smith QC said that Geen must have known the fatal consequences of what he was doing but that toying with patients' lives was a "price he was willing to pay in order to satisfy his perverse needs".He said: "People were at death's door. Most were lucky; two were not. And on February 9, when Geen went back to work with that loaded syringe, was there somebody else who was extremely lucky that the authorities had nailed their man?"Following sentencing, Geen's legal team said they planned to appeal against his conviction.
