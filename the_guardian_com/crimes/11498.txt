A killer who twice changed his court plea was jailed for life yesterday after admitting the murder of his estranged girlfriend.Guy Beckett, 32, a pub landlord, initially denied strangling Laura Torn, 18, who planned to be a police cadet and was well-known for riding her pony around the north Lincolnshire river port of Owston Ferry. He then tried to admit manslaughter but this was rejected by Hull crown court. Mr Justice Curtis, ordering that Beckett should serve at least 16 years, said: "You strangled a young girl who at least had some emotional feeling for you. You have taken the life of a young person without any excuse." Laura's murder devastated Owston Ferry, where she vanished in April last year after passing her driving test and celebrating in a local pub. Her body was found after 11 days in a haystack at Misson, Nottinghamshire. The court heard Laura had had an "on-off" sexual relationship with Beckett, who ran the Red Lion pub in Owston Ferry, but had tried to distance herself from him before her murder. Beckett had become increasingly abusive when she rejected his advances. Yvonne Coen, prosecuting, said that Beckett had finally set fire to the Red Lion and then phoned Laura in the middle of the night, claiming that he was trapped behind the bar. On the night she died, some weeks later, he had again tried to win her back, at the same time plying her with drink.
