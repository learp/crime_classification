Around 450,000 of us are selected each year for jury service. Many are happy to depart afterwards with a sense of civic duty undertaken fairly reasonably, plus a few sickening details to have nightmares about. But a new and growing breed have greater expectations. They want to hear and see results of precision forensic techniques; to know that bobbies have pulled their fingers - and gizmos - out and done a job worthy of TV's Horatio Caine.The seriously CSI-savvy are shaking up the crown courts, inspiring and exasperating prosecutors, changing the game. They know about the latest BPA (bloodstain pattern analysis), favour an electronic polymer sensor proboscis for identifying clothing odorants, and consider a lack of DNA evidence outrageous. In the courtroom the most CSI-fluent juror takes the most copious notes, or raises an eyebrow the most sceptically. (S)he may be the one who was keen as mustard to be foreman, or who sits back barely noticed in the jury room, pondering the others' deliberations, before swooping with the most intricate doubts and disappointments: why wasn't the surveillance video enhanced by 20x? Why wasn't the ceiling checked for semen?Once a person has learnt a vacuum metal deposition chamber can conjure up fingerprints made 15 years ago, there is no turning back. In America it is now permitted, during jury selection, for the question 'What are your viewing habits?' to be asked, to weed out trouble-causers. Until such a clampdown begins here, we can take solace from the knowledge that a crime-techy geek will expect absolutely nothing less than a nanogram of our DNA in an Eppendorf micro-pipette.
