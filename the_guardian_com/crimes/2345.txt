Government plans to tackle anti-social behaviour were yesterday greeted with anger by campaigners.The plans are part of the populist message being developed for Labour's local election campaign. A white paper focusing on spot fines against truants, drunks, louts and noisy neighbours will be published next week. Labour headquarters has already sent material on reclaiming communities to party activists in preparation for the May 1 elections. Ministers dropped plans to withdraw child benefit from the parents of truants, in favour of extending fines or fixed penalty notices. Beggars may also be given a criminal record, although vagrancy laws already allow police to take action. After three convictions for begging, courts will be entitled to impose a community penalty such as enforced drug treatment. The white paper will build on a one-year pilot which extended fixed penalty notices from motoring to drunkeness. Pilot schemes in London, north Wales, West Midlands and Croydon have been viewed as a success. Extension of the fines to 45 offences is planned, including bill posting, cruelty to animals, failure to produce a driving licence, illegal street trading and kerb crawling. It is possible the fines will be extended to children as young as 10, but government sources say this would be unlikely. The former social security minister Frank Field welcomed the white paper. He said: "The politics of behaviour is now the chief bread and butter issue for most of our constituents." Martin Barnes, from the Child Poverty Action Group, welcomed the shelving of the plan to remove child benefit, saying "the public is getting in creasingly tired of knee jerk headline grabbing initiatives." Shelter also criticised the proposals. "Begging is a demeaning and risky activity that people only resort to out of desperation," said a spokesperson. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat Home Office spokesman said: "It is window dressing rather than good long-term policy."
