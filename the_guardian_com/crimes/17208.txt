Detectives investigating the disappearance of Essex schoolgirl Danielle Jones believe they may have found her body after a female's remains were discovered on a construction site in Kent.The badly-decomposed body was found by workmen on a site in Northfleet, near the Bluewater shopping centre at Dartford, on Friday. The complex is just five miles across the Thames from the village of East Tilbury, Essex, where the 15-year-old disappeared as she walked to catch the school bus on June 18 last year. Last night, a spokesman for Kent police said the death was being treated as suspicious, but it was "impossible to draw any conclusions at this stage". He added that the body appeared to have been on the site "for some time". The results of a postmortem examination involving dental records are expected today. A spokeswoman for Essex police, which launched a murder investigation, said Danielle's parents, Linda and Tony Jones, had been informed of the discovery. Danielle's uncle, Stuart Campbell, 43, from Grays, Essex, was charged with her murder in October and is awaiting awaiting trial.
