A delivery driver was run over and killed with his own lorry after it was hijacked by robbers, police said yesterday.Ian Jones, 44, had left the lorry, which was full of electrical equipment, to go into a store when he heard the truck being started up. He rushed back outside and tried to stop it but it was driven over him and sped off. The tragedy happened at the back of a Currys superstore in Chingford, Essex, on Thursday lunchtime. A police source said: "Mr Jones had pulled into a service yard used for deliveries at the back of Currys. "As he went inside to tell other staff he had arrived, a white Ford Transit box van pulled into the service area. "One man left the box van and got into the lorry. Mr Jones heard the noise and went back outside and was run over as he stood in front of the lorry trying to stop the robbery. We are treating this as murder." Mr Jones, who was single and from Hawkhurst, Kent, was comforted by store staff who covered him with clothing as he lay dying. He was taken to North Middlesex hospital where he was pronounced dead. Witnesses said there were two or three men involved in the incident, aged in their 20s with fair hair.
