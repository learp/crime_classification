The body of Scarlett Keeling, the British teenager raped and murdered in Goa, was returned to the UK with some organs removed, the family's lawyer said today.Scarlett's mother, Fiona MacKeown, did not give permission for the kidneys, stomach and uterus to be taken from the body and plans to return to India to find out what happened, the lawyer said."I have spoken to Fiona who has told me the uterus, kidneys and stomach are missing," said Vikram Varma."I am waiting for an email from the coroner confirming in writing what is missing so I can then take it up with the [Indian] ministry of health."The body of the 15 year old was found on a beach in Goa on February 19. Indian police initially said Scarlett accidentally drowned, but following pressure from her mother a second post-mortem examination was carried out which revealed the teenager's body had more than 50 bruises and that she been given ecstasy, cocaine and LSD. Police then announced that she had been raped and murdered.The removal of the organs was discovered during a third post-mortem examination, taking place in the UK.The family had not been informed of this, Varma said: "There is no reason to take these organs, a doctor only takes a sample of an organ for tests."To remove the whole organ without written consent is not permissible."On Friday, the police officer who led the first investigation into Scarlett's death, Nerlon Albuquerque, was dismissed after allegations that he mishandled the inquiry.Goan police have arrested Samson D'Souza, on suspicion of rape, and Placido Carvalho, on suspicion of drugging Scarlett and consequently assisting in her murder.MacKeown, who has claimed the investigation was hampered by links between police, politicians and drugs gangs, was travelling with her boyfriend and other children in the neighbouring state of Karnataka when her daughter, who had been allowed to stay in Goa, was killed.
