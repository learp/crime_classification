A 22-year-old British student found murdered in Italy was named tonight.Meredith Kercher was reportedly found with a deep cut to her throat in her bedroom in the town of Perugia.A foreign office spokesman said: "We can confirm that a British national was found dead in her apartment."Our consular staff are in Perugia to liaise with the Italian authorities and to provide the necessary consular assistance."The circumstances of the death are under investigation by the Italian police."Miss Kercher's partially clothed body was discovered under a duvet early this afternoon at a house in the Viale Sant'Antonio, not far from the city centre, Italian news agency Ansa said.Police found the body when they went to return a mobile phone discovered in a nearby garden.Miss Kercher had been in Italy since August as part of a university exchange.According to the Ansa report, she had been to a party last night, and her three housemates, also students, had not stayed at the property.The door seemed to have been locked from the inside and police were concentrating on a window - which had bloodstains - to the outside, Ansa said.Police have sealed off the area around the scene.An elderly woman who found the phone in her garden took it to police, who checked who the owner was, which led them to the house where the victim lived.
