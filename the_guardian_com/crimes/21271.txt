A website set up by the family of the missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann has received more than 50m hits in just over 24 hours, its organisers said today.The rapid and astonishing prominence achieved by the findmadeleine site shows the success of her parents in keeping their daughter's case in the headlines despite more than two weeks without any real clue as to her fate.In the 15 days since Madeleine was apparently snatched from her parents' holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz, police have turned up virtually no leads and only one man, 33-year-old British expatriate Robert Murat, has been named as a suspect. He has repeatedly insisted he is innocent.The campaign website, launched yesterday, carried a message saying that as of 1.20am today it had received 50m hits.Family members say the campaign is being led by Madeleine's parents, doctors Gerry and Kate McCann, who have stayed in Praia da Luz with their two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie.While they have spoken only occasionally to the media, the couple have helped keep the case in the news by appearing before the cameras daily, Mrs McCann tying her hair back with yellow and green ribbons to symbolise the hunt for her daughter.Several sports stars have made appeals for information, with England's cricketers wearing yellow ribbons to show their support yesterday in the first Test match against the West Indies at Lord's.Today it was announced that a video of Madeleine would be played to fans at tomorrow's FA Cup final at the revamped Wembley stadium.An FA spokesman said the two-minute clip, Find Madeleine, would be shown on big screens before the match between Manchester United and Chelsea, and again at half-time.The same clip was screened at the Uefa Cup final between Sevilla and Espanyol in Glasgow on Wednesday.Some of Europe's largest corporations are spreading Madeleine's image and news of her disappearance across Europe through posters and text messages, while money has poured in to support the family."We want to make sure that if Madeleine isn't in Portugal that the rest of Europe is aware of the image of this little girl," family member Michael Wright told reporters yesterday.Posters of Madeleine are to be put up in aircraft and at restaurants, petrol stations, supermarkets, banks, airports and car hire offices. From BP to McDonald's and the French supermarket chain Carrefour, her face is set to be the focus of an unprecedented publicity campaign.Telecoms companies such as Vodafone, O2 and Spain's Telefonica will send out text messages to clients asking for help.Despite the publicity, and the questioning earlier this week of Mr Murat as the first "arguido", or officially named suspect, police conceded last night they had very few leads and did not yet have sufficient evidence to arrest anyone.However, when asked whether the search was "struggling", Chief Inspector Olegario Souza, one of the officers leading the hunt, replied: "No."Mr Murat today remained inside his family's villa, around 150 metres from where Madeleine disappeared.A Russian man who designed a website for Mr Murat, 22-year-old Sergey Malinka, again protested his own innocence today after his home in Praia da Luz was raided by police on Wednesday. Mr Malinka was questioned by officers but released without charge and has not been named as a suspect.Today, the Russian stressed his relationship with Mr Murat was "strictly business" and added that while he could not comment until the police investigation was over, once he could give his side of the story "it would prove me innocent, that everything is correct".He condemned reports in Portuguese newspapers alleging he had closer connections with Mr Murat, saying: "I just feel I have been misunderstood and the information about me has come out of nowhere."It's been false, untrue, it's really not helping me with my name and my career."
