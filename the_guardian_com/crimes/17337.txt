Police and magistrates should have the power to "ground" antisocial teenagers, while tougher sentences for knife crime and a change in licensing laws are needed to tackle crime in Britain, the shadow home secretary announced today.The curfew would confine children and young people to their homes, except to attend school, and could last for up to a month."I think our police need the power to ground a young persistent troublemaker â€“ in the hope that we can stop them from getting so far into trouble that they end up in the criminal justice system," Chris Grayling told the Local Government Association in London.The plan is part of a raft of proposals to tackle poor behaviour by young people in their communities.David Cameron, introducing the shadow home secretary, said the new proposals were designed to "toughen up" the justice system."For the last decade or so, we have seen that vital single-minded focus on crime-fighting disastrously diluted, so the Home Office and the police too often see themselves as some kind of social service"No. They are not a social service. They are a force. And with a Conservative government I want them to be a force to be respected and reckoned with. They are there to fight crime. That's it," he said.Other schemes put forward by the Tories include a change in licensing laws to end 24-hour drinking and prosecute retailers selling alcohol to underage children, tougher sentences for "serious offences", including carrying knives, and putting more police on the streets.The shadow home secretary said the plans are designed to stop young people being "dragged into a cycle of crime".He said: "At the heart of this challenge is a simple fact in the lives of many young people. There is nobody who really says no to them. So the misdemeanours of youth go unpunished. And so they get away with it, and do it again, and again."The measures were announced during Grayling's first significant speech as shadow home secretary.
