"Richard and Gloria Taylor are enormously disappointed with the report.Dreadful errors were made during the forensic examination of crucial evidence in the murder inquiry into Damilola Taylor's death. Those fatal errors resulted in years of delay and pain for the family in their search for justice for Damilola.The family have suffered beyond words during the twists and turns in the investigations which led to three separate trials. The basic mistakes that were made by the forensic experts had catastrophic effects.They believe that those responsible for these dreadful errors should be brought to account so that nothing like this could ever happen again. Sadly, the report, its recommendations, and its conclusions fall well short of such expectations.The report describes the catalogue of errors as 'extremely regrettable' - a conclusion that the family feel is lame in the extreme. The government should instead now act decisively to overhaul the quality of forensic science used in court."
