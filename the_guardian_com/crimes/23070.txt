A group of lesbian prison officers transferred from Holloway after allegations that they ran a regime of sexual harassment, bullying and intimidation said yesterday they had been made scapegoats for a jail which had been failing for 50 years.Claiming sexual discrimination at an employment tribunal in London, the alleged hardcore group - dubbed the Magnificent Seven - and two other female officers denied they were a clique who had intimidated young female staff to "turn" them, and treated male officers with contempt. If they win their claim the nine could get total damages of hundreds of thousands of pounds. The women were moved to prisons throughout the country after a five-month inquiry. Martin Narey, the then director general of the Prison Service, said at the time in March 2002: "There is clear evidence of sexual harassment, the sort of behaviour which we wouldn't dream of tolerating between men and women. I am not tolerating it between women and women." Giving evidence yesterday, one of the claimants, a 32-year-old officer who cannot be named for legal reasons, said it felt as though the Prison Service was trying to break her. The officer denied she had behaved like "the officer from hell". She said that as a result of the publicity over her transfer she had been subjected to taunts by male officers at Wormwood Scrubs, where she was moved temporarily, and later at Pentonville. At Wormwood Scrubs she was put on the lifers' wing, which terrified her. Two days later she went sick and was signed off work for three weeks. She learned from colleagues that the inquiry into the culture at Holloway made clear the reasons for the investigation were longstanding. "It had been going on for 50 years, I am being made a scapegoat for the problems at HMP Holloway for the past 50 years." The tribunal continues.
