News today from Dame Anne Owers, the chief inspector of prisons, that the extraordinary and successful work of HMP Grendon is being threatened by financial "efficiency savings" will come as no surprise to any of us who have worked and supported the prison – the only jail in Europe that operates wholly as a therapeutic community – over many years.Financial cuts – which have resulted in the reduction of time out of cells and curtailment or cancellation of therapy groups – are merely the latest mechanism that the prison service has employed to reshape the prison into a traditional "Category B", and which it obviously feels would better suit its bureaucratic, centralised penal management culture. In my day, we were advised that Grendon didn't chime well with the political rhetoric of the Conservative administration, only to discover that when we invited the very same politicians – Kenneth Baker and his team – to the prison that they enthusiastically embraced what Grendon was trying to achieve.Why wouldn't they? After all, Grendon is the only prison that I know of that can demonstrate empirically that if a prisoner goes there for at least 18 months they are a third less likely to re-offend when they are subsequently released. And, despite the fact that the prisoners who go to Grendon have elevated psychopathy scores – and more popularly have been labelled as "damaged, dangerous and disturbed" – the prison has the fewest prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff assaults, incidences of concerted indiscipline, self-harm, suicide, drug abuse, hostage incidents or escape attempts. What's not to like?Well, first and foremost Grendon has always been "different". From the start – and next year will be its 50th birthday – it was run by a medical superintendent, rather than a prison governor, and even if it is currently managed by a prison governor there are no other governors in the prison service who can boast, as the incumbent Dr Peter Bennett can, of having a PhD in comparative religion from Soas. Differences too in wanting prisoners to talk about their offending with qualified psychologists, psychiatrists and other therapists and then change that behaviour as a consequence, as opposed to frog-marching then into under-evaluated cognitive skills courses so as to achieve the latest centrally driven key performance target.These differences are also all predicated on another difference – treating prisoners as if they have something to offer – to themselves, to each other and the rest of the prison, and not, as the pseudonym prison officer "Ronnie Thompson" would have us believe in his booze-filled, bigged-up autobiography Screwed that all prisoners were "fucked-up junkies" bent on "cutting your face off".Grendon should be cherished and lauded by the prison service as the jewel in its crown, and we – the public – should be putting that service under pressure to give the prison all the resources that it needs, and then advocating for more prisons to run like it, for it has shown how we can reduce offending and make our community safer.
