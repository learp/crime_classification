Without wishing to dispute James Nichol's first-hand knowledge of street crime, (Letters, February 1), I must take issue with the notion that underprivileged children are "forced" to commit crimes as a result of their circumstances and background.Unless an individual suffers from a personality disorder, the decision to commit a mugging is exactly that: a decision. These are not crimes of passion, but premeditated acts in which the violence often far exceeds that "necessary" to secure the object. The idea that these crimes are carried out on the basis of economic expediency doesn't stand up to real-life cases. Many individuals with impoverished backgrounds choose to get a job (even a McJob) rather than inflict suffering. What differentiates them from their criminal peers is a sense of right and wrong. Of course we should improve housing and education, but that doesn't mean you have to be a rabid right-winger to say that those who choose to use violence, whatever their background, should expect an appropriately harsh punishment.Russell ClementsLondon
