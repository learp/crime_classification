Juries must not carry the can for the low rape conviction rate (Why is rape so easy to get away with? G2, February 1). The police either don't gather the evidence, or they lose it or misinterpret it. The CPS don't think about what might be useful and seem more eager to drop rape cases than to prosecute them. The victim is herself put on trial, but without the safeguards defendants are entitled to. The prosecutor has never met her before the trial, does nothing to establish her credibility or to defend her, even from evidence about her sexual history which recent laws should have banned. Judges should provide balance and protect the jury from misinformation and misunderstanding; instead they pander to the jury's prejudices. Their directions and summing-up often display sexism and other prejudices. If police, prosecutors and judges were made to apply the law in a caring and non-sexist way, the conviction rate would soon go up.Nina LÃ³pez Legal Action for WomenLisa Longstaff  Women Against Rape
