Drivers using motorway services are being warned to check their cars are secure after a spate of thefts believed to be linked to technology that stops them remotely locking.Thames Valley police said there had been 14 recent thefts from cars at motorway services in Berkshire and that in many cases there was “no obvious sign of a break-in and no damage caused to the vehicles as items were stolen from them”.It is believed that thieves may have used radio jammers, which can interrupt signals sent by a remote key, to steal from the vehicles undetected. Items including a laptop, suitcases and wallets have been stolen during the break-ins.Police have advised motorists to do a manual check before leaving their car unattended.Could thieves use jamming technology to steal your car? Sgt Alan Hawkett of Newbury police, said: “I strongly recommend that any members of the public visiting motorway services stations anywhere in the country keep all valuable items in their possession when away from their vehicle.“Offenders may be using technology to prevent your vehicle from locking, therefore we would advise a manual check of the doors before leaving your vehicle.”In December 2014, a 25-year-old man was convicted of using a signal jammer to break into cars in the Greater Manchester area. Michael Fennell used a signal jammer bought outside of the UK for just £35 to target central Manchester car parks.The jammer was used to prevent victims from locking their cars without their knowledge. Fennell simply opened the doors leaving no trace of the intrusion and leaving victims unaware that they had been targeted.
