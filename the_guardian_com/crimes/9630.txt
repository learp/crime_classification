A pensioner was stabbed 22 times after he confronted a burglar who broke into his home. Joseph Griffiths was discovered in a pool of blood by his wife and a friend on 10 November last year, the Old Bailey heard.Aaron de Silva, 21, has already pleaded guilty to killing the 73-year-old in his house in Fulham, south-west London, but denies murder. De Silva, of Earls Court, west London, has also admitted aggravated burglary armed with a lock knife.Opening the trial, Brendan Finucane QC, prosecuting, told the jury: "There were no eyewitnesses but people were awoken by a completely brutal and overwhelming assault on an elderly man in his own home, where he was knifed 22 times to the body."After the attack De Silva was caught on CCTV taking a "cool, calm and collected walk" back to the Earls Court hostel where he was staying, Finucane said. He was arrested three days later.The court heard that on the morning of 10 November, De Silva went into a number of gardens on Griffiths's road before stealing a pair of bolt croppers from an unlocked garden shed. Using the tool, at about 6.15am he broke a rear window on the basement level of Griffiths's six-storey terrace home and walked around the lower two levels.Griffiths and his wife, Judy, who had lived there for 50 years, were asleep in separate bedrooms on the ground floor, while family friends John and James Hall, who were visiting for a wedding, slept on the second floor.Finucane said: "Griffiths must have been woken by the defendant coming in, must have challenged him in the hallway, outside his own bedroom door." It was at this point, Finucane said, that De Silva carried out the assault.Finucane said: "Anybody who stabs a person 22 times with a knife like that has at the very least the intention to cause really serious harm, and further you can be sure that he did it with the intention to kill the deceased."The trial continues.
