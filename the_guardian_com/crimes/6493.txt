A masked gunman has died after being pinned down and restrained by customers during an armed robbery at a bookies in Plymouth.Police who were called to the scene found the man unconscious and called an ambulance but he was declared dead when paramedics arrived.The man, who was in his 50s, is believed to have been wearing a gas mask and was holding a gun when he entered a branch of Ladbrokes on on Crownhill Road in Plymouth, Devon, shortly before 7pm.Customers disarmed him and held him on the floor while others raised the alarm, according to Devon and Cornwall police.About a dozen customers were inside the bookmaker's at the time, according to a local media report.The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), has been informed of the incident.A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said that after officers arrived on the scene: "It quickly became clear the man was unresponsive and an ambulance was immediately requested by police, who carried out CPR until they arrived."A few minutes later, three paramedics arrived at the scene and continued to carry out further CPR. About 20 minutes later, the man was declared dead at the scene by the paramedics.Chief Inspector Ian Drummond-Smith said: "This is a very serious incident. We cannot speculate on what has actually taken place here today."A full investigation has now begun and while the IPCC carry out their investigation it is not appropriate to comment further."The man has been identified but next of kin have not yet been informed, police said.
