The message was sent by TheReid1, whose account no longer exists.Campbell, 24, and formerly of Manchester United, retweeted the abuse, adding "wow just seen this tweet! Disgraceful." He also linked a picture of the Show Racism the Red Card organisation's logo.A Northumbria Police spokesman said: "We are aware of the matter and inquiries are being made into it."
