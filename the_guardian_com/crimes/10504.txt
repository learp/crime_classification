A banned driver caught on film speeding at more than 100mph during a Christmas Day police chase - with his heavily pregnant girlfriend and a baby in the rear seats - has been jailed for 22 months.Ashton Dellamonica, 21, pleaded guilty at Nottingham crown court earlier this week to charges of dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and having no insurance.In-car and aerial footage released by Nottinghamshire police show Dellamonica frequently driving on the wrong side of the road during an 11-mile route along icy roads.Dellamonica, from Nottingham, sped away from an unmarked police patrol late on 25 December last year after being spotted driving a stolen Audi.He later avoided a stinger operation that had been set up on the A610 to slow him down, and then drove through Nottingham at speeds in excess of 100mph.A police helicopter was able to follow the Audi as it passed through six red traffic lights before it crashed into a parked vehicle in The Meadows area.Officers then chased Dellamonica on foot and he was arrested after being found hidden underneath a parked car.His girlfriend, baby and another passenger were all uninjured.Commenting on Dellamonica's actions, Detective Constable Emma Pollard, of Radford Road CID, said: "Officers involved said they had not seen such dangerous driving in years of policing."Anyone seeing the footage of his driving will be shocked that no one was seriously hurt by such wilful and dangerous behaviour."Claiming he was concerned about a small amount of cannabis on his person, he chose to risk the life of his unborn child, his girlfriend, brother and baby, by driving at speeds of more than 100mph in icy and wet conditions."I am pleased with the sentencing and I hope it sends out a message that we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our communities."
