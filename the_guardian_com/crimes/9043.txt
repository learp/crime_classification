I seldom think that media accounts or dramatised portrayals of what goes on in magistrates courts are very accurate but Amelia Gentleman's article (Crimes and misdemeanours, 7 June) nails it. What she saw in Thames magistrates court is what happens in courts up and down the country. The sad and hopeless cases she saw are dealt with these days in almost heroic manner by defence solicitors, probation officers, court officers, the police and magistrates, against a background of ever-more savage cuts by a succession of governments who seldom see the damage being caused to what are often the most vulnerable members of our society. The latest cuts to legal aid are nearly the last straw.In Lincolnshire we are witnessing the end of local justice through the closure of many of the courts in our geographically large county. We have seen the appointment of district judges, allegedly with the aims of speeding up proceedings, bringing more consistency to sentencing and saving money, none of which seem to be much in evidence in my experience. Instead, we have seen two much-cherished rights disappearing: the right to local justice and the right to be judged by three of one's peers, who give their time and experience free of charge. Why don't I resign as a magistrate, I hear you say? Maybe, like many of my colleagues, I feel we are now the only half chance of meaningful intervention some of our offenders have left – since cuts to welfare and services mean that shoplifting seems increasingly carried out not just to feed drug habits but also, it often turns out, families.Name and address supplied• In comparing the coalition's output of criminal justice legislation with that of Labour, you describe the coalition as having been "relative (sic) quiet in this area" (Report, 5 June). Outsourcing ever more prisons with ever more punitive regimes to be run for profit by the likes of Serco and G4s; cutting legal aid to the most vulnerable; secret court hearings for terrorism; and the part-privatisation as of this week of the globally-revered 107-year old probation service with no guarantee of the level of training or quality of non-probation staff assessing and managing risky offenders. The legislation may have been lean but the consequences have been prolific for justice, human rights and public safety in this country.Professor Gwyneth BoswellNorwich
