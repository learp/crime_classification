A 47-year-old man has been charged with the murders of vicar John Suddards and retired teacher Betty Yates, police have said.Stephen Farrow will appear before North Avon magistrates court on Thursday accused of killing the clergyman and the pensioner.Farrow was arrested in Folkestone, Kent, on Sunday, following a tipoff from the public after Avon and Somerset police launched a nationwide manhunt.Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to death at his home in Thornbury, south Gloucestershire, on 14 February. Yates, 77, was also knifed to death at her cottage in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 2 January.Farrow is accused of the murder of Suddards between 13 and 14 February and the murder of Yates between 1 and 5 January.He also faces a charge of burglary relating to a property in Thornbury between 21 December 2011 and 3 January 2012.Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson of West Mercia police said: "I would also still encourage people to come forward and talk to us if they have information which could assist our inquiry."Sian Sullivan, the senior district crown prosecutor for Avon and Somerset, said: "Having reviewed this case in line with the code for crown prosecutors, I have today decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge Stephen Farrow with the murders of Betty Yates and John Suddards."I would like to remind all concerned that Stephen Farrow now stands charged with criminal offences and has the right to a fair trial."It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice a trial."Suddards' body was found by workmen who had arrived at the vicarage next to St Mary's Church in Castle Street.The news of Suddards' death sent shockwaves through the clergy and the close-knit community, which lies about 11 miles north of Bristol.He had only taken up his post last July, having come from the diocese of Chelmsford in Essex.The former barrister moved to the area after serving at St Nicolas Church in Witham, Essex, since 2001 and before that at Great Yeldham parish, 20 miles away in Essex.Yates was found dead at the bottom of stairs at her home on the banks of the River Severn on 4 January, having been killed two days earlier.After her death, Yates' son and daughter made an emotional appeal for help to bring their mother's killer to justice.Hazel Costello, along with her brother, David Yates, said: "We are completely bewildered as to who could carry out such a savage attack on our mother."That this should have happened in her home makes this even more difficult to bear."
