The immigration minister Tony McNulty, seen as responsible for the foreign prisoners fiasco that claimed the cabinet career of Charles Clarke, was last night shifted in a tough shake-up of the Home Office.The home secretary, John Reid, announced that Mr McNulty, a former government whip, will concentrate on the police as well as home office issues in parliament. Mr Reid confirmed that the fast-rising Liam Byrne will now be responsible for immigration, asylum and citizenship, as well as delivery right across the department.At a Home Office away day on Sunday, it was agreed that Mr Byrne, with experience as a private sector consultant on information technology, was best placed to drive the malfunctioning Home Office machine.Mr Reid will today appear before the home affairs select committee to answer queries about the foreign prisoner scandal and the overall crisis in the Home Office.He will update MPs on the number of wrongly released foreign prisoners still at large. He is expected to put the foreign prisoners crisis in the context of the growing number of population movements, and the rise of people trafficking.He does not regard new allegations over the performance of the Criminal Records Bureau or the absconding of prisoners from open jails as serious allegations that undermine the Home Office's reputation.Nevertheless Phil Wheatley, director general of the prison service, was forced to respond to the latest revelations about how 359 prisoners had absconded from Leyhill open prison in the last six years.But Mr Wheatley said this escape rate - around 60 last year - was broadly consistent with other open prisons and revealed that on average, one inmate absconds every week from an open prison.Mr Wheatley said the "vast majority" of prisoners, who include murderers and rapists, were rearrested quickly, but indicated that up to a quarter were not and some would go on to reoffend.The home secretary attempted to seize back the agenda on crime yesterday by announcing that special advocates would represent victims at Parole Board hearings.Mr Reid announced the plan in a speech to the Parole Board, declaring: "We will be rebalancing the whole system in favour of victims."The announcement comes after concern over the case of the convicted rapist Anthony Rice, who murdered Naomi Bryant nine months after being released from jail, and the murder of the City financier John Monckton, killed by an offender who had been freed on licence.In his speech Mr Reid said: "I am looking at ... how to improve public protection representation at oral hearings through 'public protection advocates' who will represent victims' and societies' views."In an attempt to bring the police back on side, Mr Reid will later this week announce he is delaying plans to merge police forces. The mergers were due to go ahead in June, which is regarded as too tight a timetable by the home secretary.
