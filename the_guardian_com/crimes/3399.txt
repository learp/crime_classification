Paedophiles living in the community should be tracked by satellite to reduce the risk of them reoffending, the Conservatives said today.Shadow home secretary Oliver Letwin said that under the plans, sex offenders would wear an ankle tag containing a microchip that would enable them to be tracked wherever they were in the world. Mr Letwin urged the Home Office to set up a working party to examine the idea of using satellite technology for surveillance of paedophiles. Tracking technology - using computer chips implanted under offenders' skin - had been used in Florida and appeared to have been successful, he added. "There is technology now available which would enable us to track where a particular individual is and there is also a law which enables judges to ban convicted paedophiles once released from going ... near to a school," he told the BBC. "It may be that we could use this technology to automatically alert the police if the person in question, who had been banned from going near that school, went to it."The proposal is included in a new Conservative policy paper, Protecting Children, which considers several measures to reduce the risks posed by sex offenders in the community and on the internet, including tightening child protection laws and tougher sentences for paedophiles.Mr Letwin also proposed psychometric tests with lie detectors for those seeking employment in boarding schools and care homes, in the hope of weeding out potential sex offenders. He said: "It should be restricted to boarding schools and residential care homes, where adults are living permanently with children and where there have been some really pretty egregious cases of abuse in the past. "I think it would be worth testing out in pilot projects."
