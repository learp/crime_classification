Two street preachers who handed out Islamic State leaflets outside the flagship branch of Topshop on Oxford Street, central London, have been jailed for inviting support for a terrorist group.Ibrahim Anderson and Shah Jahan Khanwere among a group who were reported to police by two sisters as they preached in August 2014 to passersby and handed out leaflets in support of the establishment by Isis of a caliphate. Asmaa and Reem al-Jufaisha, who were returning from a nearby Palestinian rights demonstration, confronted the men and took pictures of the stall decorated with the Isis logo, which they handed to police, the court heard.Anderson and Khan denied inviting support for a banned organisation. Anderson also denied possessing information likely to be useful to a terrorist. A jury found both men guilty last week after a trial at the Old Bailey.The judge Stephen Kramer QC jailed Anderson, 38, for three years and Khan, 63, for two years, saying their activities may have led to young people being lured to their deaths in Iraq and Syria.He told them: “It’s clear you were at that location that day to promote and invite support of Isis by engaging with and trying to persuade passersby, and handing out leaflets. Both said in evidence you knew and know IS was a proscribed terrorist organisation. You were not there on that day simply to call people to Islam or Da’wah. “It may be that stall had been there from time to time before August 9, 2014. However, in my judgment it’s also likely to have been no coincidence it was there that afternoon when many were leaving a pro-Gaza event and likely to pass.”Anderson, a father of five, had previous convictions for assault and possessing an imitation firearm.
