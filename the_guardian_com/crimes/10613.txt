A woman who gave her baby a dose of a heroin substitute has been jailed for three years. Susan Taylor, 29, almost killed her 10-month-old son by rubbing his dummy in a measuring cup made for methadone in an attempt to stop him crying, the Edinburgh High Court of Justiciary heard.Her partner, Lynn Cowan, was jailed for 10 months at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday after she admitted failing to tell medics the boy had been given methadone. The judge, Lord Bannatyne, sentenced Taylor on 11 September last year, but banned the reporting of the case until Cowan's case had been heard in court.Taylor will begin her time after finishing a 26-month sentence for assault.Sentencing Taylor last year, Lord Bannatyne said: "It is my view that there's a high degree of recklessness and culpability involved in the course of this offence."Taylor had been prescribed the heroin substitute to deal with addiction. She called 999 when she discovered that the boy was not breathing on 22 November 2008. The baby, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had blue lips and vomit on his face. Paramedics said that Taylor appeared "disinterested" when they arrived at the Edinburgh flat. Advocate Depute Morag Jack, prosecuting, said: "They immediately noticed that he did not appear to be breathing apart from a single gasp for air. He was cold to touch, however there was a pulse."The woman admitted that she had given the child methadone on a number of occasions. Doctors warned that he may suffer from behavioural and learning difficulties as a result.Taylor who had a troubled upbringing, had "no concept" of how dangerous the substitute could be, the court heard.
