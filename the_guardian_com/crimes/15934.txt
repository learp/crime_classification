An inquiry was urged last night into the circumstances in which an Asian prisoner died, allegedly after his throat was slashed by his white cell mate.Shahid Aziz, 25, died on Friday in his cell at Leeds prison. He was convicted at Leeds crown court on Wednesday of criminal damage and was awaiting sentence. Police investigating the death charged a man with murder yesterday. He is expected to appear in court this morning. It is believed to be the first death of a prisoner allegedly at the hands of his cell mate since the Zahid Mubarek scandal engulfed the prison service. Mubarek was murdered in Feltham young offenders' institute in 2000 by Robert Stewart, who had a known history of racism and violence. That case led to a inquiry by the Commission for Racial Equality, which damned the prison service and prompted promises of improvement. Yesterday the prison service extended its sympathies to the family of Mr Aziz, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. Imran Khan, solicitor for the Mubarek family, said: "There should be an inquiry into whether the right practices and procedures were followed." A prison service spokeswoman said: "We are using cell sharing risk assessment to ascertain whether prisoners, whatever their race, can share a cell. Cell sharing assessment enables us to identify high risk cases where cell sharing would not be a safe option."
