Transport ministers are expected to press ahead with plans to allow the police to issue fixed penalty fines for careless driving offences, despite objections from magistrates today about the rise of "out of court justice".The proposal would mean motorists guilty of minor careless driving offences being issued with a £60 fine and three penalty points on their licence. At a magistrates court the maximum penalties would be a £5,000 fine and nine penalty points.The Association of Chief Police Officers says it intends to issue strong guidance on the dividing line between minor careless driving offences, when an on-the-spot fine should be issued, and more serious cases which should go to court.John Thornhill, the Magistrates' Association chairman, said that recent years had seen a rapid rise in the use of "out of court" justice. In 2003, 68% of all criminal cases were decided by the courts, but this had fallen to only 48% by 2007."We have been investigating the use of out-of-court disposals, on-the-spot fines, for the last 12 months, and the evidence we have suggests that on many occasions where the matter is serious police go for the easy option of the on-the-spot fine, because it is done and dusted, dealt with there and then," said Thornhill."What this is doing is turning the police into jury and sentencer. Many of the police actually don't want to do this, because they believe it's more important that an independent tribunal which is not fettered by financial considerations or targets makes that decision."But both the Department for Transport and the Association of Chief Police Officers defended the proposal.The DfT said that making careless driving a fixed-penalty offence would help the police enforce the law against bad drivers who admit fault with a minimum of bureaucracy. "But all drivers would have the option to contest their case in court and we would work with the police and the courts to develop guidance to ensure that cases are handled correctly."Transport ministers will announce their decision later this year. "We are considering all consultation responses and will make an announcement later this year," the department said.Transport officials argue that the current regime has led to a very low level of enforcement of the law on careless driving compared to the number of deaths involved.They cite figures for 2006 which show there were only 28,900 convictions for careless or dangerous driving, which caused 480 deaths. Most were sent on driver education courses.By comparison there were 92,700 convictions for drink driving, which was responsible for 540 deaths. They argue that fixed penalty fines would sharply increase the level of police action against habitually bad drivers.
