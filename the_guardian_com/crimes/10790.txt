The row about the sentencing of a driver who killed a nine-year-old boy intensified yesterday, after his jail term was reduced because the judge sentenced him wrongly.Kamel Kadri, 38, was sentenced to two years last week after being convicted of running down Callum Oakford on January 1 in Ferring, West Sussex, and driving away. But yesterday the Crown Prosecution Service said the term would be cut by two months, because the trial judge had erred. Judge Anthony Thorpe sentenced Kadri to four months for failing to report an accident to be followed by four months for failing to stop after an accident. The CPS said that the law did not allow the judge to pass a sentence longer than six months for the motoring offences. Kadri, an Algerian, was also jailed for 16 months for having a false French passport, which he used to stay in Britain after his asylum appeals failed. Vikram Dodd
