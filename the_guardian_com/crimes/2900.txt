A woman convicted in 1995 of murdering two of her children admitted yesterday that she had killed a third child 15 years ago. Maxine Robinson, 35, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, pleaded guilty at Newcastle crown court to murder.She was initially convicted of murdering her 19-month-old daughter, Christine, and five-month-old son, Anthony. A Home Office pathologist said the deaths, in 1993, were consistent with suffocation, while other experts said the deaths were natural. An appeal was unsuccessful. The death of Robinson's first child, Victoria Cope, in 1989, was thought to have been a cot death. But while in prison, Robinson confessed to murdering her. Prison staff informed police and an investigation into the death was reopened. Robinson was charged with murder in January 2003. She also admitted for the first time that she had killed Anthony and Christine, who were smothered as they slept. At her trial nine years ago, Robinson denied the charges, claiming the children were the victims of cot death. It took a jury 10 hours to convict her, and she was jailed for life. Two doctors told her legal team she could have entered a plea of infanticide with diminished responsibility at her current trial. But she was adamant she wanted to be charged with murder as she felt she needed to be punished "in the extreme" for what she had done. Detective Superintendent Harry Stephenson, of Durham police, said it had been a difficult case for the officers who had interviewed Robinson. Sentencing was adjourned.
