The uncle of five-year-old Ellie Lawrenson, who was mauled to death by a dog on New Year's Day, today admitted owning a dangerous dog.Kiel Simpson, 23, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Magistrates' Court to owning an American pit bull terrier, a breed banned under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.The magistrates adjourned sentencing until May 16 but warned Simpson that a jail sentence was possible. He was granted unconditional bail.Simpson's hearing had heard that he bought the dog as a four-week-old puppy from a man in a pub shortly before Christmas 2005.Naming the dog Reuben, Simpson cared for the animal as it grew into a heavily-muscled, 40kg dog of "immeasurable strength", prosecutor Paul Blasbery told the court.Reuben was shot dead by a Merseyside Police marksman shortly after Ellie was mauled. Its body was examined by a police expert who found it to be one of the most powerful pit bull terriers he had ever seen, and "fantastically well conditioned", Mr Blasbery said."He said that in his opinion this dog was one of the finest examples of a pit bull terrier type that he has ever examined. "Its heavy musculature "would have made it an incredibly powerful dog with immeasurable strength to bite and shake", he added.The court also heard that Reuben had been banished from the house, in the Eccleston area of St Helens, after biting Kiel Simpson's 19-year-old sister, Kelsey, on November 21 last year.Miss Simpson needed hospital treatment for puncture wounds to her thigh after the unprovoked attack.The dog had also been involved in a ferocious attack on a neighbour's Jack Russell terrier in May 2006.Michael Fogarty, defending, said that his client had made efforts to give the dog to someone else after the attack on his sister.He said: "This gentleman has had a dog ever since he was a boy and he found it very difficult to hand it over for destruction, so he was asking around, trying to get friends to take the dog, but he couldn't find anybody to take it."He did leave instructions for the dog to be left outside the house. "He realised it was dangerous and had to be got rid of, but sadly that didn't happen and the events of New Year's Day occurred."Mr Fogarty said Simpson voluntarily attended a police station on January 3 and admitted that the dog was his.He said his client felt "morally responsible" for the death of Ellie, and that he "wanted to crawl into a hole".Mr Fogarty reminded the bench, however, that Simpson was not legally charged over Ellie's death and that it would serve no purpose to jail him.He added: "He is already serving a life sentence. It is very difficult for him, and for people close to him. What's the use of sending him to prison? I say nothing will be achieved."
