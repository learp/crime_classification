Tomorrow the inquest begins into the suicide of Jolene Willis, who hanged herself at Styal Prison, Cheshire, in April 2003 at the age of 25. It was a pitiful end to a tragically short life. Jolene was the fourth of six self-inflicted deaths which occurred at the prison between August 2002 and August 2003, a series of tragedies which have made the jail synonymous with the scandal of self-harm and suicide in our women's prisons.Like many women in prison, Jolene was serving only a short sentence (four months) for shoplifting. Like many others, she had a history of drug and alcohol dependency and entered detox when she came to Styal. Staff were told of the risk of suicide. Yet Jolene died. Prison inspectorate reports on HMP Styal have identified systemic failings in the treatment and care of women withdrawing from drugs. The criticism could equally apply to any number of prisons around the UK. A record 95 prison inmates killed themselves last year, including 13 women. Since Labour came to power in 1997, there have been 571 prison suicides. The situation is a national disgrace. To his credit, Home Secretary Charles Clarke acknowledged on taking up his post that there were too many people in prison who should not be there. Successive reports on women in prison have come to the same conclusion. Only seriously violent and repeat offenders should be locked up. Those who remain in prison should be in small units close to their families with access to drug and alcohol treatment and mental-health care. The Treasury will be resistant to a radical new model based on small, local secure units, but Mr Clarke must be prepared to fight hard for the means to reform a penal system that is killing inmates 40 years after the abolition of the death penalty.
