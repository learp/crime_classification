A new law toughening the penalties for domestic violence has backfired because fewer women are seeking help, it was claimed today.Women, and men, with violent partners are said to be less willing to lodge complaints because the likelihood of this resulting in their partner getting a criminal record has increased.The Ministry of Justice confirmed today that it is setting up an urgent meeting with judges to discuss the situation, which it is claimed could be putting around 5,000 people a year, mostly women, at increased risk.The complaint concerns a provision in the Domestic Violence Act that came into force in July last year. It means that a partner who is found to be in breach of a non-molestation order will be committing a criminal offence, instead of having the matter dealt with through the civil courts as before.Judge John Platt, a circuit judge dealing with domestic violence cases, told the Times today that the number of women seeking non-molestation orders had fallen by between 25 and 30% since the new provisions came in.Since there were 20,000 such applications in 2006, this figure suggests that 5,000 people could be losing out from the protection offered by a non-molestation order."Obviously this is a very worrying figure. Either offenders have changed their behaviour – which seems extremely unlikely – or the victims do not want to criminalise the perpetrators," Platt told the paper.A spokesman for Sir Mark Potter, president of the family division of the high court, confirmed that other judges were also worried about the decline in the number of applications for non-molestation orders.Potter was "very concerned that, for whatever reason, the legislation appears to have led to a reduction rather than an increase in the protection afforded to victims of domestic violence as a result of the change of the law", the spokesman said.A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice would not say today whether ministers accepted that the new legislation was to blame for the reduction in the number of non-molestation orders.But he said the department would be holding a meeting with judges very soon to discuss the matter further.
