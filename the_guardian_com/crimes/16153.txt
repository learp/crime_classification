An African healer was sentenced to five years in jail yesterday for killing his English wife, just weeks after she brought him to Britain from Burkina Faso in August last year.Hibiekoun Hien, 54, was convicted of manslaughter by a judge at Exeter crown court and ordered to be deported after he serves his sentence.The court heard he became convinced that his wife, Linda MacDonald, 53, planned to sell him as a slave to buy a car, or was plotting to kill him.Hien spent seven disoriented weeks in Britain, having moved from a village in Burkina Faso, in west Africa, which had been his home all his life to a semi-detached house in Buckfastleigh, Devon. He spoke no English and his wife could not speak any of his language, Djoula. He spoke just a few words of French.The court heard he had a respected position in Burkina Faso as an elder and healer and came from a family with a tradition of healing which he is believed to have inherited from his ancestors.His wife was interested in African healing methods and, after two visits in which she sought tuition, they married.Mr Geoffrey Mercer QC, prosecuting said: "Hien had obvious difficulties adjusting to life in Buckfastleigh and suffered substantial mental confusion. He believed people were plotting to kill him, or [that] he would be sold. He admitted striking the deceased after an argument and then jumping out of a window, which is how he himself sustained injuries."Hien had on one occasion tried to return to Burkina Faso, but had got lost before he could reach the airport.His wife tried to persuade him to stay initially, but had given up. At the time of the killing the couple were waiting to arrange a flight to take him to Burkina Faso.Nevertheless he inflicted massive head injuries on her and battered her twice with a heavy iron bar as she sat on the sofa in her home.Mr Justice Steel told him: "The circumstances of this case are so extraordinary they present me with a very difficult sentencing exercise. The attack on your wife seems to be immediately connected to your arrival in this country. I appreciate the stress you were under and your feelings of alienation. I accept you are a man who acted out of character, and you are a healer rather than a violent man."Hien had pleaded guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing.
