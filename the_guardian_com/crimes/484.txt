The legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders (Laspo) bill committee begins its work on the legislation today (12 July) in the shadow of a Department of Work and Pensions that has for decades chronically overemphasised the moral hazards that people will be work-shy if unemployment benefits are too high while ignoring the moral hazards when they are too low.Begging, borrowing, illegal trading or stealing are options for young people, probably in debt, with little or no income and no legal employment in sight. Drug dealing, mugging, shoplifting and burglary are all capable of providing a weekly income up to three or four times the £53.45 jobseeker's allowance provided to an unemployed 18-25 year old.For these unacceptable crimes magistrates have had to fine the poorest young people into penury deeper than the unemployment benefit. For breach of a rehabilitation order they can currently be fined a maximum of £250, aged under 14 and of £1,000 in any other case; clause 70 of the Laspo bill increases the maximum fine to £2,500. A policeman's lot will not be a happy one.Rev Paul NicolsonChair, Zacchaeus 2000 Trust
