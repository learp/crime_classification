A former police officer has admitted a £300m VAT fraud, believed to be the biggest in UK history.Nigel Cranswick was a director of Ideas 2 Go (I2G), which he ran from a office in a Sheffield business park, and claimed to have bought and sold at least £2bn of goods in eight months.The 47-year-old has since admitted that the firm's trading, largely in mobile phones and computer software, was fictitious and that the aim was to generate paperwork from fake sales in order to claim back a fortune in VAT from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC).A source close to the case, which has taken five years to investigate, said it was believed to be the largest of its kind ever taken to court.Prosecution documents stated: "In its eight-month trading life, I2G's business documentation reveals that it purported to buy and sell goods, in many thousands of deals, to the value of at least £2bn."This included about £300m of VAT, which it was purportedly charged by its suppliers. The trade was not genuine and this £300m was the target of the defendants."The documents said I2G operated from a "very small and modest office accommodation in a Sheffield business park". "The defendants, who were its officers and employees and purported to carry out billions of pounds of business, had no previous experience in either the mobile phone industry or in running any business on such a grand scale," the documents said.Cranswick, of Sheffield, admitted conspiracy to cheat HMRC. Brian Olive, 56, of Doncaster, and Darren Smyth, 42, of Rotherham, admitted the same charge.Cranswick's sister Clare Reid, 44, admitted two counts of false accounting. They pleaded guilty on the eve of a trial at Newcastle crown court, and will be sentenced along with two other defendants next month.Paul Rooney, the HMRC assistant director for criminal investigation, said: "This was a sophisticated fraud designed to steal hundreds of millions of pounds of tax. HMRC investigators unravelled a complex web of fake business transactions fabricated to conceal the massive financial fraud."Cranswick joined South Yorkshire police in 1997, aged 33, and left the force a few weeks after I2G started trading in 2005. By then he and his wife, Nicola, owed £42,000 on top of their mortgage.Within a few weeks of I2G starting, the couple could afford portraits costing £2,208, teeth bleaching at £700, landscaping at £4,725 and furniture worth more than £3,100.Olive and Smyth, Cranswick's brother-in-law, were recruits to the supposed multibillion pound business and had previously worked as railway track maintenance men. I2G employed Reid as an administrator.The prosecution document stated that I2G's claimed £2bn turnover in eight months was "pure fantasy".Those figures were based on the supposed purchase and resale of around 4.6m mobile phones.It was claimed I2G made sales of £527m in its first six weeks of trading."Nobody, not even the simplest of men, could have ever believed that such a turnover could be achieved legitimately," the prosecution document said.I2G had paperwork supposedly showing sales of phones that were not yet available, or at prices far above the real wholesale price.Cranswick, who rented a villa in Marbella, Spain, describes himself as a singer-songwriter and can be seen on his website strumming a guitar in a song called Hit and Miss, which has the opening lines: "I'm in trouble, falling down a hole. How I got here, I won't ever know."He is the lead singer with an indie band called Not the Police.
