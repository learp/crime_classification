Detectives released four men and a woman yesterday who had been held in connection with the fatal shooting of police officer Sharon Beshenivsky in Bradford.A police source said other suspects were being sought, although their alleged roles were not clear. The Metropolitan police are helping the West Yorkshire force, which fears that others linked to the robbery in which PC Beshenivsky was killed last Friday are at large in London. Officers believe a gang that may have been behind similar raids was responsible. One man, aged 31, remained in custody in West Yorkshire last night.
