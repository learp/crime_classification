A conman has been jailed for four and a half years after admitting pocketing Â£300,000 in donations meant for the Help for Heroes charity, which raises funds for injured service personnel and their families.Christopher Copeland recruited teams of workers to set up donation stations at supermarkets around the country over an 18-month period.They used his fleet of former military vehicles in Help for Heroes livery, and encouraged shoppers to put money into charity buckets.The workers, who were paid expenses, would spend three or four days a week collecting, staying in Copeland's vehicles or a hotel. They handed the cash to Copeland, from Devon, who transferred it into his personal bank accounts. His con was spotted by a genuine Help the Heroes fundraiser, who reported him.Copeland, 52, admitted one charge of fraud by false representation and one charge of concealing criminal property.Judge Philip Wassall told him he had abused the goodwill and trust of the public and risked the good name of the Help for Heroes charity, which he purported to admire and support.He said: "Offences like these dent public confidence in charity and show how easy it is for somebody so motivated to take money from charities."This offending was very damaging to Help for Heroes and the public are likely to question how safe their donations are and whether they will reach the charity."Any sentence must deter and restore public confidence by showing when people offend in this way there will be lengthy sentences."David Sapiecha, prosecuting at Exeter crown court, said Copeland would now face proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.Representing Copeland, Rosaleen Collins said her client and his family had been attacked at their home since his arrest.Speaking ahead of the sentencing, Help for Heroes' income protection officer, Jo Brookes, condemned Copeland's actions. She said: "We're appalled that Chris Copeland exploited the goodwill of so many people towards our wounded men and women in such a calculated, devious way."The money he stole never reached us, or the thousands of heroes we support, because he used organised, criminal tactics to intercept it."Help for Heroes is grateful to our local fundraiser who first spotted what Copeland was doing, and to the police and the courts who have made sure he didn't get away with it."
