A former official harpist to the Prince of Wales stole a hoard of electrical goods and cash while fighting a drug addiction, a court heard today.Jemima Phillips, a graduate of the Royal College of Music who played at the wedding of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, allegedly burgled houses across the Coleford area of Gloucestershire in May.Opening the trial today, Martin Steen, prosecuting, told Gloucester crown court the 28-year-old had helped her co-defendant, 41-year-old William Davies, to burgle the homes.Phillips, from Lydney, Gloucestershire, and Davies, from Cheltenham, both deny four counts of burglary. Phillips also denies one count of handling stolen goods. Steen told the jury Davies had admitted five counts of handling stolen goods.He said Phillips had previously admitted one count of fraud by trying to use a stolen building society book at a branch of Nationwide in Monmouth.Steen said Phillips falsely claimed to police she had done this after a friend of Davies's threatened to go to the press and reveal her addiction.Steen said: "This case may attract some publicity. The reason for this is, she is a remarkably talented harpist. She has played in a number of locations and was selected for the wedding of His Royal Highness Prince Charles."He added: "Mr Davies and Miss Phillips have had problems with drugs. They are both recovering addicts."Steen told the jury Phillips and Davies had burgled four homes between 22 and 28 May.In the first burglary, a shoulder bag, a wallet and bank cards were taken from a house in Oaklands, Coleford, Steen said.Two days later, a guitar, cash, driving documents, bank cards and a computer were taken from a house in Lydney.The next day, a wallet, cards and two mobile phones were taken from a house in Coleford.Finally, on 28 May, a television, a camera, two laptop computers, a wallet and cards were taken from a house in Milkwall, near Coleford.Steen told the jury Phillips had assisted with the four burglaries.The trial continues.
