A man jailed for eight years after being branded a "wannabe suicide bomber" was the victim of a miscarriage of justice, appeal court judges have ruled.Mohammed Atif Siddique, 24, a student from Alva in Clackmannanshire, central Scotland, must wait to hear whether he will be released or will face a retrial after the court in Edinburgh said it was "minded" to quash his conviction at a hearing next week.One of the appeal judges, Lord Osborne, said some directions given to the jury by the trial judge, Lord Carloway, when explaining the main Terrorist Act provisions faced by Siddique had been a "material misdirection"."In our opinion [this] amounts to a miscarriage of justice," Osborne said.Although the court's decision centred upon the trial judge's directions to the jury, it will be welcomed by relatives and friends who have always argued that Siddique was a foolish and impressionable young man who posted inappropriate material on websites but should not have been treated as a terrorist.After he was jailed, his brother Asif Siddique said: "This is not a case regarding one individual, it's a showcase, an example being made to show other Muslims, and to show the muscle of the legal system to an innocent but stupid young man."At Siddique's trial it was alleged he possessed articles that gave rise to a "reasonable suspicion" they were for use in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.The shopkeeper's son had been under covert surveillance by the security services for several months when he was arrested at Glasgow airport in April 2006 as he was about to board a flight to Lahore in Pakistan.He was convicted of possessing and collecting items such as CDs and videos on weapons use, guerrilla tactics and bomb-making, as well as setting up websites with links to terrorist publications that showed how to use weapons and make bombs, distributing terrorist publications via links on a website, and causing a breach of the peace at Glasgow Metropolitan College by threatening to become a suicide bomber.Siddique was the first person convicted of Islamist terrorism offences in Scotland. He is thought to have been held in isolation for his own protection for much of the time he has been in jail.During Siddique's appeal his lawyers pointed out that much of the material in his possession was freely available on the internet and amounted to "mere propaganda". They argued that Siddique's possession of it did not prove he was about to commit a terrorist attack.Defence counsel Donald Findlay QC described the material as "a hotchpotch, a melange of a whole variety of matters which is, in my submission, of no practical purpose whatsoever to any terrorist". Findlay described the provisions within counter-terrorism legislation that resulted in charges being brought against Siddique as "draconian", while the crown conceded that the legislation was controversial.Siddique remains in custody pending next week's hearing. He did not appeal against the least serious charges, for which he has effectively served his sentence.
