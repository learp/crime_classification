The police and wider community in Greater Manchester must "stand as one" after the murders of two police officers killed in Hattersley last week to avoid such killings becoming "commonplace", a bishop said as locals attended remembrance services.Five days after PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes died in a gun and grenade attack while responding to an apparently routine incident, the Right Rev Mark Davies, Roman Catholic bishop of Shrewsbury, told about 50 churchgoers that the officers lost their lives "in fulfilling their duty for our protection"."If our children are not to grow up accepting the murders of Tuesday as commonplace then the police and the community must stand as one in defence of human life, overcoming whatever obstacles may prevent this trust," he said during mass at St James the Great in Hattersley."The police are there to protect us, but our protection must also be found within ourselves – in the moral values on which our homes and families are built, in the strength of our community."Dale Cregan, of no fixed address, has been charged with both murders and is due to appear via videolink at Manchester crown court on Monday. The 29-year-old has also been charged with the murders of father and son David and Mark Short, and four attempted murders across east Manchester.A fifteen-year-old boy arrested in Hattersley on suspicion of aiding an offender has been released on bail until Thursday pending further inquiries.As Davies paid tribute to the police as "our last line of protection against the savagery of the jungle", a remembrance service was held in PC Hughes's home village of Diggle, Oldham, where the 23-year-old lived with her mother. A book of condolence was put on display for the public to sign at the local church, and a service of reflection was due to take place at Mottram parish church, just half a mile from where the gun and grenade attack took place.Speaking on BBC 1's Songs of Praise, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Sir Peter Fahy, said a prayer vigil would be held on Tuesday for colleagues of the dead officers and any members of the public who wished to attend. "It is that sort of human need to express emotion to be together," he said, adding that praying for the officers and their families was many people's "own expression of hope" at a time when it would be possible to feel hopeless.For many police officers, Fahy said, their work was a vocation rather than just a job. "I think a lot of us feel passionately that policing is a vocation; it is a calling," he said."I feel that in terms of my own faith, but I know lots of officers who don't have a faith feel exactly that … that it is a vocation, it's not just a job, and I think that's what almost you go back to in difficult times and in difficult circumstances: that, how unfair something may feel, that how inadequate you may feel, you do actually rely on at the end of the day you're doing your best and this is your vocation."Canon David Wilbraham, the national police chaplain, told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that the killings had raised "profoundly deep questions" for all in the police service regardless of whether they were religious."For some people faith is an important part of life and that's absolutely fine," he said. "For others it may not play a part, but at a time like this I think a lot of people are spiritual even if they wouldn't say they had a card-carrying faith."It raises very deep questions I think for all of us when we see things on this scale about what life means, about how we live as a society, and they're profoundly deep questions that I think everyone regardless of faith or belief does question at times like this."Wilbraham added that, despite the "tremendous" sadness and shock felt within the policing community, he had not heard calls for greater precaution to be taken or for officers to be routinely armed.Fahy said the tradition of an unarmed force was held very dearly. "We believe very much in what Robert Peel laid down for us back in 1829 – that we are a routinely unarmed police force, that we use the minimum of force, that we have this very close connection with the community we serve and that is really, really important to us," he said.
