The Home Office today set out a series of proposals to reform the structure and accountability of the police.The plans - outlined as part of a consultation exercise - stretch from abolishing traditional county forces to making police authorities electable by the public.The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: "The police service grew out of communities, and the position of constable - the citizen in uniform - is a key civic position that should be rooted at the heart of any civil society."I want members of the public to know who their local police commander is and to be able to get answers to basic questions when things are not up to scratch."The abolition of the county forces, which is likely to prove controversial, is suggested as a means to develop larger "strategic" forces big enough to deal with all the demands of modern policing."The government believes the time is right to consider whether the present 43-force structure in England and Wales is the right one for today's and tomorrow's policing needs," said the Home Office's paper.It also recommends rationalising small specialist units such as London's Royal Parks police and Royal Botanical Gardens police but creating more "lead" forces to specialise in investigating crimes such as murder, complex fraud and internet paedophilia.But a proposal to allow civilians to take over more police work is sure to anger rank and file officers.Mr Blunkett has already introduced civilian patrol officers, known as community support officers, in face of protests from the Police Federation - which represents the rank and file - that only trained constables should intervene in sensitive and sometimes potentially hostile situations.The chairwoman of the Association of Police Authorities, Dr Ruth Henig, immediately voiced her opposition to the proposal to create elected police authorities after Mr Blunkett unveiled it at her organisation's conference in Manchester."Directly elected police authorities could threaten the breadth and diversity of membership with no evidence of greater effectiveness," she said."We accept the challenge that police authorities should become more visible. But we do not wish to lose the valuable contribution made by independent members, of whom 21.5% are from black and minority ethnic communities and almost half are women."Mr Blunkett said in his speech that he was aware of problems that could be caused by publicly electing chief constables."I am mindful of the dangers of rabble-rousers or racists becoming elected. Unless people actually have an understanding of who to hold to account, then this would be absolutely a waste of time."Mr Blunkett earlier said that police forces will receive full backing if they investigate claims that there are British National Party members in their ranks.Responding to claims by a BNP councillor at the weekend that 12 members of West Midlands police belong to the racist party, he said he would use his influence to ensure such allegations were investigated."I do not believe that it is tenable for a member of the British National Party to be a police officer in this country," Mr Blunkett told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
