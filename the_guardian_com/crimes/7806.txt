A teenager whose only friendships were with younger children will be jailed for life after battering a 10-year-old girl to death hours after playing cricket with her.Kieron Smith, 18, has failed to give any explanation of the tragedy in July, when he attacked Lauren Pilkington-Smith in woodland near their homes while neighbours were following coverage of the London bombings.He was found guilty yesterday by a unanimous verdict at Liverpool crown court, where his trial was held because of emotions in Leigh, Greater Manchester, where Smith was known as a solitary six-footer, obsessed with videos and late-night TV.Mr Justice Mackay adjourned sentencing for social inquiry and probation reports but said: "There is only one sentence that can be passed on him and that is life."The two-week trial heard that Smith had chalked a wicket on a terrace house wall on the warm summer night, and joined Laura and some younger boys who were full of excitement about the London Olympics and England's progress in the Ashes. The little girl was known as friendly and popular and obeyed her parents' instructions to call back at home every half hour when playing out.Smith, by contrast, dropped out of school at 13 because crowds of other children upset him. Attempts by the local education department to arrange teaching for him petered out and by 16 he had developed a routine of watching TV, playing computer games and spending time with his stepfather's alsatian and his own canary, cockatiels and parrot.The jury heard that on the day of the murder Smith was at home with his stepsister after his mother, stepfather and sister had left for a holiday in Turkey. He insisted to police he went home for tea after the cricket game, but eyewitness reports of his movements and droplets of Lauren's blood on his trainers gave him away.Detective Chief Inspector Shaun Donnellan of Greater Manchester police, who led the murder inquiry, said after the verdict: "The truth is that there was no reason for what he did. He lied to everyone in court but thankfully the jury saw through those lies. He has shown absolutely no remorse."The trial heard that Smith had half-stripped Lauren's body after the murder, stuffing a sock in her mouth and two twigs up her nostrils. There was no evidence of sexual assault and police believe his motives will remain unexplained.Lauren's grandmother, Pat Smith, read out a family statement after the verdict, describing how the child "had a wonderful sense of humour and always had a smile on her face".
