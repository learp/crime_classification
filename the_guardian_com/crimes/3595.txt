Detectives investigating the disappearance of nine-year-old Shannon Matthews have released a new photograph of her.The picture was taken in September at West Moor junior school where Shannon is a pupil and has been made public on the day that a sighting of her was reported.Two boys, who have not been named, spotted Shannon "crying her eyes out" on the day she went missing. She was seen sitting on a wall half a mile from her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire. She was not wearing her coat, which may have been put into a plastic bag with her swimming kit.Shannon vanished on her way home from school after a swimming trip on February 19. A classmate has claimed she was bullied on the bus on the way home.In a television interview, Megan Aldridge said: "We got on the bus home and Shannon was really, really quiet. She is normally noisy and chatty. "A girl came up to her and started bullying her [that day] and I told her to go away or I would tell the teacher, so she walked off. "She said she was going home and I last saw her on the school bus. She was behind me and I didn't see where she went when she got off the bus." Megan said she had told police of a "fox hole" that Shannon used to visit. West Yorkshire police have mounted a huge operation involving 250 uniformed officers and 60 detectives â€“ about 10% of the force's operational strength. More than 500 houses along Shannon's route home from school have been searched using sniffer dogs.
