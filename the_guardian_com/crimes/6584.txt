Detectives are questioning a teenager after two arrests in the hunt for the killers of a couple who had fled to a quiet seaside resort after threats following a brutal murder.A 19-year-old man was held in Nottingham and taken for questioning by officers in Lincolnshire, where Joan and John Stirland were found dead in their home at Trusthorpe three weeks ago. A second man was arrested after voluntarily giving himself up to police in Nottingham and was later released on police bail. Lincolnshire police said he had been accompanied by his solicitor and could be recalled after further inquiries. Mr Stirland, a 55-year-old textile worker, and his 53-year-old wife, a child cancer nurse, were killed shortly after calling police in the early afternoon of August 8 to report a prowler outside their home. Neighbours later described seeing two men in boilersuits near the bungalow. A car was later found on fire less than two miles away. The couple's bodies were not discovered until 9.30pm when a police officer called at their house. The couple had moved secretly to Trusthorpe last September from Nottingham after Mrs Stirland's son, Michael O'Brien, was jailed for life for shooting a man outside a local pub. O'Brien showed no remorse in court,and shouted abuse at his victim's family.
