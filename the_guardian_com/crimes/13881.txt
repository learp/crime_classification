The home secretary, John Reid, has threatened to crush the "mini-motorbikes" of yobs who ride them illegally in parks and on pavements.Mr Reid has put aside Â£200,000 of Home Office money for a summer-long assault on the misuse of the bikes, which are sold as toys but can reach 60mph and emit deafening exhaust noise.There are thought to be at least 100,000 in the country, with six deaths in Manchester alone attributed to them in the past 12 months.28 pilot areas across the country will receive money and guidance on how to fine and prosecute owners who misuse the bikes, which are only legally allowed on private land with permission.Mr Reid said: "People have had quite enough of this; we know from thousands of calls police have received."People are not going to tolerate this any more. There are parents who ought to know better."At worst, these bikes can be a death trap for children and, at best, they're not only illegal but a nuisance to neighbours."There are a lot of parents who still don't know it is illegal and think it is just a bit of fun."These bikes are not a bit of fun - they are a danger to the local community and to the young people driving them."Mr Reid was visiting Wythenshawe, Manchester, to see bikes confiscated by police scooped up by a crane and dumped in a crushing machine.The Home Office published step-by-step practical guides for residents, local police and the courts today, giving clear advice on how communities can deal with the problem.An online advertising campaign linked to mini-moto websites will also warn riders about their anti-social behaviour and its consequences.In Greater Manchester alone, police received 26,000 complaints about the bikes in the last 14 months.Chief Inspector Haydn Roberts, of Greater Manchester police, said that his officers were now confiscating 20 mini-motorbikes a week and that there had been six deaths of people using the bikes in the last 12 months.He added: "I talked to some residents who break down in tears because day in and day out there is this constant drone and their kids can't play outside in the street because of these bike riders."Anyone using the bikes on streets and playing fields can be fined and have their machines crushed as well as getting points on their licence - even if they are too young to have one yet.It is illegal to ride them in any public place and they should only be used on private land.The Motorcycle Industry Association estimates that sales of mini-moto-type vehicles have increased from 10,000 in 2002 to an estimated 100,000 in 2005.
