Knives were used in almost four out of 10 killings of young people in the UK, more than any other weapon, figures showed yesterday, but the country still had one of the lowest knife death rates in Europe.More than a dozen young people have been killed by knives in London this year, but the UK rate is 0.23 deaths per 100,000 people. That was among the lowest in Europe, along with Azerbaijan (0.06), Germany (0.23), and Slovenia (0.23), the World Health Organisation figures showed.The WHO study said a knife was used in 39.5% of killings, and in 12% of all violent crimes, among young people aged 10-29 between 2004 and 2006. And more than one in 10 hospital admissions for assault in the UK involved use of a sharp implement.The WHO said 15,000 young people were killed in Europe every year, with 40% of these deaths involving knives, but much of the violence could be prevented by using a public health approach.Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe, said: "There is much to be gained by adapting the experience of some of the most successful European countries in preventing violence."Pointing to the UK as an example, she said: "If all countries reached the same homicide rates as the lowest in the region, Europe could potentially save over 13,000 young lives per year. In other words, nine out of 10 such deaths could be avoided. This makes compelling arguments for increased investment in violence prevention."
