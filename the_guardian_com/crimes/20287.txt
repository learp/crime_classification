A former private schoolgirl who hurled homophobic abuse at a gay civil servant before stamping on him and kicking him during a deadly attack was today facing jail.Ruby Thomas was found guilty of the manslaughter of 62-year-old Ian Baynham, who died 18 days after the drink-fuelled assault in Trafalgar Square, central London, last September.Police later found his blood smeared on her handbag and the ballet pumps she was wearing as she kicked him.The court heard the 18-year-old had smiled as she "put the boot into" Baynham after he had been knocked to the ground by another teenager, Joel Alexander.Thomas's ex-boyfriend told the Old Bailey that the blonde teenager, of Anerley, south-east London, was "not the type of girl" to have carried out the assault.But jurors convicted her and 20-year-old Alexander, of Thornton Heath, south-east London, of manslaughter.A third defendant, 18-year-old Rachael Burke, of Upper Norwood, also in south-east London, was found guilty of affray at an earlier trial.Thomas, a former pupil at the Â£12,000-a-year Sydenham High School for Girls, had a record for violence. She was 15 when she assaulted a bus driver in Northumberland Avenue in December 2007, a short distance from the scene of the attack on Baynham.On the night Baynham was attacked, Thomas was said to have been "off her face", acting in a "lairy, mouthy" way and flirting with random men.The court heard Thomas had screamed "fucking faggots" at the victim and his friend Philip Brown.When Baynham confronted her, there was a scuffle during which she hit him with her handbag and he grabbed it.Alexander then ran up and knocked him to the ground, causing a severe brain injury as his head struck the pavement.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said: "That did not suffice. There is evidence that the female defendants then began putting the boot into Mr Baynham, who was still on his back, clearly unconscious and in distress."He said the girls were "fuelled by copious amounts of alcohol" and one witness likened the attack to a scene from the film A Clockwork Orange."Shocked onlookers saw repeated stamping to his chest and forceful kicks to his head," Altman said.Thomas put her head in her hands as the verdicts were returned. Both defendants will be sentenced in the new year.
