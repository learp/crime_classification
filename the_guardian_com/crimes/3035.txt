Boris Johnson's Conservative administration in London is to cut the number of police officers in the capital, despite him campaigning for election on making crime-fighting his top priority.Plans in the mayor's budget reveal a cut of 455 officers by the time London hosts the Olympics in 2012.Critics say it is the first substantial cut in police numbers in the capital since power over policing was devolved in 2000.Johnson announced last week he would stand down as chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, the body that oversees Scotland Yard.The mayor's budget lays out the proposed cuts and says: "Over the three years to 2012-13, the number of police officers is forecast to decrease by 455."The mayor's budget predicts no decrease in the cheaper police community support officers and police specials: "PCSOs remain the same and special constables increase by 2,690."The police service faces major challenges in managing police officer numbers against future funding levels," the mayor's document says.The news that police officer numbers will be cut poses problems for the Tory party nationally. It has been accused of giving sparse detail about what proposed spending cuts would mean in reality.It is also tricky for Tory leader David Cameron, because both opposition parties say the financial squeeze on Scotland Yard is the direct result of decisions made by Johnson.Dee Doocey, Liberal Democrat member of the MPA, said the police cuts were the responsibilty of the Conservative mayor. She said he had decided to spend more than £16m, which could fund the fight against crime, on the fire service instead: "The Mayor has the power to decide, it's his budget. The money for policing from the home office has increased for policing."If you're going to cut £16.4 from the police budget, it does not make any sense. It does not match up with his campaign promises."One police borough commander told the Guardian they were trying to limit the cuts to civilian staff: "We are having to lose staff and that is a painful situation."Announcing a recruitment freeze, the Met said it had 2,000 candidates waiting for a start date. It said a recruitment campaign had left it with more candidates than vacancies, "not what we predicted when we embarked on our campaigns".Relations between the Conservative administration running London and the police have been strained since Johnson came to office in May 2008.Within months he had in effect ousted the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, from office. Even those who wanted Blair gone were concerned about political interference in policing.Those concerns were heightened last year when the deputy mayor, Kit Malthouse, said he and Johnson "have our hands on the tiller" of the Met and had taken control of the force away from the home office.The Liberal Democrats will today announce plans to boost spending on the police from savings made by scrapping identity cards.Police chiefs met yesterday to discuss up to £500m in savings while maintaining key services.Scotland Yard announced a freeze in recruiting new constables, and in part blamed "the current economic position".
