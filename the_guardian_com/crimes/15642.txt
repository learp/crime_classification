The mother of Toni-Ann Byfield said her daughter would still be alive if Birmingham social services had allowed her to go to Jamaica with her after she was taken into care in 2002.The reason her request was rejected was that Roselyn Richards, who is poor, unemployed, and lives with two other children in a one-bedroom house, was judged not to have the means for proper care. Ms Richards, 34, said: "She would still be alive if returned to me. My other children are still alive." When the seven-year-old Toni-Ann was murdered, Ms Richards was in Jamaica and had not seen her for three years.Toni-Ann was taken away from Ms Richards by her former partner Bertram Byfield, after a feud between the couple. She said the drug dealer used to abuse her: "He beat me up, he took the children away from me, no dad should do that."Ms Richards said Byfield emotionally blackmailed her into talking positively about him to social services staff. "He said that Toni-Ann was bright, doing good in school. Bertram was always in control."
