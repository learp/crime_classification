Humberside and Cambridgeshire police, the two forces criticised for their handling of the Soham murder investigation, will come under renewed pressure when a new league table shows that they have problems in other areas of policing, the Guardian has learned.The two services, under scrutiny for failing to share previous allegations against the Soham murderer Ian Huntley, are believed to have emerged poorly in an official analysis of their overall performance. The first "baseline assessments" of all 43 English and Welsh forces by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) are to be published next week. The assessments, which examine 23 areas of police activity, from crime investigation, dealing with racist crime and the use of forensic science to call-handling and leadership skills, were introduced last year as part of the government's action on police reform and public accountability. An HMIC source admitted that a number of forces, in cluding Humberside and Cambridgeshire, were already receiving advice from the Home Office's police standards unit to help to bring them up to scratch on a variety of issues, but he insisted: "It would be grossly unfair to label these failing forces." However, he conceded that Humberside and Cambridgeshire were "under-performing in certain areas, and they have been given support". The Guardian understands that Cambridgeshire, headed by Tom Lloyd, is ranked poorly for crime prevention and solving, public safety, and sick leave. Humberside, whose chief constable is David Westwood, has been criticised for poor crime reduction and investigation rates. The Avon and Somerset, Greater Manchester and Nottinghamshire forces are also expected to be criticised. They were described by the Home Office last year as the worst performing forces in the country. Cleveland, West Yorkshire and Northamptonshire have also been criticised recently for their performance in various areas of activity.
