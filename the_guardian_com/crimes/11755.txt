A 58-year-old man was last night charged with the murder of a Belfast cafe owner more than 35 years ago. The shooting of Catholic father-of-four Alfredo Fusco in February 1973 was blamed on loyalist paramilitaries from the Ulster Defence Association, although the organisation never admitted responsibility. The suspect was arrested yesterday and later charged by officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland's historical enquiries unit, set up to revisit unsolved Troubles murders. Unusually, he was released on police bail to appear at Belfast magistrates court on 1 September.Mr Fusco, 58, a prominent member of Belfast's Italian community, was gunned down inside his cafe on York Road in north Belfast. Two gunmen forced their way into the premises and singled out the owner in front of customers.One chased him into a back storeroom, returning briefly to swap weapons with his accomplice before continuing to fire. Pensioner Samuel Reynolds, who had been in a nearby newsagents when he heard the gunfire, collapsed and died from a heart attack brought on by the shock.The Fusco family had been subject to intimidation in the lead-up to the killing, with Mr Fusco's car having been torched two months before he was shot.At his inquest, a corner described the killing as a "callous, horrible and senseless murder" of a respectable citizen running a respectable business.
