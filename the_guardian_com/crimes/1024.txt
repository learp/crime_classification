A coroner and solicitor has been jailed for eight years after he was convicted of stealing and defrauding clients to the tune of £2m in order to fund his lavish lifestyle.Alan Crickmore, 57, who was the coroner for Gloucestershire and an apparently respectable solicitor in Cheltenham, pocketed money that clients left in their wills for relatives and friends.Crickmore, who admitted more than 20 charges of theft and fraud, spent the money on lovely holidays, expensive restaurants and an impressive wine cellar. He used to drive a Jaguar with a numberplate including the letters HMC (Her Majesty's coroner).Among his victims was a Polish war veteran called Josef Dziuma, who died in 1998 aged 78. Crickmore acted as sole executor of his will as he had no family in the UK, and took money intended for his GP and his brother in Poland.DCI Dave Sellwood of Gloucestershire police, who led the investigation, said: "There is absolutely no remorse. There is just arrogance on his part; there is no acceptance that he has been doing anything wrong. His wife and two sons were completely oblivious. They thought he was a very successful local solicitor and Gloucestershire coroner earning a very, very good living."He always appeared very, very professional and always someone that was easy to work with. There was no reason to doubt him at all. When I spoke to the victims some didn't believe it – they didn't believe they had done very much at all. They had been completely taken in. He would tell them tales about his trips and bring them back presents from his holiday – little did they know they were paying for it."
