Since her disappearance from Bethnal Green, friends had been carrying out searches across east London and handing out leaflets. Co-stars Natalie Cassidy and Brooke Kinsella both appealed for help to find her.The torso was discovered close to Broadway market in Hackney at 2.40pm on Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said. Detectives said the arrested man remained in custody."At this early stage officers believe they know the identity of the victim but must await further forensic tests before formal identification can take place," a Met spokeswoman said."Police were initially contacted by a member of the public who had noticed something suspicious floating in the water. The torso was recovered by divers from the Met's marine support unit and additional searches are due to be carried out in the water."A post mortem examination was taking place at Poplar mortuary and an incident room was opened in Barking. Detective Inspector John Nicholson is leading the murder inquiry.The man being questioned by police is understood to have been known to McCluskie.The unclothed body's arms, legs and head had been hacked off before it was found floating in the waterway, a source said.The discovery came after officers had expressed extreme concern for McCluskie's welfare. Searches were organised by her cousins Kyri Sambridge and Nikki Tsindides in recent days, with missing person posters put up across the East End.
