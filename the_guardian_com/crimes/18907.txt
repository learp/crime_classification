A 52-year-old man questioned in connection with the disappearance of missing schoolgirl Amanda Dowler was released today on police bail and returned to custody in prison where he has been in custody charged with an unrelated offence.The man, from Ashford, Surrey, was understood to have been returned to Belmarsh prison, south east London. He was arrested there yesterday morning by Surrey police detectives investigating the disappearance of 13-year-old Amanda, who was known as Milly. The teenager disappeared while walking home from the train station in Malton-on-Thames, Surrey, on March 21. A police spokeswoman said: "The 52-year-old man arrested yesterday in relation to the inquiry into the disappearance of Amanda Dowler has today been bailed until a later date and returned to prison." Detectives have been frustrated in their pursuit of a breakthrough in the case and have admitted they do not know whether Amanda ran away or has been abducted. She was last seen by friends setting off on the mile-long walk home from the station. Milly's parents - teacher Sally, 43, and IT consultant Bob, 50, - and her sister Gemma, 16, have all made media appeals for information but have so far failed to turn up a substantial lead. Other appeals have been made by celebrities including Pop Idol Will Young. There has also been a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction, an appeal on the internet, a fingertip search of more than 100 local sites and a Â£100,000 reward posted.
