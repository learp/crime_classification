Republican dissidents are being linked to a cigarette smuggling operation smashed by an Anglo-Irish security operation.More than 120m smuggled cigarettes were seized from a ship at Greenore, Co Louth. HM Revenue & Customs and police from both sides of the Irish border were involved in what is believed to be the biggest ever seizure of contraband cigarettes in the UK or Ireland.About 150 police and security officers were involved in the operation which resulted in the arrest of two men from Co Armagh and eight from Co Louth. Security sources in Northern Ireland estimated the haul to be worth more than €50m (£45m). The ship was tracked from the Philippines on 15 September and was officially carrying animal feed as its cargo.After the cargo was unloaded, officers followed trucks to another location and raided several premises in the Co Louth area. HM Revenue & Customs spokesman John Whiting said: "This smuggling attempt was organised crime on a global scale … Today's operation shows that those who think they can exploit international borders for criminal purposes and to escape justice are wrong."Irish Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy said it was a "significant strike against organised crime". Security sources told the Guardian that the gang behind the smuggling plot is linked to the Real IRA, who have been extremely active in recent months in the region.
