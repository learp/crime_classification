The persistently low conviction rates for rape - a meagre 5.3% at last count - are a shameful indictment of a criminal justice system that time and again fails victims of sexual violence. But unacceptable as these figures are, it would be difficult to dispute that supporting victims has become more of a government priority.Among the strides forward is the liaison work of the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Sexual Violence and Abuse, which helps keep the issue on the agenda. Then there is the welcome investment in sexual assault referral centres designed to ease the distress of victims when they come into contact with the criminal justice system. And there is the victims fund, established to dispatch much-needed funding top-ups to local rape crisis centres and centres for victims of abuse across England and Wales.So why has the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) been forced to write to ministers to voice concerns that rape crisis centres - the frontline services to which victims turn at their most distressed - are facing a continuing funding crisis, with some on the brink of closure?According to NCVO and Rape Crisis England and Wales, centres face an uncertain future not because there is no cash available, or because the work they do is poor or unnecessary, but because of inadequate funding procedures that work against centres.Last month, NCVO's chief executive Stuart Etherington wrote to the justice minister, Maria Eagle, outlining its concerns about "serious maladministration of the ministry's victims fund". The letter relayed complaints from some centres that they were not being given sufficient notice about funding renewal or withdrawal, leaving them unsure if they would have to cut - or even shut - services at very short notice. A related problem is that where grants are awarded annually, as the victims fund is, organisations are forced into an uncertain and time-consuming cycle of funding applications that take staff away from doing the work they are there to do.Another aspect threatening centres' survival, the minister was told, is their over-reliance on emergency, short-term funding from the victims fund due to a lack of reliable core funding either at central or local government level. Nicole Westmarland, chair of Rape Crisis England and Wales, says centres are "being passed from pillar to post", with ministers insisting that core funding is down to local authorities when the reality is that councils, on the whole, do not accept that it is their duty to provide it."The government's response to the situation has been that the victims fund was not designed to replace core local funding, but the reality is that there is very little core funding available to these groups and the victims fund money is absolutely vital to their survival," Etherington wrote in the letter.According to the organisation, this problem lies in part with the fact that rape crisis centres frequently straddle more than one borough (there are just two centres covering the 33 London boroughs, for example), which means individual councils do not take responsibility for funding. In addition, NCVO argues, because councils have no centrally directed targets to meet on services provided by rape crisis centres, there is little incentive to plough in cash to them.Whatever or whoever is to blame, it is the victims and the people working with them who are losing out.There were 84 rape crisis centres in England and Wales in 1985. Today, there are 32, despite there being no evidence that assaults have dramatically declined. Meanwhile, only 18% of people who use crisis centre services report a rape to the police, rendering the extra resources pumped into the criminal justice arm of victim support useless for 82% of victims.Sustainable frontline services are essential in supporting victims but they need to be funded effectively - and soon, before more centres disappear.· Mary O'Hara is a Society staff writer· Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.
