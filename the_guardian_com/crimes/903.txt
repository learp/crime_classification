Sion Jenkins today said he would not appeal against a decision to refuse him compensation for the six years he spent in prison before being cleared of murdering his foster daughter, Billie-Jo.Jenkins – who was convicted in 1998 of murdering the 13-year-old – has written a book about the case, in which he claims to have uncovered information about a possible suspect.His conviction was declared unsafe on appeal in 2004. Two subsequent retrials ended with juries failing to reach a verdict, and the former teacher was eventually cleared in 2006.Details of the Ministry of Justice's rejection of the reported £500,000 claim for his time in prison emerged this week. In an interview with the Press Association, Jenkins said he had not given the refusal "a second's thought"."I'm not appealing the decision because it's not important," he added. "The most important thing for me is that the investigation doesn't die and that Sussex police continue to look for leads."Billie-Jo was found in a pool of blood. She had suffered head injuries inflicted with a metal tent peg on the patio of the family's home in Hastings, Sussex, on 15 February 1997.Jenkins, at the time the headteacher designate of the William Parker boys' school in Hastings, maintained his innocence and insisted Billie-Jo must have been killed by an intruder while he visited a DIY store.He said he believed receiving compensation would not have convinced people he was innocent of murdering his foster daughter "because of their own prejudices". Despite playing down the rejection, he described it as "bizarre" that people could be locked up for years and then not receive any compensation.Referring to the MoJ statement which said the appeal court had made it clear compensation should be paid when someone had been shown to be "clearly innocent", Jenkins said the ministry had effectively "put another demand on any miscarriage" to prove innocence as opposed to the traditional burden on the prosecution of proving guilt.After the killing his ex-wife Lois emigrated to Tasmania with their four daughters, who chose to have no contact with their father."The hardest thing to accept is that Billie isn't alive any more and that I have lost a child, and in losing her there are so many other things," Jenkins said."The years I spent in prison paled into insignificance when I think of the loss of her life. Nothing compares."Jenkins, who is studying for a doctorate at the University of Portsmouth, said he was still hopeful that Billie-Jo's killer could be caught.In his book, the Murder of Billie-Jo, he said he had identified a possible new suspect.Jenkins said he spoke to someone he thought was a dark-haired, plain clothed police officer in his hallway in the confused hour after Billie-Jo was found dead."I don't know who that person was, so that's another lead and there are other leads that I think should be looked at," Jenkins said."I don't want avenues closed down. It's hard enough trying to solve a crime 13 or 14 years after the event without closing down particular leads."Sussex police have said the Billie-Jo murder case remains "unresolved", but they continue to actively pursue any new lines of inquiry that emerge.
