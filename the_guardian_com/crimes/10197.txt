It implies that evidence induced by a police officer, offering greater financial gain for the required evidence, should be admissible at trial. The family was let down by the officer who sought to obtain evidence at any cost. The proposals of the government in the new criminal justice bill to remove rights to jury trial, allow hearsay and admit previous convictions will certainly please other police officers who do not obtain evidence properly. To help victims the pressure should be kept on obtaining proper evidence, not on removing civil rights so that improper police tactics become accepted.

Coincidentally, when the two separate reports into the Damilola Taylor murder investigation became public, we learned that the home secretary, David Blunkett, was recovering from a scheduled operation. It would appear that timing is an essential requirement for any would-be home secretary.Adam JonesLondon
