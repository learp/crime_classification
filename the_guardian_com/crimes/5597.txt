A team of criminologists at Birmingham City University has published the first study into the grim phenomenon of "family annihilation", when fathers murder their own children. Academics studied 59 men who, between 1980 and 2012, had murdered their children – and sometimes their spouses – during a single killing event, with most cases coming in the later half of the study.Attempting to understand what precipitated "family annihilators", they looked for patterns such as the methods used, victim characteristics, possible motivation, offender age, occupation and location of murders.The research, published by the Howard Journal of Criminal Justice, found that the average age of a male family annihilator was 38.5 years, and that most culprits were employed, including policemen or soldiers, and were not previously known to the criminal justice system. The most common time for a man to murder his children was a Sunday in August.The most recent identified case emerged in May, when Julian Stevenson, 48, was charged with slitting the throats of his two children in France on his first access visit since he split from his French wife.Professor David Wilson, who led the team of criminologists, said the increasing instances of the crime were a reflection of "masculinity in crisis". He said: "Some men are unable to come to terms with different and developing notions of the institution of the family, where women increasingly play a much more dynamic role than they had in the past."
