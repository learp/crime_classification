The drummer of the band N-Dubz has been convicted of sexually assaulting two women.Aaron Fagan, 25, from London, will be sentenced next month after being found guilty of groping the women at Strathclyde University students' union last October. He was placed on the sex offenders register by Sheriff Joanna Johnston at Glasgow sheriff court.Fagan claimed he had been racially discriminated against "by a white jury".N-Dubz had been performing at the students' union in Glasgow on 1 October last year, a day after the Mobo awards, where they won best album and best UK act, the court heard.One of Fagan's victims alleged he approached her and asked if she wanted to attend an after-party. She said he put his hand on her bottom and started "grabbing at it", before touching her breasts, the court heard. He also hit her friend on the bottom, the 20-year-old told the court.The women, who cannot be named, told Fagan they were not going to the party and left, the trial heard. After they alerted a bouncer, the police were called and Fagan was arrested at the union.The musician said in his testimony that he was like "honey to a swarm of bees" for female fans, and accused the women of lying.As he left the dock following the verdict, Fagan shouted: "This wasn't justice today."Outside court he said: "I'm a black man and I have been tried by a white jury. It's pretty clear what happened in that court and it's the opposite of justice. Tell me how many people could have been convicted for squeezing a girl's arse, nearly every guy could be up for that."
