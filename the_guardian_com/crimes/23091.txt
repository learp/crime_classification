Defendants accused of sex offences may be granted anonymity if MPs recommend the change, home office minister Hilary Benn said today.Appearing before the cross-party home affairs select committee, Mr Benn said he appreciated that people's reputations could be ruined by allegations of rape or child sex abuse which later proved unfounded. Asked by Ann Widdecombe whether the solution would be to offer anonymity between the accusation being made and the suspect being charged by police, he replied: "If you make that recommendation we will look at it."Ms Widdecombe said there had been several recent cases where a suspect's identity had been "widely bandied about in the press".The example of Matthew Kelly was cited. The TV presenter faced allegations earlier this year that he abused young boys 20 years ago, he was subsequently not charged.Mr Benn said that in theory a suspect should not be named by police until they had been charged. "Clearly this should not happen but we know that it does," he added.Labour MP David Winnick asked: "If names are mentioned to the press where no charges are made one can only reasonably come to the view that individual police officers acted to notify the media for gain.""That would probably be a reasonable assumption to make in the circumstances," Mr Benn replied. "It may not be the only one but clearly it should not happen."There were significant advantages to a defendant not having full anonymity until the end of a case, as currently applies to victims, he added."If someone is charged and identified it may enable other people who have information to come forward," said Mr Benn."I think that is quite a strong arrangement."
