The assertion by Richard Stallman (Letters, 20 January) that "copyright theft" is a "legal absurdity" is pernicious nonsense. Ever since the Statute of Anne in 1710 established the world's first copyright law in this country, literature, music, art and the other products of the brain expressed in concrete form have been seen as real property as much as goods and chattels. After all, money, in the form of bits of metal, paper and plastic, is equally just "abstractions" in Mr Stallman's terms. Presumably he sanctions its theft since in his terms it doesn't really exist. It is this kind of doublethink that allows copyright pirates to steal in real terms the intellectual property of authors, musicians, artists and other creative people to which they have no right. Copyright is the essential bulwark against the prostitution of culture.Professor Iain StevensonUniversity College Londonâ€¢ The Theft Act of 1968 states clearly: "'Property' includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property."Paul TurnerBelfast
