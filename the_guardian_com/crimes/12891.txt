Thai police in the resort town of Pattaya said yesterday they had arrested a 19-year-old man who allegedly raped a woman from Liverpool after offering her a ride on his motorbike.The attack happened less than two weeks after two fishermen raped and murdered the Welsh backpacker Katherine Horton, 21, on Koh Samui. They are due to be sentenced tomorrow.Major Apimuk Amnartmankong of the Pattaya police told the Associated Press that detectives had charged Phiphatphong Raksinlapa after the 29-year-old tourist identified him as her attacker. He then allegedly confessed.Major Apimuk said the suspect offered the woman a lift on his motorbike at about 11pm on Saturday.But instead of taking her home he allegedly took her to a secluded thicket and raped her.The newspaper Thairat reported that the victim went to see a Thai friend and they then went to report the rape to the police. Police told the newspaper the woman had been on holiday.It is unclear what fate awaits Ms Horton's murderers. The prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, has said they should be executed, but they may escape because they confessed.Ms Horton's mother, Elizabeth, told the BBC on Sunday that she thought they should be imprisoned for life rather than executed.
