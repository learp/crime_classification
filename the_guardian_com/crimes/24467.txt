A convicted child rapist and killer kidnapped, drugged and murdered an 18-year-old hitch-hiker 18 years ago, before burying her in his back garden, a court heard.Peter Tobin, 62, who is already serving life for the rape and murder of 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton in February 1991, is charged with killing Dinah McNicol, who was last seen in August of the same year while hitch-hiking home from a music festival. He denies the charge.The bodies of the two teenagers were found buried just feet from one another in the back garden of 50 Irvine Drive, in Margate, Kent, where Tobin was living at the time of McNicol's disappearance, Chelmsford crown court was told.A jury of seven women and five men heard graphic details of the condition in which McNicol's body was found in November 2007. Her wrists and ankles had been bound with her own headscarf and leggings, and she was wrapped in green and black bin bags which were sealed with black tape. Tests showed she had been drugged with the sedative Amitriptyline.William Clegg, QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Tobin had also been convicted in 1994 for raping a 14-year-old girl and indecently assaulting another. Both girls had been drugged with the same sedative, he said, and traces of it had also been found in Hamilton's body, which had also been wrapped in bin bags after being severed at the waist.The previous convictions were relevant because they demonstrated Tobin's propensity to kidnap, drug with Amitriptyline and rape young girls, he told the jury, and in Hamilton's case, to "murder them and bury them in rubbish sacks"."There cannot be many people in this world who share this propensity," he added.He said the jury would hear evidence that Tobin had been prescribed Amitriptyline, and had been using it in the period before McNicol's disappearance.His fingerprints had been found on the dustbin bags in which her body was wrapped, he said.Tobin's neighbour in Irvine Drive had even seen him digging the hole in which he later would bury the 18-year-old, Clegg said. "Having seen how deep the hole was he actually joked to the defendant that he was digging to Australia."Tobin sat impassively in court with his head bowed behind a screen, listening to the proceedings through headphones. A few feet away, McNicol's 70-year-old father, Ian, her sister Laura Hollands, 44, and her brother Daniel, 44, held hands as the evidence was outlined.McNicol was last seen on 5 August 1991, when she left a music festival in Liphook, Hampshire, to hitch-hike to her home near Chelmsford with David Tremlett, a man she had met at the festival.They accepted a lift from a man who dropped Tremlett off first at Junction 8 of the M25, Clegg said, leaving McNicol alone in the front seat with the driver."No one Dinah knew ever saw or heard from her again," said Clegg. "It is the case of the crown that she was abducted by the driver of that car. We will seek to prove that the driver was in fact this defendant."He told the court that in August 1991 Tobin had had an arrangement with his then estranged wife, Cathy Wilson, where he would travel to Portsmouth, where she lived, on a Friday to collect their young son Daniel, and return on Monday to drop him off after spending the weekend with him in Margate. Tobin's return journey would have brought him past the spot where Tremlett and McNicol were picked up, Clegg said.The jury was told that when she turned 18, two months before she vanished, McNicol had been awarded Â£2,740 as compensation for the death of her mother, Judith, in a car accident in 1980, and that she had agreed with her father to use the money carefully for her education or for travel.In the days following her disappearance, large sums of money were withdrawn from the account on successive days, however, until only a few hundred pounds remained.The first withdrawal was in Margate, "just a short distance from where this defendant then lived," Clegg told the court. Other withdrawals were from banks in Ramsgate, which is near Margate; in Brighton, where Tobin had previously lived on and off over a period of 20 years; and in Portsmouth, where he went to see his son.A "hugely independent and free-spirited" young woman, McNicol had frequently stayed with her sisters or friends without informing her father, the court heard. When she did not get in touch to discover her A level results he became alarmed, however, and contacted the police after discovering the money was missing. The case continues.
