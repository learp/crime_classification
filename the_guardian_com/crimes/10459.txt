Rebecca Leighton, the nurse accused of offences relating to the deaths of hospital patients, has been released from prison after all charges were dropped.Leighton, 27, who was arrested in July after unexplained deaths at Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, had been charged in connection with contaminating bags of saline with insulin and faced charges of criminal damage with intent to endanger life. She has always denied any wrongdoing.Crucially, the complex Greater Manchester police investigation continues with other lines of inquiry. The Crown Prosecution Service announced her release from Styal prison in Cheshire. It said prosecution could be restarted if further evidence was presented.Leighton said on Friday night in a statement read by her lawyer, Carl Richmond: "I have been living in hell and was locked up in prison for something I had not done."Thanking those who had supported her, she added: "It was so frustrating for me, knowing that the person who has actually carried out these terrible acts is still out there. My life has been turned upside down. All I ever wanted to do was to pursue a profession in nursing and to care for my patients."I think it is unbelievable that anyone in the medical profession would ever put patients' lives at risk."The investigation centred on bags of saline solution that were sabotaged with insulin and initially focused on five deaths, but police later said the deaths of two of those patients – Vera Pearson, 84, and George Keep, 84, both from Cheadle – were no longer part of their inquiry.They are still examining the suspicious deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Alfred Weaver, 83, who all died at Stepping Hill.The police were called in after an experienced nurse noticed a sudden and inexplicable drop in patients' blood sugar levels.Nazir Afzal, the chief crown prosecutor for the north-west, said: "Rebecca Leighton was charged on the basis that there was a reasonable suspicion she had committed the offences and there were reasonable grounds for believing the continuing investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable amount of time. When we make a decision on this basis it would be wrong of us to keep a suspect in custody indefinitely without keeping a very close eye on what evidence is emerging and whether objections to bail can be justified."He said the inquiries had not so far provided a case that would meet the test that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.He said a review of the case with senior police officers and counsel found that there was not a case in law to proceed on the evidence available and that charges should be discontinued."There is the prospect that further evidence might emerge. The law does allow us to reinstate charges in those circumstances, particularly where the allegations are serious," he said.Leighton also faced a charge of theft of medication belonging to the hospital and this too was discontinued.Leighton has continuously protested her innocence in interviews since her arrest, and those who know her portray a hard-working, cheerful and polite young woman who enjoyed nights out with her friends but found night shifts difficult.She followed her mother, Lynda, into nursing after taking an Open University degree. Her mother is a manager responsible for nurse training at Stepping Hill.The Nursing and Midwifery Council had begun proceedings to suspend Leighton's registration. It is not clear if those proceedings will continue following her release.In a statement, the NMC said the interim order would "remain in place at present".Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney, of Greater Manchester police, said: "Our thoughts continue to be with the families of those whose deaths are being investigated and I want to say that their search for answers is matched only by our desire to provide them."This investigation is one of the most complex investigations that our most senior detectives have ever worked on, comparable in size and scope to the Manchester bomb inquiry. We cannot rule out making other arrests," he added.He said there were 40 potential victims, and two cases where there was "a high probability that the deaths were caused by contaminated products". Police had already interviewed 200 of the 700 staff, visitors and patients who had access to the area concerned.He added: "We need a long period of time to complete this investigation and eliminate those who were not involved and it is only right in these circumstances to discontinue the case until we can deal with these issues." He said no stone would be left unturned as part of the investigation.
