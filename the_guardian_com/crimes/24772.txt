A judge today questioned a decision by prosecutors not to pursue a murder charge against a mother who left her three-year-old daughter to die from malnutrition in her bedroom.Tiffany Wright died in "squalor, filth and degradation" last year, when she was "entirely neglected" by her parents at the pub they ran in Sheffield.Her mother, Sabrina Hirst, 22, did not find her body until two days after her death.Hirst was jailed today for 12 years after admitting manslaughter. Her husband, Robert Hirst, 44, was jailed for five years after admitting child cruelty.The Recorder of Sheffield, Judge Alan Goldsack QC, expressed his surprise that the Crown Prosecution Service accepted her guilty plea to manslaughter when she was initially charged with murder.The judge described the case as "about as bad a case of child manslaughter as there can be". He said had she been convicted of murder, he could have sentenced Tiffany's mother to 22 years imprisonment.Sheffield social services said a serious case review was under way to find out what lessons needed to be learnt.Sheffield crown court heard that the circumstances of Tiffany's death were "truly appalling". The judge was told how the little girl's body was found decomposing by police in a beetle-infested room at the Scarbrough Arms, in Upperthorpe, Sheffield, in September last year.A pathologist said she had been dead for between two and three days and tests showed she had not eaten or drunk anything for at least 20 hours, probably more.The court heard Tiffany died from bronchial pneumonia, which was a direct result of malnutrition.Opening the case, Jeremy Richardson QC told the judge Tiffany died because she "simply had not been fed or given fluids".CCTV film found in the pub showed Sabrina Hirst carrying on working in the bar in the days before her daughter's death. At one point she is heard talking on the phone showing concern about whether her dogs had been fed.Even Sabrina Hirst's own barrister admitted his client's version of events was that she last checked on her poorly daughter at 7am on the Friday, before she found her body in the early hours of Sunday, September 30.An analysis of her bones showed she had been subjected to intermittent malnutrition for a prolonged period of time.Richardson explained how the family lived above the pub where Tiffany was brought up in "circumstances of abject squalor and degradation".He said the couple would regularly go out leaving the little girl with no supervision in a flat which was covered in dog faeces and had bare electrical cables exposed from wall sockets. He said the couple "entirely neglected" their daughter.She was often "never fed properly, if at all" and lived in "squalor, filth and degradation". The prosecutor added that the squalor "almost defies description for any human being to live in".The court heard Robert Hirst, who became involved with his wife in 2004 and married her in 2006, initially wanted to formally adopt Tiffany but later seemed to become more detached from her.One witness said she saw him shout at the three-year-old: "You little bitch. Eat your fucking food."The court heard how the pub's CCTV caught him talking to his sobbing wife after they had found Tiffany in her room and before the police arrived.He was heard to say: "We've fucked it all up" and "we're going to get banged up for this".The court heard how Tiffany was about one and half stone (9kg) at the time of her death, and was 3ft 4ins tall.She had put on less than a kilo in weight in the last two years of her life. The couple had also admitted child cruelty in relation to a one-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons.Sabrina Hirst sobbed almost continuously throughout the three-hour hearing today but her husband showed no emotion in the dock.Judge Goldsack told them: "Most members of the public, particularly parents, will find it impossible to understand how you could treat your children in this way.The couple left Tiffany and a one-year-old boy often unattended and locked in the living quarters, he said, against orders from social services."One almost unbelievable piece of evidence is that on what was probably Tiffany's last day alive you, Sabrina Hirst, were discussing on the phone concerns you had about one of your dogs' weight and feeding problems."The judge concluded: "In my judgment all those factors make this about as bad a case of child manslaughter as there can be."Alan Jones, chairman of the Sheffield Safeguarding Children Board, said a serious case review had been launched to look at what lessons needed to be learnt.He said he was "saddened" that Tiffany "did not benefit from the support services available to Sheffield children". "The details of the court case and the severity of the sentences on the parents indicate that this case of neglect is exceptional and particularly shocking."We always try to take effective action when a child is thought to be at risk. It is particularly difficult for staff to do this when the harm by parents is deliberate and they are evasive, untruthful and manipulative."A South Yorkshire Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said a statement would be issued next week about why the murder charge against Sabrina Hirst was dropped.
