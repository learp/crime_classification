Downing Street yesterday backed the home secretary, John Reid, in his row with the attorney general over the sentence passed on a convicted paedophile who kidnapped and sexually assaulted a three-year-old girl.The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, was said to have considered Mr Reid's intervention "not helpful" and warned it might jeopardise the case as the move would be seen by the courts as political pressure on an impartial legal figure.The case is expected to accelerate a review, chaired by the lord chief justice, of the sentencing rules that permit judges to give a discount of up to one third in sentencing offenders who plead guilty at an early stage. It is expected to say that in cases where the prosecution evidence is overwhelming or the defendant was caught red-handed the discount should be cut.Lord Goldsmith now has 28 days to decide whether to ask the appeal court to rule whether the minimum tariff of the life sentence passed on Craig Sweeney, 24, for the kidnap and sexual assault of a three-year-old girl from Cardiff is "unduly lenient" and should be increased. The judge in Sweeney's case is believed to have set a minimum term of five years and 108 days before his first opportunity to be considered for parole, partly as a result of a 30% discount for his early guilty plea and expression of remorse.New Home Office figures showing that 53 prisoners sentenced to life since 2000 have already been released on licence yesterday fuelled concern over the minimum tariffs being set by the courts. But recent prison service figures show that the average time spent in prison by mandatory lifers is now 14 years - far higher than a decade ago.The attorney general's office yesterday confirmed that Lord Goldsmith has called for the file in the case: "The attorney will make a decision purely on the merits of the case and not in response to political or public pressure. Calling for the file in no way implies that there will be a reference by the attorney. Still less does it imply any criticism of the sentencing judge."Mr Reid stirred the row on Monday when he wrote to Lord Goldsmith urging him to refer the Sweeney case to the appeal court for being an "unduly lenient" sentence, claiming the tariff did not reflect the seriousness of the crime.A former Labour attorney general, Lord Morris of Aberavon QC, said he would have been extremely annoyed by Mr Reid's intervention: "One forgets of course that the guilty man will be represented by counsel in the court of appeal. He will make the point he can't get a fair hearing," he told the BBC.The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, accused the home secretary of rank hypocrisy in blaming judges for sentences which were a consequence of legislation introduced by this government. "It is bad enough that John Reid gives himself the right to second guess a sentence within hours of it being passed, but it is also extremely cynical when he must know that the possible deductions in Mr Sweeney's custodial sentence results from legislation which only came into effect in April last year."But Downing Street defended the home secretary's intervention, saying that Mr Reid was "rightly articulating the public concern that there was a disconnect between the public's view of the offences and the sentences that were being handed out to deal with the offence".Stephen Hockman QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said he doubted the attorney general would be affected by Mr Reid's intervention. "Politicians are entitled to speak out on legal matters that concern them, though of course it is probably quite important that they should choose their words with care."I doubt that the attorney general is bothered by what John Reid said."
