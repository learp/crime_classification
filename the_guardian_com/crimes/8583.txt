The prison population has hit a record 85,000 after Labour's decision to end the 18-day early release scheme just before the election campaign got under way.The figure for the jail population in England and Wales, published today, stands at 85,706.That is a rise of 192 in the last week and of more than 1,000 over the last six weeks, when the decision to end the early release scheme was announced. The last prisoner released under the scheme left jail 18 days early on 9 April.The emergency early release scheme, known as end of custody licence, was designed to relieve pressure on prisons and applied only to low-risk inmates serving sentences of less than four years.When the justice secretary, Jack Straw, announced the end of the scheme he expected it would add about 1,200 to the prison population. He claimed the decision had been taken only because there was sufficient capacity in the short term and long term to cope with the rising prison population.The total useable operational capacity of the 140 prisons in England and Wales is 87,196, giving prison service managers headroom of 2,000 places. No prisoners are being held under an emergency reserve scheme to use police cells.Still, there are now 21 prisons each holding more than 1,000 inmates, with Wandsworth in south-west London the most populated: it has 1,627 within its Victorian walls.The Labour government has embarked on the biggest prison building programme in western Europe, aiming to take the number of places in the system to 96,000 by 2014.The £4.2bn programme includes five supersized jails of 1,500 each, with the first planned for Essex.The latest figures show the prison population is not far off the "high scenario" contained in the last set of official projections, which set a figure of 85,700 by the end of June.The sudden decision to scrap the early release scheme meant Labour had adopted a key Conservative law and order policy on the eve of the election campaign.Frances Crook, the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said that having doubled since the mid-1990s, a new record had been reached with no end in sight to further record highs."This ceaseless growth in prison numbers is untenable and any new administration will have to bite the bullet and find a strategic way to reduce the prison population," she said."Recent statistics show that 36.8% reoffended on community sentences in 2008, compared with more than 61% for those sentenced to a year or less in prison. Not only are community sentences more effective at reducing crime but they come at a fraction of the price, with a community order costing on average £2,000-£3,000 a year, compared with at least £41,000 a year to run a prison place."
