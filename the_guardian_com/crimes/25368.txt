All children could be required to take a test to find out if they are a risk of becoming criminals, new government proposals unveiled today say.The government plans to "establish universal checks throughout a child's development to help service providers to identify those most at risk of offending," the report says.It adds that the checks could "piggyback on existing contact points such as transition to secondary schools".So far, it is unclear what form such tests could take or whether they would involve police or probation officers, a personal interview with the child or a review of school and police records."Today's government crime review appears to add over a hundred pages of platitude to ten years of legislative overkill," Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said."Who, for example, can disagree with the idea of 'early intervention'? But are we talking about supporting and educating young people or bar-coding babies at birth?"Neera Sharma, the principal policy officer at the chuildren's charity Barnardos said: "If this means that parents might get early help and support, if it means that issues such as poor school attendance were to be addressed, this has the potential to reduce crime and keep young people out of trouble."But if a child is identified as at risk, is that family going to get the support it needs? The danger could be that they are labelled and they live up to the expectations of them. There is a risk of stigmatising the child."Other plans set out in the document include maximising the potential of hi-tech gadgets - businesses will be encouraged to make "crimeproof" products such as fingerprint-activated iPods, and the development of technology could lead to the introduction of crowd scanners able to detect bombs.The paper also suggests that immigrants entering Britain temporarily could be asked to take out "adequate health insurance" rather than being allowed to use the NHS.Courts may be forced to publish efficiency data, with badly-performing courts facing measures to improve.The policy review also recommends tougher community sentences and the removal of assets and driving licences as an alternative to sending convicted offenders to already overcrowded jails.Other plans include keeping prisoners in contact with their children, more therapy and less reliance on drugs to treat mentally ill offenders.The lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, this morning denied the shift in policy on sentencing was a recognition that the government had "got it wrong" on crime since 1997."It's not that we want less people in prison or we want more people in prison," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. "What the vital drive has got to be is the public and protecting them."Tony Blair announced a review of the prison service, led by the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Sir Ronnie Flannagan, who will attempt to find ways of cutting red tape, boosting neighbourhood policing and managing resources more effectively.Mr Blair also announced the creation of new prolific offender licences in order to limit the movements of people when they leave prison and preventing them from mixing with former associates.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the review was "recognition of the abject failure of criminal justice policy in the last 10 years"."This rag bag of ill-thought through ideas is likely to go the same way as government proposals for cashpoint fines for yobs and night courts," he added.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: "If the reports of a real change of heart in the government's approach to crime are true, this is a welcome U-turn."We have been warning for years that New Labour's obsessive pursuit of headlines, over-reliance on ever-more illiberal legislation and fanatical 'get tough' rhetoric do little to tackle either the fear of crime or its root causes."Richard Garside, the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College London, said: "There is an element of 'here's one I made earlier' about these latest plans."The government has spent 10 years reforming the criminal justice process and ratcheting up criminal justice expenditure to record level."But there is a lack of fresh and genuinely original thinking that takes seriously the fact that the problem of crime is deeply rooted in social, economic and political structures."
