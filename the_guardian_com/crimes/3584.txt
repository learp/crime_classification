This little piggy went to market, this little piggy stayed at home and this little piggy plus 729 friends and relations were kidnapped by rustlers in Wigan.The pigs, aged between three weeks and three months, were snaffled from a farm late on Friday or early on Saturday. The presumption is that they were loaded into a three-decker animal transporter wagon rather than being herded down the M6. Yesterday police in Greater Manchester estimated that it would have taken more than six hours to load them. But no one seems to have heard a squeal in the raid in which the little ones were grabbed from heated fibreglass modules and their older colleagues from a finishing house. The haul could be worth up to £40,000. "When I got to the farm, there were a few pigs running round in the yard," said David Bowling, a tenant of Standish Hall farm. "We keep everything secured and so realised we had had visitors - and we already knew we had been staked out the previous Monday. "My guess is that the pigs will be in the south-east, integrated on to a large farm with falsified documents." The motive appears to be a rise in prices. The Wigan porkers will be worth about £80 each when they are ready for slaughter at 22 weeks. Mr Bowling hopes the loss will be covered by insurance. If it is, he and his wife, son and daughter, will say goodbye to pigs and Wigan and head for Australia.
