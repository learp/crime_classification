One of Britain's most notorious criminals was today revealed as the alleged ringleader of a gang accused of plotting to smuggle £1m of cannabis into Jersey.Curtis Warren, 46, is the only drugs trafficker to ever make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List, and was once Interpol's most wanted man, the jury at the royal court in St Helier heard.Warren and five other men all deny plotting to import 180kg of cannabis – which has a street value in Jersey of £1m, significantly higher than in the UK.Undercover police officers followed the gang, bugging their cars and tapping their phones for a number of months before they were all arrested in July 2007.Warren's criminal past was disclosed today as his counsel, advocate Stephen Baker, cross-examined the Jersey police officer in charge of the case.Just weeks before the Jersey plot is alleged to have begun in the summer of 2007, Warren was released from a Dutch prison where he had served 10 years of a sentence for drug trafficking and firearms offences and manslaughter, the court heard.The jury heard that Warren had been convicted of importing 400kg of cocaine, 60kg of heroin, 1,500kg of cannabis and 50kg of ecstasy. He left prison on 14 June 2007 and was arrested at his girlfriend's house in St Helier on 21 July.While in jail in Holland, Warren killed a fellow prisoner and added the manslaughter conviction to his lengthy criminal record, the court heard.Warren walked free from another trial at Newcastle crown court in 1993, when he was accused of smuggling 1,000kg of cocaine into the UK, hidden inside lead ingots, Baker told the court.That trial was stopped when it was revealed that a close associate, Brian Charrington, was an informant for UK customs.Warren's criminal past was disclosed as his counsel sought to discover whether one of the men involved in the Jersey plot was in fact a police informant.Mohammed Liazid, a Moroccan living in Holland, is accused by the crown of providing the cannabis which Warren and his alleged gang plotted to bring to Jersey via boat from France.Liazid was secretly taped discussing the alleged deal with Jonathan Welsh, one of Warren's co-accused, referred to by the crown as Warren's "right-hand man".But Liazid has not been arrested. Baker suggested no attempts had been made to arrest him and asked whether he could be an informer for either the Dutch or Jersey authorities.During cross-examination, Detective Sergeant Paul Kennea, the Jersey police officer in charge of the case, said he had no knowledge that Liazid was an informant, and said that the police had no idea of his whereabouts.The jury was told today that much of the evidence against the gang was obtained through covert surveillance of Warren and others by police in Jersey, Britain and Holland.Baker asked Kennea whether had he known who Warren was prior to the defendant's arrival in Jersey in June 2007.Kennea described Warren as "just another man".Baker continued: "There must have been great excitement that day in the drugs squad, you were getting the chance to observe Curtis Warren. Every drugs squad officer in the country and the UK knows who Curtis Warren is."The officer said: "Most of the [surveillance] team were not drug squad officers and had not heard of him."Referring to a best-selling unauthorised biography about Warren's criminal career, Baker said to the officer: "You must have read the book, it's available in shops and airports in Jersey and all over the UK."Kennea replied: "About 10 years ago on the beach, yes."Baker said: "Warren is a man who, by reputation, is a drug dealer of substantial wealth and influence, isn't he?"The drugs squad officer said: "To me, that day, he was a job."The case continues.
