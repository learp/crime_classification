Merseyside police found the player had 61 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.His year-long driving disqualification could be reduced by three months if he completes a course before 7 October.A collection order for payment was made and Pienaar was ordered to pay a total of £100 in costs to cover both the charges brought against him, the court official said.He arrived at the Merseyside club on loan in the summer of 2007, and his move from Borussia Dortmund was later made permanent when Everton paid £2m for him.Everton Football Club declined to comment.
