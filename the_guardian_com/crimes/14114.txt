Three men have been arrested after the murder of a woman who was shot as she held a baby at a christening party.The woman, a mother in her 30s originally from Sierra Leone, was shot in the head and died an hour after the attack at a community hall on the Wood Dene estate in Peckham at 10pm on Saturday.The child, believed to be between six months and a year old, escaped unharmed.The men were arrested last night by officers from Operation Trident, the Scotland Yard unit which investigates gun crime within the black community.The shooting took place at what police described as a "christening-style event", involving about 100 people. A gang of three men in hooded tops are understood to have burst into the hall and opened fire on the guests inside.Bullets were sprayed across the hall from a number of weapons, but no one else was injured in the incident. The gang stole guests' handbags, mobile phones and wine before fleeing on foot.The investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Ashley Sharp, said: "This was an outrageous intrusion into a family celebration."People were obviously shocked and panicked. We believe three men wearing hoodies entered the centre, and were involved in this incident. We are also trying to trace a number of firearms."One witness said many local people had been invited to the event. "The atmosphere had actually been really good until that point, with everyone just chilling out outside," said Stacey, 25, who did not want to give her surname.Police have seized CCTV footage from the estate and forensic teams conducted searches of the scene.Mr Sharp said the victim was not related to the child and detectives were not sure whether she was the intended target of her killers or had been caught in the crossfire."It is too early at this stage to be sure as to even whether this was the intended victim," he said."We have no indication that the victim knew them."A postmortem examination carried out yesterday concluded that the woman, who did not live in Peckham, died from a single gun shot to the head.Vicky Idiegbe, from the Wood Dene Project Community Group, said: "We've been fighting the council to make changes for a long time ... the lights don't work, and everything is hidden behind trees."There is no police presence at all. It's got to the point now where at night I just lock myself in the flat and am too terrified to go out."Police are appealing for information and said they were "keeping an open mind" as to the motive behind the shooting.
