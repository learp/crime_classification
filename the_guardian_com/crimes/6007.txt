Last year was the worst on record for metal thefts from churches, according to insurance figures. More than 2,500 claims were made to the main Church of England insurer, passing the previous record of more than 2,400 in 2008.Chelmsford diocese in Essex was worst hit, according to Ecclesiastical, with more than 90 claims for metal theft from churches in the area. Lincoln and Lichfield in the Midlands were second and third, with both making more than 80 claims after lead was stolen from church roofs. The diocese of London and the Nottinghamshire diocese of Southwell were fourth and fifth respectively.Although last year saw the highest number of claims, the value of claims has been higher in previous years, Ecclesiastical said.A survey carried out for the insurer indicated strong support from the public for a toughening up of the legislation on metal theft, with 67% of UK adults in favour of changes to the law to make it harder for criminals to sell stolen lead and other metals to scrap dealers, while 18% of adults said metal theft had suffered a direct impact on their employment or personal lives in terms of its effect on transport, energy networks and farming since 2007.John Coates, Ecclesiastical's direct insurance services director, said: "2011 has been a very tough year, with incidents of metal theft from churches becoming virtually endemic. If there is any light at the end of the tunnel, it's the groundswell of public awareness of the problem this year and the growing sense of outrage."Our survey shows that the public does not want this state of affairs to continue and will support action to crack down on metal thieves and the methods they use to gain money for their stolen goods. We believe it's important that the government takes note of this mood and takes immediate action to tighten up the law."
