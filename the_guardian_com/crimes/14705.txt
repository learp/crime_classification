Police yesterday carried out a series of raids on a suspected immigration racket, thought to have raked in millions of pounds for its perpetrators who detectives believe provided more than 1,000 fake student visas for South Africans.More than 120 officers swooped at dawn on 13 addresses in south and east London and Essex, arresting 20 people.Operation Taming, the biggest of its kind carried out by Scotland Yard, was the result of 13 months' undercover work by detectives from the Maxim team, set up last year to tackle serious crime linked to illegal immigrants.Police seized 12 men and eight women in 10 homes in Peckham, Anerley, and Mitcham in south London, and Westcliff-on-Sea and Gants Hill in Essex. Two allegedly bogus colleges in Tooting and an office in central London were also searched.Immigration officers and the London assets recovery team accompanied police on the operation, and computers, printing equipment, passports, and large sums of cash were also recovered from some of the premises.The London raids were coordinated with South African police activity in Durban, where at least one address was visited yesterday morning, although no one was arrested.The suspects, in custody at various London police stations, were being questioned about facilitating illegal entry and leave to remain in the UK, and money laundering.Detectives think applicants paid £400 or £500 each for counterfeit student visas, and were provided with cover stories about coming to London to attend bogus colleges, if questioned by the authorities.The visas were valid for between six months and three years, and could be extended on further payment. The police believe this particular scam has been going on for several years and provided visas for more than 1,000 illegal immigrants, mostly South African, both black and white.Detective Chief Superintendent Steven Kupis, who heads Maxim and was in charge of yesterday's operation, said illegal immigrants who entered the UK under such schemes would be deported if found, but added that they were also victims, as they had handed over cash for fake documents."They are losing not only their money but their right to be in this country," he said.But he warned: "The Met is completely committed to robust activity against organised immigration crime."We are targeting the 'Mr Bigs' who are making considerable amounts of money generating misery in London's new communities."We also want to send out a strong message that the 2002 Proceeds of Crime Act allows us to take your assets from you if you are involved in crime."The Home Office minister Des Browne said the government had stepped up efforts to prevent abuse of people posing as students with new measures to crack down on establishments masquerading as legitimate colleges.On April 22 the government announced that genuine colleges must register by the end of this year and foreign students would only be able to gain entry to study at an approved educational establishment."This will protect the vast majority of legitimate students who bring £3bn [a year] to our economy, while reducing the scope for abuse of legal immigration routes into the UK," Mr Browne said.
