The maximum sentence for carrying a knife in public could be increased to bring it more into line with that for a gun, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, suggested today.Debating the crime and home affairs sections of last week's Queens' speech, Mr Clarke said he would be prepared to consider longer sentences to tackle knife crime.He also hinted that a national knife amnesty could be part of the forthcoming legislation - announced in the programme last week - which will raise the minimum age for purchasing knives.In a debate with the shadow home secretary and frontrunner in the Conservative leadership contest, David Davis, Mr Clarke raised the example of the London borough of Enfield, which he said had had an "extremely successful" amnesty on knives."There is a case for it, but it needs to be introduced at the right time, led by the police in relation to the legislation that I am describing," he added.Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the maximum sentence for carrying a gun in public was seven years compared to only two for a knife. This gap should be closed, he said.Mr Clarke replied: "I am certainly prepared to consider proposals to that effect when we debate the bill."I don't think the knife is the same as a gun, but you are entirely correct to say that we need to look at the comparison between the two and see if they ought to be brought more in line."The government has already proposed raising the minimum age for buying knives from 16 to 18 and giving teachers the power to search pupils for weapons.Mr Clarke also taunted Mr Davis to back the government's plans for ID cards.In an olive branch to his own side, he offered to meet Labour MPs opposed to the legislation to discuss their concerns.He pointed out, however, that the Conservatives began by voting for the legislation at its second reading, before abstaining at the third reading and opposing the legislation as it ran out of time.And he urged Mr Davis, as a "potential statesman" - a reference to his possible Tory leadership bid - to give serious consideration to supporting the new bill."You raised five questions," he told Mr Davis. "Your tests, which were a fig-leaf to cover the retreats and shifts of the Conservative party on this legislation, were firstly that legislation must clearly define the purpose of the cards. I can tell you it does clearly define the purpose of the cards."Other tests of whether the technology was sufficiently well developed and the Home Office capable of delivering this major IT project were also now met, he said.Earlier today junior Home Office minister Hazel Blears sought to distance herself from suggestions that offenders doing community service could be made to wear US-style uniforms.She stressed in the Commons that visible justice was crucial and said local people should have some control over the type of community sentence carried out in their area.Although her suggestion in the Observer was later backed by Mr Clarke, today at question time, she sought to clear up any confusion.She told MPs: "Can I make it clear here once and for all, for the record, that I never suggested orange boiler suits should be worn."What I did say, and this I firmly believe, is that local people do want to have confidence in community sentences and they want to see that work is being done and that this is a tough option not a soft option."
