The father of Damilola Taylor today questioned whether the eight-year youth custody sentences handed to his son's killers would act as a deterrent.Standing by Damilola's mother, Gloria, Richard Taylor made the remarks outside the Old Bailey shortly after Danny Preddie, 18, and his brother Ricky, 19, were sentenced for the manslaughter of the 10-year-old schoolboy.Almost six years after Damilola was killed and at the end of a third trial, in which it emerged mistakes had been made in the collection of forensic evidence, Mr Taylor said: "From the outset this case has been a catalogue of failures."Failure by the system to keep young people in school and off the streets, failure to prevent them from committing crime, and failure by their mentors to give good direction, and failure by the authorities to catch them sooner."Mr Taylor told reporters: "Today's convictions will not bring back Damilola and we question whether these sentences will act as an appropriate deterrent to other potential criminals."With the spate of recent stabbings and shootings by young people for whom carrying weapons has become an accepted norm, we believe Damilola's murder reflects a crisis within our communities that is now out of control."Earlier, Mr Justice Goldring sentenced the brothers to eight years each in a young offenders' institute. He told the pair: "Neither of you showed any regret or remorse ... You both left the victim to die ... Neither of you called for help."The judge noted that there had been calls for longer sentences, but said: "I cannot sentence on the basis of an intention to kill or cause really serious injury. I have to sentence on the basis of the defendants' ages at the time of the offence."The Preddies were 12 and 13 at the time of the manslaughter.Mr Justice Goldring acknowledged that Damilola's parents, who he praised for conducting themselves with "such dignity", might feel that the sentences were "inadequate".Mr Taylor had said in a newspaper interview published today that he wanted the brothers to get a life term with a minimum tariff of 10 years - one for each year of Damilola's life. But the judge said he did not think life sentences were appropriate; he said he hoped the sentence would reflect the public concern about gangs bullying other children.The brothers were handcuffed to a prison officer and both of them made defiant gestures, raising their hands and crossing their wrists as they were led to the cells. One of their supporters in the public gallery shouted an obscene insult at the judge.The pair, who lived near Damilola on the North Peckham estate in south London, had denied killing Damilola by jabbing his leg with a broken beer bottle in November 2000, but they were convicted by a jury in August this year after a retrial.An earlier trial in April had cleared them of murder and assault with intent to rob, but could not agree on the charge of manslaughter.The exceptional decision for the pair to appear in the dock in handcuffs followed an outburst by Ricky when the brothers were convicted of manslaughter in August. He had to be restrained as, shouting and protesting his innocence, he threatened jurors and police.Nigerian-born Damilola had been in Britain only a few months when he fell victim to the two brothers as he was walking home from the local library after school. He bled to death in a stairwell of the estate as local workmen tried to save his life.A number of youths, including the Preddies, were arrested. Four were cleared in a trial in 2002. Hassan Jihad, 20, was cleared in April this year.The Preddies, who had a local reputation for violence, were not charged until last year, when forensic evidence missed earlier, in the form of tiny spots of blood and fibres, linked the pair to the killing.Today, before sentencing, Orlando Pownall QC, defending Danny Preddie, asked for mercy for his client, saying there had been no intention to kill or cause serious injury.Although he had spent only four months out of custody since he was 15, these other convictions could not be held against him in sentencing him for the 2000 manslaughter.Nigel Sweeney QC, defending Ricky Preddie, said: "There is nothing any of us can do to remedy the loss of Damilola Taylor or ease Mr and Mrs Taylor's pain. They have suffered with conspicuous dignity."Mr Sweeney said the judge had seen Ricky under intense pressure but others had seen a better side of him.Mr Justice Goldring sentenced the brothers to eight years' youth custody, minus time already spent in custody: 523 days for Ricky and 330 for Danny.
