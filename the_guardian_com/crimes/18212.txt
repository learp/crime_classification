Police have released a picture of a 15-year-old boy they want to question over the suspected murder of a teenager, believed to have been killed during an altercation over a stolen BlackBerry phone.The CCTV image, filmed on a bus on Sunday, is believed to be the last sighting of Dawda Jallow, from Peckham in south-east London. Detectives took the unusual step – given his age – of naming Jallow after Dogan Ismail, 17, also from Peckham, was fatally stabbed on Sunday.Ismail was killed on the Aylesbury estate in nearby Walworth after going there with his 15-year-old brother, Orhan. Officers said the brothers had gone to the estate to recover a BlackBerry phone stolen from Orhan on Friday.They encountered a group of four males and Ismail was fatally injured during an "altercation".In a statement released through the police, Ismail's family said: "Our beloved son, friend, cousin, nephew and grandson has been cruelly taken away from us."Words cannot describe how much we will miss him. We want justice for Dogan and his killer caught. Anyone with information, please tell the police."The image of Jallow shows him travelling on the number 35 bus between Camberwell Green and Newington Causeway just after 10.30pm on Sunday."If anyone knows him, if anyone knows where he has been staying, if anyone has any ideas that they should put him up for the night, I would urge them not to and call us instead," said Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner of the Metropolitan police, who is leading the investigation."He must be staying somewhere and so I am urging the community for their help in letting me know where that is."Jallow is described as black, clean-shaven with cropped black afro hair, 5ft 5in and stocky for his age. He is a Gambian national but speaks with a London accent.The incident happened just yards away from where 21-year-old Shaun Chambers, from Greenwich, was killed on 26 September. Police said there was no link between the two deaths.They also said they did not believe Ismail's stabbing was gang-related and stressed that neither Ismail nor his brother had any connection to gangs.A postmortem examination found that Ismail died of a single stab wound.A 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of perverting the course of justice but they were later bailed.
