The mother's voice trembles as she describes the night her 14-year-old son was sexually assaulted at the home of a referee he had befriended on a FA course.'He fled from the house at 4am wearing just his trainers, a fleece and his boxer shorts because the man had hidden his clothes. He called 999. It was terrible,' she says. 'It's a parent's worst nightmare and for my son it's a life sentence.'While the trauma endured by the mother and son from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, is, understandably, more extreme than the problems encountered by most youngsters involved in football, a report to be published this week by the government- backed Independent Football Commission reveals that all is not well in the country's national sport.The report, which sets out the results of an exhaustive 18-month study into the treatment of children in football, lists a succession of ways in which young people are vulnerable to abuse, ranging from bullying by coaches and over-aggressive parents, to the risk of grooming by paedophiles who target them after seeing their pictures in match programmes or even by masquerading as talent scouts.As the mother continues to talk about the suffering her teenage son endured at the hands of Michael Webb, a 47-year-old referee with the Berkshire and Buckinghamshire FA who was eventually sentenced to two years for the assault, the pain caused by the attack becomes increasingly apparent, as does her desire to ensure that no other family suffers a similar fate.'They met on a referee's course and he used his own son to befriend my son - that's how they got to know each other. I always thought that he was weird, but my son would say: "Mum, don't worry, he's a great man, he's a referee, he's very well regarded." So I was persuaded. You expect them to have paedophile stamped on their forehead, but of course they don't and he was very clever at grooming my son.'He was invited to stay with Webb and his son. Webb sent his boy to bed early then said my son should sleep on a spare bed in his room, but then my son woke up in the night to find Webb doing things to him. He was terribly depressed afterwards, turned to drink, dropped three of his GCSEs and hardly went back to school because he couldn't face it.'The anger in her voice cannot be disguised as she adds: 'Football seems such a reputable sport, but I think it needs to do much more to protect youngsters from these disgusting people.'Football's governing bodies insist, of course, and with some justification, that despite such cases, the vast majority of young people can continue to play for their local team or to visit their favourite professional club without fear or risk, as generations did before them; the number of incidents of abuse remains small when set against the millions who take part in football each week.Nevertheless, for some the findings will dredge up uncomfortable memories of the scandals that have tarnished the image of swimming - in which there have been several high-profile prosecutions of coaches - and other sports and expose what, it appears, may have been an unseen world of maltreatment and misconduct.Most immediately striking is the number of abuse investigations - something which has hitherto remained secret - while equally worrying is the report's warning that the current system, under which the FA and Premier League investigate incidents separately, is flawed and could allow individuals rejected by one organisation to work in the other.'The FA in 2005 had around 250 cases ongoing. The Premier League told the commission that it had had four cases since 2003, which it had commissioned an independent company to investigate. All were resolved; a further two were ongoing,' the report says.'But as a system for protecting children, the model is flawed. It is possible for someone to be rejected for work in football by the FA, but accepted by the Premier League. Children stand to be better protected if there is uniform case handling and confidence that, whichever body is deciding who is appropriate to work in football, the response to an individual is the same.'The report points out that other dangers remain, including in the professional game where clubs are routinely failing to follow the FA's own guidance, set out in 10 'golden rules', on taking pictures of children and the use of the resulting photographs.'An area of concern is the use of photographs in match day programmes. The commission found in a survey of 24 programmes randomly taken across all leagues, that FA 'golden rules' are regularly breached and clubs do not recognise the risk to children if they are traceable to their school or home from an image in a programme.'Photographs most commonly used are those of mascots, but pictures of ballboys and girls are also used. Children also feature on "news" pages (eg, birthday notices) and where children have won prizes in club competitions. In all but two photographs, children are fully identified.'There is a recognised risk, and a body of evidence, that photographs of children can identify them and, especially if the images find their way on to the internet, can render a child vulnerable.'Concern is also expressed about the treatment of ball boys during matches, which, the report suggests, can sometimes amount to child abuse. 'The commission came across instances where ballboys/ girls have been the target of abuse from players and sometimes coaches. This may be when the child is not aware of conventions, particularly towards the end of professional games, regarding how quickly or slowly a ball is thrown back into play. There is at least one instance of a player angrily throwing the ball back at a ball boy, causing injury, and several of unacceptable language being directed at ball boys.'The role of adult mascots comes under similar scrutiny. Superficially, it may have a whiff of the ludicrous. How could a bloke dressed up as a hippo be a worry? But such people have access to children and as such should be checked. The report says that some are subject to Criminal Records Bureau reports, but many are not, creating a potential risk of abuse or inappropriate behaviour.'There are issues around the other mascots, the adult ones inside funny costumes who entertain the crowd and frequently have an extended role at the club, interfacing with children. Those acting as club mascots are vulnerable to their actions being misinterpreted, especially when they are posing for photographs with children or when asked - often by parents - to hold children or take them on their knee,' the report says.The commission, set up in 2001 by the FA, the Premier League and the Football League to assess the way in which the game is run, says that contact between star players and their young fans can give rise to further problems. Examples include when teenage female supporters ask for body autographs or players are asked to pose for pictures with children or even to visit young fans in hospital wards.It suggests that the relevant governing bodies of football should produce guidance to increase players' awareness of child protection to assist both the children and the players themselves.Another problem cited is conduct towards teenage girls working for contract caterers in football stadiums. 'It is not unusual for waiting staff to be female and under 18 and to be vulnerable in hospitality areas to more attention than might be appropriate,' says the report.At lower levels of the game, local clubs are advised to check the credentials of those claiming to be scouts for professional clubs because 'the fake scout, sadly, is not unknown', and to ensure that referees are registered with the FA, meaning they will have had a criminal records check, something that, the report warns, does not always happen.'People are usually just grateful to have anyone willing to referee. What this suggests, however, is that numbers of children are under the supervision of referees who may not be suited to work with children, and that those enabling this have perhaps little awareness of the likely wider risk to children from the individual's encounter with them at a football game.'A separate concern - clearly less serious than physical abuse, but which can still cause considerable emotional damage - is the conduct of parents who shout aggressively at children from the touchline. For them, a system of 'red cards', fines and bans is recommended.'Parents are often described as the biggest problem in youth football,' the report adds. 'They put winning before playing, being selected over taking part. Often-cited examples of poor parental behaviour are loud, aggressive exhortation, bad language, audible criticism of a child's performance, mockery, abusing the referee, violence to other parents, antagonism towards a coach - each of them a form of abuse.'Although the authors of the report are keen to emphasise that the risk to youngsters at professional clubs or those who play for their local team remains small, there have, of course, been a number of serious incidents at all levels of the game.One of the most well documented is the case of former Scotland striker Alan Brazil, who also played for Ipswich, Spurs and Manchester United, and who gave evidence in court that he had been abused by a former Celtic Boys Club coach, Jim Torbett. Torbett was jailed in 1998 for two-and-a-half years for molesting Brazil, who was 13 at the time, and other boys over a seven-year period.Earlier this year, Christopher Norris, a youth coach with Morton FC, a Scottish second division side, was sentenced to three years' probation after admitting taking or permitting indecent photos of children at his home over an 18-month period. The photos, which were downloaded from the internet, showed boys as young as 10 being abused by adults.More happily, the report, which was commissioned by the football authorities to help them tighten safeguards in the game in the wake of the problems affecting other sports, cites many positive achievements which should reduce the risk.These include the appointment of child protection officers at many clubs, the introduction of a requirement for criminal records checks for many jobs in football, and an increased awareness among county FA organisations of the need to ensure proper protection and treatment of young players. Training provided by the FA's child protection unit is also praised, as is the collaboration between football and organisations such as the NSPCC and the police.'The FA's strategy has, in the last five years, driven and facilitated an enormous programme of change and represents remarkable achievement at all levels,' the report states. 'Regularly, from other sports' governing bodies, the commission heard acknowledgement that football was ahead in many areas of child protection. Progress has clearly been made and child protection is recognised as fundamental.'John Carr, a spokesman for NCH, the largest child welfare organisation in Britain, said that football, like other sports, had suffered serious problems with child abuse, but praised the game's efforts to combat it.'Sport in general has been plagued with scandals and by adults who want to misuse their positions of trust,' he said. 'This report is a reminder that things can go badly wrong, but it is commendable that football is taking this matter seriously.'Football is very image-conscious and has worked out that every paedophile case is very damaging. I am sure they are determined to be absolutely on top of this problem.'
