Brazilian police have recovered more body parts belonging to the British teenager who was dismembered and stuffed in a suitcase, allegedly by her boyfriend. The head and forearms, believed to belong to 17-year-old Cara Marie Burke, were discovered along the banks of a small creek near the city of Goiania, not far from where an unemployed farm labourer found the teenager's left leg wrapped in a black plastic bag. Police inspector Carlos Raimundo Batista said he was confident the body parts belonged to Burke, from Southfields, southwest London, after her alleged killer, 20-year-old Mohammed Carvalho dos Santos, confessed to dumping her head and limbs in the river. The find came a week after Burke's torso was found in a suitcase near a different river. Carlos Trajano, who is representing Dos Santos, said his client flew into a rage and killed the teenager last Saturday after she threatened to expose him to his family as a drug dealer and cocaine addict.Trajano also told police his client, who will be pleading temporary insanity at his trial, was "totally dependent" on a range of drugs, including crack cocaine and a concoction known in Brazil as merla - a mixture of coca paste and battery acid.Police said Burke, who arrived in Brazil about three months ago, had met Dos Santos in London, where his mother, Ivanyr dos Santos, was working as a maid. Police believe they were a couple until a few weeks ago, but the teenager's family has denied this. Trajano revealed that his client had previously been charged with attempted homicide and car theft. Police earlier accused him of attempting to bribe officers with 70,000 reals (about Â£22,000).
