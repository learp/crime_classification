A rapist received a public apology from an Old Bailey judge yesterday even though he had pleaded guilty to a "terrifying and utterly repugnant" attack.Recorder Robert Seabrook QC originally jailed Adam Levy, from County Kerry, for nine years after he admitted assaulting and raping a 25-year-old Mexican woman in south London. But he called Levy back into court to say that the sentence had been too severe, changed it to a six-year term, and offered him a public apology for the trauma he had been through after the initial sentence. "I'm persuaded that I had fallen into error earlier in perhaps being too influenced by the abhorrent nature of the offence and having given insufficient credit to your plea of guilty," he said. Levy, 32, pounced on his victim as she was walking home late at night in 1997. He indecently assaulted and raped her, then walked from the scene. He fled to Ireland after the attack, but was arrested when a DNA sample identified him as the attacker. He admitted rape and told the police that he had been a "different person then because I was really into drink and drugs".
