Police have named a man they want to speak to after a car was driven into a crowd outside a nightclub. Seven women and seven men were injured – and later taken to hospital – when the stolen Saab mounted the pavement outside the Dali Bar in Rochdale early on Sunday. It is thought that two men in the car had earlier been refused entry to the bar. The car was driven at door staff at 2.10am then drove along the pavement for up to 200 metres after hitting pedestrians. Detectives want to trace Lee Bradley, 26. Another 26-year-old remains in police custody where he is being questioned.
