Thousands more offenders will be ordered to perform unpaid community service wearing bright clothing as an alternative to jail under a new shake-up of the criminal justice system announced today.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, said that the proposal to make offenders "visibly pay back" the community for their crimes was not a soft option. It would also provide a solution to the overcrowding in Britain's prisons.Mr Clarke said he wanted the total number of hours of unpaid work under community sentences to double to 10 million by 2011, as part of his five-year strategy on reducing re-offending published today.The idea extends the existing Community Payback scheme under which local people vote on what offenders should be doing in their area.There will also be new sentences that combine community service and prison sentences.Some of the work could involve preparation for the London Olympics in 2012, according the strategy.Launching the document, Mr Clarke said: "The idea that prison works in stopping re-offending is demonstrably wrong."A shocking truth is that more than half of all crime in this country is committed by people who have been through the criminal justice system before."Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Clarke said: "Working hard on a relatively mundane job such as cleaning up an estate, compared with lying on your back in a prison cell, is a much tougher option in many circumstances."Under the plan, offenders would have to carry out community sentences in recognisable uniforms. They would also be offered "going straight" contracts - help with housing and jobs was promised if they signed behaviour contracts and stayed out of trouble.Mr Clarke said he wanted to stop the "merry-go-round" of repeat offending, and insisted that those who were a danger to society would still be given custodial sentences."The task that is determined in this strategy today is to get effective community sentences, with unpaid work absolutely at the core of it. So people are doing work and paying back into the community - visibly, yes, because it's important the community sees that that payback is happening - but also linked to a range of different rehabilitations to try to help offenders to go straight," said Mr Clarke.At last count, there were 77,800 inmates in England and Wales - just 373 short of total capacity. The strategy also said that those convicted for less serious offences should serve time at adult community prisons, where they would be allowed more contact with family and friends.The plans were attacked by a group representing victims of crime.Dee Edwards, co-founder of Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, said: "There are already 2,000 offenders being supervised by the Probation Service who are considered to be high or very high risk."They are not all supervised 24 hours a day. How can they be? Prison works. It works for me and it works for the public. Why do they need to reduce prison numbers, anyway?"But the Prison Reform Trust welcomed the plan. Its director, Juliet Lyon, praised Mr Clarke's "thoughtful" approach, but warned that the Probation Service would need extra resources to make it work."To make this vision more than just a dream Mr Clarke must now tackle rocketing prison numbers and fund community solutions to crime."Former chief prisons inspector Lord Ramsbottom accused Mr Clarke of making empty promises.He said: "Many of us are in full agreement with Charles Clarke and his vision about what he wants to do. The system at the moment is simply not capable of providing what is needed to fulfil the government part of the promise."The trouble is that, with overcrowded prisons unable to produce the programmes, these promises in fact are frankly empty."Some elements of the package seemed "quite gimmicky", he said, but backed the use of more community sentences if the public could be given more confidence in it.
