A 36-year-old man was remanded in custody today charged with murdering his terminally ill son.Andrew Wragg, of Henty Close, Worthing, West Sussex, appeared at Chichester Magistrates' Court charged with murdering his 10-year-old son Jacob, who suffered with Hunters Syndrome. Wragg, who appeared dressed in a white polo shirt, spoke only to confirm his name and age during the 10-minute hearing. He was remanded until August 5 when he will appear before a judge at Lewes Crown Court. There was no application for bail, although a full application for his release will be made at the Crown Court. Wragg's father Robert, brother Chris and sister Tina were in court to hear Angela McGuinness outline the facts of the case for the prosecution. Wragg was charged last night while Jacob's mother Mary Wragg, who has arrested with him on Saturday night, was released without bail. Speaking after today's hearing, Oscar Vincent, acting for Wragg, said: "It is a deeply tragic case involving many issues with which the family have yet to come to terms and which will be dealt with in due course. "In the meantime, I hope the family will be allowed to grieve in peace." Today a police cordon sealing off Henty Close had been removed following a search of the property over the weekend.
