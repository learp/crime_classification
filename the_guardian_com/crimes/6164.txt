The Youth Justice Board (YJB) claims it has got tougher with young criminals who breach the terms of their community punishment after figures revealed offenders could break the rules more than 40 times before being sent back to court.Offenders aged under 18 who were handed a 12-month version of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme (ISSP) had to be deemed "non-compliant" on 40.5 occasions on average before official action was taken against them, according to a YJB report.But the board said more up-to-date figures showed the number of breaches had more than doubled between 2004-05 and 2005-06 on the government's flagship community punishment scheme, which forces youngsters to undertake a tough programme of education and other activities.A YJB spokesman said: "Since this study was undertaken, much work has been done with youth offending team practitioners to emphasise the importance of applying the national standards regarding breach in a robust and consistent manner."A fresh emphasis has been placed upon swift breach for non-compliance and the importance of reinforcing the seriousness of the order by returning young people who do not comply to court."Under-18s on the six-month version of the scheme had to break the rules 17 times, on average, before being taken to court.In all, 55% of youths placed on pilot versions of the 12-month scheme committed a breach, compared with 65% in the six-month version.Those on the longer version of the order - designed to be an alternative to a jail term - were more likely to commit a second and third breach, statistics showed.The YJB spokesman said: "This study looked at a small sample, just 106 young people, going through the scheme nearly three years ago, and has highlighted that there was evidence of variation in regard to breaching policy, with staff using a wide degree of discretion when deciding when non-compliance should be dealt with by breach action."Non-compliance is often very minor misbehaviour, including late attendance or rudeness to staff."
