Police arrested almost 300 drunk or incapacitated drivers a day during a month-long clampdown over the Christmas period.A total of 9,148 people were arrested across England and Wales as police targeted those suspected of driving under the influence of drink or drugs.Officers in 43 forces breath-tested 183,397 drivers between December 1 and January 1. The number of tests was 25,000 up on the previous year's campaign but a similar proportion of drivers, about 5%, were found to be behind the wheel illegally. The figures showed those under 25 who were tested were more likely to be over the legal limit.Chief Constable Mick Giannasi, of Gwent Police, who is responsible for policing roads across England and Wales, said it was worrying that some drivers saw themselves as above the law and were willing to put their lives, and those of others, at risk."Drink and drug drive collisions not only devastate the lives of victims and their families, but they also ruin the lives of the offenders," he said. "Driving under the influence of any substance, whether it is alcohol or drugs is not acceptable. Alcohol and drugs can impair your ability to judge speed and distances, reduce concentration and delay reaction speed."Jim Fitzpatrick, road safety minister, said drink drivers were "more likely to be caught than ever before"."This isn't just a message for Christmas, it's for every day of the year. Drink driving ruins lives. In 2007, 460 people died and families across Britain were devastated - don't do it," he added.The department for transport spent Â£1.6m on a Christmas drink drive campaign, with the message that drink drivers are treated like any other criminal.Anyone arrested is required to give blood and DNA samples. Convicted offenders face a minimum 12-month driving ban, criminal record and a fine.
