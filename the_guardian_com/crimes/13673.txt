Two men, aged 18 and 20, have been arrested in connection with an attack in which a 41-year-old man was set alight as he slept in the street.Matthew Kitchen, a married window fabricator from Bury, is thought to have been making his way back home following a night out when he fell asleep at a bus stop in Radcliffe, near Manchester, shortly after 2am on Sunday. It is believed that a car pulled up alongside him and that the occupants got out and set fire to Mr Kitchen before driving off again. Mr Kitchen was taken to the nearby Wythenshawe Hospital, where he was last night in a critical but stable condition. Doctors who have said that he has a 25% chance of surviving his injuries were yesterday assessing whether he would be able to withstand surgery. Mr Kitchen's brother Chris said yesterday: "He is a very popular person who is well known and well liked. He has never been in any trouble and the whole family are shocked and devastated. It seems to be an utterly senseless act." "We are treating this case very seriously," said Detective Inspector Simon Collier from Whitefield CID. "This was an unprovoked attack on a man who has suffered serious burns and is in a critical condition in hospital." Police have launched an appeal for witnesses.
