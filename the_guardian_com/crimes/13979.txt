The government has quadrupled the fine for touting at the London Olympics as part of a wider clampdown designed to deter the sale of tickets on the black market.Home secretary Theresa May has announced that the fine will increase from £5,000 to £20,000 for those convicted under laws introduced as part of the legislation required to host the Games."By increasing the fines for touting we are sending a clear message to criminals and prospective criminals that it is not worth their while and they are not welcome," said May."The focus of the government and everyone involved is to deliver a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games that London, the UK and the world can enjoy. It will not be spoiled by ticket touts."The Metropolitan police's Operation Podium division has stepped up its activity to try to disrupt the activities of organised gangs of touts in the run up to the Games, making a series of arrests last weekend at football matches at the Emirates and Anfield.Touting tickets for football matches is also an offence. While reselling tickets for other sporting events and concerts is not a criminal offence, it may breach the promoter's terms and conditions."My officers are working now to make the Olympics as hostile an environment as possible for them, and increasing the penalty will help by sending a clear warning," said Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, the national Olympic security co-ordinator. "Touts are part of organised criminal networks, often involved in other crimes, and we are committed to dismantling them layer by layer."He said that warning letters had been sent to those "who may try to illegally sell Olympic tickets, to warn them their card is marked and we are watching".The Met and Olympic organisers have also launched a public information campaign in an attempt to warn prospective purchasers of the dangers of buying from anywhere other than the official site.Recent major sporting events and music festivals have been blighted by a stream of scam websites offering non-existant tickets and using applicants' card details for criminal purposes.
