Police salaries should be based on performance and skills instead of length of service, a thinktank said today.The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said the current system, which sees officers receiving annual pay increases of between 2% and 6% during their first 10 years, in addition to their annual-pay increases, was flawed.In a report, the IPPR argued that this system discouraged officers from developing specialist skills and failed to encourage them to do difficult or dangerous jobs such as emergency response.Instead the IPPR proposed a new set of pay bands for each rank, with higher pay for officers with specialist skills.An IPPR spokesman, Guy Lodge, said: "We all know the police do a difficult and challenging job, but no system of pay is fair that rewards people solely on the basis of time served rather than their ability to do the job effectively."The current row over pay levels is preventing much-needed debate about how we reward police officers and how we deliver a high-performing police service."He continued: "You could have a system whereby detection levels and those sorts of things are part of a police pay system, but the core message we are trying to put is that... pay should be linked to skills."
