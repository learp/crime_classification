A man alleged to have killed his son and seriously injured his daughter in a fall from a hotel balcony was today charged with murder and attempted murder before an investigating magistrate in Crete.John Hogan jumped 50ft from a fourth-floor balcony at the Petramare Hotel, in the resort town of Ierapetra, while on holiday with his wife Natasha, 34, six-year-old son, Liam, and daughter Mia, aged two.Mr Hogan, 32, is alleged to have jumped from the balcony while holding his two children on August 15, killing Liam, seriously injuring himself and leaving Mia with a broken arm.He suffered arm, chest and leg injuries, and has been under police guard at Heraklion University Hospital on the Greek island.This morning, he was taken to the court, in the town of Neapolis, in an ambulance and was brought into the building in a wheelchair, weeping and with his head in his hands.Court officials said he had broken down and expressed remorse for what had happened.Sky News reported that Mr Hogan, who runs a tiling business in Bristol, hugged his mother and sister and whispered "I'm so sorry" before going into the hearing.The channel said he had previously held meetings with the district prosecutor and the judge.During the meetings, it was claimed he had been in a distracted state prior to the apparent suicide attempt, knowing only that he wanted to die and did not want to be separated from his children.He had two brothers who had committed suicide, and had been on antidepressants until he stopped taking them several months ago because they were making him ill, Sky said.The channel also reported that Mr Hogan could not remember any specific events that had taken place close to the balcony fall.His lawyer, Dimitris Xyritakis, said it could be up to 10 months before the trial started and that Mr Hogan would plead that he was in a "state of confusion" when he jumped from the balcony. He will be given a psychiatric examination before the trial, and could face up to 25 years in jail if convicted.The hearing came less than 48 hours after Liam Hogan was buried at a church in Bradley Stoke, Bristol.A message from Natasha Hogan to her son, attached to floral tributes, read: "You are so special to me and I will love you forever. Everything you did, everything you were, made mummy so proud. Have lots of fun playing in heaven ... until we meet again."
