The crown prosecution service yesterday announced that perpetrators of anti-gay offences will be treated with "zero tolerance" in future.The initiative, which includes crimes against transsexuals, will cover incidents regarded by victims as homophobic or "transphobic"-based on the service's definition of a racist crime as one perceived as racist by victims. The move is designed to encourage more victims of anti-gay crimes to come forward. Studies show that male victims of rape, for example, are reluctant to report attacks to police. The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, said: "Homophobic crimes strike at people's right to feel safe and secure, and to abuse or attack someone because of their sexual orientation and gender identity is a hate crime which cannot be tolerated. "The CPS today sends a clear message to those who commit such crimes that they will be dealt with firmly."
