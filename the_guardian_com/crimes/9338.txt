Too many young people with mental health problems end up in prison because support services for disturbed children are inadequate, according to a leading prison reform charity.A report for the Prison Reform Trust calls for vast improvements to the system of assessment for troubled youngsters to prevent so many from being imprisoned.The study, Troubled Inside, cites previous research by the office for national statistics and the chief inspector of prisons that suggests more than nine out of 10 young offenders have at least one mental health problem, and more than half of young men on remand have a psychiatric disorder. It adds that a study from last year shows conditions such as schizophrenia and manic depression were 50 times more common among sentenced male prisoners than among 16 to 19-year-olds outside. "Prison should not be considered appropriate for young people with mental health problems," the report says. The trust's director, Juliet Lyon, called for young offenders with mental health problems to receive treatment rather than punishment."Vulnerable children and young people need secure care and treatment, not punishment and neglect," she said. "Working together, the Department of Health and the Home Office must act now to introduce earlier assessment and intervention for troubled children in the community. "They must also respond to the largely unmet mental health needs of disturbed young people in young offenders' institutions and transfer those who are severely mentally ill from prisons to health settings."
