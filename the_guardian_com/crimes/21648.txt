Neil Entwistle, the computer programmer accused of killing his wife and baby daughter in Massachusetts last month, yesterday agreed to return to the United States to face trial. He waived his right to an extradition hearing and said through his lawyer that he wanted to avoid any further distress to his wife's family and his own.Bow Street magistrates court was packed with media when Mr Entwistle made his brief appearance. Mr Entwistle, 27, originally from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, smiled at his father, Cliff, who attended the proceedings with a lawyer."You are agreeing to be sent immediately to the US and there will be no extradition proceedings?" asked the district judge, Anthony Evans. "That's right, yes," said Mr Entwistle.Outside court his lawyer, Judith Seddon, read a brief statement in which her client expressed his desire to return to Massachusetts as swiftly as possible. Asked if her client was denying killing his wife, Rachel, and daughter, Lillian, Ms Seddon said she had no further comment.On his return to the US, Mr Entwistle will be formally charged with the double murder and with illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.
