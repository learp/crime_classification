A scheme to protect women from domestic abuse by removing violent partners from the family home has been shelved by the government, sparking fears that public protection is being put at risk by the coalition's cuts programme.Under domestic violence protection orders – also known as "go orders" – planned for England and Wales, senior police would have been given the power to act instantly to safeguard families they considered at threat.They were aimed at intervening in cases where police were worried about violent behaviour within a household, but did not have enough evidence to bring a criminal charge.Deborah McIlveen, head of policy at Women's Aid, said: "It is disappointing that an initiative that may have potentially helped to save lives is being cut."The orders – modelled on a scheme from Austria – would have applied for up to a fortnight in a bid to prevent women having to flee to emergency accommodation such as refuges.An officer of inspector rank or above would have had the power to order a perpetrator from a property and the immediate area for up to 14 days.Breaching the orders could lead to a prison sentence.The scheme, first unveiled by then home secretary Alan Johnson last year, was due to be trialled in Wiltshire and the West Midlands prior to being rolled out.Victims were expected to have access to help and advice by caseworkers on the options open to them if they left the relationship – including securing a longer-term injunction.But May wrote to charities last week to say that she had taken the decision to "defer" the pilots due to budgetary pressures and concerns about the "practicability" of the legislation.A Home Office spokesman confirmed that pilots have been "deferred", with a final decision due after the autumn spending review, and after the department had "explored options for reducing costs of implementation".The spokesman insisted that May considered tackling violence against women a priority, adding: "However, in tough economic times we are now considering our options for delivering improved protection and value for money."Brian Moore, the Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on violence and public protection, said the police were not consulted about the decision.Moore, chief constable at Wiltshire police force, where the scheme was due to be piloted in October, said: "We were advised but not consulted that domestic violence protection orders were not proceeding at this stage. I am concerned at the number of gaps in public protection that may arise as a result of government budget planning."David Hanson, the shadow police spokesman, branded May's decision as "a retrograde step" for women vulnerable to violence in the home.He said he was tabling urgent Commons questions demanding to know the reason for the decision, and whether police had been consulted.He pointed out that neither the Liberal Democrats nor the Conservatives opposed the plans when they were discussed in parliament prior being enshrined in the Crime and Security Act last April. "I am very concerned by this," he said. "The scrapping of a potential prevention measure in domestic violence is a very retrograde step."The Home Office is under pressure to reduce its £10bn budget by up to £2.5bn. But Hanson claimed that the pilots were not costly to administer.Under the present law, only those arrested and charged with an offence can be barred from their home either through bail conditions or by the victim seeking an order in the civil courts.David Chaplin, a spokesman for the NSPCC children's charity, said the organisation was "deeply disappointed" by the move.He said: "We strongly supported the orders. They would have given some vital respite to the victims of abuse."
