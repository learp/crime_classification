A handyman who planted child pornography on a school caretaker's computer was jailed for 12 years today.Neil Weiner hoped to get Eddie Thompson sacked from Swanlea school in east London so that he could be promoted.Weiner, 40, was convicted of perverting the course of justice and two counts of possessing indecent images of children.Judge David Paget told him: "What you did to a decent and honest man was in my view wicked."It is difficult to imagine a more cunning, deceitful or warped course of conduct than yours in this case, or a more malicious one."The Old Bailey heard he sent police a CD containing indecent images of children, saying they came from Thompson's laptop.Hundreds more pictures were found on the computer and the caretaker was arrested.He told police he had been set up by colleagues who did not like him but it was eight months before he heard no action would be taken.
