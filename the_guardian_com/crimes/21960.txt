An Irish businessman has become the first person to be convicted in connection with the Northern Bank robbery, which netted the IRA more than £26m.Cork-based financial adviser Ted Cunningham, 60, was today found guilty of laundering more than £3m connected with the Northern Bank heist ‑ at the time the biggest cash robbery in UK criminal history ‑ in December 2004.After deliberating for nearly six hours, a jury of seven men and five women at Cork circuit criminal court found Cunningham guilty on 10 counts relating to money laundering. He is expected to be sentenced later today.The jury heard evidence from 75 prosecution witnesses and two defence witnesses and were given access to 65 exhibits produced in the case, which began on 14 January and lasted 10 weeks.Judge Cornelius Murphy, who spent more than 11 hours summing up the case, told the jury they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on each charge if they were to convict Cunningham."Approach this issue as dispassionately as you can. This is the people of Ireland against Mr Cunningham, not the Northern Bank against Mr Cunningham or the gardai against Mr Cunningham. I require from you a unanimous verdict on each of the 10 charges," he said.In reply to a question from the jury on money laundering, Murphy said that in order to convict Mr Cunningham they had to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that he possessed or used the money at issue and that he knew or believed it to be stolen.The robbery at the Northern Bank's Belfast headquarters was carried out by the IRA, according to Sir Hugh Orde, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.Police discovered £3m hidden in Cunningham's Cork home in 2005.Cunningham testified that the money came from Bulgarian businessmen seeking to buy a quarry. He denied any involvement with the IRA.
