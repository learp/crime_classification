A man who believed he had got away with murder for 18 years was jailed for life at the Old Bailey yesterday after he was trapped by advances in forensic science.Anthony Ruark, 40, was first questioned by police in 1983 after his lover Jacqueline Poole was found dead at her home in Ruislip, west London. Mrs Poole had been beaten, sexually assaulted and strangled with a ligature. Ruark, of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, had denied murdering Mrs Poole, 25, in February 1983. Over the years, Ruark continued associating with Mrs Poole's family as if nothing had happened. "He is a man who must have had this on his conscience for 18 years," said his counsel, Nicholas Price QC. When Ruark committed a minor theft early last year his DNA profile was put on the national DNA database, an act which led to his conviction. Detective Chief Inspector Norman McKinlay was already re-investigating the murder in which Ruark was a suspect after a call from a member of the public in 1999. He enlisted the help of the forensic science services DNA experts. And in April last year, after Ruark's theft offence, they alerted Mr McKinlay that they had had a "hit". An old forensic sample was analysed again by the service using new DNA profiling techniques. It matched Ruark to the murder victim. Judge Kenneth Machin told Ruark: "This was a brutal murder of a defenceless woman who had been nothing but kind to you." He commended Mr McKinlay, saying: "But for his re-examination, this case, this matter may not have come to court." Ruark had previous convictions for dishonesty but none for violence. The court heard that Mrs Poole may have been killed for her jewellery. Mr McKinlay said outside the court it was "very gratifying for us to be able to help Jacqueline's family to finally know the truth about her death". Press Association
