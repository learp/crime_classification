A British-born Muslim student was jailed for eight years today for distributing material that glorified terrorism and suicide bombing.Mohammed Atif Siddique, 21, was found guilty last month of providing training material on bomb-making and of threatening to become a suicide bomber.Siddique was also convicted of distributing a range of terrorist material via the internet.Siddique, from Alva, Clackmannanshire, sat motionless at the high court in Edinburgh as the judge handed down his sentence.Lord Carloway told him: "The articles which you had in your possession included a large number of files stored in a concealed location on your laptop computer which you had with you when about to board a flight to Pakistan on April 5 2006."These files are in English and contain terrorist propaganda particularly emanating from al-Qaida, glorifying terrorism - especially suicide bombing - designed to encourage people to commit such acts of terrorism and promote the recruitment of English-speaking, mainly British nationals, to the cause of jihad."The judge said: "It is clear from the evidence that you did not have this material because of some innocent curiosity."Siddique was convicted at the high court in Glasgow after a trial lasting nearly four weeks.During the proceedings he was branded a "wannabe suicide bomber" by the advocate-depute, Brian McConnachie QC.Documents and footage linked to Siddique during the trial were described as "a call to arms for Muslims"."It's clear from that material that the whole idea was to glorify martyrdom operations, which we call suicide bombings," Mr McConnachie said.Siddique had denied three charges under the Terrorism Act 2000, one under the Terrorism Act 2006, and a breach of the peace charge.He was accused of possessing and collecting items such as CDs and videos on weapons use, guerrilla tactics and bomb-making that could have been used for terrorist purposes.He was further accused of causing a breach of the peace at Glasgow Metropolitan college by threatening to become a suicide bomber and to blow up Glasgow, and showing images of suicide bombers and beheadings.The offences were alleged to have been carried out between March 1 2003 and April 13 last year.Speaking outside court, Siddique's older brother insisted he had not received a fair trial or a fair sentence.Reading from a statement, Mohammed Asif Siddique said: "Today Atif Siddique has been sentenced under controversial and vague terror legislation for looking for answers on the internet. "Atif is no terrorist. This has indeed been a miscarriage of justice."Siddique's solicitor, Aamer Anwar, said: "We've met with Atif Siddique and he wishes me to say as his solicitor that he maintains he's innocent and we will be making an appeal on his behalf."
