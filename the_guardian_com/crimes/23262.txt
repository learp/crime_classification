A homeowner has been jailed for 30 months after fighting off knife-wielding intruders. Munir Hussain, a 53-year-old businessman, and his family were tied up by a gang of masked men in their living room and threatened at knifepoint. When the intruders fled, Hussain and his brother chased and caught one of the men and attacked him.They were both found guilty of grevious bodily harm with intent after the burglar suffered a fractured skull and was left with a permanent brain injury. The judge said it was necessary to "make it absolutely clear that, whatever the circumstances, persons cannot take the law into their own hands, or carry out revenge attacks upon a person who has offended them". The defence argued that Hussain was the "real victim" who had acted in the heat of the moment under extreme stress.The case is similar to that of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who was jailed for murder in 2000 after shooting an intruder dead, which prompted a national debate on the limits of self defence.Do you think Hussain's case could be justified as self defence? Or do you agree with the judge that whatever the circumstances, people should never take the law into their own hands?
