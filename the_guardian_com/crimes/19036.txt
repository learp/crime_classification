The missing British backpacker Peter Falconio was alive and well days after the outback attack in which he is believed to have been killed, a Darwin court was told yesterday.A service station attendant from the New South Wales town of Bourke told the court that Mr Falconio had been at the station several days after the incident in July 2001. Robert Brown and his partner, Melissa Kendall, had seen pictures of Mr Falconio in the newspapers after the attack and immediately suspected that the missing man was in their shop. "It was just on dark, round about 6 o'clock," Mr Brown said via video-link. "Melissa came out the back and told me that the old mate that's in the papers is in the shop. I spun out. I went out and had a look at him. I seen [sic] the bloke that looked exactly like that was in the paper. It was just him. He came in to buy a drink and a Mars Bar. I served Peter Falconio myself." He said that the man had bleached-blond hair and a scar on his lip but was otherwise uninjured. He could detect a slight English accent, having heard one "on the telly". "I think he had a slight one but nothing that really stood out that much," he said. Shown a photograph of Mr Falconio, Mr Brown said he was sure it was the man he served. "If it wasn't him, they were twins," he said. He told the court he had followed the man outside and found him with a man and a woman and a pickup truck. Bradley John Murdoch, a 45-year-old mechanic from the western Australian town of Broome, has been charged with murdering Mr Falconio and assaulting his partner, Joanne Lees, on the Stuart highway 180 miles north of Alice Springs. The hearing continues.
