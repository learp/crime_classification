Essex police are to challenge a high court ban on a controversial poster campaign that would have plastered pictures of a convicted burglar around his home town.Forty posters featuring Gary Ellis, 27, of Brentwood, Essex, were due to appear on commuter railway station platforms and at Little Chef restaurants this week as part of a hard-hitting anti-crime campaign.Officers hoped the campaign would shame Ellis, described by police as a "prolific offender", and discourage others from crime.However, lawyers for Ellis objected and obtained a high court injunction temporarily preventing the police from going ahead with the scheme.Essex police said today the force would challenge the injunction and a hearing is expected to take place at the high court in the near future.The force said a risk assessment had been carried out before Ellis was chosen as a subject for the posters to gauge the possible effect of the campaign on his mental health.The plan has attracted criticism from prisoners' support groups. Lucy Gampell, the director of Action for Prisoners' Families, called the campaign "utterly misguided" and "a serious infringement on the right to privacy for the family of the prisoner".Other forces are watching the scheme with a view to implementing it elsewhere in the UK.
