The police watchdog has condemned a force's "systemic failures" in helping the family of a man with severe learning difficulties who collapsed and died after confronting youths who had taunted him for years.Greater Manchester police completely failed to acknowledge the targeting of David Askew, 64, and his family as a hate crime, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said following an investigation.In almost half of the incidents reviewed by the IPCC in which the family contacted the police, there was no acknowledgement of the family's vulnerability or the history of abuse suffered.Disability charities said such incidents were all too common and called for police and the judicial system to take such crimes more seriously.Askew collapsed and died in the garden of his home in Hattersley in March last year after confronting a group of youths who had reportedly knocked over a wheelie bin and tampered with his mother's mobility scooter.Following his death, it emerged that Askew and his family had reported antisocial behaviour and other crimes to the police 88 times in six years.The case echoed that of Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her 18-year-old daughter, Francecca, who had severe learning difficulties, by setting fire to the car in which they were sitting near their family home in Barwell, Leicestershire in October 2007.A subsequent inquest found the family had endured years of abuse, and held police and council officials partly responsible for failing to properly respond to Pilkington's requests for help.The IPCC report into Askew's death was less condemnatory, noting that local police worked "diligently" to assist the family, including when off duty.But it found the police had failed to consistently identify the vulnerability of the family, respond to incidents as possible hate crimes or liaise properly between officers responding to calls and the neighbourhood policing team.The force had no systems in place to deal with repeated targeting of the disabled, and many incidents were dealt with in isolation by officers ignorant of the background.The IPCC report also criticised Tameside council, local NHS staff and the housing association which owned Askew's home for regarding him as "part of the problem" rather than a victim."Antisocial behaviour is the type of low-level crime that can pass beneath the radar of police," said IPCC commissioner Naseem Malik."However, for the families experiencing such crime, it can be a horrific experience. The Askew family had experienced years of torment at the hands of local youths who targeted David in particular."The IPCC recognised that some local officers "went beyond the call of duty" in trying to help the family, she said, adding: "While the Askew family perceived the work of the local team as assisting and giving them some comfort, they were actually being failed at a higher level as opportunities to implement a co-ordinated approach to tackle and deal with the problems was being missed."They were left with a sticking-plaster solution when the matter needed extensive surgery."Garry Shewan, assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said the force recognised "more should have been done" to help Askew and his family.But, he said, even before the death the force had began a major review of how it dealt with antisocial behaviour and new systems were now in place to prevent future failings.The chief executive of the disability charity Mencap, Mark Goldring, said Askew had endured "terrible and prolonged abuse".He said: "Mencap estimates that as many as nine out of 10 people with a learning disability are verbally harassed or exposed to violence due to their disability."It is hate crime and deserves to be taken as seriously as racial, religious and homophobic crime."The IPCC report should be "a wake-up call", said Richard Hawkes, the chief executive of Scope.He said: "Disabled people experience harassment and abuse on a daily basis, simply because they are different."Often it starts with persistent low-level incidents. But if left unchecked, antisocial behaviour can escalate into something more serious. The impact can be unspeakable."Victims find it hard to come forward. Many will ignore harassment â€“ others will find the justice system literally inaccessible."As a result, disability hate crime is sorely under-reported and official figures mask the true scale of the problem. Where it is reported, conviction rates are much lower than other types of hate crime."Last September a 19-year-old man who lived near Askew was detained in a young offenders' institution after he admitted using intimidating, threatening and aggressive behaviour against the family.
