A man caught on CCTV sexually assaulting a horse in an attack lasting more than an hour has been jailed.Former removals worker Alan Blackman, 31, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to trespass with the intent to commit a sexual offence and attempted intercourse with a horse.Blackman was arrested after the animal was found injured at farm stables in Redenhall, Norfolk, on 6 August. He was sentenced on Friday at Norwich crown court.The court heard he had filmed himself abusing the horse. Jailing him for 14 months, Judge Katharine Moore told Blackman: “You recorded this possibly because it was something you yourself might watch again or because it was something you might want others to watch. Unfortunately as a result of your actions, the horse sustained injuries.”Describing the offence as “somewhat unusual”, Claire Matthews, prosecuting, said the horse’s owner had become suspicious about a possible disturbance in the stable and checked security camera footage. They found CCTV footage of Blackman sexually assaulting the horse, she said.“In total he was in the stable for something in the order of an hour and 10 minutes.”She said Blackman was arrested after a police appeal for information accompanied by CCTV images was published in the media.Michael Clare, mitigating, said Blackman was now unemployed and in debt. “He has already sentenced himself to a lifetime of excruciating embarrassment,” he added.Speaking after sentencing, DS Alison Clabon said: “Crimes such as this are very rare and today’s sentencing will hopefully send out a strong message that this sort of criminality will not be tolerated and the justice system will come down hard on those who feel they can get away with such a horrifying crime.”
