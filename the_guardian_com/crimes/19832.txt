The man returned to a dark car, believed to be a BMW or Mercedes, and was driven away by a second offender.Officers arrested a 37-year-old man from Gloucester in connection with the incident. A 20-year-old man from Cheltenham was arrested on Tuesday evening on suspicion of arson. Both men remain in police custody.The door of the building sustained light fire damage and no one was injured.Richard Burge, chief inspector for Gloucester, appealed for witnesses. He said: "Gloucester has a wonderfully diverse and welcoming community and I know people will be upset and angry about this. In recent weeks I've been buoyed by the fact we haven't seen any of the tensions there have been elsewhere in the country."I know now the community will come together, help us with our inquiries and show that it utterly rejects acts like this. We'll be increasing community patrols in the area over the coming days."
