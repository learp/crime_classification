A forensic science graduate caught a care assistant who was stealing from her grandmother by hiding a camera in the eye of a teddy bear. Emma Sampson, 21, set out to catch a thief after her grandmother, Thelma, 75, noticed the money missing from her home in Walton, Liverpool. Emma Sampson and her father, Robert, 46, installed a miniature camera in the eye socket of the bear and marked three £20 notes in the purse, catching Yvonne Allen red-handed.Allen, 28, of Oakwood Road, Halewood, Liverpool, was jailed last week for six months after admitting two counts of theft, and agreed to pay £60 to Mrs Sampson.Mr Sampson said: "My mother has end-stage leukaemia and we had to get a carer in who worked for the primary care trust [PCT]. The next day my mum said £40 had gone out of her purse. "I said 'are you sure?' and she said 'I may be dying but I know how much money I had in my handbag'."Emma wrote down the serial numbers on three £20 notes in my mum's purse and we got a £55 camera from the local DIY store. Emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside. "We thought it would be a long process but [Allen] was greedy. We called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers." Bernie Cuthel, managing director of Liverpool PCT Provider Services, confirmed that a former healthcare assistant had been convicted of stealing from a patient and following an internal disciplinary hearing was no longer employed by the trust. Mrs Sampson has a new care assistant.
