A fraudster who conned the Inland Revenue out of £54.6m in tax allowances was yesterday told that he will have to pay back £98m or face having another 10 years added to his original 12½-year sentence.Ian Leaf, 51, had led a lavish lifestyle. He owned a £5m 10-bedroomed chateau on the shores of Lake Geneva, an apartment in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier and luxury cars. But it all fell apart when he was arrested and extradited from Switzerland last year after carrying out what investigators called the "largest swindle of its kind".Leaf systematically evaded paying corporation tax when buying and selling companies through a series of real and bogus international firms, racking up a massive profit. He was convicted of 13 counts of fraudulent trading between 1991 and 1996 and sentenced at Southwark crown court, south London, in December.The jurors heard that his "breathtaking" criminality was the "largest swindle of its kind", and involved a 100-strong international line-up of real and bogus companies, a bank registered on a small South Pacific atoll, and a firm of brokers with little more than an accommodation address. Back in court yesterday to hear his financial fate, he was told he would have to pay back the £54.6m plus £43.4m in interest, or face a maximum default sentence of an additional 10 years.His barrister, Tim Owen QC, said he had only recently been instructed and needed more time to deal with the "complex" issues involved.But his client had "substantially less" than the £98m the crown was seeking.Adjourning the case to April 7, Judge David Higgins said he found it "almost incredible to believe that the defendant does not know where every penny has gone - whether into companies or trusts, is sitting in bank accounts or has been turned into other assets."
