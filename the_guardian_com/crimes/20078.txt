Senior judges have ruled that a decision to free a police officer accused of murdering his wife was "properly conducted", even though he went on to kill his mother-in-law before committing suicide, a coroner said yesterday.Garry Weddell, a former inspector with the Metropolitan police, shot himself earlier this month just hours after killing his mother-in-law. The attorney general launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the decision to grant the 47-year-old bail. But yesterday at the opening of the inquest into Weddell's death, coroner David Morris said a high court review had found the decision had been "properly conducted". The Bedford and Luton coroner said senior judges who examined the case said they had no criticism of Judge John Bevan QC who made the original decision.The decision to grant the former inspector bail was taken after his brother Geoffrey, a London-based barrister who specialises in police law, offered surety of Â£200,000 and said Weddell would live with him in Surrey. The defence team had argued that this, combined with Weddell's cooperation with the police and fears for his safety in prison, meant bail should be considered, even though there was evidence he had planned to harm himself while in custody.Morris added that court transcripts containing discussions on the decision to release Weddell from custody will be published tomorrow.
