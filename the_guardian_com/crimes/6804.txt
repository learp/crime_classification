The poisoned Russian former spy Alexander Litvinenko was buried today in London, as prosecutors in his home country opened their own criminal investigation into his death.The move follows Scotland Yard's announcement last night that it was treating the case as suspected murder.Also today, the Health Protection Agency said seven employees at the Millennium hotel in central London, where Mr Litvinenko met a contact the day he fell ill, have tested positive for "low levels" of polonium-210, the radioactive isotope that killed the ex-KGB officer.There was no immediate threat to the health of the staff, all of whom work in the hotel's bar, and the long-term risk was thought to be "very small", the HPA said.Meanwhile, the Russian Interfax agency reported tonight that Dmitry Kovtun, one of the businessmen who met Mr Litvinenko before he was poisoned, was in a coma in hospital.Mr Litvinenko's sealed coffin was laid to rest at Highgate cemetery in north London at 2.30pm, before a crowd of around 50 mourners, including the former intelligence agent's wife, Marina, and young son, as well as the exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky and the Chechen separatist Akhmed Zakayev.In yet another curious twist in the ever more complex affair, proceedings were briefly interrupted by an imam performing Muslim prayers.Some family members claimed Mr Litvinenko converted to Islam on his deathbed, something disputed by close friends.Mr Litvinenko's friend Alexander Goldfarb said the imam's prayers were allowed to continue, despite being contrary to Mrs Litvinenko's wish that the burial service be strictly non-denominational."We had a choice to turn it into an unseemly situation but Marina asked us to respect the memory of Alexander and let these people do what they did. Let God be their judge."Earlier today, the prosecutor general's office in Russia announced it had opened a criminal case on Mr Litvinenko's death, as well as the attempted killing of his associate Mr Kovtun.The move will allow suspects to be prosecuted in Russia, from where officials have said suspects will not be extradited.It had not been previously announced that Mr Kovtun, a businessman who met Mr Litvinenko before he was poisoned, was ill.Andrei Lugovoi, another businessman who met the former KGB spy, is undergoing medical tests in a Moscow hospital, according to his lawyer. He had been due to be questioned today by Scotland Yard detectives who are in Russia to investigate the case, but this was postponed.Mr Lugovoi, a former KGB officer who now runs a juice factory, said he would cooperate with Scotland Yard's inquiry.Last night, Scotland Yard said the team investigating Mr Litvinenko's death had "reached the stage where it is felt appropriate to treat it as an allegation of murder". The statement said that "many lines of inquiry, both in the UK and Russia" were being pursued and that detectives were keeping an open mind and "methodically following the evidence".While Scotland Yard was ruling out the possibility that Mr Litvinenko deliberately or accidentally poisoned himself, police stressed they had reached no conclusions as to the means employed, the motive or the identity of those who might be responsible.An early rumour had suggested Mr Litvinenko may have been responsible for his own death or taken poison in order to implicate the Russian authorities.The Kremlin has denied any role in Mr Litvinenko's death. Among the other theories is that it could have been the work of rogue elements in Russia's intelligence services.Also today, a Russian newspaper reported that Yegor Gaidar, a former prime minister who fell seriously ill in Ireland the day after Mr Litvinenko's death, remained certain he was poisoned.The 50-year-old liberal economist, who served briefly as prime minister in the 1990s under the then president, Boris Yeltsin, and is a leader of a Russian liberal opposition party, was taken to intensive care in Ireland but has now recovered.In an article published in the Vedomosti daily, Mr Gaidar said his sudden symptoms - fatigue, bleeding from the nose and mouth, vomiting and loss of consciousness - had to have been caused by poisoning, although he excluded the possibility that Russian authorities could be responsible."That means that more likely than not, someone among the open or hidden enemies of the Russian authorities, those who are interested in a further radical deterioration of ties between Russia and the west, stands behind this," he said.
