Nick Clegg will on Thursday take the high-risk step of publicly vetoing a Conservative plan to automatically jail any offender caught in possession of a knife for a second time.The deputy prime minister says he will not allow the government to support "headline-grabbing solutions" in the aftermath of the murder of the Leeds schoolteacher Ann Maguire.Writing in the Guardian, Clegg argues that such draconian measures could "turn the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow".His stance, confronting the law-and-order agenda of his coalition partners, is a risk at a time when the Liberal Democrats are already facing a possible drubbing in the local and European elections.Nevertheless Clegg describes the measures drawn up by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, as "a step backwards that will undermine the government's rehabilitation revolution".The challenge opens up the possibility of another big split in the coalition with at least 40 Tory backbenchers demanding that their party fulfills the 2010 manifesto pledge which states that "anyone convicted of a knife crime can expect to face a prison sentence".Tory backbenchers have already tabled amendments introducing automatic six-month jail sentences to the new criminal justice and courts bill for any offender caught in possession of a knife twice. Currently, about three in four of those convicted of a knife crime do not go to prison. The measures are due for debate in the next few weeks.Owing to the dispute within the government Cameron has not yet said how Conservative ministers will respond to the amendments, but if he fails to back Grayling a large Tory rebellion is likely and it could isolate him. Grayling has the support of the home secretary, Theresa May, and the education secretary, Michael Gove.Last week Clegg was infuriated when letters on the subject, signed by two Liberal Democrat ministers, were leaked, probably by Conservative sources, showing the Lib Dems refusing to discuss the Grayling knife plan and raising objections.Clegg has now decided to in effect conclude discussions in government by ruling out any Lib Dem support for automatic jail sentences for carrying knives.The leak last week was incendiary since it occured the day after Maguire was knifed to death in her school, prompting Liberal Democrat claims that the Conservatives were playing politics with the death of a popular schoolteacher.Clegg, in his Guardian article, referring to the knifing, says: "Everybody has been shaken by the death of Ann Maguire and the notion that any teacher should lose their life in the classroom. It was especially poignant because she was clearly such a widely respected and loved teacher. But in the aftermath of terrible events such as this we have to be careful that we don't simply reach for headline-grabbing solutions which don't necessarily work in practice."He says he opposes the introduction of a six-month mandatory minimum sentence for someone convicted for possessing a knife for a second time."This is a minimum of six months in prison for simply having a knife, potentially even a penknife, in your pocket. Not, as I've read in some press reports, for a number of offences involving a knife."Clegg also takes a swipe at Labour. He warns that if the party plays politics with the issue and backs the proposed law "just to appear tough in the eyes of voters and the rightwing press, it will be clear that they have learned nothing from their time in government when they let the prison population spiral out of control".The shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan said he was studying the amendments tabled by the Tory backbenchers, and would come to a view shortly, but there is strong pressure in the shadow cabinet to support the Tory-backed measure.The amendments have been tabled by the Tory backbencher Nick de Bois, who said: "Nick Clegg is quite wrong about this and has misjudged the public mood on this issue and of the house. He is right: legislation alone will not solve knife crime. There are many other additional measures, such as mentoring and education. But it is vital we send a clear message that if you have one previous conviction for carrying a knife and you are caught again, then you will have a jail sentence."The criminal justice bill is due to return to the Commons next week, but it is likely the specific measures on knife crime will not be debated for some weeks as the bill is carried over into the next parliament.Clegg stresses in his Guardian article that "prison is often going to be the right option and violent offenders who are a danger to the public ought to be behind bars". But he insists an automatic jail sentence cannot be right since sometimes gang members are forced to carry knives by their leaders.He argues: "Putting someone like that into prison could push them into the arms of hardened criminals, and let the gang leaders off the hook. Instead of prison, we need to divert vulnerable people away from gang culture."Last year there were 16,031 instances of a person caught in possession of a knife that led to action taken. Of these cases 28% brought immediate custody. The remainder were let off with softer options. More than 3,200 people got a caution or fine.
