Police cells will start housing convicts from Thursday as part of an attempt to head off the crisis in prison capacity, the home secretary said today.In a series of urgent measures announced on the first day MPs returned to Westminster, John Reid promised to convert former army barracks and a former secure hospital to boost capacity, after jail numbers reached their peak level this week.But the Tories condemned the situation as a "catastrophe facing the country", and condemned Mr Reid as "lackadaisical and slow to act".David Davis, the shadow home secretary, challenged Mr Reid across the despatch box in the Commons, saying that putting prisoners in police cells would be "costly and probably counterproductive".The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "Public safety is at stake because of government incompetence. These are stopgap measures which beg more questions than answers."In a busy first day back for Mr Reid - he also announced that the identity cards scheme would be rolled out over the next ten years at a cost of £5.4bn - the home secretary told MPs in an emergency statement that two women's prisons are now to take male prisoners.Mr Reid said that the current high prison population of 79,819 was due in part to increased use of indeterminate sentences to keep dangerous people in jail longer and in part to the decision not to release foreign prisoners until they were considered for deportation.Mr Reid informed MPs that negotiations were under way to convert a former army barracks and the former secure hospital Ashworth East into prisoner accommodation.In addition, 300 places are to be added to those used by the immigration service by next March, with a further 400 following by 2008.The home secretary told MPs that the law is to be changed to make the deportation of criminals easier and that incentives are to be offered to persuade prisoners to return voluntarily to their own countries. "Maximum flexibility" will be provided for transfers to open prisons, focusing on lower-risk offenders, he said.Mr Reid said that he will implement the formal use of police cells - known as "Operation Safeguard" - to hold convicts from October 12.Mr Davis told the Commons that the crisis had arisen because the government was "derelict in its duty to protect the public".He also warned that moving prisoners to open jails will involve "sanctioning an increase of risk to public safety".Mr Reid began by saying that, despite advice recommending it, he had ruled out freeing prisoners early as part of his emergency plans.In the last overcrowding crisis in 2002, David Blunkett, then the home secretary, made room by twice extending the "home detention curfew" electronic tagging scheme to allow prisoners to be freed early.Using police cells cost the prison service more than £360 per prisoner per night under Mr Blunkett.The Home Office is due to issue updated figures for the prison population for England and Wales after it hit an all-time high on Friday at 79,843, in theory leaving just 125 spare places for new inmates.The figure dropped slightly over the weekend, said a Home Office spokeswoman, but she refused to reveal the jail population total, saying that the figure was only published on a weekly basis.Nacro, the crime reduction charity, called on Mr Reid to issue a circular to courts asking for restraint in the use of imprisonment.The group's chief executive, Paul Cavadino, said: "The government should follow the lead of a previous home secretary 26 years ago when a prison officers' dispute led to jails refusing to admit prisoners."The then-home secretary, William Whitelaw, issued a circular to courts asking for restraint in the use of imprisonment for less serious offenders and remand prisoners."The courts responded positively and the numbers in custody fell by 4,000 in three months."Similar action now would reduce the need to resort to the wholly undesirable option of using police cells to hold prisoners."He added: "Low-risk offenders near the end of their sentences could be released to supervised accommodation run by voluntary organisations."This would be much more likely to reduce reoffending than holding prisoners in police stations, which have no facilities for education, rehabilitation or drug treatment."Although the government has a building programme to create another 8,000 prison places, they will not come into use until 2012.At the weekend a confidential memorandum was leaked, disclosing that Mr Reid was prepared to "take the risk" that there would be more prison escapes as a result of the scheme.The briefing memo by Fiona Radford, Governor of Ford open prison in west Sussex, dated August 3, disclosed that secure prisons had been ordered to identify inmates who could be transferred to open conditions.Ms Radford said that she had warned the director-general of the prison service, Phil Wheatley, that "almost inevitably" there would be more escapes from open jails, but he had made clear that ministers had accepted this was a price they would have to pay.Gerry Sutcliffe, the junior home office minister, insisted that no violent or sexual offenders would be transferred to less secure jails and that all inmates would be assessed to ensure that they were not a risk to the public before being moved.
