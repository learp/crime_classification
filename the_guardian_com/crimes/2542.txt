A father has been jailed for eight years after killing his baby daughter when she would not stop screaming as he tried to play a computer game.Mark Sandland, 28, who had shaken five-week-old Aimee-Rose during a sudden loss of temper, sobbed as he was sentenced.He had claimed he suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him at their flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.But police who searched the home after Aimee-Rose was rushed to hospital found a PlayStation on the sofa opposite the TV.Prosecutor Sally Howes QC told Lewes crown court on Monday that Sandland's mobile phone internet history showed he logged on to a website offering tips on how to play Assassin's Creed 3 on the device at 2.22pm.The step-by-step instruction meant there would have been little point accessing it unless the game was being played, she added.Sandland had been charged with murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent, which was accepted.Sentencing him at Hove crown court on Wednesday, Mr Justice Sweeney said that after he inflicted the injuries, Sandland lied and sought to cover up his actions.He said: "Frustrated with the game and with Aimee-Rose screaming, you lost your temper and you assaulted her, gripping her torso hard and violently shaking her."Whilst it's impossible to identify the precise detail of what you did, the injuries that you caused Aimee-Rose speak for themselves."The girl had suffered bruising to her face, chest, abdomen, hip and lower limbs. She also had a range of other injuries, including bleeding on the brain.About 16 minutes after Sandland logged on to the website, he dialled 999.Mr Justice Sweeney told him: "Whilst you have no recollection now of the fatal incident, it's obvious that at the time you appreciated what you had done and in consequence lied and sought to cover up what had actually happened."You pretended on the phone that you had a fit. You turned off the television to cover up the fact that you had been on the PlayStation."Thereafter you continued to lie and cover up to those who were trying to treat Aimee-Rose, although I stress that they wouldn't have done anything different if you had told the truth, and to the police."The judge said there were a number of aggravating features, including the fact that Aimee-Rose was a vulnerable child of five weeks.In addition, he said Sandland was in a position of trust, made repeated false accounts to cover up his actions and had shown no real remorse.The judge accepted it was a "momentary" attack without premeditation and that Sandland had sought emergency help. Sandland will serve half his jail sentence before being released on licence.
