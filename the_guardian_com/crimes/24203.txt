DNA samples saved by a change in the law in 2001 have been matched with material from crime scenes in nearly 8,000 cases, the government said yesterday.The controversial change, which was criticised by civil liberties groups, allowed samples taken from suspects who were later acquitted to be retained.Since 2001, forensics teams have made 7,990 DNA matches against samples which previously would have been destroyed. Home Office minister Andy Burnham told a select committee that matches had been made in 96 murder investigations, 50 attempted murders and 116 rapes.
