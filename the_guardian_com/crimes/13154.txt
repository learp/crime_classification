A teenager was charged today with murdering her boyfriend hours after collecting her A-level results. Katherine McGrath, 18, was arrested after Alyn Thomas was found dead last Friday in Bridgend, south Wales. Police and an ambulance crew were called to a house in the Brackla area of the town in the early hours. McGrath is understood to have been out celebrating on Thursday after picking up her A-level results. Thomas, 22, from Cymmer, Neath, had written messages to her on MySpace. One last month said "I love you" 12 times. She was due to appear at Bridgend magistrates court.
