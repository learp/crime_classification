A man has been given a hospital order after killing his 95-year-old mother with a wrench because he claimed she told him she wanted to die.Staffordshire police said David Powell, 74, planned to take his own life after the attack but could not go through with it.Powell was given a hospital order at Stafford crown court after admitting the manslaughter of Cecilia Powell at her home in Penkhull on the grounds of diminished responsibility.The court heard Powell called police at about 8pm on Thursday 9 April to report his mother’s death. He told police that he had killed her an hour earlier.But Powell, of Barlaston, Staffordshire, later said he had killed her three days earlier.DI Andy Maxfield said: “Mrs Powell’s death was particularly tragic as she was killed by her own son, the person who had once been her carer.“Powell claimed that his mother had expressed a wish to die and that his intention had been to end her misery and die with her as he felt unable to cope. He claimed he could see no other way out.“This has been a very upsetting case. Powell found the burden of caring for his mother too much to bear and did not feel able to carry on.“For an elderly woman to die in such violent circumstances is extremely sad. Nobody deserves to end their days like that.”
