The family of a young jockey who died in a suspected arson attack has said his dream was to be the "next Frankie Dettori".Jamie Kyne, 18, from Ireland, was killed along with fellow jockey Jan Wilson, 19, from Forfar in Scotland, when fire ripped through flats in Norton, near Malton, North Yorkshire, on Saturday morning.Wilson's family paid tribute to their daughter today, describing her love of riding. "She did indeed live the dream, if not for long."Kyne's mother, Madaline, issued a statement with his brothers Francis, Jason, Brandan and Daniel, and his sister Cassandra. "We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who have sent best wishes and supported her and her family at this most saddening time."It is a testament to Jamie who has been taken from us in the most heartbreaking way, that even on his passing he continues to make us all so proud of him."Jamie succeeded in all he chose to do, from hurling to boxing, to chasing his dream of becoming the next Frankie Dettori."He is, and will continue to be, a role model for us all."Why Jamie was taken from us we will never know but an angel like him deserved a better chance of life."He was an idol to all of us and we would like this opportunity to send our sincere condolences to Jan Wilson's family who are suffering like us."Wilson's parents, Drew and Margaret, said: "She was a bubbly person and mixed with everybody, she was also very determined and totally fearless in the saddle.  Jan Wilson also died in the fire.

Kyne and Wilson were on the second floor.Their friend and fellow apprentice, Ian Brennan, was in the same flat and jumped to safety as the fire ripped through the building at 2.15am. The 20-year-old was released from hospital and went on to ride at Thirsk on Saturday.A fourth person in the block, Dean Pratt, an Irish apprentice jockey, was taken to York District hospital and treated for burns and smoke inhalation.A man in his 30s was arrested by North Yorkshire police and remains on police bail.
