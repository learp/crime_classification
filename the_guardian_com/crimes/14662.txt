The bishop to the Prison Service today backed penal reformers' calls for a thorough evaluation of prison privatisation.The Rt Rev Peter Selby, bishop of Worcester, said the government's policy of encouraging private companies to run jails could raise serious "conflicts of interest".Dr Selby questioned whether government plans to reduce the number of people in prison might be undermined by the involvement of firms for which a rising jail population would be in their commercial interests. He said: "If numbers in prisons need to be reduced - as most agree - is it helpful to create an interest in their growth among companies and their shareholders?"Are there some real conflicts of interest which we are likely to have to address: for instance, will judges and jurors have to be vetted to ensure that they do not have an interest in sending more people to prison?"More generally, if prisons become part of the 'commercial sector', do those running them have an interest in reducing regimes or staffing levels in ways that militate against the restorative aims of imprisonment?"The bishop's remarks came in response to a report published today by the Prison Reform Trust (PRT), which called for an "open and vigorous" debate about prison privatisation.The report - Private Punishment: Who Profits? - said there was a need to "reassess the merits of prison privatisation and the ethics of large companies profiting from the incarceration of thousands of people".The PRT director, Juliet Lyon, said: "Even those who believe that ethical or moral considerations about prison privatisation are misplaced or outdated should surely stop and think about the impact of prison privatisation on criminal justice policy and the treatment of offenders."The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Brendan Barber, backed the report, which raises concerns about private companies' lack of accountability to parliament and the public's inability to examine contracts signed with the Home Office.There are currently 10 private prisons in England and Wales: Altcourse, near Liverpool; Ashfield, near Bristol; Bronzefield in Ashford, Middlesex; Doncaster; Dovegate in Staffordshire, Forest Bank, near Manchester; Lowdham Grange, near Nottingham; Parc at Bridgend, South Wales; Rye Hill, near Rugby and the Wolds at Everthorpe, East Yorkshire. Another private jail is due to open at Peterborough in March.A Prison Service spokesman said there was "little that is new" in the PRT report. He added: "The fact that there were no self-inflicted deaths in privately managed prisons in 2004 says something about the safe environment being created. There is no evidence that private sector prisons deliver a reduced regime. In fact, they set the highest standards in this area."
