The key witness in the Damilola Taylor murder trial today denied getting details about the case from newspaper reports.George Carter-Stephenson QC, defending one of four youths accused of the 10-year-old's murder, read a report that described Damilola's blood flowing like a water fountain. The 14-year-old girl had initially used a similar phrase to police but later withdrew the comments. She told the court she had heard the phrase from the father of one of her friends. Mr Carter-Stephenson compared other similarities in what she told police to newspaper reports, but the girl denied reading the articles. But, when the lawyer suggested she had to tell lies because she was not there when Damilola was attacked, the girl retorted: "I know what happened on that day - they know what happened on that day." Damilola died after being stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle in November 2000 on the North Peckham Estate, south London, where he lived. The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack, which happened after a gang of youths tried to rob the boy. Two brothers aged 16, their 17-year-old friend and a 14-year-old youth deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob.The trial continues.
