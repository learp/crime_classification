Detectives on Merseyside were questioning a man yesterday who was arrested after he called police to say he had killed his parents.Officers found the bodies of Ted Mills, a 64-year-old recruitment manager for the RAC, and his wife Margaret, 62, at their home in Whiston, Merseyside, after a phone call on Sunday night. Postmortem examinations were being carried out. The man under arrest is believed to be the couple's son Robert, 31, but police have refused to confirm his identity. The family's dog is also believed to have been killed. The home was searched yesterday and officers made house-to-house inquiries. "They were a lovely couple," said a neighbour, Mary Schofield, 52. "It's horrible to think that they have met their ends like this. They had two grown-up sons and Robert lived at home with them." Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: "They were the kind of people you could trust. We left our keys with them and they would check our house when we went away." Police said inquiries were continuing.
