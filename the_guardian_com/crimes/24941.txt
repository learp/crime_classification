A Saudi Arabian student who died after being attacked on a footpath in Essex has been identified by police.Detectives are investigating the possibility that Nahid Almanea, 31, was targeted in Colchester because of her Muslim dress.She was attacked while walking on the Salary Brook trail on Tuesday morning. Paramedics tried to save her but she died at the scene from head and body injuries.The University of Essex student, who was living in the town, was wearing a dark navy-blue abaya, or full-length robe, with a patterned, multicoloured hijab headscarf.DS Tracy Hawkings said officers were keeping an open mind about the motive for the attack.Hawkings added: "We are conscious that the dress of the victim will have identified her as likely being a Muslim and this is one of the main lines of the investigation, but again there is no firm evidence at this time that she was targeted because of her religion."Officers are also looking at possible links with the murder of James Attfield, a vulnerable man with brain damage, who died after being stabbed more than 100 times in a park in the town in March.The Saudi Arabian embassy confirmed that Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz, ambassador to the UK, had contacted the woman's family and was in contact with Essex police.The University of Essex has informed all staff and students about the attack and reminded them of safety procedures, a spokeswoman said.She added: "Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the young woman who died, and we are deeply saddened by this tragic incident. The university is providing every possible assistance to the police."Anyone with any information should contact the major investigation team on 01245 282103, Essex police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.The university has opened a helpline on 01206 874333 to provide support for students, staff and others connected to the campus.
