A gay man was attacked and died after being subjected to homophobic taunts in Trafalgar Square, the Old Bailey heard today.Ian Baynham, 62, died from a brain injury 18 days after being punched to the ground on 25 September last year.He was confronted by two teenage girls outside South Africa House after they had been drinking, said Brian Altman, prosecuting.Baynham was with his friend Philip Brown and they were called "fucking faggots", it was alleged.After a confrontation, a youth who was with the girls punched Baynham to the ground, where the girls kicked and stamped on him "like a scene from Clockwork Orange", the jury was told.Joel Alexander, 19, of Thornton Heath, south London, Rachel Burke, 18, of Three Oaks, East Sussex, and Ruby Thomas, 18, of Lichfield, Staffordshire, deny manslaughter.Altman told the jury that Trafalgar Square had been the scene of a "despicable incident" during which Baynham was "brutally attacked"."One onlooker likened the scene of violence to the film A Clockwork Orange," he said."The story of this case is of an all too familiar and depressing tale of drunken loutish behaviour."Two of these defendants are teenage girls. Fuelled by copious amounts of alcohol, they confronted Mr Baynham with abuse."Together with Joel Alexander, they jointly participated in a violent attack on a defenceless man in public."Ian Baynham was openly homosexual. What led to his death began when Ruby Thomas hurled homophobic abuse at him and his friend Philip Brown."Altman said a confrontation between Thomas and the victim escalated when he slapped Burke.Alexander then felled Baynham with such force that he hit the back of his head on the pavement and became unconscious, he said."That did not suffice," he said. "There is evidence that the female defendants then began putting the boot into Mr Baynham, who was still prone on his back, clearly unconscious and in distress."Shocked onlookers saw repeated stamping to his chest and forceful kicks to his head."Altman said Burke repeatedly punched Brown in the face when he tried to stop her running into an Underground station nearby.The defendants, who were aged 17 and 18 at the time, also deny violent disorder. Burke denies assaulting Brown.The trial continues.
