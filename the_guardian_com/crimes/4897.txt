A promise by Scotland Yard to dramatically increase the number of specialist officers trained to help catch rapists and sexual abusers has not been met.In June the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said he would hire at least 200 more detectives to deal with the 60% rise in reports of rape and sexual abuse to police. But figures released on Thursday show that barely a quarter of that number of detectives have been hired, leaving specialist investigators overwhelmed by their emotionally demanding workload.The pledge came after a report for the Met found specialist officers were facing burnout.According to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the Met’s specialist sexual violence units, known as Sapphire, had 440 officers when the pledge was made in June.The Met is understood to have asked the government for money to fund the extra officers and been rebuffed.By December 2015, only 47 new officers had been recruited for the specialist Sapphire units, not even a quarter of what the Met commissioner had said he was hoping to recruit by that stage.Hogan-Howe said in September 2015: “We would like to get them in place by the end of this calendar year.”The Met denies the delay has anything to do with officers being diverted to historical abuse investigations such as Operation Midland, the heavily criticised inquiry into claims of a VIP abuse ring.The figures were obtained under FoI laws by the Labour group in the London assembly. Joanne McCartney, policing spokesperson for Labour in the London assembly, said: “Last year the Met promised that 200 additional officers would be assigned to deal with the dramatic increase in reports of rapes and sexual assaults. By December however we had only seen a quarter of that delivered.“It’s clear that the shortage of detectives … is having a damaging impact on their ability to properly resource the Sapphire sexual crimes team. We need to see urgent action to rectify this.”The number of rapes and other sexual offences reported to the Met, Britain’s biggest police force, increased by more than 60% in the three years from 2012 to 2015. This is largely attributed to the Jimmy Savile effect, with more victims willing to come forward after the entertainer’s decades of abuse were revealed.McCartney said: “Positive efforts to encourage victims to come forward have resulted in significant increases in reported sexual crimes. The police now need to urgently match this with the resources to support victims and properly investigate these crimes. Anything less risks undermining the progress we have made and letting down the victims of these harrowing crimes.”The Met said it still intended to recruit the extra officers. In a statement it said: “Whilst some of these posts are for detectives, many of them are for sexual offences investigative techniques (SOIT) officers – these are specialist police constables responsible for taking initial accounts from victims and supporting them throughout the process from evidence gathering all the way through to disclosure at court.“We are in the process of recruiting officers to fill the posts and it is important selection for these key roles is rigorous.”Denying that the delay was related to historical abuse investigations, the Met said: “The recruitment of staff into the sexual offences exploitation and child abuse command does not affect specialist non-recent investigations, which are being progressed within a different department.”A review of how rape and sexual offences are handled by the Met and prosecutors was conducted by Dame Elish Angiolini QC. It found anxiety within the police and among prosecutors handling rape cases about the “overwhelming” workload. It said: “High levels of anxiety were observed in both organisations, which, unless additional resources are forthcoming, can only become worse as staff struggle to meet increasing crime reporting.”This in turn was leading to a lack of empathy among some detectives, the inquiry report said. “Some detective inspectors were concerned that the impact of burnout on those working in this field and of ‘compassion fatigue’ due to unacceptable workloads has left some officers incapable of recognising any but those they consider the most deserving of complainants,” it said.Only a minority of sex attacks are ever reported to police, and in turn only a fraction of attackers are convicted. It is estimated that 80% of victims do not report attacks.
