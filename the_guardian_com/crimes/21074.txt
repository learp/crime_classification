An 11-year-old boy stabbed his seven-month old nephew in the stomach, causing the baby life-threatening injuries, a court heard yesterday.The child, who cannot be named, denied attempted murder when he appeared before Hull crown court. He also denies wounding and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.The court heard that he stabbed the baby, who was crying in a carry cot, with a kitchen knife at his home in north-east Lincolnshire last December. He then allegedly hid the broken knife under a television cabinet.The baby was being cared for by his grandmother, as her daughter - the accused boy's sister - was suffering from depression and had been sectioned for her own safety under the Mental Health Act.The boy told police: "Without realising that I did, I stabbed [the baby] and didn't realise that I did until it had happened."A fortnight before the incident he was seen by his former teacher as he had missed a class. When she asked him why he had not been in class, he replied: "There's all sorts going on at home." He said it was noisy at home and that the baby was "doing his head in".Doctors described the baby's injuries as life-threatening, but he made a good recovery following an operation.The boy said he was stressed about school as he was being bullied, which made him mad and wound up. Gary Burrell, prosecuting, said at the time of the stabbing, the boy had felt "a bit like a volcano, an erupting volcano".The judge, Mr Justice Silber, said there would be frequent breaks during the trial to ensure the boy did not lose concentration. None of the barristers, nor the judge, wore wigs or gowns.Mr Burrell told the jury it was accepted by both sides that the boy stabbed the baby. "The sole issue is the extent of the child's mental element when he stabbed the baby."The boy's mother, who works full-time as a home help, described the noisy family and said there was no time to give her son any attention."I didn't really talk to him," she said. "I didn't have the time or energy to think about my own kids."The case continues.
