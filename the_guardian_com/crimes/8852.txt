Police have arrested one of their community support officers after allegations that he arranged vehicle number checks on behalf of activists in the British National Party.Andrew Matthews, 29, from Garforth, Leeds, was held in custody overnight after colleagues detained him when he arrived for work at Morley police station, West Yorkshire. The move followed the handing over of a dossier by the Yorkshire Post newspaper which also suggested that Mr Matthews was asked for information about criminal proceedings being taken against leading members of the rightwing group. West Yorkshire police have headed the investigation into alleged incitement to racial hatred by the BNP's leader, Nick Griffin, and a group of activists in Bradford. Another local case involves Karl Hansen, who stood for the BNP in Huddersfield at the general election and pleaded guilty last week to drugs charges.The dossier includes an alleged copy of Mr Matthews's BNP membership card. Police were forbidden to join the party in a directive in January from the Association of Chief Police Officers. West Yorkshire's chief constable, Colin Cramphorn, recently circulated a reminder. Nick Cass, the party's Yorkshire organiser, said yesterday: "We certainly wouldn't be asking anyone to check anything on a police computer, or anything like that. And certainly not a community support officer. They can't even carry handcuffs, let alone check computers. But if he's committed illegal behaviour, then that's his own problem." Sam Kirk of Unite Against Fascism in Leeds said: "We are pleased that the police are taking action."
