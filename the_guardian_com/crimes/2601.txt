Police hunting the killer of the French student Amelie Delagrange want to speak to four people who may have vital clues.The 22-year-old was bludgeoned to death on August 19 as she walked across Twickenham Green in south-west London, on her way home after an evening out with friends.Detectives fear her murderer may also have killed 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell in February last year, and carried out serious attacks on four other young women, all with blond or light brown hair.Ms Delagrange, who moved to London in June to improve her English, got off the 267 bus at Fulwell bus garage at 9.45pm, and was seen walking past the Loch Fyne fish restaurant in Hampton Road just before 10pm. As she crossed the green, she was struck twice with a blunt instrument on the head.Yesterday, Scotland Yard released CCTV pictures of four bus passengers - three men and a woman - who could prove crucial to the investigation. Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Murphy, heading the murder inquiry, said: "They may have seen something, but are not aware of how important it is."Four men have been arrested in connection with the inquiry. Two have been bailed until next month, while the others are in a psychiatric hospital for assessment under the Mental Health Act.Last month, the victim's friends and family planted a tree in her memory near the spot where she died.
