We are appealing to Josh's friends and the community to come forward and help us find his killers."Someone out there must know who is responsible for this murder."Close friends of the victim left tributes at the murder scene on Tuesday and spoke of their grief.Azra Valentino, 18, said: "He wasn't meant to go like this. We're all just shocked. When I see this, I can't believe it really. I'm just shaken up. I don't know what to do."Josh was the last person who you'd think would be on the news for a death or something, he wasn't like that. He got caught up in it."Another of Joshua's closest friends, who did not want to be named, laid a pair of trainers and a jumper he had owned among the cards and flowers left at the scene."I ain't feeling good at all," he said. "He was my best friend. He got stabbed. He lived with me here a little bit, he stayed with me here a couple of times."The distraught friend described Joshua as "a good youth at heart" who loved music, particularly rapping."This made me realise what life is seriously really about," he said. "I lost someone close to me. He had a lot of friends around here. Josh has got a lot of friends, this is what people don't know."The murder investigation was launched after Joshua was pronounced dead at the scene at 1.26am on Tuesday.
