A police force has admitted more than £100,000 has been stolen from a "secure storage area" at one of its stations.Warwickshire police said £113,000 had disappeared from the designated site at its former headquarters in the village of Leek Wootton.The money was seized from criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act in 2009 and was linked to an operation that resulted in the conviction of three people in January 2010 for a variety of offences, including possession of firearms.The cash was reported as missing on 30 September last year and a confidential investigation began, carried out by the anti-corruption unit of Warwickshire police's professional standards department.No offenders have yet been identified, the force said, so a public appeal has now been issued.The force has formally referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which has decided it should be investigated locally. Warwickshire Police Authority has also been informed.All members of the force have been told of the theft, and anyone with any information is asked to contact Warwickshire Police on 01926 4150000 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
