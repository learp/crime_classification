An Algerian man lost an appeal today against his conviction for murdering a Special Branch detective during a bungled raid.Detective Constable Stephen Oake, 40, was stabbed to death after Kamel Bourgass was cornered in a flat in Crumpsall, Manchester, in 2003. The 31-year-old was involved in a ricin terror plot which saw him jailed for 17 years for conspiring to cause a public nuisance.Detectives believe he was planning to smear the chemical, or other poisons, on the door handles of cars and buildings in the Holloway Road area of north London.His lawyers told the court of appeal sitting at Woolwich crown court that details about the ricin plot should not have been used in the separate murder trial.But in a hearing today at the Old Bailey, judges told Bourgass, who heard proceedings via a translator and appeared via videolink, that he had lost his appeal.Lord Justice Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Newman, said evidence about the ricin explained to the jury why he was so determined to evade capture, refuting the argument that he had acted in self-defence. Without it, the jury would have been left speculating as to why he wished to "take on" a large number of police officers unless he was fearful they might "do him serious injury".In a written judgment, he said: "In our judgment the ricin material was directly relevant to the issues being decided by the jury, enabling them to consider evidence rather than indulge in what would have been uninformed speculation about why the appellant behaved in the desperate fashion he did." The mere fact that it "served to make a strong case stronger" did not make it inadmissible.The court acknowledged concerns about "the spirit of the times and deep public concern about the risk of mass murder by a terrorists or terrorists"."Nevertheless, we cannot see any basis for interfering with the discretionary element of the decision to use the ricin material," Lord Justice Judge said.The judges also dismissed further grounds of appeal, relating to the mishandling of the Crumpsall raid and alleged racism on the part of police officers. They also ruled against a "remarkably tenuous" suggestion about "incriminating material" found during an earlier raid in Wood Green, north London, being attributable to a second man, Mohammed Meguerba.Bourgass's lawyers applied for an adjournment in order for this to be clarified but the court held that it was not of the "remotest possible relevance" to the case.In the raid, officers discovered thousands of pounds in cash, hand-written recipes for poisons such as ricin and cyanide, and bottles containing chemicals. The Wood Green search eventually led to Bourgass's separate conviction over the ricin plot.The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, welcomed today's decision, saying "the prosecution has been vindicated in its approach to this case"."It was entirely right the jury was told that Bourgass knew he had left a mountain of evidence in the Wood Green flat and that this was the key motivation for him to launch his murderous attack. He was convicted of murder on overwhelming evidence." Mr Macdonald said the thoughts of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) were with the family and friends of Mr Oake who was "cruelly and brutally murdered while doing his job and protecting others". "The family's humanity, compassion and support throughout an extremely difficult and complex case is something all those at the CPS who met them will long remember."
