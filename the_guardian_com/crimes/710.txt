Almost half of Britons admit they sometimes don't feel safe in their own homes and list their top worries as noisy streets, unexpected visitors and being alone at night.A report from Halifax Home Insurance published today also reveals that residents' top property fears are burglary, theft of belongings outside the home, and the trauma of suffering a fire.Casting a nostalgic eye to the past, nearly half of the 2,000 people questioned named the 1950s as the safest 10-year period. And the 65+ age group who would remember it best were the firmest in their view, with three-quarters claiming it was the safest era.The Peace of Mind index – the first in a new series of quarterly reports – provides a research-based ranking for how secure and safe different sectors of the UK population feel at home.Nearly half (43%) of Britons admit they sometimes don't feel safe at home. Other top worries include noisy streets (cited by 29% of respondents), unexpected visitors to the door (27%), and being alone at night (18%).Analysis of the independent research commissioned by Halifax and of the British Crime Survey data led to the creation of seven "Peace of Mind" indicators made up of attitudinal and behavioural measures.Other answers given when asked what makes people feel unsafe when at home included: worrying about neighbours leaving doors and gates open; police sirens; youths drinking or smoking outside late at night; loud people outside; unexplained noises at night; unexpected visitors at the door; and even police helicopters hovering above.The index also highlights the aspects that help make Britons feel safe in their homes. The majority of respondents (74%) feel reassured knowing all doors and windows have security locks on, more than two thirds (67%) feel safer having a partner or family member in the home, and more than half (51%) feel secure knowing there is a landline telephone in the property. A quarter of respondents said they were reassured by having a dog in the house.
