Sweeping changes in the way DNA is stored on Britain's national database are likely to be introduced following an ethical review. The first move would prevent police from indefinitely storing DNA samples provided voluntarily by witnesses to eliminate themselves from investigations, a move that would affect thousands of people.Lawyers and academics who began examining the database's operations last year are also to scrutinise the police's retention of DNA profiles from individuals accused, but later cleared, of crimes. This month the European Court of Human Rights Court is to deliberate on a British case in which two individuals cleared of crimes failed to get their DNA taken off the national database.The Home Office is also reviewing Britain's National Database and is considering proposals to expand the range of crimes for which people would have to give DNA - from major recordable offences to non-recordable, less serious ones. The country's database is, per head of population, the world's largest with 4.25 million profiles. The proposed changes would further expand that database, a move even the police oppose.'The public has a high level of confidence in DNA as a crime-fighting tool but if we start taking it from people involved in minor crimes, like traffic offences, that could work against us,' said Tony Lake, head of forensics for the Association of Chief Police Officers, and chief constable of Lincolnshire.
