Criminal cases could be dealt with in days or even hours under plans to bring in "swift and sure justice", ministers will say on Friday.There are plans for speeding up the criminal justice system, using more video-link technology, encouraging magistrates courts to conduct trials in the evenings and at weekends, and enabling JPs to hear cases in community centres.Some proposals have been inspired by the emergency court hearings held during last summer riots.Solicitors, however, oppose the idea of extended working hours becoming a regular duty.The policing and criminal justice minster, Nick Herbert, will say: "It is a basic principle of justice that it should be delivered without delay, yet straightforward cases that could be dealt with in days or even hours are taking weeks and months. Justice delayed is justice denied, and victims are the biggest losers."The response to the riots showed us that the system can move much faster … this new focus on delivering swift and sure justice will support the police, give communities a voice, and reduce crime."Video links for defendants and witnesses appearing in court will become routine.Shoplifting cases currently taking five weeks should be dealt with in 13 days or fewer where guilt is admitted and virtual courts are used, the white paper will say.Single magistrates should be allowed to sit outside courts, probably in community centres, to dispense justice in low-level, uncontested cases, the document will also suggest.Community sentences will be toughened up by introducing a punitive element in every sentence and making those on unpaid work do a full working  week.In response to criticism of the rapid increase in the use of cautions and other out-of-court disposals, the ministry of justice and the Association of Chief Police Officers are drawing up a simplified "justice test" to ensure crimes are dealt with appropriately.Local magistrates will also be given a supervisory role in scrutinising the use of summary justice by officers. Concerns have been voiced by senior judges about the deployment of cautions for incidents involving sex offenders or those previously convicted of violence against the person.On out-of-court disposals, ajustice ministry spokesperson said: "We know there have been problems, and we are determined to address them."We have swept away all targets in this area, in line with our intention to give back discretion to professionals such as police officers and we are working on clearer guidance to help ensure that out-of-court disposals are used appropriately and effectively."John Fassenfelt, chairman of the Magistrates' Association, welcomed the anticipated changes, but warned: "While most of our members will be pleased to see a role for single justices to deal with low-level uncontested cases, we are concerned about ... judicial independence and that such powers for this role should be for the judiciary only and not delegated to justices' clerks."
