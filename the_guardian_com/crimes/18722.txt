A mass murderer who helped carry out one of Northern Ireland's most horrific terrorist attacks was a suspected police agent who allegedly received a £50,000-a-year "salary" after being freed from jail, it was claimed yesterday.Torrens Knight, 36, was part of the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Freedom Fighters gang which sprayed a Co Derry pub with bullets, killing eight people and injuring 19, in the "trick or treat" massacre on Halloween night 1993.He was jailed for life after admitting his role in the atrocity at the Rising Sun bar in the village of Greysteel and the murders of four Catholic workmen in nearby Castlerock seven months earlier, but walked free from the Maze prison in July 2000 under the Good Friday agreement.Now Nuala O'Loan, the Northern Ireland police ombudsman, is investigating allegations that Knight, said to have become a born-again Christian while in jail, was a police informant. The ombudsman's team is also investigating claims that a gun later used in the Greysteel murders was moved before police could recover it.Informed sources told the Press Association in Belfast that cash was lodged in a bank account set up for Knight, and staff told he was employed by a Scottish firm as an engineer on a £50,000-a-year salary.But the arrangement ended after two payments - it is unclear just how much money Knight may have received. The ombudsman's office has been told anglers stumbled on high-powered rifles, belonging to the UFF, after the Castlerock shootings but police failed to find them after a search along the Agivey river.It has been alleged that a Special Branch officer moved the guns to protect Knight's identity. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has refused to comment on the claims.Meanwhile, Sir Hugh Orde, the Northern Ireland chief constable, told the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee yesterday that intercepted telephone calls should be admissible as court evidence against organised crime gangs.
