After Cheltenham magistrates allowed identification of a youth against whom an Asbo had been granted, the local council issued a press release that not only named him, but gave the street in which he lived. It claimed he had been responsible for "a reign of terror" in his neighbourhood. The release said the boy was found to have been violent, abusive, insulting, racist, threatening and intimidating on several occasions. It listed other allegations, including shoplifting, assault, robbery and riding vehicles on grassed areas. The 16-year-old, who would not have been identified by a youth court, was initially banned for 10 years from entering the area where his anti-social behaviour was said to have taken place. On appeal, this was reduced to five years. Between April 1999 and March 2001, 215 Asbos were issued in England and Wales.
