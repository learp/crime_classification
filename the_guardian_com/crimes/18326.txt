Police investigating an attack on a young boy who was found in a wood with serious neck injuries have charged a 12-year-old girl with inflicting grievous bodily harm and of attempting to pervert the course of justice.Anthony Hinchliffe, who is five, was discovered wandering alone with ligature marks around his neck and bruising to his body after he went missing from the back garden of his home in Dewsbury on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for west Yorkshire police said last night the girl had been placed in the care of a youth offending team and would appear at Dewsbury youth court on June 10. She added that detectives were no longer looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Five children - all aged between 11 and 12 - were arrested in the course of the inquiry, which detectives initially treated as an attempted murder. A boy and girl, both aged 11, and two 12-year-old boys were released without charge. Anthony's mother, Terry Brown, 32, yesterday made a direct appeal to anyone who had any knowledge about the incident to contact the police. She said the past few days had been "very distressing" for herself and her family. "One of my main concerns, now that I have Anthony back with me, is for anyone with any information that could help police to come forward. If you know anything at all, please call," she said. Specially trained police officers are now interviewing Anthony in an effort to discover how he came to leave his home and end up half a mile away in the wood, known locally as Devil's Ditch. The incident took place 24 hours after the BBC screened the film Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, in which Kevin Costner rescues a young boy from the threat of hanging. In 1999 the film was linked to the death of an eight-year-old boy in New Zealand.
