Children as young as nine are flocking to join violent street gangs and taking part in crimes such as drug dealing, theft and even murder. Alarming figures suggest there are now as many as 30,000 gang members across England and Wales and the numbers are rising rapidly. The number of gang members aged under 16 has doubled in the past year and nearly half of all gang murders committed with firearms now involve victims under the age of 18. London, Birmingham and Manchester have the most extreme problems, closely followed by Liverpool, Leeds and Bradford, while other towns and cities are increasingly experiencing problems associated with gang culture. Steve Shropshire, an expert on gangs and youth culture and co-author of a new report that highlights the problem, said: 'Young people are being drawn into the gangs and crews in ever increasing numbers and the average age of new members is falling dramatically. The gang culture is now inextricably linked with gun violence.' Many gangs are sophisticated and some have access to private doctors who will treat gunshot wounds without reporting the incident to the police. Increasingly, he reports, gang activity is centred around schools. A typical secondary school in a gang area will have up to 20 hardcore members among the pupils, 30 or 40 associate members and up to 100 or more who are marginally involved. The members listen to gangsta rap and idolise the heroes of films like Scarface, Goodfellas and Menace II Society, adopting their values and some of their language.
