An inquiry report published today found no one was to blame for leaving a man known as the "Camden Ripper" free to murder three women.Psychiatric patient Anthony Hardy received three life sentences at the Old Bailey in November 2003 for murdering and mutilating prostitutes. He dumped body parts in dustbins near his north London home. Later several other women came forward to report they had been raped by him. A year-long inquiry, commissioned by the North central London strategic health authority, into the crucial decisions surrounding Hardy's health care treatment in 2002 found he had an untreatable personality disorder but was not mentally ill. The panel concluded: "Hardy's mental illness was purely coincidental to the murders." They said: "It is not the proper role of mental health services to contain people who may be violent but whose violence is not connected to the mental illness. On hearing this, Tina Harvey, who claimed she was raped by Hardy two weeks before he killed two of his victims in December 2002, said: "Sorry, I've just got to laugh." The former masseuse and mother of two claimed that when Hardy attacked her at his home, his eyes flashed in such a terrifying way that he could only have been mentally ill. She said: "Trust me, I know. My gut feeling is that he was mentally ill - those eyes. "He was trying to crush me and kill me. He was not the character of the personality disorder. It was of a mentally ill man."
