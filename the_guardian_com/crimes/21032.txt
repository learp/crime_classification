A man accused of ordering an underworld assassination that went disastrously wrong and left two hitmen dead has been arrested in Spain, police said today.Security firm boss Bobby Spiers, 40, who was arrested in Benidorm yesterday, is alleged to have been behind an attempted execution at the Brass Handles pub in Salford, Greater Manchester, in March 2006.The attempted killing was planned after Spiers suffered a "loss of face" during a petty dispute over admission to a Manchester nightclub, with a doorman, David Totton.Drinkers watching a Sunday afternoon football game on TV fled in terror as hired hitmen, Carlton Alveranga, 20, and Richard Austin, 19, burst into the pub and fired a volley of shots at their target.Totton and another man were hit and severely injured during the attack, which saw Austin fire six times. But when Alveranga's 9mm handgun jammed, locals turned on the pair and disarmed them.A known Moss Side gangster in the pub at the time is suspected of then shooting the two men with their own weapons, before they staggered outside where they were beaten by a mob as they lay dying.The two men shot inside the pub survived but steadfastly refused to cooperate with the police.Last year, Ian McLeod, a gang leader from Moss Side, and a convicted gun-runner, Constance Howarth, 38, from Salford were jailed for a total of 41 years at Preston crown court for their part in planning the botched hit.Spiers, from Prestwich, Greater Manchester, was wanted by police but fled abroad and did not stand trial.A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said: "A 40-year-old man has been arrested in Spain in connection with a shooting at the Brass Handles pub in Salford on Sunday March 12 2006."Following extensive inquiries by Greater Manchester police, Spanish officers arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder under a European arrest warrant."He is currently in custody in Spain awaiting formal extradition."
