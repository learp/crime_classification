Elaine Kerr says that her life has worked out well. At 33, she has a job she loves as a care worker in a day centre for people with learning difficulties; a nice flat in a good area of Glasgow and two young boys she clearly adores. But that is very far from the direction in which she was heading in her teens.Raised in Cranhill, one of the toughest areas of the city, Elaine started to hang around with a local gang when she was 14. They would get together in a local park or the stairways of nearby high-rise flats, taking drugs and drinking cheap alcohol.She remembers a rival gang member, a girl who carried a sword, and after a melee with that gang, Elaine needed six stitches in a head wound.At 15, Elaine and some of her friends were arrested for stealing car badges from "more or less every car in Cran", she says.The eldest of the group, a 16-year-old, was sent to court, but Elaine and the other younger members were referred to the children's panel. She was terrified at the prospect, but says the panel members not only put her at ease, but also listened to her.To her relief, they decided she showed real remorse and no further action would be required. It was a turning point for Elaine, who then buckled down at school and went on to college to study social care. She now sits on a panel herself and says she aims to "turn young lives around in the way that mine was turned".She sometimes goes back to her old neighbourhood in the east of the city. She knows the dangers the environment presents to youngsters, some of whom are born to drug-addicts for whom heroin will "always come first"."Helping kids in trouble, in any way I can, is the most rewarding thing I can think of. "I've been there and so can offer more than sympathy."
