More than 50 criminals had their sentences increased last year after they were ruled to be unduly lenient, the attorney general's office said today .The court of appeal ruled in four-fifths of the 71 cases referred to it that prison terms handed down by judges in England and Wales were too light. As a result, 52 offenders had their jail terms increased, down from 75 in 2007.The attorney general, Lady Scotland, considered 274 cases in 2008 compared with 342 a year earlier.Scotland said: "The power to ask the court of appeal to consider increasing sentences is an important part of the law officers' role as guardians of the public interest. These cases are rare, but it is important that this safeguard is built into the criminal justice system, to enable the court to increase a sentence which is so lenient that the punishment fails to fit the crime and damages public confidence."Even if a sentence is not increased, the court can give appropriate guidance to judges in how they should approach particular types of cases in future."Sentences can be referred to the court if they are considered to fall outside the appropriate range.The number of cases referred is a very small proportion of the 80,000 dealt with by crown courts each year.Lord Justice Thomas, the deputy head of criminal justice, said: "The figures published today show that the system for the court of appeal to deal with unduly lenient sentences is working."The attorney general's power to ask the court of appeal to examine sentences which she thinks are unduly lenient is an important part of her independent role in representing the public interest."The attorney general can look at cases brought to her attention by prosecutors, victims and interested members of the public."In the small number of cases referred to it by the attorney general, the court of appeal decides whether the sentence is unduly lenient."The court of appeal also decides many cases where people convicted of criminal offences argue that their sentences are too severe."
