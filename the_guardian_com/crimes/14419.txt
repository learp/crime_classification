Kerb crawlers and pimps are targeted in a new government strategy on prostitution announced today.The new strategy, which abandons earlier proposals for licensed "red light" zones, cracks down on those who exploit prostitutes and their clients. It aims to create a safer environment for sex workers and prevent children being lured into the industry.The police are also to be encouraged to make more use of existing powers to confiscate driving licences from those caught kerb crawling more than once. First time offenders will be offered "kerb crawler re-education programmes".Under the strategy prostitutes are to be warned of violent clients in an expanded "ugly mugs" scheme that is already running in several areas.There will also be new penalties for loitering or soliciting for sex to help the courts direct prostitutes into treatment for drug and alcohol dependency, and more help will be offered to women who want to get out of prostitution.The definition of a brothel will change so that two or three prostitutes can work together in a bid to improve safety. Under current laws it is legal for one person - and no more - to operate from a flat as a prostitute.Announcing the plans, home office minister Fiona MacTaggart said: "I want to a tough approach to kerb crawling, combined with much better work to prevent children being drawn into prostitution and give those involved a route out."Just one town - Middlesbrough - is responsible for a quarter of all kerb crawling convictions, and ministers want to see its zero tolerance approach replicated across England and Wales. Ms MacTaggart explained why the government had rejected the idea of "managed zones" for prostitution, despite support for such an idea in some areas including Doncaster and Liverpool."I cannot accept that we should turn a blind eye to a problem that causes misery for people living in or near red-light areas," she said."There is no evidence that decriminalising or licensing prostitution would achieve our objective of reducing exploitation, improving the safety of those involved and making local communities safer."The move comes after the chief constable of Gloucestershire police, Tim Brain, rejected the plans for official red light zones because they would require a change in the law and evidence of their success in other countries was inconclusive. Dr Brain's report for the government, published in December 2004, noted that the number of women cautioned for street prostitution had fallen from 3,323 in 1993 to 732 in 2001, while the number of girls under 18 cautioned fell from 296 to just six in the same period. "The reality of it is that prostitution harms individuals, blights communities and fosters organised crime," Dr Brain told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."A very balanced approach, which the government has brought forward, means helping individuals, helping communities and tackling the people who abuse and exploit."But Niki Adams of the English Collective of Prostitutes told the programme: "I think the package is very similar to many other approaches we have seen in the past, which is really just to crack down on prostitutes. "With a crackdown on clients, the result will be an increase in criminalisation and an increase in rape and other violence. That's what we have seen every previous time that has been put forward. "Women have less time to check out clients and are forced further underground. Women are less likely to come forward and report rape and violence."
