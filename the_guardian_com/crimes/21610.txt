Domestic violence should be punished more severely than similar attacks against strangers outside the home, according to draft guidelines published by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales.The recommendation reflects a shift in public attitudes towards domestic abuse. Forty years ago police officers often ignored complaints by wives against their husbands.The new advice to judges says an offence in a domestic context makes it more serious because: “Domestic abuse is rarely a one-off incident; it is likely to become increasingly frequent and more serious the longer it continues, and may result in death.”The draft guidelines, if adopted, would replace existing sentencing directions stating that offences committed in a domestic context “should be seen as no less serious than those in a non-domestic context”.The Sentencing Council promotes greater consistency in sentencing across the courts while aiming to increase public understanding of the decision judges make.Its latest consultation includes, for the first time, recommendations for judges sentencing offenders for stalking and revenge pornography – the crime of disclosing private sexual images without consent in order to cause an individual harm or distress.More than 200 prosecutions for revenge pornography have been brought since the legislation came into effect two years ago. Offenders deemed to have the highest level of culpability are those who send images designed to maximise distress, for example if they have been sent to a victim’s family who are religious or to a victim’s young siblings.Setting up fake online profiles in the victim’s name, and uploading images and inviting comments or contact from the public that could result in a victim receiving abuse and “highly sexualised contact from strangers” are also listed.Recent changes to the law have doubled the maximum sentences for stalking and harassment from five years to 10. Maximum penalties for the aggravated form of the offences – involving a racial or religious hatred element – have risen from seven years to 14. Domestic abuse, the term now preferred by the Sentencing Council, is not an offence in its own right but, the draft guidelines say, “an element within a wide range of offences”. In assessing the seriousness of an offence, the draft guidelines say judges should consider that “the domestic context of the offending behaviour makes the offending more serious, because it represents a violation of the trust that normally exists between people in an intimate or family relationship”.The guidelines state: “Domestic abuse can inflict lasting trauma on victims and their extended families, especially children and young people who either witness the abuse or are aware of it having occurred. Domestic abuse is rarely a one-off incident and it is the cumulative and interlinked physical, psychological, sexual, emotional or financial abuse that has a particularly damaging effect on the victims and those around them.”Mrs Justice McGowan, a member of the Sentencing Council, said: “These offences can be particularly sensitive and distressing, leading to very significant harm to victims. The new guidelines we are proposing will help ensure sentences reflect the seriousness of these offences and take into account the increases in sentence levels for stalking and harassment introduced by parliament.”Welcoming the new guidelines, the justice secretary, Liz Truss, said: “Domestic abuse shatters lives and destroys families. It is right that our courts recognise this and that punishments properly fit these abhorrent crimes. “Tackling domestic abuse is a priority for the prime minister, so I am working with the home secretary to leave no stone unturned in delivering a system that protects victims and increases convictions.”
