The lord chancellor, Jack Straw, last night launched a strong defence of judges and magistrates whose decisions trigger huge political and media criticism, saying that they must be given the public space to make "desperately difficult decisions".He said the courts and parole board panels had to make decisions based on the information in front of them, and overwhelmingly they made the correct ones."Even so, they sometimes attract the opprobrium of the press, the public and, on occasion, politicians. They do not deserve, however, this criticism," he told parole board members in the David Hatch memorial lecture.It was essential to the integrity of the judiciary in a free society that trial judges and magistrates were left to pass the sentence they believed was appropriate, Straw added.As lord chancellor, Straw has a statutory duty to protect the independence of the judiciary. When he became the first elected MP to hold the post last summer, he emphasised his commitment to protect their judicial independence in public and in private.In his speech last night, he cited two "appalling" cases currently in the public eye which demonstrated the complexities of the task: that of Garry Newlove, who was kicked to death by a teenage gang including one youngster who had been freed on bail hours before; and that of Garry Weddell, who had also been bailed before allegedly killing his mother-in-law.The decision whether to grant bail to a defendant was always a difficult one for judges and magistrates, he said. "These must be independent judicial decisions based on the law as it is, and they do so to a very high standard." The lord chancellor added that he appreciated that that did not provide any comfort to the families of the victims involved.Such cases highlighted the "desperately difficult decisions" facing judges and magistrates, and it was no different for parole board panel members. Individual parole decisions have triggered protests in recent years after several high-profile cases where those released under licence have gone on to offend again.Straw said he wanted to create a "more stable and better defined arm's-length relationship" between government and parliament, and judges and magistrates. The new framework would also ensure that the parole board remained free to make "unfettered decisions on individual cases". The government's proposal to set up a judge-led sentencing commission to create an overall framework for criminal courts would not curb the discretion of judges in individual cases, he added.Significant reform of parts of the sentencing system might be needed to reach a more stable relationship between MPs, who allocate the resources for probation and prison services and set the criminal law, and the judges, who make the individual decisions, the lord chancellor said."This proposal has nothing to do with linking individual sentences to the availability of correctional resources," he added. "Respecting the independence of sentencers to pass the sentence they believe is appropriate in the individual case is essential to the integrity of the judiciary in a free society."
