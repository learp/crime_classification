The body of disabled man James Hughes was found hidden in a suitcase in the back garden of the family home, police confirmed last night.Detectives also confirmed that Hughes, who was 22 but had the mental age of a toddler, had been dead for some time.The news came as Hughes' stepfather, Brian Kirby, and an unnamed youth, who were arrested on suspicion of murder, were released without charge.Hughes and his mother, Heather Wardle, were reported missing last weekend. Wardle was found hanged on Monday near the family home in Redditch, Worcestershire, and the body of Hughes was discovered on Wednesday.Last night superintendent Jane Horwood of West Mercia constabulary said the body was in a suitcase "concealed among other items in the garden," adding: "The body was in a decomposed condition."She continued: "The post-mortem was inconclusive and we are awaiting the results of tests which we hope will tell us how long James had been dead and how he died. These are likely to take some time."Police are continuing to investigate reports of sightings in the last few weeks and months and it is still unclear when James was last seen."From the start, Hughes' disappearance was steeped in mystery. Police said that Wardle, 39, left the family home last Friday evening saying she was going to visit a friend. But they could not establish when Hughes had been seen last.The mystery deepened when neighbours said they had not seen Hughes for some time and it emerged that the family had broken off contact with social services, who used to help care for Hughes.Neighbours said that Wardle had appeared to be in some distress in the weeks leading up to her disappearance.Hughes, who could not fend for himself or walk unaided, lived in a terraced house in the Church Hill area of Redditch with his mother, his stepfather, Kirby, and three stepbrothers, Daniel, who is 17, Callum, eight, and Luke, six.Hughes' natural father, Paul Hughes, also lives in Redditch and until recently had seen him regularly.He paid tribute to Hughes yesterday, saying: "My son was the most beautiful of mother Earth's creations that I have had the privilege to meet."His aura of happiness and mischief was plain for all to see. He taught us that the strong should look after the weak and so much about what was important and what was not important in life."Paul Hughes, who does not have any other children, said that until recently he had enjoyed regular contact with James, seeing him several times a week.He added: "He was a happy-go-lucky soul and always had a smile on his face. He brought out the best in people he met, which is why I think it has affected so many people the way it has. Although he was 22, James retained the innocence of childhood and he was very, very precious."Hughes said that he had an awful feeling something had happened to his son as soon as he found out about Wardle's death. His son's death had left him "devastated and gutted."He added: "He was irreplaceable and it has left a massive hole in my life."
