Only 17 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales have so far fully implemented nationally recommended changes to the way they record crime, according to an Audit Commission report published today.The Whitehall public spending watchdog says that the continued differences in the way forces record crime mean that the figures on violent crime are the least robust of the official statistics. But it says that the overall headline crime figures, which show the number of offences falling in recent years, remain unaffected. Zoe Billingham, of the commission, said: "Our judgment is that official crime statistics are quite robust. But crimes against the person are less robust overall than crimes which are easier to define and categorise such as vehicle crime and burglary." The report says that the majority of police forces are not compliant with the new national standard, and a few still have some way to go. "Improvements have not been achieved consistently across the country and progress made in some areas has been offset by weaknesses emerging elsewhere." The changes to the way that the police record crime have been controversial. As single incidents of violence can be counted as more than one crime in some cases under the new standards, an underlying fall in the number of incidents appears as a headline increase in some kinds of crimes. But the Audit Commission's research does not support claims that the true crime rate has increased under Labour.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "These findings suggest that crime levels may be even higher than is now reported."But a Home Office minister, Hazel Blears, said the report showed there had been a significant improvement in the quality of crime recording in the last four years: "However, further work is needed."
