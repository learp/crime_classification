More than a dozen companies that "preyed on older people" through carbon credit scams – selling them as if they were shares or bonds, when they were worthless in that form – have been closed by the industry's regulator.Nineteen firms that attracted investments of nearly £24m from more than 1,500 people by offering "worthless" carbon credits – or certified emission reductions (CERs) – were wound up by the Insolvency Service in the last 15 months.The consumer minister, Jo Swinson, said the offending companies made money from carbon credit scams in which small investors were promised huge returns for trading permits that each offer corporations the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide.But the amount purchased by people, while costing a significant amount to individuals, was relatively too small to attract interest from big companies, who usually trade CERs in bulk.Swinson said: "This is a particularly contemptible scam as it not only preyed on older people trying to maximise their savings but also targeted their sincere desire to make ethical investments. Instead investors have been left out of pocket with shares that are either worthless or do not exist."In the last 15 months we have wound up 19 companies for trading in these non-viable credits and we will continue to take robust action against any more companies attempting this scam."According to the Insolvency Service the businesses targeted mainly older people – with most customers mostly ranging between 50 and 85 years old – and used high pressure sales techniques to encourage purchases. "Salesmen played on people's keenness to 'do their bit' to save the environment while making an investment at the same time," a spokesman for the service said."Investors were promised huge returns by selling these credits to corporate giants such as Marks and Spencer and British Airways. But instead most found there was no market for the relatively small amounts they held as companies that trade CERs only trade in high volumes."Eco Global Markets Limited, one of the companies wound up this summer, took over £8.5m from more than 230 investors, 50 of whom were aged over 70. In many instances the company led investors to expect returns of up to 42% on their CERs – an evaluation taken from a news article published in 2010 and long out of date. The company also sold more carbon credits than it had, leaving many people with nothing of value.One of the victims, an 89-year-old man, told investigators that the firm's salesman met him near his home twice – once at a train station, where he was encouraged to hand over £20,000 for 2,000 carbon credits.Caroline Abrahams, charity director for Age UK, said: "It is despicable that these companies seem to home in on older people as an easy target. Scams can take place on the doorstep, by phone, on the internet or through the post and the sad fact is that if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is."Our advice is if you feel under pressure to commit, then please just step away because any reputable company will allow you time to think an offer over. Anyone can be taken in by a scam so people should never be embarrassed to report a crime. If you feel you are or have been a victim speak to the police, a family member or friend."
