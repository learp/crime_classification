The father of a seven-year-old girl who allegedly died of starvation has vowed to find out how she was allowed to die and warned there would be 'repercussions' following her death.Ishaq Abu Zaire, father of Khyra Ishaq, said yesterday he was 'just as ignorant as everyone else as to what happened', but pledged to find out the truth. 'Once I know what happened, I promise there are going to be consequences and repercussions,' he said.Khyra and her five siblings are reported to have been in an emaciated state when paramedics went to their home in Handsworth last week. Angela Gordon, 33, and Junaid Abuhamza, 29 - Khyra's mother and her partner - have appeared in court charged with causing or allowing her death through neglect. Zaire said he felt let down by the authorities. 'I have a dead child and they did nothing,' he said. His words echo those of Isolene Clark, Khyra's grandmother, who said her grandchildren had been let down by the 'people who were supposed to protect them'.Their comments come as an independent panel convene in Birmingham to discuss how Khyra, who died last Saturday, could have been allowed to suffer such an appalling death.
