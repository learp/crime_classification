The parents of the missing four-year-old Madeleine McCann said today they were clinging on to the hope that their daughter was safe and being looked after by someone who wanted a child of their own.Kate and Gerry McCann said they hoped whoever was holding her would give her up voluntarily and leave her to be found in a safe place.Mr McCann told a packed news conference in Madrid that the couple had travelled to Spain to seek reassurance that there had been a "proactive" search in the country after Madeleine was taken from her bed in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on May 3.In a reference to the disappearance of a Spanish boy, Yeremi Vargas, in Gran Canaria in March, Mr McCann said he thought his daughter's case should be examined with other similar cases."I think it is at least worth exploring the possibility that Madeleine's disappearance should not be considered in isolation and in the context of other disappearances in the Iberian peninsula, even the Canary Isles as well."Mr McCann said cases of missing children should be investigated "in a pan-European fashion, the same way that other EU movements of people are considered."Earlier, the couple gave a series of interviews to Spanish television and media - including a missing people programme called Los Más Buscados (Most Wanted)."When we think about it, we pray that she is looked after and it is someone who wanted a little girl for their own who would look after her very well," Mr McCann said. "But we do not know who has taken her and it doesn't help us search for her."We believe it would be a member of the public who comes forward with information to the police. We also pray that the person who has her gives her up voluntarily and drops her at a church or a safe place".The couple were given a letter from the family of seven-year-old Yeremi. They seemed touched by the gesture and fought back the tears as they accepted the envelope from the television presenter Paco Lobatón.Mr McCann said that although Madeleine's abduction was a parent's worst nightmare, they had found comfort from their two other children, two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie.
