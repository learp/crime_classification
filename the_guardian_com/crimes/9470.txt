Drivers who kill may still escape prison under proposed guidelines for the new offence of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, brought in to counter public concern about such cases, it emerged yesterday.The sentencing advisory panel is recommending a starting point of a weighty community service sentence for the least serious of such offences. For the most serious, the starting point would be 36 months in prison. Aggravating factors such as speeding, driving aggressively or using a mobile phone would push the levels up from there.The panel produced sentencing guidelines yesterday for two new offences: causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving, which will carry a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment, and causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured, for which the maximum sentence will be two years in prison.These offences, created by the Road Safety Act 2006 and due to be brought into force this year, were a response to public concern that drivers who caused deaths but were convicted only of careless driving were being too lightly punished.Among sentences that caused an outcry were a £1,000 fine and a year's driving ban for lorry driver William Ishani, who killed a family of four, including a nine-month-old baby, and a £400 fine and six points endorsement for Waqas Ahmed, who reversed up the M25 in the dark without lights, killing two people.The panel plans to research public attitudes to driving offences before sending its final proposals to the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which will draw up guidance for judges. Martin Wasik, the panel's chairman, said: "In particular, we are keen to test public opinion on the difficult balancing exercise that needs to be carried out when sentencing an offender who had no intention to cause harm but whose actions have resulted in death."Yesterday's consultation paper also proposes new sentencing guidelines for two long-standing offences: causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, for which the maximum sentence has been increased by parliament from 10 to 14 years.The panel recommends that for the most serious offences the starting point should go up from six to eight years.
