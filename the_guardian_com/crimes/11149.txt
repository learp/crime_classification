The body of a Briton who was thought to have been kidnapped has been found on a beach in Spain.Francis Brennan, 25, from Anfield, Liverpool, was last seen in Alicante on 24 January when he was stopped in a friend's car by several men who posed as police officers. His body was found in the Le Zenia area of Alicante on Saturday and was formally identified by the Spanish authorities on Thursday.Brennan fled the UK ahead of a sentencing date last October for an assault he committed in the Thames Valley area in 2012.His girlfriend, Sophie Staunton, went out to Javea, Alicante, in December to persuade him to return home before he went missing a month later.In February, his parents, Carl and Janet, appealed to the British public and the British ex-pat community in Spain to come forward with any information that could lead to his safe return.A spokesman for Merseyside police said: "We can confirm that a body found on a beach in the La Zenia area of Alicante on Saturday was last night formally identified by the Spanish authorities as Francis Brennan."Francis's parents have been informed of his death and a family liaison officer from Merseyside police is providing them with support and advice at this difficult time."A live police investigation carried out by the authorities in Spain remains ongoing."
