Prison inmates have developed an ingenious contraption made of shredded rubber gloves, batteries and a very long piece of string to smuggle drugs and mobile phones into jail.Prison officers at Liverpool are taking measures to scupper a new technique that involves using shreds of rubber glove to catapult batteries attached to string or fish wire into a nearby cemetery.Children as young as 12 in the pay of local gangs wait for the batteries to fly into the cemetery and attach parcels containing illicit substances to the string. Inmates later hoist their catch over the prison wall."Drug dealers are using every trick in the book to ply their trade inside the jail," said Brian McMillan, head of security at the prison. "We have already achieved a great deal in terms of catching the smugglers and seizing contraband."We are going to install grilles to the outside of all 605 cell windows. [The grilles] will allow air and light through but the prisoners won't be able to cut through them and bring in packages from outside."We are also working to improve netting across the recreation areas."Another security officer at the jail said three teenagers were discovered attaching drug packages to the homemade reels in recent weeks, but authorities are focusing on the organised gangs behind the smuggling. Two sniffer dogs will also be placed at the prison full-time and a mobile phone detector should help catch inmates using illicit phones, officials said.
