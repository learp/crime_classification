Government plans to track convicted sex offenders released from prison via satellite would not prevent them from abusing children undetected, according to sex crimes experts.The satellite-tracking scheme, to be piloted in England and Wales later this year, would not alert police and probation staff to sexual abuse carried out in the home of a paedophile or that of their victim, said Derek Green, director of adult services at sex crimes consultancy Ray Wyre Associates (RWA).Mr Green said that satellite tags would enable the police to know whether a sex offender was breaching the conditions of their release by loitering near schools or hanging out in parks, but this offered limited protection as most child abuse is carried out in the home."It will make it easier to enforce sex offender orders as police and probation will be able to check whether an offender is hanging out in a park or near a school," he said. "But most child sexual abuse occurs in the offender's home, or the child's. If all you've got is a bleeping signal that someone is at home that's not much use. It's an added layer of security but it's not the solution to the problem."Donald Findlater, manager of Stop It Now!, a national helpline which provides advice to people concerned they pose a risk to children, said the tracking scheme would only be useful in monitoring highly predatory child sex offenders."It will be helpful in monitoring whether some offenders are going near certain high risk areas like schools," he said. "But for the majority of sex offenders it won't be that helpful. If an offender's going to the pub we won't have a clue who they're meeting, or if they're going to other places where there are children."Mr Green, a former manager at a residential treatment centre for sex offenders, conceded that the satellite tracking plan was "the only kind of response the government can have to allay public fear" about sex offenders in the community."Increasing external control over where sex offenders are going will make it easier to track whether or not they're meeting each other or arriving at places at the same time," he said.The home secretary, David Blunkett, said yesterday that he regarded the development of tough tracking measures to protect the public from offenders released from prison as a key part of Labour's third-term programme on law and order.The new satellite technology, which has been employed effectively in several US states, uses global satellite positioning equipment to enable police and probation staff to pinpoint the wearer to within three metres.Some versions can provide a day-to-day log of where the offender has been. This information can be used to help predict if they will offend again. As with existing electronic tags, the device is fitted to the offender's ankle but, instead of being linked to a telephone line in his home, it has a wireless connection to a mobile phone that must be carried at all times. If the phone is separated from the tag, an alarm is triggered in the probation service's monitoring centre. Mr Blunkett hopes that the technology will help ensure that the highest risk offenders stay away from locations such as school playgrounds, or particular addresses where they have been banned. But it will also enable the police to know whether they have been near the scene of a reported crime. But Mr Green claimed that such external control of sex offenders' movements needed to be paired with measures to help them regulate their behaviour.RWA has developed an alternative satellite tracking device with, called the SG-ROM (Sky Guardian Remote Offender Management), which would allow an offender to press a button on the tagged mobile phone to alert probation staff that they were worried they might reoffend.Mr Green said: "If the offender was feeling the urge or temptation to offend, they could press a button on the phone and be able to talk within minutes to a expert who could talk them down."RWA is currently seeking Home Office funding to pilot the tracking device.
