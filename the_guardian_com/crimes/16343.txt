The credit crunch threatens to bring to an end the longest recorded period of falling crime in living memory in England and Wales, Home Office criminologists said today.As the latest British Crime Survey (BCS) data was published today, showing a 10% fall in crime levels — equal to a 1m fewer offences — over the past year, officials predicted the economic slowdown would lead to "upward pressure" on levels of property crime, such as burglary and car break-ins.They also said many desirable consumer items, such as mobile phones and MP3 players, were inexpensive enough to be affordable but a shift in real wage rates could put them out of reach.The Home Office's chief scientific adviser, Professor Paul Wiles, said the 10% fall to 10.1m crimes, estimated by the BCS, continued the overall 48% decline in crime since it peaked in 1995.The figures for last year show violent crime down by 12%, car crime down 11%, vandalism down 10%, robberies down 16% and domestic burglary and personal theft stable.The only categories to show an increase were gun crime, with the number of incidents involving firearms up 2%, and drug offences, which rose 18% — an increase officials said was due to greater police use of their powers to issue warnings for cannabis possession.Wiles said the chances of becoming a victim of crime had fallen from 24% to 22%, and victimisation rates are at their lowest levels since the BCS began, in 1981.The survey also shows that the public remains sceptical about the accuracy of crime data, with two-thirds saying they believed national crime rates had risen in the past two years. But there was some comfort for ministers — only 39% of the public believed crime had risen in their area.Wiles said long-term data showing levels of worry about crime had fallen by a third since 1999, matching the longer-term drop in the crime rate.Drugs and the lack of parental discipline were the most commonly identified causes of crime.He said the fall in the crime rate in England and Wales since the mid-1990s had been mirrored by similar declines in most other western developed nations.The possible factors behind the historic fall in crime included: a decade of economic growth and prosperity; the global growth in anti-crime measures, including burglar and car alarms and better locks and bolts; and the shift in the demographic profile to a more ageing population.Under-16sThe BCS had been criticised for failing to include under-16s among its 40,000 interviews. The Home Office announced today they would now be included, though they did not expect the experience of 14 and 15-year-olds to be significantly different to the 16 and 17-year-olds. Under-16s had been excluded from the survey because it was thought improper to interview children without parental consent. Burglary and car crimeThe biggest falls in crime had been recorded in these categories of domestic burglaries, car thefts and thefts from cars. The number of domestic burglaries has fallen from 1.7m in 1996, to 729,000 in 2007/08 according to the BCS. Young males who are unemployed and single adults with children were far more likely to be burgled than those with a householder over 75. Homes with no security measures are 10 times more likely to be burgled than those with window locks and dead locks. The number of car-related thefts has fallen by 66% over the last decade to 1.497m in 2007/08 - a further fall of 11% over the year.Drug crimeThe BCS shows continuing falls in the use of illegal drugs by all age groups. Amongst younger people - those aged 16 to 24 - those using an illicit drug has fallen in the past year from 24% to 21%, despite the government's intention to toughen the criminal sanctions on cannabis. Although drug use is going down, police recorded drug offences rose by 18% to 228,000 in the year leading up to this April. But Home Office statisticians say this is a reflection of police activity against drugs rather than an indication of drug use.GeographyCrime is not evenly spread, with more than half of all robberies, for example, concentrated in just 29 mainly inner-city local authority areas. Recent trends show that crime fell in high crime areas at a faster rate than elsewhere – a 24% drop in 40 high crime areas compared with 18% elsewhere.FraudBanking industry figures published today show that credit card fraud is already beginning to balloon with 2.7m fraudulent transactions recorded in the last year, on UK-issued cards in 2007 - an increase of 20%. Much of this growth reflects the rapid expansion of online shopping.
