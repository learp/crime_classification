Violent crime by young people has risen by nearly 40% in the past three years. according to figures published yesterday.The Youth Justice Board said violence against the person by under-18s increased by 39%, from just over 40,000 offences in 2003-04 to more than 56,000 in 2006-07. Robberies committed by under-18s also saw a large rise - up by 45%, from 4,740 to 6,855 a year. Last night the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "So much for Labour's boast to get tough on crime and the causes of crime. This massive increase is not only causing misery for communities up and down the country but storing up some real problems for the future."The figures also revealed a steep rise in the number of crimes committed by girls, who committed 59,236 crimes in 2006-07, up by 25% from 47,358 in 2003-04. A study by the South Bank University, London, said that the rise might be due, in part, to raised intolerance towards girls involved in low-level offences, and partly to a rise in alcohol consumption.Susannah Eagle, joint author of the study, said most of the violent offences recorded were minor fights between girls, sometimes in school playgrounds. "We think that the response to girls by agencies - schools, police, other people - has changed, so girls are possibly being prosecuted for offences they weren't being prosecuted for before."Eagle said this could be due to a media focus on crimes involving girls and to a growing unwillingness among the public to intervene. "It is not just that girls are committing more offences," she said. "The population has increased, so you would expect to see more offences ... The other element is there may be some link between girls using alcohol and offences. But it is not the dramatic change the figures might suggest."The rise in crimes committed by girls compares with a 2% drop in offences by boys in the same period, although young men still commit most crimes.Around 16,000 girls were found guilty of violent attacks and nearly 20,000 of theft and handling stolen goods. One hundred and eighty were convicted of arson.Nearly 1,000 girls were convicted of drug crimes, nearly 1,500 of motoring offences and 5,964 of public order offences.
