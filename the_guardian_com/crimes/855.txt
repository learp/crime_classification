A dentist whose church in Northern Ireland urged him to confess to a double murder was given a minimum 20-year prison sentence today. Belfast crown court heard that 51-year-old Colin Howell must serve the minimum tariff before he can be considered for release.The bodies of Colin Howell's wife Lesley, 31, and Trevor Buchanan, 32, were found in a car filled with exhaust fumes in the village of Castlerock in 1991 in what appeared to be a double suicide. But the case was reopened last year when Howell handed himself in at a police station.Belfast crown court heard that he had kept the secret for almost 20 years before eventually confessing after his financial world collapsed when he lost £350,000 by falling victim to a scam about missing gold in the Philippines.Howell, a father of 10, was a highly acclaimed dentist and a lay-preacher. In 1991 he was having an affair with Hazel Buchanan and killed her husband and his own wife, making it appear a double suicide.In sentencing, Mr Justice Hart said that he had carried out "truly heinous crimes". He described the "cold-blooded, carefully planned and ruthlessly executed double murder of two people who Howell saw as standing in the way of his adulterous desire to be with Hazel Buchanan. (Stewart)"Each murder was carried out when the victim was asleep and thus entirely defenceless," he said.In his summary Mr Justice Hart said two innocent people were murdered and six children deprived of the love of their mother or their father."The reputations of their innocent parents, who had already been wronged by Mr Howell, were further stigmatised by the false implication that they had taken their own lives in a suicide pact".Mr Justice Hart said he had read victim impact statements from two of Howell's children, from Lesley Howell's brother, and from members of Trevor Buchanan's family which showed that many lives had been gravely affected for many years by the murders.The court was also told that, while the prosecution accept that Howell was not motivated by money when he committed the murders, he had been in financial difficulties at the time and profited financially from his wife's death.Howell inherited her estate and that of her father who had died a few days before, as well as receiving the proceeds of a number of insurance policies.As a result he received various sums amounting to just over £414,000.Hazel Buchanan later remarried, becoming Hazel Stewart. At the outset Mr Justice Hart clarified that Stewart had pleaded not guilty to both counts of murder. Her trial is due to begin on 7 February.The judge said he did not propose to refer to her alleged role in events leading up to, and during the murders, as this will be considered by the trial jury.Hart considered it was not necessary to await the outcome of Stewart's trial before fixing the minimum term which Howell must serve, as admissions had clearly set out his role.On Monday, Belfast crown court was told how Lesley Howell called out to her six-year-old son, Matthew, as her husband gassed her.Details of how Buchanan struggled with his killer before becoming overcome with fumes were also made public.
