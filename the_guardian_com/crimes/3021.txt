Plans to merge police forces across the country were dealt a severe blow last night with the announcement that two candidates for amalgamation had pulled out.The Cumbria and Lancashire constabularies - which had been keen to merge - were told there was no money for the move. Although this was widely taken to sound the death-knell for the entire project, the Home Office denied it was unravelling.The reform blueprint aims to help smaller forces in England and Wales which are struggling with global issues such as such as counter-terrorism.The merger had been the only one of the five proposed by the Home Office to be approved by the police authorities this year.But yesterday the police minister Tony McNulty called in the chief constables to explain that financial problems involved with merging the forces had proved insuperable.The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Ken Jones, told all chief constables: "The necessary financial support has not materialised and mergers, including voluntary ones, will not take place."But a Home Office spokesman denied that the merger programme had collapsed and the home secretary, John Reid, was preparing to announce the demise of the scheme. "John Reid does not want to force the merger on communities and people. He wants to do things thoroughly," the spokesman said. "Yes, there's a stumbling block, this is going to take some time to reach a situation where we have merged police forces."Our position remains we want to see police forces that can deal with the problems of 21st century policing. We will continue doing that through discussion and dialogue."The Cumbria and Lancashire forces said they were "intensely" disappointed.
