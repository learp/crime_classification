The Foreign Office was drawn into the row over the criminal records backlog today as the Tories demanded to know the role played by UK embassies in passing on information about Britons convicted abroad.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, wrote to the home secretary, John Reid, and to the Foreign Office asking for details of current arrangements.He also asked Mr Reid whether existing databases had been checked for other weaknesses after it emerged this week that 27,500 criminal files had not been entered on to the police national computer (PNC).The total included Britons convicted of serious crimes such as murder and rape overseas.The blunder raised the prospect of serious criminals being cleared to work with children and vulnerable adults because their crimes were not entered on the PNC, and therefore did not show up during vetting.The Conservatives said the Home Office had confirmed that consular staff notify the Serious Organised Crime Agency of the arrest of British nationals abroad, or their release from jail or deportation.In a letter to Mr Reid, released to journalists, Mr Davis wrote: "In relation to the 280 serious cases that you say cannot be entered on the PNC because you only have the names of the offenders, have you yet asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to cross-check those names and, if necessary, the countries where they are detained against the consular division's database?"I would have thought this would have been a first, basic check to undertake immediately given the serious issues of public safety at stake."In a statement to MPs on Wednesday, the home secretary said the Criminal Records Bureau will check whether any vetting reports sent to employers about the most serious offenders needed to be re-examined.He said he expected to be informed of the conclusions "in a matter of days".A spokesman said at the time that Mr Reid hoped to be able to update MPs on the findings by the end of this week, and he has called for an internal inquiry into the debacle.The future of two Home Office ministers - Tony McNulty and Joan Ryan - remains unclear after it emerged the department was warned three months ago about the problems with criminal records of Britons convicted abroad.Mr Davis's intervention came on the same day as Mr Reid revealed that the number of criminals absconding from open prisons is at its lowest level for 10 years.He said open jails serve an important purpose in preparing offenders to reintegrate back into society and that it is up to the Parole Board to assess whether a prisoner is suitable for one.Earlier this week, it was revealed that five killers have disappeared from Sudbury open prison in Derbyshire since November - with three absconding in recent days.
