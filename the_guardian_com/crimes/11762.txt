A man was arrested today on suspicion of the murder of a teenager who disappeared from her home in Lancashire almost 28 months ago.The 51-year-old man, who has not been identified, is being interviewed by police over the murder of Paige Chivers, who was 15 at the time of her disappearance from her home in Bispham, near Blackpool, on 23 August 2007, following an argument with her father.There have been no confirmed sightings of Paige and her body has never been found. However, several people have previously been arrested in connection with her death. It is thought Paige was struggling to come to terms with the sudden death of her mother, Sheila, 48, in February 2006, when she vanished.The man, who is from Blackpool, is being questioned by detectives in Preston. There is a Â£12,000 reward for information that would lead to identifying Paige's whereabouts or the conviction of those responsible for her disappearance. Searches are being carried out at premises in Blackpool and police have also seized vehicles for examination.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Rothwell, of Lancashire police's major investigation team, said: "This is yet another development in our ongoing investigation as we continue to try and establish what has happened to Paige. Today's arrest demonstrates that, despite the passage of time, we are still receiving new information and the investigation continues to move forwards."I would like to thank those people that have responded to media appeals for information and would continue to urge the public to come forward and call us, anonymously if they wish, as the smallest piece of information could prove to be very important. It is never too late to come forward."He said that Paige's family continued to live with the daily anguish of not knowing what had happened to her and faced their third Christmas without her."I would like to reassure them and the general public that my team are committed to finding out what has happened to Paige and today's arrest is just one line of inquiry we are currently following up. We continue to keep an open mind and look for evidence as to what has happened to Paige."
