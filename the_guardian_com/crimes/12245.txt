It was only a matter of time before the term "asbo" escaped the criminal world for wider pastures - and now it has happened, as poet Ian Killen discovered in a park in Hull.A couple of yells of "Asbo! Here, Asbo!" brought a short-haired, Staffordshire bull terrier dashing across the grass to fetch a stick for its owner - the first officially recorded dog in Britain to be named after antisocial behaviour orders. "It has quite a good ring to it, Asbo, doesn't it?" said Mr Killen, who has spent the year collecting dogs' names in Hull for a limited edition tea towel to commemorate the city's literature festival this week. "It's better than Twoc [argot for Taking Without Owner's Consent and one of the other 99 names]." The tea towel is a social document of disaffected Britain. Other names include drug abuse terms, several dozen gangsta and rapper references, and a dog called Burberry, after that central item of "chav" fashion style. "I was disappointed not to find a dog actually named Chav," said Mr Killen, 44, who also failed to turn up a Hoodie, though he is confident that there's one out there. "There's a distinctive richness to the way that people use vocabulary in Hull. The dogs' names are a vivid portrayal of the world their owners live in - but they're people who can laugh at themselves as well as teasing the authorities." The authorities are largely benign about the towel, one of five special commissions from the festival, known as The Humber Mouth and one of the biggest urban literary get-togethers in the country. A spokesman for Hull Citysafe, the partnership dedicated to reducing crime in the port, said: "Asbo sounds quite good if you're calling for your dog, but I wouldn't want to shout Twoc too often."
