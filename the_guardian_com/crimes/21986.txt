A 13-year-old was stabbed in a London street yesterday, less than a week after Damilola Taylor was killed as he walked home from school.The black boy was walking with an Asian friend in Hackney Wick, north-east London, when they were approached by two youths who stole a mobile phone and cash from the Asian boy, also aged 13.A passer-by intervened and the robbers left, but they returned when the two boys were on their own, punching the Asian and stabbing his friend with a knife, leaving him seriously injured. London Ambulance Service said he had cuts to his stomach but his condition was stable.Meanwhile a gang of youths aged 10 to 14 has become the focus of the Damilola Taylor investigation. They were loitering in Peckham, south London, the night he was stabbed.Witnesses have told Scotland Yard detectives that between six and 10 boys were outside the librarywhere the 10-year-old had joined an after-school computer class last Monday. An anonymous 999 call reported a bottle fight between youths shortly before Damilola was attacked, but police found no evidence of the incident. Detective Superin tendent David Dillnutt, overseeing the inquiry, said: "We are still seeking witnesses at the library from about 3.35pm when Damilola arrived _ this is a particular square where children meet." Police believe a woman in a red anorak with a small child was also outside the library. The fresh appeal for information came follow ing the arrest and release on Saturday of two boys, aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old woman.During a press conference Mr Dillnutt dismissed reports that Damilola's family believed their son, who was born in Nigeria and had moved to the UK four months ago, was being bullied by West Indian youths. "We have no evidence of this. The family is not saying this is a racial incident or a racist attack. We simply do not know if there is a link between the bullying that had been complained of by Damilola's family and his death."Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, acknowledged, how ever, that there were tensions on the Peckham estate where he was killed. "What is being said is that there is a certain amount of tension between racial groups," he told London Weekend Television. "We must not deny that, but we must also not build that up into a situation where there's more violence." Sir John said 70 officers were on the case. All of Damilola's classmates had been seen, and 100 adults have come forward. A memorial service was held yesterday.Â•The government will this week announce plans to extend youth curfews to anyone aged up to 16. Ministers will also review policy on the carrying of knives.
