A care worker who took out a home improvement loan to pay for a hitman to kill her husband was jailed for seven years yesterday. Zoe Kenealy, 44, took the £4,500 loan to have husband Timothy killed because she "could no longer bear to live with him". But the neighbour who took the money never went through with the attack.Yesterday Timothy Kenealy, who has said he will stand by his wife, sat with his head in his hands as the judge described her plot. "You did it partly for the insurance money but more because you could no longer bear to live with him," Judge Gregory Stone told the Old Bailey. "Although it is said the hitman never had the intention to commit the murder, the fact is that the more you pursued him and the more money you raised, there was a greater risk that things would change and your husband would be murdered."The court was told that Kenealy had started applying for loans in November 2006 but was turned down by two companies before getting £4,500 from Welcome Financial Services.The jury heard she had been in a violent relationship with her previous husband and felt smothered by Kenealy. Simon Wild, prosecuting, said she gave neighbour Lee Waite a down-payment of £3,000 in December 2006 to hire a hitman but the 31-year-old demanded a further £7,000. Kenealy then texted members of her family asking for cash, and was arrested when her father called the police.
