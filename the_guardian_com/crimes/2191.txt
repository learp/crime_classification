The government is expected to do a U-turn today on its proposal to open up the family courts to the media, in the face of opposition from lawyers, social workers, young people and children's organisations.A consultation paper last July proposed that the media be allowed into the family courts as of right, with reporting restrictions to protect families' confidentiality.But in a rebuff to justice minister Harriet Harman, who made opening the courts a priority when she took over the family law portfolio, the justice secretary, Lord Falconer, is expected to announce today that the reform will not go ahead.Ms Harman's sister, Sarah, a solicitor who represents parents accused of child abuse, has been spearheading a campaign to sweep away the secrecy surrounding the family courts. Some senior judges also support the move, which they believe will allay suspicions that miscarriages of justice are happening behind closed doors on the say-so of unaccountable experts.Lord Falconer signalled a possible change of mind last March, when he said in a speech that more than 200 children who had given their views on opening the courts during consultation "overwhelmingly rejected the idea, with the clear support of key third-party organisations speaking up for the interests of children".He added: "They are clear - crystal clear - that they do not want the family court filled with people who have no involvement in proceedings. They do not want people in the court hearing private details of their lives. They are worried about themselves or their families being identified by people whom they do not trust to report responsibly."Instead of having a right to go into court, reporters will be able to apply to sit in on a case, but it will be up to the judge whether to let them.As a way of making the system more open, judges will be encouraged to publish their judgments, making sure they are anonymised to prevent identification of families and carers. At present, judgments are confidential unless the judge in the case decides to publish, which rarely happens.Among the influential voices raised against opening the courts was the National Children's Bureau, which argued that "the media ... inevitably has a function to find news that will increase readership and sell newspapers and magazines".The Family Law Bar Association said the original proposals took little account of the rights of the child.Cases would be delayed while children who were old enough were canvassed on whether an application should be made to exclude the media, putting them under extra pressure.In addition, the need to make such applications would add to costs and delays, said the family law barristers.
