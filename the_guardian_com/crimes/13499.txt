Three youths have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a teenager on London's Oxford Street during the Boxing Day sales.Scotland Yard said a 20-year-old and two 16-year-olds were being held at separate London police stations in connection with the fatal stabbing of Seydou DiarrassoubaDiarrassouba, 18, was stabbed in the heart after a fight broke out at a Foot Locker sports shoe store.Eleven people had already been arrested in the investigation. All are currently on bail until dates in January.The new arrests came after 17 suspected gang members were held in a bid to dampen "rising tensions" and prevent reprisal attacks following the killing.Investigators said a number of gangs were present at the time and were aware of people wanting to "seek retaliation or revenge" for what had happened.In order to pre-empt any further violence, officers yesterday conducted a series of raids across the capital, arresting 17 people for a range of offences including grievous bodily harm, robbery, affray, intent to supply drugs, burglary, forgery and handling stolen goods. A large amount of cash was also seized.The motive of the attack on Diarrassouba is yet to be established. In a statement released through police, his family said: "Our loving son and brother has been snatched away from us."A simple shopping trip has turned into a complete nightmare for our whole family."We are urging anyone who was in Oxford Street at the time of the incident to come forward with any evidence, no matter how little relevance they think it could have, to help the police with their ongoing investigation."
