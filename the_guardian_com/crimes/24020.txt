A driver is due to appear in court today charged with knocking down a detective who has been fighting for her life in hospital.Detective Constable Catherine Corbett, 39, remains in a critical condition after she was struck by a car when she tried to detain a fraud suspect near Heathrow airport last week. Last night Rashpal Singh, 41, was charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent to endanger life.The collision happened shortly after 8am on Friday outside the Sheraton Skyline hotel on the northern perimeter of the airport.As the suspect left the car park driving a blue Peugeot he hit DC Corbett, leaving her with severe head injuries.Two other male officers from West Midlands police sustained minor injuries in the crash after they were carried for a short distance on the bonnet of the car.Mr Singh was also charged with two counts of actual bodily harm against the two male officers, Scotland Yard said.DC Corbett, of Solihull in the Midlands, is under 24-hour medical supervision at the neurological unit of London's Charing Cross hospital.A 32-year-old woman arrested in connection with the incident was last night released on bail to return to a west London police station at a future date. Mr Singh will appear at Hendon magistrates court, north-west London, today. DC Corbett was awarded a commendation in 1993 and had been in London for two days investigating the case before Friday's incident.
