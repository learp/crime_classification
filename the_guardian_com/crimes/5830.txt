Britain's most famous prisoner was released yesterday. The day began with a four page spread in the Daily Mail on his latest jail diaries - with payment being sent to drug rehabilitation and victim support charities - and ended with a BBC television documentary which suggested that Lord Archer, the former Tory deputy chairman, was still worth about £70m.His release coincided with a reminder from the Prison Reform Trust about the fate of the other 89,999 prisoners who are likely to be released this year. One third will have nowhere to live, despite the fact that stable accommodation can reduce offending by 20%. Two thirds will be unemployed, a second major way of ensuring ex-prisoners go straight. Another big group will have lost contact with their families, the third crucial factor in rehabilitation. Is it any wonder that 58% of adult offenders - and 74% of young offenders - are reconvicted within two years of release? If ever there was a need for more investment in rehabilitation programmes, then one last statistic points the way: ex-offenders are responsible for one in five of all crimes at a cost of £11bn each year. To its credit, the prison service introduced several schemes to give inmates a better chance - personal officers, sentence management, custody-to-work. All have been seriously disrupted by the current overcrowding crisis. In the words of the chief prison inspector, Anne Owers, "the notion of a joined-up, properly funded and implemented national strategy to resettle prisoners appears further away now than it was a year ago." A dramatic redirection of funds from prison to resettlement projects is urgently needed.
