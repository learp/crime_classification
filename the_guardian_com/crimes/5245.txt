Nick Clegg, in his advocacy of a less punitively oriented criminal justice system, deserves widespread support (This knife law won't work, 8 May). He speaks of Lib Dem opposition to the recent proposal to introduce a six-month mandatory sentence for anyone convicted for the second time for possessing a knife which, he says, "would undermine the government's progress in establishing a rehabilitation revolution".His words would be more convincing if the Lib Dem minister in the justice department, Simon Hughes, had accepted our invitation to speak at the recent public meeting to launch Prison Learning TV.PLTV is a new project of our charity, the Prisons Video Trust, backed by a Big Lottery two-year grant and with encouragement from the National Offender Management Service. It supports the rehabilitation of prisoners and the tackling of recidivism through the production of video programmes that aim to transform personal development, learning opportunities and life skills for serving prisoners by delivering a multi-platform TV channel to prisoners across the country.Nick Clegg thinks the key to reducing crime is to focus on practical solutions that stop people offending in the first place; what better way to achieve this than by espousal of PLTV's revolutionary approach to rehabilitation?Terry Waite Chair, Benedict Birnberg Deputy chair, Antonio Ferrara CEO The Prisons Video Trust• If I want to build a bridge, I call in a firm of civil engineers who specialise in bridge-building. If I want a railway built, again I call in a team of specialist railway engineers. When it comes to human beings, however, why is it that politicians seem to believe that they are the experts on dealing with crime and punishment and not psychologists, psychiatrists, probation officers, etc, who spend their lives working and studying this particularly challenging aspect of human behaviour.Rex HarphamTavistock, Devon
