Your report (Ex-drugs adviser backs safe use of mephedrone, 26 March) is derived from an incorrect interpretation of an interview with me in the London Evening Standard. The claim that I recommend that mephedrone "should" be allowed under controlled circumstances, rather than banned, is incorrect. I simply suggested this as an option worth exploring as a potential alternative to criminalising users, rather than being the preferred option.You also write: "Nutt said criminal gangs would be 'rubbing their hands' at the prospect of the drug being outlawed by the government." This mis-attributed quote was actually attributed in the Evening Standard article to Sergio Montes, a member of a Facebook group in support of my work.Having researched the drugs field for more than 30 years as a scientist, my concern is that the undoubted harms of drug-taking are minimised and that drug users, of whom there are millions, are protected. Some reactions to my suggestion that some form of regulated supply of mephedrone, ecstasy and cannabis is worth considering shows just how difficult it is to have a rational, science-based debate. It also shows just how important it is that the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs continues its work in providing high-quality, scientific information on drugs and their relative harms.David NuttIndependent Scientific Committee on Drugs
