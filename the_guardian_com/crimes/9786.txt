The murder of teacher Robert Symons by a man released from prison on licence is the latest high-profile failure that ministers believe is corroding public confidence in the parole system.The conviction of Yousef Bouhaddou came on the day that the London probation service confirmed that four probation officers suspended for mistakes they made in handling the killers of the city financier John Monckton will not face disciplinary action.A catalogue of errors in the Monckton case was identified by an inquiry which blamed the murder on a "collective failure" of the London probation service.The Symons murder happened just four weeks before John Monckton was also murdered in his own home, at the point when the London service was at its lowest ebb.But these cases also followed two similar failings of the parole and probation service in Nottingham involving the murder of a jeweller and a police officer.More cases are in the pipeline. Ministers are anxiously awaiting the results of a further inquiry into a murder in Winchester.Senior Home Office figures regard these repeated failings of the probation service to properly monitor offenders in the community as a "dagger at the heart" of the criminal justice system.In both the Monckton and Symons cases the parole board's decision was described as "defensible in principle".But in practice the safeguards that were meant to happen to ensure they did not offend again after their release were never put in place.The parole board last night stressed that although there had been some violence used during Bouhaddou's previous crimes there was nothing approaching the kind of violence he used against Robert Symons.The official risk assessment put him down as low to medium risk and all the professional reports recommended that he be released.What these cases all highlight is that the risk assessment of released prisoners is still sometimes more of an art than a science.Its shortcomings are often exacerbated by the abolition of the personal interview of the offender by the parole board panel before his release.The probation service has also all too often failed to do what it has previously agreed, despite its best efforts to cope with released offenders in the community.The resulting lack of public confidence in the probation system only encourages the courts to fuel the rise in the ever-growing prison population.
