The Metropolitan police victimised an Asian detective who had previously won a racial discrimination case against the force, an employment tribunal has ruled.Detective Sergeant Gurpal Virdi, who sued the Met in 2005 after being repeatedly passed over for promotion, said today the Met still had not learned lessons about discrimination.The Sikh officer had been reinstated on full pay after being cleared at an earlier employment tribunal in 2002 of sending racist hate mail to fellow officers.At the end of that first tribunal, the Met was ordered to pay Mr Virdi Â£200,000 after it was found to have racially discriminated against him.He returned to work with a formal apology from the then Met commissioner, John Stevens, but sued again alleging that his career was being hampered because of the original legal action.In the decision made public today, the tribunal was "unanimous" in backing the claims of victimisation but did not uphold Mr Virdi's claims of racial discrimination.The officer today vowed to stay in the Met, where he works in the serious crime directorate.Mr Virdi told Guardian Unlimited: "I welcome the judgment; it shows the MPS [Metropolitan police service] is not learning lessons. Ethnic minorities are still being discriminated against, victimised and their promotion denied."The saga began when Scotland Yard's complaints investigation branch accused Mr Virdi of sending racist letters to himself and to other officers at a west London police station.It suggested he was bitter because he had been overlooked for promotion. One of the letters read: "Not wanted. Keep the police force white. Leave now or else." It was signed "NF".In April 1998, Mr Virdi was arrested, his home was searched and he was suspended. In March 2000, a police discipline panel found against him and he was dismissed. But in August 2000, an employment tribunal found the force had racially discriminated against Mr Virdi, and in February 2002 he received an apology.In a statement today, Scotland Yard said: "Clearly the MPS will give full and careful consideration to the written decision of the tribunal. DS Virdi remains a valued member of the MPS and we will continue to provide him with the appropriate support to meet his professional development needs, as we do with all of our staff."The statement stressed the tribunal found the Met had not discriminated against Mr Virdi on grounds of his race in its management of his application in the 2005 promotion process.It continued: "However, the tribunal were critical of some parts of the appeal process and found that he had been treated less favourably on the basis that he was an individual who had carried out protected acts (his previous discrimination complaints against the MPS)."The tribunal's view was that this history was a significant cause of the appeal not being dealt with as thoroughly as it could have been and that this amounted to victimisation."Scotland Yard said it was "disappointed" with this aspect of the finding and would be "considering the judgment further".
