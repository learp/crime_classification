Police investigating the murder of a fine art student found dead in a shared house said today they could not rule out the possibility that he had been the victim of a bungled burglary.Officers called to a house in the Hyde Park area of Leeds at about 2pm yesterday found the body of 20-year-old Joseph Mark Cook in a first floor bedroom. No one else was in the building.Cook, from Newcastle upon Tyne, was studying fine art at Leeds Metropolitan University and had been due to start his second year.Detective Superintendent Bill Shackleton, leading the investigation, said he was keeping an open mind about what was behind the death.He confirmed that a botched burglary was one line of inquiry but said he was not in a position to discuss the injuries Cook had suffered.Shackleton appealed for anyone who was in the area of Ebberston Terrace or who knew Cook to come forward."The investigation is in its very early stages, and there are obviously still a lot of questions that we need to find answers to," he said."At the moment, we are appealing for anyone who saw anyone coming or going from the property at any time on Sunday or Monday to contact us urgently."We are particularly keen to hear from any friends or fellow students who knew Joseph well and can help us build up a picture of him."We're still trying to establish when and by whom Joe was last seen. We think [it was] probably late afternoon on Sunday."Police said the death was being treated as murder. Officers found an open basement window at the house, and although it had a grille across it Shackleton said he believed it would not "preclude a burglary".He said officers were trying to determine who had been in the house and which items of property belonged to whom.Police said it was not yet clear why Cook had been in Leeds before the beginning of term, but do not believe he was at last weekend's Leeds festival.
