Today Britain faces the closest examination of race and justice this country has seen for nearly two decades. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry report will forever lock one teenage boy's murder into the psyche of the nation. But as we reflect on the death at a bus stop in south London, we should also remember the 25 other murders that did not register so loud: Navid Sadiq, Donald Palmer, Donna O'Dwyer, Imran Khan . . .
