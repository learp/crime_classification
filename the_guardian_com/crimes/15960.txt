The conviction this week of a teenage boy for racially bullying a 14-year-old girl to the brink of suicide has gained a lot of attention.The ruling sets a long-overdue precedent, and will be welcome news to the victims and families of bullied young people. But some groups appear to disagree that children and parents have the right to speak out against bullies in the courts.The thinktank Civitas has said that "the law does not belong in the playground", and that this case "should be a matter for the school and the children's parents".For many years, Beatbullying has campaigned for schools, the government and the judiciary to take bullying and child-on-child crime as seriously as they do crimes against adults.This conviction is a watershed for the anti-bullying campaign. At last, a judge has acknowledged that the systematic hate bullying of a young person is criminal.In this case, as in so many others, the school had reached the limit of its ability to control the bullying situation. Yet this case involved a child pushed to the point of attempted suicide, and should not be trivialised.We have a responsibility as a society to keep every child secure and protected in their homes, schools and communities.Extreme, systematic bullying and child-on-child violence, wherever it is found, should be seen as a child protection issue.Why, if an adult abuses a young person, does the state swing into action to protect them, but if a young person seriously attacks or abuses a peer we see it as a local difficulty best dealt with by the school?We need to start by acknowledging that extreme acts of child-on-child violence are a part of thousands of young people's lives. We must then apply a radical policy and practice to arrest this growing trend.This conviction will be of critical importance to the 250,000 young people in the UK who are systematically and seriously bullied.We will not let detractors diminish our celebration of this landmark result. We make no apologies for believing that, in certain extreme cases, the law does indeed "belong in the playground", because the rights of young people to protection and safety are critical.Beatbullying is heartened by the courage of the bullied girl and her family to turn to the law in order to stem the abuse that has blighted her schooling. We would like to thank the judge for understanding that the extremes of child-on-child violence and bullying are often criminal acts and need to be treated as such.â€¢ Emma-Jane Cross is the chief executive of the anti-bullying charity Beatbullying
