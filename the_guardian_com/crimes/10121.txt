A Crawley Town fan has been arrested by police and banned for life by the club after taunting Manchester United over the Munich air disaster in the video for their official FA Cup song.Crawley officials reported him to police after a United fan noticed the 19-year-old making aircraft gestures in the video, which had been posted on YouTube ahead of the fifth-round tie between the sides.A statement from Sussex police issued this morning read: "The man from Crawley was arrested under the Public Order Act on suspicion of causing harassment, alarm or distress and has been bailed until 25 February pending further inquiries."As part of his bail conditions the man is not allowed to travel to Manchester for the Crawley Town Football Club match against Manchester United on Saturday 19 February."The non-league side had recorded a version of The Specials' song A Message to You Rudy called A Message to You Rooney and were unaware of the gestures made by the fan during the recording.The club's chief executive, Alan Williams earlier told the Guardian: "We immediately pulled it off the [club] website and removed it from YouTube."We've called in the police to see if they will press charges and we have identified the idiot responsible and banned him from the club for life."He's not welcome here now or ever again. This should be an unbelievable week for us, playing the biggest club there is, and if anyone thinks Crawley would deliberately insult Manchester United over something so sensitive, that is what gets to me more than anything."Eight United players were among 23 passengers who died when a plane carrying the team back from a European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade crashed on a Munich runway in 1958.
