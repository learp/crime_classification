The government's coffers will be drained of at least £5bn this year due to VAT "carousel" fraud despite official data showing sharp falls in the fraudulent activity in the past couple of months, a leading business and financial adviser said yesterday.Based on the latest official trade statistics, Grant Thornton said their estimate of £5bn was "conservative" and was likely to be reached even if the final quarter of this year sees a substantial decrease in the scale of fraud."The economic impact of [carousel] fraud continues to have a significant negative impact on the UK economy," said Stephen Gifford, the firm's chief economist. "Even on a conservative estimate we forecast losses to HM Treasury will amount to £5bn in 2006. That represents around one penny on the basic rate of income tax."Carousel fraud works when a fraudster imports high-value items such as mobile phones, sells them on through a chain of traders and re-exports them. He does not hand over the VAT when importing them and reclaims it when exporting them. This can happen dozens of times with the same van-load of goods. Fraudsters have become so sophisticated they spin 'virtual' carousels where computer programmes simulate shipments of fictitious goods in order to reclaim VAT.The latest estimates by the Office for National Statistics show that carousel fraud activity, rather than actual VAT losses, dropped to £1bn in September, the third monthly fall and the lowest for about 12 months. The attempted fraud levels had surged up to £4bn a month during the spring and summer. The closure in September by Dutch police of the First Curacao International Bank, which was providing banking facilities to all Britain's estimated 2,500 carousel fraudsters, curbed the fraud. HM Revenue & Customs has also nearly tripled the number of investigators it has working on the problem, to 1,400, allowing it to run much more thorough checks before making VAT refunds.But despite efforts to combat the problem by Revenue & Customs, Grant Thornton are uncertain whether these measures will have a lasting effect."Only time will tell if this is permanent or only a temporary effect," said Mr Gifford.
