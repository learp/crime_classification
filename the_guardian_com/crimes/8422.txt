Two men accused of attempting to blackmail an unidentified member of the royal family were named today.Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan, both from London, are due to appear at the Old Bailey next month. They allegedly threatened to release a video they claimed indicated that the royal had engaged in a sex act with an aide.The pair were also alleged to have claimed they had footage of the aide snorting cocaine and evidence suggesting the royal had supplied the aide with an envelope containing the drug.The case is the first alleged extortion attempt against a royal for more than a century.The member of the royal family who was targeted has not been named, but the Guardian understands it was not a senior royal. Buckingham Palace has refused to discuss the case, saying it is a police matter.Although a name was being circulated yesterday, a court order prevents the identification of the royal or any witnesses until any further order by a judge.Mr Strachan, a 30-year-old property developer, and Mr McGuigan, 40, appeared at City of Westminster magistrates court on September 13, each charged with one count of blackmail. They were remanded in custody to reappear at the Old Bailey on December 20.A spokeswoman said the Crown Prosecution Service had successfully applied for the September hearing to be held in camera, but it was not yet known whether lawyers would seek similar treatment when the defendants appeared next month."We made two applications, for the section 11 restrictions and for the court to be heard in camera," the spokeswoman said. "We make such applications to protect the interests of alleged victims and alleged witnesses."Members of the press were present when the applications were made and did not make any applications objecting to them, she added.
