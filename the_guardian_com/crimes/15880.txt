Five men, including two former councillors, were today jailed for their parts in a failed postal votes scam intended to get a Conservative candidate elected in the 2005 general election.A judge heard that a newspaper investigation and police inquiry had unearthed a plot to get the Tory candidate Haroon Rashid elected in the marginal Bradford West seat using hundreds of fraudulent postal vote applications.Leeds crown court was told detectives examined about 900 suspicious forms, many from people who did not exist or had no idea an application had been made on their behalf.The plot was foiled before the conspirators had the chance to convert the applications into votes, and Rashid was defeated by the sitting Labour MP, Marsha Singh, who won with a majority of more than 3,000 votes.Prosecutors said "the plan may well have been successful" had the press not intervened in May 2005.The former Bradford City councillor Jamshed Khan, Reis Khan – another former councillor – Mohammed Sultan and Mohammed Rafiq were each jailed for 21 months for their part in the conspiracy.All four denied a charge of conspiring to defraud the electoral registration officer of Bradford City council but were found guilty at a trial earlier this year.Another defendant, Alyas Khan, admitted the offence and was jailed for 11 months.The Electoral Commission chairwoman, Jenny Watson, welcomed the sentences, saying: "Electoral fraud is a crime and, rightly, is taken seriously by the police, courts and all those involved in running elections."
