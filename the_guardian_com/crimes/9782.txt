The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday April 9 2007The place in Devon referred to in the article below is Newton Abbot, not Abbott as orginally given. This has now been amended.A judge who granted bail to a serial paedophile while he awaited sentence because of prison overcrowding yesterday defended his decision as he jailed the man for an unlimited period.Keith Morris pleaded guilty in January to four sexual offences against a 15-year-old boy with learning difficulties. Yesterday Judge Graham Cottle told him that he would be not be eligible for release for at least four years but might never be freed because the risk of him re-offending was "unacceptably high".Exeter crown court heard that Morris, 46, of Newton Abbot, Devon, began abusing boys when he was 16 and said his sexual attraction would "never go away". He was jailed in 1980 and 1989 for indecent assaults. He abused his latest victim over two years and told him he would kill him if he spoke out.Defending his decision to grant Morris bail, the judge said: "Judges have been asked quite rightly to consider whether a remand in custody pending trial or sentence is unavoidable, or whether it is safe to direct a release on bail with appropriate conditions."If the latter is possible it has the effect of freeing up space in our overcrowded prisons." He also attacked "ill-informed" criticism of his handling of the case.Adrian Sanders, the Liberal Democrat MP for Torbay, had accused Judge Cottle in a parliamentary debate of "playing politics" over the decision to bail Morris. Yesterday he said that if Morris was dangerous enough to be jailed he should have been held in custody while awaiting sentence.
