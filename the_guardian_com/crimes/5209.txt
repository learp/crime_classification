The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, is considering an appeal against a sentence given to a man for raping a 10-year-old girl.Keith Fenn, 24, was given concurrent two-year and 18-month jail sentences at Oxford crown court by Judge Julian Hall for two attacks on the girl in a park. Because of the amount of time he has already spent in prison awaiting sentence, Fenn could be free in a few months.Lord Goldsmith acted after Tory backbencher Mike Penning wrote to him about Fenn. A spokesman for the attorney general said: "He has asked for the papers from the Crown Prosecution Service so he can consider whether or not to refer the sentence to the court of appeal as unduly lenient."Mr Penning, MP for Hemel Hempstead, said he decided to intervene despite the fact that the victim was not a constituent. "This sends out all the wrong signals to paedophiles," he said. "This young lady is in care and doesn't have parents who can stand up for her, so what better job could an MP do?" he said. In his letter to Lord Goldsmith, Mr Penning said: "Last week Judge Julian Hall QC sentenced Keith Fenn to what has been described as a pathetically lenient sentence for the rape of a 10-year-old child. Fenn will serve only four months, when the judge could have used his powers to give a much more severe sentence."Judge Hall hit the headlines in February when he suggested that compensation paid to another child sex abuse victim could be used to buy a new bicycle to cheer the child up. In the Oxford case, the judge reportedly made a reference to the girl dressing provocatively. Michelle Elliot, director of Kidscape, said: "It is absolutely shocking. We will be going to the attorney general to ask for the sentence to be changed. Given what Judge Hall has said before in another child sex abuse case, I don't think he should be sitting on these kinds of cases. This sentence is incredibly weak and does not reflect the gravity of the crime of rape against a 10-year-old."
