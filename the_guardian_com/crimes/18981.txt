Five family members were convicted yesterday of torturing, killing and decapitating a vulnerable man before dumping his corpse in a lake.Michael Gilbert, 26, was kept as a slave, assaulted with bats, shot, stabbed and beaten. Parts of his ordeal were filmed on mobile phones.Gilbert was also made to goad a large pet lizard until it attacked him with its tail, and the family planned a game show where contestants would pay £5 to slap him and £25 to headbutt him.Gilbert escaped several times but the family tracked him down. His body was thrown in the Blue Lagoon in Arlesey, Bedfordshire, last year.A bag containing his headless corpse was discovered by two dog walkers on 10 May 2009; his knee joints, forearm, elbow and head were missing.His head was discovered in February this year in a prison-issue holdall, along with other missing body parts.James Watt, 27, from Chertsey Close, Luton, Bedfordshire, his girlfriend, Natasha Oldfield, and his brother's girlfriend, Nichola Roberts, were yesterday unanimously convicted of the murder at Luton crown court. Watt had already admitted familial homicide and perverting the course of justice. Oldfield was also convicted of assisting an offender.Watt's brother, Robert, 20, and his mother, Jennifer Smith-Dennis, 58, were also found guilty of familial homicide.Robert Watt had already pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. He was earlier acquitted of murder.A third brother, Richard Watt, 25, previously admitted familial homicide and perverting the course of justice.Their father, Antonio Watt, 60, was earlier cleared of familial homicide and perverting the course of justice.Mr Gilbert's mother, Rosalie White, 49, said the family were pleased with the result. They had tried to help Michael, who had returned to them occasionally, she said tearfully on leaving court, adding: "He was 26, he wasn't a baby. I did all a mother could do."Her son, Chrissy, 31, said: "It's been a traumatic time for our family and nothing will bring Michael back but let's hope this will save others from violent behaviour."James, Robert and Richard Watt, along with their mother Smith-Dennis, Oldfield and Roberts, will be sentenced on Monday.Detectives believe Mr Gilbert died overnight between 12 and 22 January last year.James Watt's bedroom, which he shared with Oldfield, has been identified as the scene where the corpse was butchered.Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Jon Humphries said it was one of the worst crimes he had seen. "This is the worst case, and most serious and long-standing series of abusive incidents that have led to someone's death, that I have seen in 26 years," he said.
