Thousands of pounds of government grants intended to give deaf and disabled people access to the workplace have gone missing and are feared to have been pocketed by an employer, an investigation has alleged.Deaf and disabled employees of Corner (UK) Ltd told See Hear, a BBC programme for deaf people, that they were pressured into signing Access to Work forms enabling their employer to claim allowances for sign language interpreters they did not receive.One worker, Konstanty Bakowski, from Poland, was registered with AtW as receiving 991 hours of support over 18 months but he said he only received 18 hours of support. The investigation alleged that Corner was able to claim as much as £37,000 for interpreters it did not provide.AtW receives an annual budget of £66.8m from the Department for Work and Pensions to remove barriers faced by deaf and disabled people in the workplace so employers don't have to cover support costs. Employers are responsible for filling in forms detailing the support their employees use, but they have to be signed by employees to verify they have been receiving the services.When See Hear interviewed Corner's owner, Doreen Harris, in relation to another story last year, she spoke about AtW and how it enabled her to employ highly skilled deaf people as she could get funding for interpreters to facilitate communication.But the programme claimed this week that while Harris claimed AtW funding hours for interpreters, communication support workers and other services, her employees received little or no support.Another employee said Harris claimed for a communication support worker and notetaker for him, neither of which he received. Anita Bhatoa, a visually impaired employee, said she didn't receive the adapted computer she required.Bakowski said he did not know what was on the forms Harris gave him to sign while others spoke about being pressured to sign forms they were unsure about.See Hear began investigating Corner after employees complained on its message board that Harris was recruiting for up to 20 positions for a new office in Birmingham when they had not been paid for months.A communication support worker, who remained anonymous, said Harris asked her to ensure all applicants could apply for AtW and had a questionnaire asking people whether they could do so, what their disability was and what kind of support they needed. She added that Harris took on lots of deaf and disabled people, ignoring those who couldn't apply for AtW support.Corner is still registered with Companies House as being active but its company returns are overdue, the last returns having been submitted in May 2006. See Hear believes it had 16 people in its London office and 10 in the Birmingham office last December, but both offices now appear to be closed. Harris has her name down as the director of five companies - one of which is in insolvency proceedings – and has been taken to court several times over debts of £85,000.Attempts by the Guardian to get in touch with Harris were unsuccessful. she denied the allegations in a telephone message left at the See Hear office.Islington council confirmed Harris worked part-time for them as a youth project worker and that they were currently investigating the situation. A DWP spokesperson said: "Jobcentre Plus are currently investigating whether any Access to Work funds in respect of employees working for Corner (UK) Ltd have been incorrectly claimed and awarded."Terry Rooney MP, chair of the select committee on Work and Pensions, told See Hear that "something's obviously gone wrong here" and that "there needs to be an investigation".But he added that monitoring every claim made "would need another 10,000 civil servants. Ideally we want to spend all the £66m on individual disabled people helping them back into work, not on a bureaucracy to monitor." He admitted that the scheme "does depend on the honest of the employer and the individual person" to an extent.See Hear's editor, Terry Riley, said: "If Mrs Harris and Corner (UK) Ltd could get away with this so easily, one is bound to ask whether this is the tip of the iceberg". Mark Harper, the Conservative frontbench spokesperson on disability, said he was concerned the case "might be part of a wider pattern. The minister really does need to look into it to see if it highlights any bigger weaknesses".
