The government's creation of an agency to seize illicit wealth from criminals was today condemned as "ill-planned" and "unrealistic" by a cross-party committee of MPs.A National Audit Office report in February this year revealed that the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) spent £65m over the first four years of its existence, but seized just £23m. Today's report by the House of Commons public accounts committee criticised the ARA for concentrating its efforts on recovering the full value of criminals' illegal assets by court action, rather than negotiating settlements that left them with some of their ill-gotten gains. A single case in which a settlement was negotiated accounted for more than half of the £23m recovered by the agency, and took just 15 months to complete, compared to the four-year average for cases pursued through the courts, said the report. The ARA was created with much fanfare in 2003 by David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, who gave it the power to seize assets even from people who had not been convicted of any crime and claimed: "We are hitting organised criminals where it really hurts: in their pockets." The agency will be disbanded in April and its duties transferred to the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
