A scrap-metal dealer was told by a judge yesterday that he should never be released from jail for the frenzied murder of three generations of one family which prompted a seven-year legal marathon.For the second time in three years, David Morris, 44, stood in a court dock to hear four concurrent life terms passed and an emphatic recommendation that life should mean life."If ever there was a case for a whole life sentence, this is it," said Mr Justice McKinnon in the high court after underlining the savagery of the killings and Morris's implacable denials.The sentences followed four days of jury deliberation at Newport crown court in a retrial of one of the biggest criminal investigations undertaken in south Wales.But they left unhealed a bitter division between the family and friends of Morris and those of his victims, Mandy Power, 34, her bed-ridden mother Doris Dawson, 80, and Mrs Power's daughters Katie, 10, and Emily, eight.While Mrs Power's supporters celebrated victory and called Morris "a lunatic who doesn't deserve to walk the planet", his family claimed that he would never get a fair trial in Wales.The case was soured within months of the discovery of the family's bodies in a blazing house in Clydach, near Swansea, in June 1999. The women and girls had been beaten to death with a heavy pole kept in a bedroom in case of intruders.It transpired Mrs Power had been having an affair with a local police officer, Alison Lewis, unknown to Mrs Lewis's husband, Stephen, who was an acting police inspector. A year after the murders, the Lewises were arrested on suspicion of murder and Mr Lewis's brother Stuart, also a police inspector, was held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.But police attention turned to Morris after forensic tests linked him to a blood-stained gold chain found at the murder scene, which he denied owning. It emerged he had got a relative to buy an identical gold chain when police appealed for information about the jewellery.His wife who initially gave him an alibi for the time of the murder then admitted to police that she had lied. He was convicted in 2002 at Swansea crown court but the high court ordered a retrial because of a possible conflict of interest involving one of the defence lawyers.Mr Justice McKinnon said the motive for the killing might never be known, but it appeared to involve intense sexual feeling. The prosecution alleged Morris had been told that his partner had been having an affair, was being called a "slapper" locally and that Mrs Power knew about the allegations regarding his partner.Morris had confronted Mrs Power for information and then gone into a frenzy when she told him nothing. Mrs Power was battered in the face, like her mother and daughters, and stripped after death and her body abused with a sex aid.In a statement, Mrs Power's family said: "Once again the verdict today was the right one. David Morris will spend the rest of his life behind bars and we as a family will do everything in our power to make sure he never comes out."The last seven years have been a living nightmare for us and have not been helped by the poster campaigns and petitions by Morris's family claiming him to be innocent. Two guilty verdicts say it all."Throughout this trial we have had to listen to the lies about Mandy and hear her name being dragged through the mud"Morris's sister Debbie said: "We will fight this every step of the way. He has no chance in Wales, and he is up against the police." His father Brian said: "He will never get a fair trial in Wales."Detective Inspector Chris Coutts, of South Wales police, said: "Mrs Power's family has shown unbelievable strength and dignity. The community of Clydach has also felt the pain but they have also shown spirit and support for my team."
