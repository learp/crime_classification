A British man murdered his wife and dumped her in a lake, shortly after the couple moved to a medieval French farmhouse, a court heard today.The jury in Albi, south-west France, heard that Robert Lund told the police "manifest lies" to hide his crime, which he tried to disguise as an accident.They were told that he killed Evelyn Lund so he could live off her life insurance.The couple moved from Lancashire to the remote village of Rayssac, in Tarn departement, in 1997. Mrs Lund went missing from the couple's 400-year-old farmhouse on December 29 1999.In 2001, the 52-year-old's badly-decomposed body was found slumped on the back seat of her 4x4 in a nearby lake, when a drought caused the water level to fall by 9m (30ft).After a row with her husband on December 29, Mrs Lund fled to the house of a friend, Marianne Ramsey.Presenting the case against Mr Lund, the examining magistrate, Maitre Barthe, said the 55-year-old former council tree surgeon had lied when he told police that his wife did not come home after storming out on the argument.Mrs Ramsey's husband told police that Mrs Lund was wearing glasses when she came to the house, which were later found in her handbag at the Lunds' farmhouse.Mr Barthe said this proved Mrs Lund returned home before her death."Robert Lund told manifest lies to hide the fact his wife came home on December 29," he said.Mr Lund, originally from Darwen in Lancashire, has always maintained he played no part in his wife's death, and says she died after driving into the lake by accident.But traces of blood found on Mrs Lund's clothing and the back seat of the 4x4 showed she had died as a result of violence, the court heard."Evelyn Wilkinson (Mrs Lund's maiden name) died on the night of December 29 to 30," Mr Barthe went on, "and she died from violence - not as the result of a driving accident."When her body entered the water she was no longer breathing, or breathing so little that she did not inhale any water, which indicates that she had already been smothered or knocked unconscious."He said Mr Lund killed her before dumping her in the lake and then returning home on foot.The Lunds' relationship had become extremely strained after they moved to France, and Mrs Lund had contacted a divorce helpline, Mr Barthe said.
