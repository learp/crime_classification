A man believed to have been murdered more than a fortnight ago was going to be buried in his own back garden, police have suggested.Zbigniew Michniewicz, 36, was found by police officers in his house in Greenford, west London, on Thursday after neighbours reported their concern.Detectives found a grave that had been dug but not used. A spokesman for Scotland Yard described it as "a large hole, big enough for a body, in the garden at the rear of the property". It is understood that Michniewicz was killed in a fight involving three white men on an evening two or three weeks ago.A 20-year-old man and 17-year-old woman, understood to be residents of the same house, have been arrested in connection with the death. Both have been bailed until later this month. DCI Noel McHugh of the homicide and major crime command said: "I am keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anything suspicious or may have some information. I also want to hear from anyone who stayed at or visited the property in the last few weeks."One resident, who declined to be named, said: "It's very dark. I have seen men and women coming and going but they were rarely outside. They kept themselves to themselves and wouldn't stop to talk even if I'd wave they would just turn around and ignore me like I wasn't there. You would sometimes see people moving about inside from time to time, but there never seemed to be many lights on.A postmortem took place on Friday, but police said the cause of death is not being issued at this stage.
