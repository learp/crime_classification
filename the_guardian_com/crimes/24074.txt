Ronnie Kray, one half of Britain’s best-known criminal partnership, died in hospital yesterday morning at the age of 61, two days after collapsing at Broadmoor hospital where he was serving a life sentence for murder.Fellow villains and former detectives expressed their regrets at the death of the man who, with his twin brother Reg, became the prototype East End gangster during their brief heyday in the 1960s.Earlier this week Kray, who was jailed for the murder of fellow gangster George Cornell at the Blind Beggar pub in 1966, was taken to Heatherwood hospital in Ascot where he was treated for anaemia and exhaustion. He had told Reg that he was suffering from a bleeding ulcer, and there were no indications that the illness was life-threatening.After being returned to Broadmoor, he complained of feeling unwell and was taken to a specialist unit at Wexham Park hospital in Slough, where he died from a heart attack. He had previously suffered heart problems and was a very heavy smoker, smoking more than 100 cigarettes a day.A former fellow inmate, “Mad Frankie” Fraser, said: “He was pumped full of drugs. He must have had the constitution of a horse.” He added: “He was a real gentleman.”A close friend of the Kray family, Eddie Jones, said that the funeral - which will probably take place in Chingford, east London, next week - would “be as big as Kennedy’s.” Ron had expressed a wish for an old-fashioned funeral, complete with black-plumed horse-drawn hearse.Reg Kray was told of the death in Maidstone prison where he is serving life for the murder of Jack “The Hat” McVitie. He was comforted in his cell by Freddie “The Mean Machine” Foreman, a former Kray henchman jailed in connection with a Security Express robbery.The twins’ older brother, Charlie, who also served time in connection with the murder of McVitie, said he was “gutted” and “in bits” at the news.Ron’s former wife, Kate Howard, said she had known that Ron was in hospital but had not realised how seriously ill he was. She was very sad to hear of his death.Leonard “Nipper” Read, the former Scotland Yard detective who tracked the Krays down and brought them to trial for the murders of McVitie and Cornell at the Old Bailey in 1969, said he was also “saddened”.Ron Kray had been certified insane and knew he was unlikely to leave Broadmoor. Reg Kray is hoping to be released after serving the 30 years minimum recommended at his trial.
