When Yasemin Vatansever and Yetunde Diya left their homes on north London estates to fly to Ghana late last June, it must have seemed a great adventure.They could hardly have imagined how long it would last.The 16-year-old girls travelled to the west African country after being offered an all-expenses paid holiday by a man they met in Tottenham, where Vatansever lived. They apparently told their parents they were going on a school trip to France.When they arrived in Ghana's capital, Accra, they were met by two men who checked them into a hotel and kept a close eye on them there until the end of the week.The men then gave the girls two laptop bags to carry and dropped them back at the city's Kotoka airport to catch a flight home. But as they passed through the terminal, customs officials were suspiciously eyeing the bags, which appeared unnaturally heavy.Operation Westbridge, a project set up by the UK and Ghana to tackle the increasing use of the route as a gateway to Britain and Europe, swung into action.Officials swooped and found £300,000 worth of cocaine - weighing 6kg - sewn into the linings. Vatansever and Diya were arrested and later charged with attempted drug smuggling. Ghanaian authorities said they had been promised £3000 each to transport the bags to London.In a telephone interview from the headquarters of Ghana's Narcotics Control Board (NACOB) where they were held, Vatansever told Channel 4 News they had been tricked into carrying the drugs."There were basically two boys over here who gave us two bags and told us to bring it, [that] it was an empty bag. We never thought anything bad was inside and they told us to go to the UK and drop it off to some boy at the airport," she said."They didn't tell us nothing, we didn't think nothing, 'cause basically we are innocent, we don't know nothing about this drugs and stuff."During the trial, held in private because of their age, the girls' lawyers insisted they had not been promised money. They said the laptop bags were only mentioned once they were in Ghana and that they knew nothing of the real purpose of their trip.But in November, Vatansever and Diya were found guilty. Those who had been in court described how they sat silently through a 90-minute hearing, breaking down in tears as the judge left the room.Their parents, who remained in London, defended them, saying they were two vulnerable young girls whose naivety had been 'ruthlessly exploited' by the men who lured them to Ghana and the girls were not the 'criminal masterminds' the authorities had made them out to be.They had just finished their GCSEs at Islington Arts and Media School when they went to Ghana and both had places at post-16 college.Vatansever was looking after an elderly grandmother, and Diya had gained 11 GCSEs at grade C or above.At school they were kind to other pupils, pleasant, polite and hard working, according to deputy head teacher, Judy Gemmell.They are said to be a tight twosome who have gained solace from facing their ordeal together. Since their trial ended, the girls have remained on their own at NACOB, guarded by a few members of staff, waiting to hear how much longer they must spend in Ghana.Now, more than six months after they boarded the plane to Africa, their lives are set to change unimaginably once again.
