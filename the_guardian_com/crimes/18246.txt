Police hunting for the murderer of a pregnant 14-year-old girl who was found strangled in a churchyard were continuing to question a 27-year-old man yesterday.The almost naked body of Amy Williams was discovered on the morning of December 27 in Telford, Shropshire. Detectives arrested a man on Thursday. He comes from the Telford area, and is not believed to be related to Amy. Detectives were yesterday set to seek extra time to hold the man. They are expected to apply to a magistrate for a warrant to detain the man for a total of 96 hours, after which time they must either charge or release him. Amy, who was six months pregnant, was discovered in the grounds of St Michael's church. She was last seen on Boxing Day after leaving a family party. Police are still appealing for anyone who saw her in the 12 hours between the last sighting and the discovery of her body to come forward. A West Mercia Police spokesman said in a statement: "A man is in custody in connection with the death of Amy Williams. Police inquiries continue and we remain keen to hear from anyone with information which may help." The arrest came hours after Amy's family had told of their devastation after her murder. A post mortem examination established she had been strangled, although detectives said there was no obvious sign of a struggle. The results of further tests to determine whether she had been sexually assaulted are due next week.
