The Archbishop of Canterbury will today deliver the Prison Reform Trust's annual lecture as the debate continues over the crisis surrounding Britain's jails.Dr Rowan Williams' speech, to an 800-strong audience at Westminster central hall in London tonight, comes after a torrid week for the home secretary, John Reid, over the prisons issue.Mr Reid has been facing a rebellion from judges over pleas to imprison only the most dangerous and persistent criminals when handing down sentences, because of the overcrowding crisis in jails.Dr Williams will give a lecture entitled Criminal Justice: Building Responsibility. The archbishop regularly commentates on social issues and has spoken in the past of there being a "moral vacuum" in British society.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "At a time of crisis in our overcrowded jails, it will be very helpful to hear about the moral principles which underlie a responsible use of imprisonment. Thinking about ways to resolve conflict and to find long-term solutions will be a welcome relief from panic measures which see no further than storage or containment."Jails in England and Wales are now almost at capacity, which is around 80,000 inmates; the number of inmates increased rapidly in the first three weeks of the year, though it has decreased slightly in the past week.Despite the fall, there were still some 120 prisoners held overnight in police stations and court cells over the weekend because there was no room in prisons. Mr Reid has been looking at using prefab units and, reportedly a former RAF base in Norfolk, to cope with overcrowding. He has also been considering prison ships.Earlier this week, Lord Woolf, the former lord chief justice, urged Mr Reid to release thousands of non-dangerous offenders to ease the overcrowding. Lord Woolf said he should suspend the operation of legislation that requires the judges to "use more and longer sentences than are necessary".On Monday, Mr Reid made it clear in a round of interviews that it will take two and half years - at least until 2009 - to sort out the Home Office's various problems. He said he had the "endurance and determination" to see it through.Tonight's talk marks the 25th anniversary of the Prison Reform Trust. The trust was founded in 1982 to raise public awareness of conditions in prisons and the increasing use of incarceration, when the prison population stood at 43,707.
