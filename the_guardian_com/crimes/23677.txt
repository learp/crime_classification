A police constable who boasted about his girlfriend's lavish lifestyle unwittingly exposed her secret life as a brothel madam, a court heard yesterday.PC John Thomas would regale colleagues at a rural Welsh police station with tales of exciting weekends and trips. He talked "non stop" about Julie Hyett's Mercedes convertible, and about parties and holidays to Las Vegas, Monte Carlo and Palm Springs.But senior officers at Kidwelly police station in south-west Wales who heard the stories recalled a Julie Hyett who had once been prosecuted for running a brothel. Detectives looked into the background of Thomas's new love and found it was the same person - and she was once again living off the illicit sex trade.Swansea crown court was told that Hyett, 37, was running brothels in Swansea and Haverfordwest. She had allowed a girl of 16 to work in one of them.Hyett, of Winterbourne, Bristol, admitted controlling a prostitute and obtaining a Â£99,750 mortgage by deception, lying to the building society that she had an ordinary job. She was given a 15-month suspended prison sentence and Judge Gerald Price ordered that her assets be seized.Thomas, who has left the force, became embroiled in the mortgage scam and has been given a suspended sentence for fraud.
