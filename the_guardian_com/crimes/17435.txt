If revenge is a dish best served cold, the portion served up by Martin Frostick was positively icy. Eleven years after he was gazumped on a house purchase, he launched a smear campaign to ruin the estate agents he blamed for the collapse of the deal.He was convicted of fraud by false representation at Minshull Street crown court, Manchester, and sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for two years.Frostick told the court he had agreed to buy a £280,000 farmhouse in Saddleworth during the property boom and had paid his agent, solicitor and surveyor. But just weeks before the completion date, the agents, Ryder & Dutton, rang him to say he had been too slow in getting a mortgage and someone else had bought the property, he said.Last year he discovered it had been the same firm that had acted for the building society when his former home in Haworth Street, Oldham, previously valued at £43,000, was sold for just £27,000 after being repossessed.When he tried to make inquiries about the Haworth Street house to Ryder & Dutton he was told the records had been destroyed.Frostick, 53, from Delph, Oldham, then faxed bogus bankruptcy petitions to 765 companies falsely claiming that Ryder & Dutton was going bust, which led to the estate agents being deluged with inquiries about its financial health.He faxed copies of the fabricated bankruptcy petition to Ryder & Dutton's director, Richard Powell, and sent him an email of an article from the Guardian about Northern Rock's financial problems altered to read as though it was about Ryder & Dutton.After a commercial leasing company terminated an agreement with the firm, the estate agents called in the police and issued public statements dismissing the notices as "malicious rumour".Frostick told the police he was "delighted" about the cancelling of the lease agreement. "I fucking hate the twats. They're thieving bastards," he said.In court, Frostick admitted sending the bogus faxes, but claimed he did not realise he was doing anything wrong. "I didn't think in my opinion I was guilty as hell, but everybody tells me [I am]. I was trying to tell the truth," he said. He was ordered to do 250 hours of community work and pay £500 costs.
