The proposals in the government consultation are also a direct attack on victims of crime as well as the organisations that support them (Letters, 21 April). The consultation proposes to slash or remove entirely the compensation paid to victims of violent crime, even capping what victims can claim for loss of earnings.Most Usdaw members are shopworkers and are vulnerable to the risk of criminal assault. Of the members we supported in 2011 following an assault, 67% would receive no compensation under the new proposals, 22% would see their compensation halved and 11% of the most seriously injured would have their compensation significantly reduced. The government gives no real reason for the cuts other than a projected saving of Â£50m, a relatively meagre amount that will have no impact on deficit reduction and will be far outweighed by the consequential impact on victims and their families. We have started a petition against them which readers can sign at www.usdaw.org.uk.John HannettGeneral secretary, Usdaw
