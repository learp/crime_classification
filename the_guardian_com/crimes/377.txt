Senior police officers were yesterday checking a list of about 80 foreigners convicted of the most dangerous crimes and released by mistake instead of being considered for deportation.Home Office officials sent the names to the Association of Chief Police Officers to check against the police national computer as frantic attempts continued to identify all 916 people who are at large after being freed in error at the end of their sentences.Charles Clarke, the home secretary, promised the Commons that he would update them on the progress of the hunt for the most serious offenders by the end of the week. But so far only 107 of the 1,023 have been tracked down.A similar list has been sent to the Probation Service in the hope that some of those convicted of the most serious offences would have been put on supervision orders after their release and as a result may have last known addresses.But Harry Fletcher of the National Association of Probation Officers said it was likely any of those on supervision orders would have vanished. "It has caused major panic," he said. "There may be some who were given supervision orders but as soon as they realise they have been released and have escaped deportation they are likely to abscond."The Home Office doesn't seem to know how many have absconded, how many were on supervision orders or whether any arrest warrants have been issued for any of them. There is only a remote chance that a significant number will ever be found," he added."The most likely route was if they were caught for further crimes and only then when they were checked against the police national computer would they come to light."As criticism against Mr Clarke and the Home Office mounted, officials in the department said they were considering taking the extraordinary step of releasing names of some of those being sought.But despite the exercise to identify where the 80 most serious offenders were, it was clear last night that there were no police officers actively searching for any of the missing people.Asked if teams of police officers had been sent out on to the streets, Acpo said senior officers had been asked only to check of a list of names against the police national computer to see whether any of the released foreigners had reoffended or if there was any intelligence on them to identify their whereabouts.Acpo refused to comment on the results of its investigations but said it had notified the Home Office as each name was checked yesterday. The list of 80 includes nine rapists, three murderers, five paedophiles and seven other sex offenders, all of whom should have been considered for deportation. Some of these may be on licence, and the paedophiles should have been placed on the national sex offenders register.The 1,023 include 175 Jamaicans, 59 Nigerians, 58 Iraqis, 50 Irish, 48 from Somalia, 42 from Algeria, 28 from India, 20 from Zimbabwe, 17 from China, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and 16 from Sierra Leone.Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat leader, told the Commons a Nigerian prisoner who was released yesterday should have been deported.Mr Clarke denied that the man, who was not named, was included in the 916 being sought, but he was further detained later yesterday under immigration legislation. The man, understood to be from the Manchester area, had been jailed for one year for fraud-related offences and was due to be released from Holme House prison, in Stockton, near Middlesbrough.A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said: "One Nigerian prisoner, due to be released, is being held in custody under immigration powers following the expiry of his custodial period."Offenders' originsWhere they came fromJamaica 175Nigeria 59Iraq 58Ireland 50Somalia 48Pakistan 45Algeria 42Dem Rep Congo 28India 28Turkey 23Zimbabwe 20Iran 19Angola 18Bangladesh 17China 17Sri Lanka 17Sierra Leone 16South Africa 14Netherlands 13Fed Rep Yugoslavia 12Romania 12Kenya 11Vietnam 11Afghanistan 10Rest of world 260Total 1,023
