Police have told women to be vigilant following a string of sex attacks in the Manchester and Stockport area.Fourteen attacks took place between July 18 and September 29, the most recent being the rape of a 28-year-old woman on Saturday. Although police have not ruled out the possibility that they are unrelated, all of the attacks occurred in the Gorton, Reddish and Abbey Hey areas, and initially focused on an area around the Ashton Canal known locally as the Yellow Brick Road. Though the assaults have taken place on women from a wide age range, it appears the main targets have been young. The attacker is described as white, in his late teens to early 20s, 5ft 9ins to 6ft tall, of slim build, with short, dark hair and a spotty complexion. He is often wearing casual sports clothing and rides a distinctive black, red and silver mountain bike. In each of the incidents, the attacker approached his victims on a bicycle and produced, or intimated he had, a knife. Detective Chief Inspector Jane Antrobus, who is leading the investigation, said police believed they were looking for a man well-acquainted with the area. "It does appear he looks to spot a victim using the cycle lanes, rather than planning the attack. I feel confident that this man is a local person who knows the area well and knows the exits and entrances of the cycle path." Chief Inspector Antrobus warned that the attacks have increased in severity, culminating in the rape on Saturday, when the victim was forced into bushes at knifepoint, as she walked through a park at 10am. "It appears he is growing in confidence," she said. "Individuals need to be vigilant, perhaps arm themselves with an attack alarm. Be aware of who's around you and don't be too confident just because it is daylight."
