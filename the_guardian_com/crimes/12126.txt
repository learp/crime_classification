The fiancee of one of the failed July 21 bomb plotters was jailed for three years yesterday for helping him to escape from London dressed in a full-length burka.Fardosa Abdullahi, 20, is the last of 16 people to be convicted or to plead guilty to charges in connection with the failed attacks. She admitted helping Yassin Omar to flee to Birmingham dressed as a woman the day after he attempted to detonate a bomb on a tube train approaching Warren Street station on July 21 2005. Omar was caught on CCTV wearing a black burka which belonged to Abdullahi's mother and carrying a white handbag.Judge Paul Worsley said at the Old Bailey that Abdullahi, of Finchley, north London, who is 24 weeks pregnant, would receive less than a five-year term because she had pleaded guilty. But he added: "The message must go out that this court will not go soft on those who assist terrorists, even those who are young, vulnerable and under pressure. Your responsibility to this country should have been greater than your responsibility to your husband or fiance, if such he was."Muktar Said Ibrahim, Yassin Omar, Ramzi Mohammed and Hussain Osman attempted to set off rucksack bombs on tube lines and an east London bus, but the devices, made from hydrogen peroxide and chapati flour, failed to detonate.All were convicted of conspiracy to murder and jailed for life at Woolwich crown court last July with a minimum term of 40 years. A fifth would-be bomber, Manfo Asiedu, who dumped his device in woodland, was jailed for 33 years.Osman's wife, Yeshi Girma, was sentenced to 15 years last month and her sister, Mulu Girma, was jailed for 10 years for having prior knowledge of the attacks.
