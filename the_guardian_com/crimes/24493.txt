They gathered last night for a "vigil of hope" at the small beachside church at Praia da Luz; locals, expatriates and holidaymakers, all of whom had been urged to wear green or carry branches to symbolise a continuing fierce hope that Madeleine McCann may yet be found safe and well.In truth, nine days after the child vanished from an Algarve holiday village, tangible signs offering any hope that she may be alive are thin on the ground. Police have spent the past few days interviewing British holidaymakers, and talking at length with the missing girl's parents, but physical searches in the small town and its surroundings, they confirmed yesterday, have now finished, having yielded "zero" results.Her parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, were applauded by villagers when they attended the vigil, which took place the night before Madeleine's fourth birthday. Up to 300 people packed the tiny village church as the McCanns entered, both dressed in green, with Mrs McCann still clutching her daughter's soft toys.The McCanns spent most of Thursday afternoon and evening being reinterviewed at the local headquarters of the Policia Judiciaria, which is leading the investigation. Mrs McCann stayed at the station for nine hours and her husband 14 hours, leaving at 3am. The authorities have insisted that they are not suspected in the apparent kidnapping.While the McCanns were at the headquarters, according to local media reports, another British couple were interviewed at the same station. They were not arrested and were driven from the station concealed by a blanket.The interviews were the latest developments in an investigation that has led to more than a week of rumour and speculation but almost no hard facts.Media attention in recent days has focused on CCTV footage of two men and a woman taken at a petrol station on May 3, the night Madeleine vanished. Local media quoted police sources suggesting that one of the men has been identified by a German expatriate as the man he saw taking photographs of his daughter in a nearby town three days before the apparent kidnap.Police dogs had found a scent trail from the apartment where the girl vanished to another in the same holiday complex, which had been occupied by Britons, the Correio da Manha said.A British businessman has contacted the McCann family and offered a Â£1m reward for information leading to Madeleine's safe return, but it is unclear whether Portugal's strict laws would allow the offer to stand. Meanwhile David Beckham became the latest footballer to appeal for information. In Glasgow, at St Andrew's Cathedral, hundreds of well-wishers queued to join another vigil for missing Madeleine.The McCanns appeared briefly outside their apartment yesterday to insist that they remain "positive and focused on the investigation", but the statement, read by Mr McCann, seemed calculated in part to dampen criticism of the Portuguese police, stressing that the couple had now "seen how hard the police are working" to find Madeleine.The investigation has attracted intense criticism from the British media for the apparent tardiness with which Portuguese authorities began the hunt, and their failure to secure immediately the apartment from which the child vanished. A former senior British police officer said the handling of the crime scene was the worst he had ever seen.The Sun columnist Jane Moore put it more bluntly: "Regrettably for the distraught McCann family, their daughter Maddie has been abducted in a sleepy Portuguese fishing village where, up to now, PC Plodriguez's main job has been rubber-stamping lost handbag forms for holidaymakers' insurance claims."Stung by the criticism, the authorities have become defensive, stressing the scale of the investigation and the number of officers - 150 at one point - involved. There are also signs of a backlash against the British media. One paper said the criticisms had put "insupportable pressure" on the investigation. The Diario de Noticias insisted Mr and Mrs McCann were suspects and claimed that on the night Madeleine disappeared they had not checked on her, contrary to what they told police.Alison Castanheira, a British expat who had helped with the search, said there was resentment among the Portuguese and expat community: "Everybody is angry as everyone is blaming the police for not doing their job, but realistically the parents haven't done theirs."
