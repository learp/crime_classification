A man who broke the neck of a talented ballet dancer when he mugged him for his smartphone has been jailed for 13 years.Doctors feared that Jack Widdowson, 19, would spend the rest of his life using a wheelchair after he was attacked during a night out in Cardiff.But Widdowson, who was an apprentice with a Swiss ballet company, made an amazing recovery and fought back to full health, in part thanks to his fitness, strength and flexibility.His attacker, Mohammed Mohamoed, 27, was on Monday jailed for 13 years after being found guilty.Egyptian-born Mohamoed, who falsely told immigration officials he was a Palestinian refugee, will be deported when he is released from prison.Mr Justice Wyn Williams told him: "You caused Jack extremely serious injury and he was very fortunate he didn't suffer permanent, devastating effects. You left him lying in the street which was callous in the extreme. You will be subject to an automatic deportation when you have served your sentence."Widdowson, one of the youngest apprentices to be taken on by the Swiss company Bern:Ballet, was attacked while visiting his brother who is studying at Cardiff University. The day before the attack he had been told he would be an understudy for a leading role.Cardiff crown court heard his night out in the Welsh capital came to a violent end when he was mugged by Mohamoed, who took his iPhone and left him for dead in the street.A jury was shown a video interview with the rising star, from Bath, Somerset, as he lay in a hospital bed wearing a neck brace after the attack in November 2011.He told police: "I have broken neck, that's going to have to have a hell of a lot of rehab and physio to get back to where I was."Minutes after the attack Mohamoed was seen laughing and joking in the city centre, even kicking a football around with a group of boys.He admitted meeting Widdowson and stealing the iPhone which he later used to call a friend in Italy before selling it at a market.But he told the court the young ballet dancer was unharmed when he left him in the Cardiff Bay area. Mohamoed was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm.After the case Widdowson's parents, Julian and Celia, who have since set up a charity called the Dance Again Foundation, said: "Jack has made an amazing recovery from a horrific injury and we would like to thank the many people who have helped to achieve that."He has been performing for some time now and has already performed publicly on a number of occasions."We and he are just delighted that he has been able to resume his career as a dancer despite what happened to him."Detective Constable Mike Owens of South Wales police said: "He was subjected to a shocking level of violence by Mohammed Mohamoed. Amazingly Jack, who is such a talented young man, has made a full recovery and we are delighted that he is back dancing again."Today's decision will hopefully allow Jack and his family to finally put this incident behind them."
