The report, the result of a one-year inquiry by the Metropolitan police and the Prison Service's anti-corruption unit, suggested corrupt officers were accepting bribes from prisoners to bring in mobile phones and drugs. It claimed there was little enthusiasm from many on high to pursue intelligence about corruption. Prison Service officials hoped that Operation Extract would show they could act, but problems quickly emerged. After the 14 were suspended – all on full pay – Pentonville was forced to close a wing as it had insufficient staff to make it secure. At a time of chronic overcrowding, it meant that more than 100 prisoners had to be moved to police cells for months. Brian Traynor, chair of the Prison Officer Association's diversity committee who represented the suspended officers, said the service had to pay tens of thousands of pounds a day extra to hold the men.Two of the 14 officers were charged and found guilty, but both these convictions were overturned on appeal.It is understood that within the next 28 days, all 14 are expected to receive individual compensation payouts ranging between £5,000 and £9,000 from the Prison Service. As they were suspended on full pay they are not entitled to lost earnings."We need an independent investigation into allegations of corruption, maladministration and the management culture within the prison service," said Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo.A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "On 14 August 2006 the Governor of HMP Pentonville took the decision to suspend 14 officers following allegations of corrupt behaviour. This investigation has now been concluded and no further action is being taken against any of the officers involved. We do not comment on any payments made to individual members of staff."
