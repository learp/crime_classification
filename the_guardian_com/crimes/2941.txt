Grainy black-and-white footage of the shooting of a businessman outside his home was aired on Crimewatch last night in an effort to identify the gunman.The video shows the attempted murder of Charles Butler as he reaches home in Green Lane, Dagenham, Essex, on October 13. A man approaches with a handgun, and Mr Butler is seen running away as the gun is fired repeatedly. Mr Butler, 50, a father of three, ran into the road before his attacker opened fire at close range, hitting him in the neck and shoulder. The gunman is seen fleeing the scene. Police believe he may have got into a red car in Stockdale Road. Mr Butler remains in a critical condition on life support more than a month after the shooting. Doctors fear that any attempt to remove the bullet from his neck could kill him. Yesterday Detective Chief Inspector Dave Brown said: "We appreciate that the CCTV footage being released is extremely graphic but we are certain someone will recognise the gunman, and it is essential that he is apprehended as soon as possible." Scotland Yard arrested three men, including a police officer, in connection with the shooting. All were released on bail. The officer, a detective constable aged 47 and based at the specialist crime directorate in Barking, Essex, was suspended after being arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. Police said the detective was likely to know those investigating him, but insisted that this would not compromise the case. A spokesman said: "The integrity of the investigation is not at stake. We believe this was probably a professional hit." Through the renewed public appeal on BBC1's Crimewatch, police hope to find witnesses who may have seen a white car pulling into Mr Butler's drive an hour before the shooting. "Green Lane is a busy road and we are certain someone must have seen the gunman either waiting in a vehicle or loitering in the area," Mr Brown said.
