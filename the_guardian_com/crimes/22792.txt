A policeman caught punching a drunken man by security cameras was jailed for 21 months yesterday for the attack and for lying about it afterwards.PC Gary Waddoups, who has lost his job and Â£120,000 pension rights after 20 years' service, was told by a judge he had brought disgrace on himself and the West Yorkshire force. He was filmed in Leeds 10 days before Christmas in 2001, as he punched 31-year-old Stephen Ryan in the stomach three times. The fist he used was shown to be clenched round a pair of metal handcuffs, which added to the impact of the "vicious" blows. Waddoups, 43, from Knottingley, was convicted last month at Bradford crown court of causing actual bodily harm to Mr Ryan. He was warned at the time that he faced a substantial jail sentence for the attack and for perverting the course of justice by writing "a total and complete distortion of what really happened" in his duty report. The recorder of Bradford, Judge Stephen Gullick, told him yesterday: "It is of the utmost importance to the public that those upholding and enforcing the law remain within that law at all times and never overstep the mark." Policing a city centre where people were drunk and potentially disorderly was a challenge, but "rough and ready" techniques like Waddoups' were unacceptable. Waddoups told the previous hearing he was trying to get Mr Ryan to take his hands out of his pockets, as he feared he might have a hidden weapon. Jonathan Devlin, defending, said that the incident had cost Waddoups his job and pension. He had taken up voluntary work in the hope of finding a job on release. The case follows a two month jail sentence given last October to another West Yorkshire officer, PC Keith Empsall, for punching and kicking a man during an arrest in Wakefield.
