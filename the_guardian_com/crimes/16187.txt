A former Scout leader who sexually abused boys on trips to the Norfolk Broads in offences spanning nearly 30 years has been sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. Barry Warren, 78, abused 14 boys he met through his role as a scoutmaster. The earliest offences happened in the 1970s, while the most recent took place in the mid-1990s, Norfolk constabulary said. Warren, from King’s Lynn in Norfolk, pleaded guilty to two counts of gross indecency against two boys under 13 in August last year. His sentencing was delayed after a further 12 people came forward with allegations of abuse.He pleaded guilty to seven counts of gross indecency and one of sexual assault at Norwich crown court on Monday. The latest offences relate to boys under 16 whom he met through the Scouts. Further similar allegations were left to lie on the court file.Judge Maureen Bacon sentenced Warren to 10 years and six months in prison. He was also placed on the sex offender register for life. Outside court, DC Debbie Payne said: “Warren clearly misused his position of trust to take his unassuming victims on trips on the Norfolk Broads and swimming at the weekends. He then used these trips as an opportunity to abuse them. We would like to commend all the victims for the bravery they have shown in speaking to the police.“Warren’s actions all those years ago have had a profound impact on many of the victims, but we hope such a sentence will help them to move on positively with their lives.”
