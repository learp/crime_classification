The prison service warned yesterday that it could be only two weeks away from using cells in police stations to hold prisoners after prison numbers surged by 233 in the past week to an all-time high of 74,012.The jail population in England and Wales has risen by more than 600 in the last four weeks. There has been a particularly sharp rise in the number of women in prison. A prison service spokeswoman said that population figures released yesterday were just 400 short of the point at which they would start having to house inmates in police cells. At the current rate of increase, that situation could be reached within a fortnight. The latest internal prison security report for the first week of July shows there were 536 reported incidents in jails in England and Wales. It records two escapes and four deaths, two of them suicides. Home Office ministers are hoping that changes to the home detention curfew early release scheme which comes into effect on Monday will cut the daily prison population by between 800 and 1,000 when it is fully implemented.
