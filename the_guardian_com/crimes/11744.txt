The former lover of a missing office worker from Edinburgh has been charged with her murder, although her body has not been found.David Gilroy, 47, from Silverknowes, Edinburgh, was released on bail this afternoon after he appeared in private at Edinburgh sheriff court charged with killing Suzanne Pilley, 38.Pilley, a bookkeeper with Infrastructure Managers, disappeared on 4 May only a few metres from the entrance to the firm's offices off George Street in central Edinburgh as she arrived for work.CCTV cameras showed Pilley taking two buses into the city centre and walking from Princes Street past St Andrew's Square and towards the offices, but she then vanished without trace.Detectives from Lothian and Borders police issued a public appeal for information and an intensive search has not found her.Gilroy made no plea at the hearing, but his lawyer, Jim Wardlaw, spoke briefly to reporters. He said: "My client has been served with a petition which alleges he is responsible for the murder of Suzanne Pilley. Bail was applied for and granted."Gilroy, who also worked for the same firm, had an affair with Suzanne and briefly moved out of his family home last year to live with her at her flat in the Stenhouse area of Edinburgh. But he returned to his wife Andrea and two children in January this year.
