You are trying to relax in front of the TV at 10pm after a hard day at work, but all you can hear are the neighbour's children playing outside in the street. Some are skateboarding; one is setting off your car alarm; and all of them are shouting and swearing.What do you do? Call out of the window, telling them to keep the noise down, and receive a torrent of verbal abuse in return? Go next door to speak to the parents, and get into a heated argument. Or call the council? Alan and Ruth have lost count of the number of times they have complained to the council over the past six years. Their neighbour, Debbie, at first ignored the warning letters. "I thought they were overreacting," she says. "A number of children were doing the same thing. I took it quite personally, thinking they wanted to get my children into trouble." It was only after she received a letter from the council threatening her with eviction that Debbie grounded her three young sons - but that only made things worse. "It was very difficult keeping the children inside, so they became very resentful and started to be disrespectful to the neighbours," she says. "The kids saw me getting upset, which created more animosity, and the whole thing turned into a big vicious circle." Six weeks later, her boys were back outside. "I got to the point where I was going to smack her one," says Alan. "It's got into a slagging match on both sides." Requests to the council to see each other with a third party present were denied until last month, when the dispute was finally referred to Nottingham Mediation Service (NMS). Two meetings later, Debbie has signed an agreement with Alan and Ruth, stating that her children will not play on the street after 9pm and that the neighbours should try to resolve any future problems by speaking politely to each other. "To be honest, I thought the meetings would be a waste of time," says Alan. "But they went well. It's nice and quiet at the moment, but we'll see how it is in two months' time." Although this was not the most difficult case - the average dispute can takes up to five "shuttle" visits, at which mediators pass on information from one party to the other, before a face-to-face meeting - it is typical of the types of problems dealt with, says NMS coordinator Jean Hart. "Noise is the top offender - loud music, DIY, shouting and screaming, doors banging, washing machines - followed by verbal abuse and the behaviour of young people," Hart says. It is the same for the 240 mediation services throughout Britain. Last year, more than 47,000 people were involved in community mediation. Unlike the government's increasingly punitive approach to nuisance neighbours, mediation takes a non-adversarial approach to tackling conflict. Mediators are trained to provide equal support to both parties. Of the 120 cases it sees each year, NMS reports a 65% success rate. Success means achieving a verbal or signed agreement between the warring factions. Of these, 80% are still intact three months on. "Friendship is unrealistic," says Hart. "In one agreement, we had both parties avoiding eye contact because one would accuse the other of glaring at them and it would all flare up again." Although the service is beating targets set out in a service level agreement (SLA) with Nottingham city council, Hart believes it could be more successful if disputes were referred much earlier. She says: "We often don't get involved until a lot of assumptions have been made by the council and the police, counter allegations have been fired, and the whole thing has escalated." As part of the SLA, the city council has to refer a minimum of 50 cases a year, but Hart believes that, in the current climate, mediation is increasingly overlooked in favour of hardline legal remedies, such as antisocial behaviour orders, despite its proven cost effectiveness. A comparative evaluation this year of four Scottish neighbour mediation projects and 50 legal cases found that the majority of the mediations had successful outcomes and cost between £121 and £484 per case, compared with £339 to £13,692 for the legal alternative (average cost £3,536). According to the umbrella body Mediation UK, at least eight mediation services have closed in the past year and many more are struggling financially. "There is no statutory funding requirement, so local authorities have pulled the plug," says director Tony Billinghurst. "What we need is a nationally funded mediation service." One reason it took so long for Alan, Ruth and Debbie to solve their dispute was a funding crisis at NMS. Since its inception in 1996 it had relied on a range of grants from agencies that included crime reduction charity Nacro, which employs Hart and two other mediators. Ten volunteer mediators make up the workforce. In March 2002, it was threatened with closure, until the council stepped in. One dispute for certain could have been solved much earlier if funding had been secured. "This needn't have gone on for six years and caused me and the kids all this upset," says Debbie. "We just needed someone to bring us together with some rules."
