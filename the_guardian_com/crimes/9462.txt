The government should consider setting up "nursing home jails" for the growing number of elderly inmates, a charity report urged today. The Prison Reform Trust said the prison service is failing to provide adequate healthcare for prisoners over 60, who make up the fastest-growing age group in prisons in England and Wales.The report, Growing Old in Prison, found there were 1,200 inmates over 60 - three times the number a decade ago. Of those, more than 80% have at least one chronic illness or disability. Instead of leaving individual prisons to cope, the trust suggests following the example of America, which has established "nursing home prisons" offering specialist care. The call follows a series of prison inspectors' reports that have raised concerns about conditions for elderly prisoners. Most prisons do not have special facilities for elderly inmates. The only one that has a designated unit, Kingston prison in Portsmouth, offers little specialist care and an inspection in April found conditions there were "degrading", adding "movement was severely restricted" and some prisoners described themselves as "vegetating".Geoff Dobson, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said loneliness was an added problem as many elderly inmates had no family or community links.He said harsher sentencing, particularly for violent and sex offenders, has contributed to the rise in elderly inmates."The problem is likely to get worse because of that harsher sentencing. Some of these elderly inmates would not have been sent to prison a few years ago," he said."The previous prisons minister, Hilary Benn, ruled out developing a national strategy to deal with elderly prisoners but we are urging the government to think again."The prison population in England and Wales has passed an all-time high of 74,000 and four chief constables have been warned that soon they may need to hold prisoners in police cells.
