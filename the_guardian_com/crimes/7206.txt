The killer of headteacher Philip Lawrence has left prison 15 years after the school gate murder, it emerged today.Learco Chindamo, 29, was moved to a secure probation hostel in London after a decision last Wednesday to release him on parole.He was freed from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk after his probation arrangements were completed, sources said.Chindamo was jailed indefinitely for Lawrence's murder outside St George's Roman Catholic School in Maida Vale, west London, in 1995.Lawrence, a 48-year-old father of four, was fatally wounded after going to help a pupil who was being attacked by a gang.Among the attackers was Chindamo, then 15 years old, who went on to brag about the killing hours later.He was convicted of the murder in October 1996, jailed indefinitely and ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years.A judge ruled that he cannot be deported to Italy, where he was born, because having spent most of his life in Britain it would breach his human rights.
