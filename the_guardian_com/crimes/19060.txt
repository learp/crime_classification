A man was being questioned last night about the triple murders of a talented teenage singer, her mother and brother.Pierre Williams, 32, was being held in Manchester after Kesha Wizzart, 18, who appeared on Stars In Their Eyes, Beverley Samuels, 36, and Fred, 13, were found bludgeoned to death at home in the Fallowfield area of the city.The children's father Fred Wizzart, who had split up with Samuels, yesterday paid tribute to the trio that 'lit up' their lives: 'Words cannot describe the loss. No one could ever replace them.'A statement released by relatives described Kesha as a 'humming bird' who was always happy and singing. Fred Junior was 'a little gem.' Their mother, a nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary, was 'incredibly loving - a strong person with a soft heart.'Kesha impressed millions when she appeared on the televised talent show in 2004. As a 15-year-old she had dreamed of a singing career after performing a Toni Braxton song on the ITV show. But just weeks ago, she had completed A-levels in law, English and philosophy and wanted to become a barrister. She had been given a bursary to study at the University of Manchester.Williams, Samuels's ex-boyfriend, phoned police at 5am yesterday. They picked him up in the West Midlands.
