A nurse accused of murdering four elderly patients predicted the exact time one woman would die, a court heard today.Colin Norris, 31, also told a colleague that it was "just his luck" if the patient did not survive, as he would have to complete the paperwork.Opening the case against Mr Norris, Robert Smith QC accused the defendant of injecting his victims with lethal doses of insulin.He told the court that Mr Norris had deliberately used the drug, considered "dangerous when administered in large doses," to kill the women.Describing the death of one pensioner, Ethel Hall, 86, Mr Smith said: "She was not the only patient to meet a similar end to their lives."It is also the prosecution case that staff nurse Norris administered insulin to four other women on the wards where he worked in the course of only six months during or between May and November 2002."The first of the women survived, the jury heard.Newcastle crown court heard Mrs Hall had suffered a fractured hip in November 2002 after a fall.An operation to repair the break had gone reasonably well and she was recovering on ward 36 when she developed a catastrophic brain injury.Mr Smith added: "Significantly, he (Norris) said something quite extraordinary - he went on to predict the time of Ethel Hall's death."Mr Smith said Norris told a colleague: "It was always in the morning when things go wrong - about 5:15."This prediction by Colin Norris proved to be entirely correct."Mr Norris, from Glasgow, faces four charges of murder and five charges of attempted murder between May and December 2002.All the charges, which Norris denies, relate to five patients at Leeds General Infirmary or St James's hospital, Leeds.The women included Vera Wilby, 90, from Rawdon, Leeds, who survived the injection; Doris Ludlam, 80, from Pudsey, West Yorkshire; Bridget Bourke, 88, from Holbeck, Leeds; Irene Crookes, 79, from Leeds and Ethel Hall, 86, from Calverley, Leeds.Mr Smith said there were a number of "remarkable common facts" between the five victims.All suffered fractured hips and had undergone surgery, he said, and each one could be regarded as a "burden to nursing staff."Mr Smith added that all five patients were on wards where Mr Norris was working and their fatal comas occurred early in the morning - meaning the fatal doses of insulin had been administered at night when the defendant was working.Mr Smith said: "Colin Norris deliberately administered these drugs to these five women. He did so intending to kill them."The case continues.
