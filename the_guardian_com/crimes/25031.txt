Organised crime syndicates have consolidated their grip inside the prison system, with fresh intelligence revealing that underworld figures are orchestrating operations with impunity from jails.Bill Hughes, director-general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, has warned that major criminals are finding it increasingly easy to operate within the criminal justice system.Hughes, the second-in-command at Britain's equivalent to the FBI, said: 'We are becoming aware that this is a major problem with criminals running their business from inside. In a sense they are protected because there are no police watching them and they have a good understanding of the prison regime.' His comments coincide with mounting concern over the availability of mobile phones inside prisons. Ministry of Justice figures reveal that up to 3,500 phones were smuggled into jails in England and Wales in the past year. Prison investigators recently found that inmates at Wandsworth had a 'limitless supply' of phones that allowed them to direct activities with ease from inside. Hughes said officers were now concentrating on recovering assets using financial reporting orders that force criminals to provide bank statements to ensure they are not making any crime-related earnings while serving their sentences. 'You have to hit them where it hurts, and that often means taking their criminal proceeds,' said Hughes.
