Forcing offenders to say "sorry" for their crimes persuades virtually none of them to go straight, official research showed yesterday.A Home Office report said "restorative cautioning", in which offenders apologise to their victims, had little effect on reconviction rates. It also dismissed the findings of a previous study which said restorative cautioning had been a success, suggesting its good results were down to police making extra effort because researchers were present. The report looked at restorative justice schemes in the Thames Valley and compared them with traditional cautioning schemes in Sussex and Warwickshire. It then examined how many offenders who had received a restorative caution were "resanctioned" - convicted, cautioned or given a final warning or reprimand by police - within the next two years. Initially, Thames Valley appeared to have a lower resanctioning rate of 30%, compared with 34% and 35% for the other counties. But when other factors were taken into account, they wiped out Thames Valley's lead, researchers said. The report concluded: "Within Thames Valley the type of caution was not a significant predictor of resanctioning rates. Such lack of significance suggests that the practice of restorative cautioning had little effect." Offenders were given cautions for a range of offences, including theft and handling (33% of the total), violent crimes (17%) and drugs (17%). A report in 2002 found that similar restorative justice schemes had led to about a quarter of offenders going straight. But these results were not supported by the new large-scale study.
