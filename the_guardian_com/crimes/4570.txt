Doctors fear a man may be left with permanent brain damage after he was assaulted at a wedding reception filmed by GMTV.Show presenters Keith Chegwin and Jono Coleman were guests at the lavish reception, funded by the bride with the proceeds of a £10,000 competition win on the ITV breakfast show.Police said a 45-year-old man, a relative of the newlyweds, was in a critical condition in hospital after he was assaulted during the party at Shillibeers bar and restaurant, in Pentonville, north London.The guest, who has serious head injuries, was found slumped in the venue's toilets about 9.30pm on Saturday, just hours after the film crew had left.Detectives said although hundreds of people had been at the 400-capacity venue, no one had yet come forward as a witness to the attack.Acting Detective Chief Inspector Lorraine Dillon, of the major incident team in Islington, said: "This appears to be a nasty and motiveless attack on a man who was a guest at the wedding of a relative."We are very disappointed at the lack of witnesses that have come forward as there were several hundred guests at the wedding. We believe it's likely that they did not appreciate the severity of the injuries but the reality is that this man is likely to have a permanent disability if he survives, and it is not conceivable that this happened by accident."Despite the apparent lack of witnesses I believe that someone knows who has done this and we need them to come forward and tell us what they know."Officers said the newlyweds, who have not been named, were extremely distressed. A spokeswoman said: "The bride and groom are very upset at what has happened, on a day that was up until this incident, a very happy occasion."The bride won £10,000 after entering a GMTV phone-in and was visited at her home in Camden, north London, live on TV by Chegwin on March 29. A GMTV spokeswoman said: "She had decided to use it to pay for her dream wedding and GMTV were in attendance to film at the reception and left at around 6.30pm."Presenters Keith Chegwin and Jono Coleman, a producer and a film crew were there to produce pieces to camera and to film promotional trailers for future competitions."In the circumstances GMTV has decided it would be inappropriate to broadcast the film. We are taking steps to provide GMTV footage to police in the hope it assists the investigation."
