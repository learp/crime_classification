One of the prime suspects in the murder of Stephen Lawrence is being treated for psychological problems by a black doctor, it emerged yesterday. Luke Knight, aged 23, is being treated by Chike Ococha, a Nigerian-born psychiatrist, at Greenwich district hospital in south-east London. He is understood to have psychological problems after being ostracised following the publicity over Stephen's murder. It is believed that Mr Knight was referred to Dr Ococha, who is responsible for the Greenwich area, after seeking help from his local GP.  In a statement Oxleas Healthcare Trust, which covers the Greenwich area, said yesterday: 'Patient confidentiality prevents Oxleas NHS Trust from discussing who the trust is treating or what treatment they are receiving.' However, a spokesperson added: 'It is the trust's role, as part of the NHS, to provide help and support to people with mental health problems, regardless of their personal circumstances.' Dr Okocha's secretary said that the psychiatrist would not be making any comment.  Mr Knight has asked to be re-housed after allegedly receiving threatening letters, as have Neil and Jamie Acourt, two other suspects in the killing.  Stephen, 18, was murdered at a bus stop in south-east London in April 1993 by a gang of white youths who screamed racist abuse before stabbing him. Mr Knight, along with Neil Acourt and Gary Dobson, was the subject of a private prosecution by Doreen and Neville Lawrence in 1996. The three were acquitted after the Old Bailey judge ruled that vital evidence was inadmissible. In his report into Stephen's murder, Sir William Macpherson described the suspects as 'infected and invaded by gross and revolting racism'. The inquiry heard surveillance tapes of the five suspects. Mr Knight was recorded as making racist remarks about Cameroon during the last World Cup, and similar expletives about Italy.
