Though still a relative novice in Washington politics, Gabrielle Giffords has come to be regarded as a rising star in the Democratic Party since her election to the US Congress five years ago. She was one of the few Democrats in swing districts to survive a Republican sweep during last November's mid-term elections, narrowly defeating a conservative Republican opponent endorsed by the Tea Party.That she was able to avoid defeat, while many colleagues fell, was thanks largely to her embracing a range of conservative positions, most notably on immigration, a touchstone issue in her district of southeast Arizona.The US political website Real Clear Politics named her one of its "Top Ten Rising Power Players in the US Congress" after the 2010 elections because of her influence on the immigration debate.But while the Ivy League-educated Giffords has leaned to the right on other issues – she is a long-time supporter of gun ownership and one of the fiscally conservative "blue dog" Democrats hailing mostly from southern states – her support for President Obama's overhaul of the healthcare system has made turned her into a hate figure for many on the right.Giffords's election in 2006 to the House of Representatives as only the third woman in Arizona's history to be elected to serve in Congress – and the state's first Jewish Congresswoman – marked her out as an ambitious figure to watch."I wouldn't be surprised if she's the first or second female president. She's of that calibre," Robert Reich, who was a labour secretary under Bill Clinton and attended Giffords's wedding, told the Arizona Republic newspaper.She has been married to Mark Kelly, a US Navy captain and astronaut whose brother is currently in space, since November 2007.Her hobbies also mark her out as an atypical Democrat. Along with guns, she has identified herself as a truck and motorcycle enthusiast, whose dream is to ride a motor bike all the way to Argentina.Sworn in to a third term in Congress earlier in the week, Giffords should have been at the forefront of her party's battle with the vanguard of tea party-endorsed candidates and other Republicans.Instead, she was fighting for her life last night at a hospital in her home city after neurosurgeons carried out emergency surgery to repair the damage done by a bullet that passed through her brain.
