A survey of 2,000 adults conducted by the Essex Centre for the Study of Integrity has found that people are less honest than they were a decade ago. But the survey itself amounted to a dishonesty test, inviting participants to rate their tolerance of behaviour including littering, adultery and handling stolen goods. What we really need is a more positive test, one that that demonstrates just how honest we can be, in the right circumstances …Score each example accordingly: (1) Never justified; (2) Rarely justified; (3) Sometimes justified; (4) Always justified. A score above 35 means a high RVQ (revised integrity quotient). Help yourself to a little reward from the nearest honesty box.• Informing a former partner, through intermediaries, that you're worried about how haggard he looks.• Passing on a dubious but exciting rumour about a colleague, even if it goes against the express wishes of the person who told you.• Using the internet to tell an anonymous idiot that he is an idiot, anonymously.• Returning a DVD left in your flat by ex-girlfriend, even if you must travel across town to drop by unannounced because she doesn't seem to be answering her phone.• Revealing daughter's excellent GCSE results to a friend whose child didn't do very well.• Admitting to one's employer that a disastrous strategy was actually someone else's idea.• Giving police officer detailed descriptions of vehicles that were going loads faster than you were.• Explaining to minicab driver why you've always hated the person you just had dinner with.• Letting neighbour know, as delicately as possible, that your new car is out of his price range.• Taking full responsibility for dishonest behaviour in exchange for nothing more than peace of mind and a reduced sentence.
