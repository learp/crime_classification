A fuller picture is beginning to emerge of how the alleged killers of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich were radicalised.In the case of Michael Adebolajo, the 28-year-old filmed at the scene of the killing declaring he was fighting for "almighty Allah", one area of focus is during and after his time at Greenwich University, where he lived in student accommodation between 2004 and 2005.Born in Lambeth into a church-going family of Nigerian origin, he is thought to have converted to Islam around 2003.Omar Bakri Mohammed, the cleric who founded the now-banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun, has said he tutored Adebolajo after his conversion and the young man started coming to meetings of the group at a time when anger was high over the war in Iraq. The cleric described him as a shy man who would ask questions about when violence was justified.Another potentially significant event was Adebolajo's arrest in 2010 in Kenya close to the border with Somalia. Kenyan authorities say they believe he was preparing to train and fight with the al-Qaida-linked Somali militant group al-Shabaab.Adebolajo was later deported, but not before he was tortured, according to a friend who said the Londoner had gone abroad to study. Abu Nusaybah, who was arrested shortly after making the allegations in a BBC interview, in part attributed Adebolajo's radicalisation to his alleged ill-treatment in Kenya.Nusaybah said he believed that his friend became radicalised about six months ago, when he noticed what he regarded as profound changes in Adebolajo's character, which he attributed to his experiences in Kenya and to events on his return to Britain.According to Nusaybah, Adebolajo came under pressure from the security service to work for them. "His whole concept was he wanted to live in a Muslim land because at the time he was being harassed by MI5," he added.The Guardian has learned that last year Adebolajo went to a lawyer to complain of harassment by MI5.Fewer clues about what may have radicalised Michael Adebowale to the point where he may have been prepared to inflict violence have come into the public domain.However, it has emerged that he and Adebolajo attended a prayer group set up by Usman Ali, a radical cleric who was banned from the Greenwich Islamic Centre in 2007 after the mosque's trustees secured a court injunction against him.Adebowale, who was born to Nigerian parents in Denmark Hill, south London, is reported to have converted to Islam at 19.Neighbours said his mother, a probation officer, had been concerned about his exposure to criminal elements during his teens and was advised by a neighbour to take him to the head of a mosque for spiritual guidance.He is said to have been converted to Islam by the head imam and taken for weeks of "further training" at a centre near Cambridge.Magdalene Edwards, a friend and neighbour of Adebowale, who said that she first saw him in "Muslim dress" a year ago, told Channel 4 News that he was a "lovely boy who had the makings of a fine young man"."He was angry. He was angry at a lot of things like a lot of young people are," she added. "Young people who have lost their way have got no hope. You have got these elder people who can come in and will prey on them."
