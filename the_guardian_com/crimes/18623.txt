Madeleine McCann's parents used the Â£1m fund set up to help find her to pay their mortgage, it has been confirmed.Gerry and Kate McCann, who have been on unpaid leave since Madeleine disappeared almost six months ago, used the money to make two mortgage payments on their home in Leicestershire.Clarence Mitchell, the family's official spokesman, said: "The fund has always had the ability to assist the family financially if necessary, and they've only used it to pay for two mortgage payments earlier this year."When they were made arguido [official suspects], it stopped, which was a mutual decision on the part of the fund and the McCanns - they were happy to accept that their changed status meant they were no longer entitled to that assistance."On the Find Madeleine website, the fund lists one of its purposes as to "support the family".It has also emerged that Portuguese police have staged a re-enactment of how a possible abductor could have taken Madeleine from the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3.The detective in charge of the case, Paulo Rebelo, was yesterday photographed at the flat examining the scene with colleagues.Mr Mitchell said Mr and Mrs McCann welcomed the renewed focus on the theory that their daughter was abducted.Mr Mitchell yesterday also issued a statement on behalf of friends of the McCanns who were on holiday with them at the resort, denying they have entered into a "pact of silence" to protect the couple.The so-called "tapas seven", who had dinner with the McCanns on the night their daughter vanished, have been the subject of media reports suggesting they are withholding vital clues from police.The friends said: "We wish to state that there is categorically no 'pact of silence' or indeed anything secretive between us - just the desire to assist the search for Madeleine."This is reflected in us saying and doing nothing that could in any way hinder the investigations now under way."Mr McCann is due to return to work as a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield hospital in Leicester on Thursday.
