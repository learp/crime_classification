Ministers have turned down police pleas to repeal a 100-year-old law that guarantees compensation to the victims of riots because the insurance industry is deserting crime hit inner city areas.The police authorities have been pressing the home secretary, David Blunkett, to repeal the 1886 Riot (Damages) Act after insurers for the private security company Group 4 started to sue the police after the Yarl's Wood immigration centre in Bedfordshire was burned down by detainees. The riot at the detention centre earlier this year has already led to delays in opening two private prisons because of the reluctance of the insurance industry to insure them in the wake of Yarl's Wood. But Home Office ministers announced yesterday that despite "the strongly held views of the police" they would not scrap the Victorian law. "Repeal of the act is likely to lead to an increase in premiums in areas where riots have occurred," said the Home Office in its response to MPs on the House of Commons home affairs select committee. Ministers said that repeal of the act will not solve the problem of businesses and householders people facing higher premiums and that it is a safety net for those businesses and residents who cannot get affordable insurance cover. Meanwhile, Mr Blunkett said he would stand firm over his police reform powers to impose action plans on police divisions which are deemed to have be failing. He told MPs yesterday that he would clarify how he intended to use his powers but claimed those who argued that he should not have them in the first place were just "mischief making".
