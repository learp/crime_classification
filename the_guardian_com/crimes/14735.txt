The police officer shot dead when he confronted an armed man at a flat in Shrewsbury had been commended five times for bravery, the chief constable of the West Mercia force revealed yesterday.Paul West described Richard Gray, 43, who was gunned down as he went to the scene of a domestic dispute early on Sunday, as an "excellent" policeman and paid tribute to his "bravery, determination and professionalism".PC Gray was killed by what is thought to have been a blast from a shotgun fired by a man named locally as Peter Medlicott, who shot himself shortly afterwards. No police officer fired a gun at the scene, it emerged yesterday.Mr West said he had been due to present PC Gray with an award later this year. "The first divisional commendation was for an incident in which he rescued a man trying to jump into the river Severn from the English bridge in Shrewsbury," he said."Last October, Ricky was one of four officers to receive a divisional commendation for their professionalism, decision-making, and teamwork under pressure for rescuing two women from the river Severn during the early hours of a day last July."Together with a colleague, Ricky also received a chief constable's commendation and a judge's commendation for his part in the arrest of an unstable man with a firearm."Mr West said PC Gray was also to be awarded a chief constable's certificate of commendation, the highest award given by the force, for his part in the arrest of a violent man who confronted officers with a semi automatic pistol during a check in Shrewsbury in April last year."I was due to present this award to PC Gray in a ceremony later this year," he said. "He was very popular with his colleagues, extremely well-liked and held in the highest regard. The fact he had been recommended for five commendations spoke volumes about his character."The first thoughts of everyone working for West Mercia constabulary are with Ricky's family at this extremely sad time."PC Gray joined the police after serving in the army with the first battalion of the Black Watch in Northern Ireland, Germany, England, Scotland and Hong Kong.Mr Medlicott, described by friends as a fishing and shooting enthusiast, was said to have been ordered out of a pub at about midnight on Saturday. Residents said he was then seen on the roof of a shed throwing stones at the windows of his flat.The incident has been reported to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
