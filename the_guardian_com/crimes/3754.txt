Detectives were questioning a 15-year-old boy last night about the murder of the American artist, Margaret Muller, and the stabbing of a female jogger in a north London park.The teenager, who was first arrested last month, was being questioned about the knife attack on a 39-year-old woman in Clissold Park, Stoke Newington, on December 5. Police think this assault is linked to the murder of Ms Muller, 27, who was stabbed to death about two miles away in Victoria Park, Hackney, last February. Both victims were attacked while out running. The 39 year-old woman was seriously injured but managed to run about 100 metres, pursued by her attacker, before collapsing in front of a doctor, who was in the park with her children. She saved the jogger's life by stemming the flow of blood with a blanket. A 24 year-old man was also arrested at the same time as the 15 year-old. Both were freed on police bail and told to report to police on January 12, but this was later cancelled. The two are not connected and no further action will now be taken against the older man.
