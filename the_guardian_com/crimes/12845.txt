Prosecutors should offer plea bargains to suspects in terrorism cases, according to a leading Liberal Democrat.Nick Clegg, the party's home affairs spokesman, suggests that offering deals to individuals on the fringes of plots would allow the authorities to find and prosecute the instigators."One of the most notable failures to date in British counter-terrorism has been our inability to find or try such leaders," he writes in a forthcoming book on the future of the Lib Dems."We should be prepared to make it clearer, in the guidelines issued by the attorney general and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service], that plea-bargaining should be an option for individuals on the penumbra of terrorist plots."Combined with real efforts to build trust in Muslim communities, this could do a great deal to encourage individuals to testify and help us bring the leaders of terrorist cells to court."Labour and the Conservatives see law and order as the Lib Dems' electoral weak spot and are likely to seize on the proposal as evidence that the party's counter-terrorism policies are "soft".But Mr Clegg uses the rest of the essay for Beyond Liberty -published by the IPPR on Friday, to coincide with the party's spring conference - to attempt to reposition the party as tough on crime and disorder.Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Mark Oaten, Mr Clegg has been much more aggressive towards the government, arguing that it is failing because it is obsessed with proving it can crack down on problems, and should instead "do less better".In his essay he also argues that the CPS should be able to charge terror suspects even where there is not a realistic chance of conviction, as long as it believes there is a reasonable prospect of further evidence emerging prior to trial.The proposal will alarm the most anxious guardians of civil liberties within the Liberal Democrats.But Mr Clegg argues that it would be better than the government's policy of "circumventing due process altogether, most notably by way of control orders and expanded powers of detention without charge".Elsewhere he proposes that three times as many prisoners should be in paid work by the end of the decade, arguing that the criminal justice system must place a greater emphasis on rehabilitation.But he adds: "Prisoners should not be given full access to the money they have earned in prison until, say, two years after release, to encourage them to remain straight after release."A fixed proportion, say 20%, of all their earnings should also be diverted to a common fund for victim compensation."Mr Clegg argues that "an approach that relies above and beyond all else on the perception of 'toughness'" has actually hampered the government's attempts to fight crime and disorder.He adds: "There is nothing 'soft' or indulgent in engaging with prisoners to minimise the chances that they reoffend upon release: it is fulfilling one of the basic functions of a prison system, ensuring that offenders do not leave yet more victims in their wake."Reoffending rates are arguably the most reliable gauge of the efficacy of a criminal justice system."Put simply, if criminals who come into contact with a criminal justice system are not turned away from further crime, the system is failing."The home affairs spokesman is widely tipped as a future leader of the party - although he is expected to face a tough fight contest with Chris Huhne, the environment spokesman, when Sir Menzies steps down."If and when I think I have a serious contribution to make then I'd be daft not to give it serious consideration," he told an interviewer this weekend.
