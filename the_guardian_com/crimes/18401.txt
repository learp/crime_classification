Suspected paedophiles, rapists and violent offenders will have their bail conditions dropped as early as this week, unless the police are successful in suspending a high court ruling.Napo, the probation union, said it had learned of scores of suspects who were subject to lengthy police investigations and who were set to have their bail conditions lifted.These include a 26-year-old suspected paedophile, arrested this year in possession of hundreds of images of child abuse, whose bail conditions bar him from using a computer.A 30-year-old man with convictions for actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm and who is prohibited from contacting his partner and her child can also expect to have his bail conditions lifted, Napo said.The government is attempting to introduce emergency laws that would prevent their bail conditions being lifted. The supreme court will hear a plea to suspend the ruling, which was made in relation to murder suspect Paul Hookway, who was arrested in November.Greater Manchester police had been given permission to detain Hookway for 36 hours, but he was released after 28 while they continued their investigations. Five months later the police applied to the courts to extend the period of detention from 36 hours to the maximum 96, so he could be questioned further. But the district judge at Salford magistrates' court refused, saying the clock had continued to run while Hookway was on bail and therefore the 96-hour deadline – and his bail conditions – had expired months earlier.The force sought a judicial review, but the ruling was upheld at the high court last week, prompting chaos.Fresh guidance issued to forces now says officers have to rearrest suspects in order to detain or question them again if they want to exceed the 96-hour period – but they can do so only with "new evidence". The ruling means the bail deadline for hundreds, possibly thousands, of suspects has already expired, releasing them from their bail conditions.Solicitor Joseph Kotrie-Monson, who represented Hookway, said the ruling prevented "police from abusing the custody process to re-interview citizens any number of times". But the Association of Chief Police Officers said the ruling had caused "chaos and concern" among officers.The Home Office knew about the judgment last month, but said the full impact of it became clear only on 17 June. Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, said it was now questionable whether some suspects could be summoned to police stations if their bail conditions had expired.He said in complex cases involving referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service, the use of forensics or outside agencies, it was inevitable that police would need longer than four consecutive days to conduct their investigations."This seriously affects public protection," Fletcher said. "If this ruling stands the CPS and the police will be forced to decide whether to charge or release based on inadequate information. This will affect public confidence and risks causing injustice."
