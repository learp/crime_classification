The driver of a bin lorry that crashed in Glasgow, killing six people, has admitted driving a car without a licence nine months after the incident.Harry Clarke, 60, appeared at Glasgow sheriff court on Friday, where he pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless driving. Clarke was seen at the wheel of a white Corsa in the city on 20 September 2015, despite having had his licence suspended for medical reasons after the accident in 2014. Clarke’s lorry careered out of control in central Glasgow on 22 December 2014, killing six people and injuring 15, after he experienced “an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope”. In relation to the latest incident, he admitted driving despite the knowledge that he had suffered a loss of consciousness while at the wheel on the day of the crash. Clarke also admitted that he had suffered a loss of consciousness or episode of altered awareness while at the wheel of a stationary bus on 7 April 2010. Clarke’s licence was suspended for 12 months on 27 June 2015, with the authorities concluding that he knew or ought to have known he was unfit to drive and there was a risk he might lose consciousness or suffer an episode of altered awareness while driving.Presenting the case for the prosecution, Mark Allan told the court in Glasgow that Clarke’s neighbours had seen him get into a white Corsa in a car park outside his house.“After watching for between 30 seconds and two minutes, both witnesses saw the accused enter into the driver’s seat, switch on the exterior lights and drive out of the car park on to Buchanan Street,” Allan said. Clarke returned about two hours later at about 10.15pm.“He went round to either the passenger door or boot and retrieved some carrier bags from the car, before leaving the car and walking to his home address,” Allan said.Clarke was cautioned and charged by police two days later, reportedly telling them: “I have never been out on a public road. I have just moved the car in the private car park.”Clarke was not prosecuted over the lorry crash, with the Crown Office insisting there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal proceedings.Relatives of three crash victims sought permission from senior judges to bring charges against him in a private prosecution. However, judges at the appeal court in Edinburgh ruled late last year that they could not pursue the case.Jack and Lorraine Sweeney, 68 and 69, and their granddaughter Erin McQuade, 18, Stephenie Tait, 29, Jacqueline Morton, 51, and Gillian Ewing, 52, died in the incident.A fatal accident inquiry heard that Clarke had a history of health issues and had not disclosed his medical background to his employers or the DVLA.
