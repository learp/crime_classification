An unemployed truck driver who claimed that he could sell London's Ritz Hotel to a property developer was found guilty of obtaining money by deception today.Anthony Lee, 49, who is also an undischarged bankrupt, was warned by Judge Robbins at Southwark crown court that he faces a "quite substantial custodial sentence" for defrauding two businessmen of £1m.Lee was acquitted by the jury of an alternative conspiracy charge to extract the money from Terence Collins and Marcel Boerkhoorn by falsely claiming that he was in a position to procure the sale of the Ritz in Piccadilly, central London. The court had heard that he participated in an "ambitious scam" to sell London's Ritz Hotel to unsuspecting businessmen for a "bargain" price of £250m. At the time the landmark hotel was estimated to be worth up to £600m.Lee, who pretended that he was acting on behalf of the billionaire Barclay brothers who own the landmark hotel and casino, enticed his targets with false promises."The deal that sounded too good to be true was a complete fantasy," Anuja Dhir QC, prosecuting, told Southwark crown court."As the negotiations progressed," Dhir told the court, Lee sucked his "victims in with more false promises and frustrated them with unnecessary requests until he managed to extract from them a payment of £1m."He was not at that time involved in the property business or authorised in any way to act as intermediaries on behalf of the Barclay brothers, the court was told.The jury acquitted Patrick Dolan, 68, of Tottenham, north London, a former construction manager, of taking part in the scam.Lee, of Goole, East Yorkshire, was remanded in custody pending sentence later this month.Both Lee and Dolan had denied conspiracy to defraud between 1 January 1 2006 and 30 March 2007.On Thursday the jury cleared a solicitor, Conn Farrell, 57, of taking part in the scheme to try and sell the Ritz Hotel for £250m.Farrell, of Aldershot, Hampshire, had always insisted he was simply acting on the instructions of his clients, Lee and Dolan.After the verdict, Dolan said: "Justice has been done. At long last. I was innocent."Det Sgt Garry Ridler, of North Yorks Police, said: "This case has taken two years and 151 statements. Lee is your typical fraudster who sucks people in and obtains their trust with lies."
