Police are tonight questioning a man in connection with the suspected murder of three women over a period of 11 months after body parts were found floating in a Yorkshire river.The remains of one body – found in the river Aire at Shipley, West Yorkshire on Tuesday afternoon – are yet to be formally identified, but they are believed to be Suzanne Blamires. She and the two other women were sex workers.Police confirmed that they arrested a 40-year-old man on Monday in connection with her murder and the disappearance of the other two women.Police are thought to have intensified investigations after Blamires, 36, from Allerton, Bradford, went missing last Friday. Shelley Armitage, 31, also from Allerton, has been missing since 26 April, and Susan Rushworth, 43, from the Manningham area, was last seen near her home on 22 June last year.Assistant chief constable Jawaid Akhtar, of West Yorkshire police, said the man was originally being questioned on suspicion of murdering Blamires, but officers had been granted extra time to question him about the other two women."This is a very thorough and painstaking inquiry into three missing women, all of them sex workers, with all the necessary resources and expertise devoted to it," he said.A man who works at Shipley College said police had been searching the area intensively in recent weeks. There had been police activity in skips around the college in the last few weeks, he said. When asked, police refused to say what they were looking for, but had been focusing efforts on a building in Thornton Road.Echoing the unease of many local resident, he said it was worrying that there had been three murders of prostitutes. "There has been nothing like this since the Yorkshire Ripper," he said.Today the area where the remains were found, close to an industrial estate on the outskirts of Shipley, had been cordoned off by police. During the afternoon detectives removed items, including a computer, from a nearby car showroom.A police spokeswoman said a walker had spotted the remains floating in the Aire.Earlier this month, police launched a poster appeal to try to trace Armitage, who was last seen between the late evening of Monday 26 April and the early morning of the next day in Rebecca Street, in the red-light district of Bradford city centre. Detectives described her as "a much-loved daughter and sister" and said her family were growing increasingly concerned for her welfare.A police spokeswoman said that Blamires had last been seen near her home in Allerton. She was considered at risk because of her work and her issues with alcohol and drugs.Detectives have been trying to solve the murder of Rebecca Hall, a sex worker whose battered body was found in an alleyway in 2001, but today said they were not linking the disappearance of the three women to the 19-year-old, who also worked in Bradford.
