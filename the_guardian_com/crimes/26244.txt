Police today launched a fresh bid to trace a British boy who vanished almost 12 years ago in Greece by issuing a digital image of how he may look now.The officer leading the hunt for Ben Needham, who was 21 months old when he went missing in 1991, said he hoped that the computer-generated picture would lead to a breakthrough in the case.Detective Inspector Martin Locking, of South Yorkshire police, said: "We don't know what happened to him. Very soon after he disappeared, the trail went cold."There have been lots of rumours about him being abducted by a travelling family, but there is no evidence to suggest that happened."Ben, his mother and grandparents had moved from Sheffield to Kos.He was last seen on July 24 1991, near a farmhouse the family was renovating. No trace of him has been found since, despite a major publicity campaign and the publication of a similar, "aged" picture three years ago.The new image is being issued ahead of the 12th anniversary of Ben's disappearance.It was compiled by the Metropolitan police's facial imaging team on behalf of the police national missing person's bureau, and is featured on the UK missing children website. The "age progression technique" used to create the picture involves taking photographs of other family members, usually parents, grandparents and siblings, to determine how aged facial features may look.DI Locking told the Press Association: "If he is alive and well and with a family, it is possible, although remote, that he may start to question his background and perhaps come across the website."He said that the file on Ben's case would remain open, adding: "We will act positively on any information we receive. I would love to find him."A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire police said officers "had not given up hope" of tracing Ben. They are working alongside a private investigator hired by Ben's family.The spokeswoman added that Ben, whose 14th birthday is on October 14 this year, has a strawberry-shaped birth mark in the nape of his neck.Police are urging anyone with information about Ben to call freephone 0808-100 8777 or e-mail the UK missing children website.
