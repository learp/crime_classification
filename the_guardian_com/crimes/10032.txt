Chief constables are to target dealers and not young users when a ban on the legal high mephedrone, comes into effect within the next few weeks.The home secretary, Alan Johnson, hopes the statutory instrument he is to introduce in parliament tomorrow scheduling mephedrone as a class B drug will win sufficient cross-party backing to reach the statute book before the general election campaign officially gets under way."The government is determined to crack down on these so-called legal highs and we must all play a part in ensuring children and young people know about their dangers," he said.Johnson also announced an immediate ban on the import of mephedrone – known as miaow or M-cat – after the government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) disclosed official concern that the imitation amphetamine may be linked to as many as 25 deaths in England and Scotland.Tim Hollis, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on drugs, said: "Our enforcement will initially concentrate on those people who sell and traffic this harmful drug rather than on the young people who we may find in possession of it. It is not our intention to criminalise young people.He added: "Its new classification will, I am sure, provide a degree of reassurance that something is being done about it. It does not, however, solve what has become an increasingly complex issue, and making something illegal does not stop it being sold, bought or consumed."The decision to ban mephedrone and similar substances in the cathinone group follows a report from the ACMD that the drug is really an amphetamine.Drug experts say mephedrone has been one of the fastest-growing drugs in Britain. It was developed by chemists in the Far East from the active ingredient in khat, a plant found in north Africa. It is widely sold on the internet and in "headshops", often as plant food.ACMD's chairman, Professor Les Iversen, said reports from the National Programme of Substance Abuse Deaths indicated mephedrone was possibly implicated in 18 deaths in England and a further seven in Scotland.He did say this fatal link had not yet been confirmed and postmortem and inquest verdicts were awaited. In one case in Scotland it had been confirmed that death had followed a mixture of mephedrone and methadone, the heroin substitute.Iversen said: "A ban may not impact on all users or dealers but one of the alarming features of mephedrone is that it is being taken by young people who have never taken illicit drugs in their life."They are taking it because it is legal and they think it is safe. We can convey two messages to the community: it is not safe and it is not legal."The ACMD chair said the most serious potential harms from mephedrone were a "mirror image" of those caused by "crystal meth" or methamphetamines.They include a strong desire to redose, in order to recapture the initial rush; potentially dangerous changes in body temperature, including overheating; a heart rate of more than 100 beats a minute; constriction of blood vessels, making fingers turn blue; and hallucinations and psychosis at high dosages.Iversen acknowledged that clinical research or hard information on the harmful effects of mephedrone was limited but said the ban last year on spice, another previously legal high that imitates the effects of cannabis, provided a precedent.He said: "We know a little about mephedrone but we know a lot about amphetamines. Cathinones [of which mephedrone is the most popular] are simply amphetamines by another name."Senior police officers had warned that users were stockpiling the drug and buying it in bulk in anticipation of a ban.The decision to ban mephedrone was taken despite the resignation of the only veterinary consultant on the ACMD, Dr Polly Taylor, on Sunday, leaving the council inquorate.Home Office lawyers are confident this legal issue can be resolved.
