A gang member who armed the killer of the Liverpool schoolboy Rhys Jones saw his "unduly lenient" seven-year sentence increased to 12 years by the court of appeal today.James Yates, 21, who provided Sean Mercer with the Smith and Wesson handgun used to murder Rhys, was ordered at Liverpool crown court in January to serve seven years for possessing a weapon, and given two five-year sentences, to run concurrently, for assisting an offender.The sentence was referred to the court of appeal by the attorney general, Baroness Scotland QC.At a hearing in London, the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, sitting with Mrs Justice Rafferty and Mr Justice Henriques, agreed with submissions made on her behalf that the sentence imposed should have been longer.Judge said gun crime was a "modern pestilence" and offenders faced severe, deterrent custodial terms.Yates, of Croxteth, was in court for the decision, as were Rhys's family.Eleven-year-old Rhys was shot dead in August 2007 in a Liverpool pub car park as he made his way home from football training. Mercer, who was 16 at the time of the killing, was sentenced to 22 years for the murder.Dean Kelly, 17, was sentenced to four years for assisting an offender, and Nathan Quinn, 18, was sentenced to two years in addition to the five years he was already serving for separate gun-related offences. The trial judge said they would not serve the full sentences because of time served on remand. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was given a two-year supervision order with a curfew.
