The model Naomi Campbell is to face five charges in connection with an alleged assault on a police officer at Heathrow Terminal 5, her lawyer said today.Campbell was removed from a flight bound for Los Angeles last month after an alleged row over luggage. Her lawyer, Simon Nicholls, said Campbell, 37, would appear at Uxbridge magistrates court in west London on June 20. She was told she would face charges when she answered bail at Heathrow police station.Campbell was arrested at Terminal 5 on April 3, shortly after the opening of the new terminal was blighted by thousands of bags being lost and flights being cancelled, leaving BA with a bill that ran into millions of pounds.The Crown Prosecution Service said Campbell was accused of three counts of assaulting a constable, one count of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress and one count of using threatening, abusive words or behaviour to cabin crew. Nicholls read a statement on her behalf saying: "Miss Campbell is bitterly disappointed that the prosecutors have advised her she is to be prosecuted for various offences. "Prosecutors in this case have decided she needs to be prosecuted in the magistrates court. She respects that decision and she hopes this matter is dealt with expeditiously."
