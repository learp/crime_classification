The fashion designer Nicole Farhi said today she feared she was about to die when a pair of robbers choked her on the doorstep of her north London home.Farhi said she was attacked by two men, one carrying a small knife, as she went to open the front door of her house in Highgate just after 11pm on 21 April last year."One hand came on to my eyes, the other on to my throat, he squeezed and I fainted," she told Wood Green crown court. "My last thought was, how stupid to die in front of my house."After losing consciousness for a few minutes, Farhi said she came round to discover the men stealing a diamond ring she was wearing, along with a Rolex watch that had belonged to her father.The 62-year-old, who runs an eponymous chain of fashion outlets, told the court she heard the two men speaking French, her native tongue, and pleaded to them in the language not to take the watch."I asked for my watch back because it had sentimental value," she said. "I started speaking louder and louder and they said, 'Let's go', because I was speaking too loud."She was giving evidence at the trial of Matthew Mykoo, 27, from Brent, north-west London. He is alleged to have carried a knife while his brother, Daniel, choked Farhi using an arm around her throat.Matthew Mykoo denies 16 counts of robbery, but last week admitted two other counts. He also denies a charge of taking a car without consent. Daniel Mykoo, 28, from Fulham, west London, has admitted 16 counts of robbery.Farhi told the court she had tried to give the men some money from her handbag but could only find yen following a trip to Japan."I was frightened, obviously," she said. "I said to them, 'Don't cut me with this knife,' in French. I said, 'Don't cut me, don't cut me.' They fled and my husband at that moment opened the door."Her husband, the playwright David Hare, had come to the door assuming she was speaking to her mother as her words were in French, the court heard.The case continues.
