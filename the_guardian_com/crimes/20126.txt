We ask that anyone with information about the whereabouts of Joanna contact the police."Brown, of North Street, Winkfield, is accused of murdering his wife sometime between Saturday and Monday.He is also currently charged with preventing a coroner from holding an inquest by disposing of her body in an unknown place.
