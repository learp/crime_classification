The government made another intervention yesterday into the controversy over the jailing of a mother whose children played truant, by reporting that social workers had visited her 71 times in 12 months to try to ensure her daughters went back to school. Before Patricia Amos appeals against her unprecedented 60-day sentence at Oxford crown court tomorrow, the Department for Education and Skills moved to show that her prosecution was not a "slap-happy decision" by revealing that she had been prosecuted before for the same reason. An adviser to Estelle Morris, the education secretary, said: "Every help has been given to this woman over the years in an attempt to get her children to attend school. The local authority [Oxfordshire] has bent over backwards as the 71 contacts from May 2000 to May 2001 by educational social workers shows." Twelve days ago at Banbury magistrates court, Amos, 43, was jailed for failing to ensure that her daughters Emma, 15, and Jackie, 13, attended school - a move backed by Ms Morris who is becoming increasingly tough on pupil discipline. A chronology released by departmental officials showed that Amos had first been contacted about truanting in November 1989, that time concerning another child, Elizabeth. Amos, a mother of five, was prosecuted then and received a conditional discharge. The first referrals by social workers about Jackie and Emma's truancy from Banbury school were in February 2000. In May Amos got her first warning. She received a final warning in December 2000. In July 2001 a parenting order was imposed on Amos after she pleaded guilty to charges under section 44 of the Children Act. In November a warning was issued about her non-compliance with the parenting order. After Amos failed to attend hearings a warrant for her arrest was issued in March 2002 and on May 9 she was jailed.Amos's solicitor, Stephen Warrington, was unavailable for comment.
