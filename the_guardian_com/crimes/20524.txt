A man who raped a three-month-old baby had his minimum jail sentence increased by two years by the court of appeal today.Alan Webster, who admitted raping the child while babysitting, will now serve at least eight years before he is considered for parole.But his co-accused Tanya French escaped an increase in her original five-year custodial sentence.The pair carried out sexual offences of the "gravest depravity" against a 12-week-old girl.A panel of five senior judges, headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, ruled that Webster's six-year minimum term was too short.But Lord Phillips stressed: "His sentence was life imprisonment and such was his depravity that it was questionable whether the parole board would ever consider that he should be released."The court ruled that, having regard to French's youth and the fact that she had been corrupted by Webster, her sentence fell within the range that was properly open to the sentencing judge "and should not be disturbed".They had been urged to raise the length of the original sentences by the attorney general Lord Goldsmith.He said the crimes committed by Webster and French had "shocked and outraged public opinion".Webster, 40, and French, now 20, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, raped and indecently assaulted the baby and took photographs of the abuse.Webster was jailed for life in January after pleading guilty to rape, indecent assault, permitting indecent images to be taken of a child and making indecent images.The judge at St Albans crown court set a minimum term of six years in Webster's case. French was jailed for five years and given an extended licence period of five years after admitting the same charges.The baby's mother described the original sentences given to the pair as a "joke". She was unaware of the abuse until detectives visited her after finding photographs detailing the horrific abuse at Webster's home.Webster, described as "evil and depraved", also pleaded guilty to a separate charge of indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl.The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, said the cases of Webster and French were "exceptional in the nature of what took place and their depravity".He told the judges: "You may think that, having seen the photographs, that what took place was almost beyond comprehension. The acts of those two offenders will have done incalculable damage to the baby and her mother."
