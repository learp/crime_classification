Police recovered four more letter bombs from homes and a sorting office in Luton, Bedfordshire, yesterday where 10 identical packages were found at the weekend.Each A4 manilla envelope has a Jiffy bag inside containing a plastic box holding lighter fluid. Three envelopes also contained a powder-like substance which has been sent for forensic examination but is not believed to be dangerous. Police set up an incident room to deal with the packets but have not been able to find a motive. They have warned the public to exercise caution. Six packets were delivered to Luton addresses on Saturday morning and four more were recovered from two Royal Mail delivery offices in the town. Three others were found at residential addresses yesterday and a fourth at a local sorting office. "If you receive a suspicious or unexpected package, leave it alone and dial 999," said Detective Superintendent Nicky Dahl of Bedfordshire police.
