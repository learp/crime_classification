Liam Byrne's conviction for talking on his mobile phone while driving is the first setback in an otherwise unblemished political career since becoming an MP just over three years ago.The fact that a Home Office minister has flouted the law will no doubt be seized upon by the Conservatives as the debate over immigration controls begins to dominate the political landscape. Just this week, Mr Byrne was attacking the Tory leader, David Cameron, over his calls for a cap on migrant numbers to regain "control" of immigration.Mr Byrne has prospered since being catapulted into parliament on the back of a byelection victory in the Birmingham Hodge Hill constituency in July 2004.The married father of three, who worked in the business sector prior to arriving at Westminster, was made a junior minister in the Department of Health within nine months of being elected. He was moved to the Home Office in the May 2006 reshuffle and has remained there since.A very brief stint (two weeks) as the minister of state for police and counter-terrorism ended abruptly after the then home secretary, John Reid, handed him the thorny immigration portfolio. In his previous life, the 36-year-old worked for Accenture, the multinational consulting firm, and merchant bankers NM Rothschild, before co-founding a venture capital-backed technology company, eGS Group, in 2000.Between 1996 and 1997, he advised the Labour party on the reorganisation of Millbank and helped lead Labour's business campaign.
