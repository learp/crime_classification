A salesman who tried to sell one of his kidneys in an internet chat room to pay off gambling debts walked free from court yesterday after receiving a suspended jail sentence.Daniel Tuck, 26, the first person in Britain to be convicted of contravening the Human Tissue Act, agreed a price of £24,000 for the organ with an undercover reporter, Wolverhampton crown court heard.Judge Michael Challinor said he believed Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, was a dishonest individual who had no intention of donating a kidney. He suspended Tuck's 12-month sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250 in costs.Judge Challinor told Tuck, who had previous convictions for theft and deception: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts and an understandable revulsion at such practices. A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, told the court Tuck had pleaded guilty last month to a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation.Tuck was questioned by police after meeting a reporter from the Birmingham-based Sunday Mercury newspaper and agreeing a price of £24,000 for the kidney. The meeting was arranged in May last year after Tuck posted an advert on an internet chatroom used by those suffering from kidney disease.During the meeting, Tuck confirmed he was aware that sale of organs in the United Kingdom was illegal, Ms Miller said.Tuck was arrested in June last year and told police he had recently split with his girlfriend and was £25,000 in debt. "He said he wasn't thinking straight," Ms Miller said. "He said he put the advert on the site to see what would happen."Jas Mann, defending, said his client had been a broken man at the time of the offence. He said that Tuck was gambling on a regular basis and that whatever he was earning, he had "pumped into" fruit machines.A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority, set up under the 2004 Human Tissue Act to take action against trafficking in organs, said Tuck's conviction was the first successful prosecution of its kind.
