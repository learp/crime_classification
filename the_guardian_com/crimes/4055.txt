Police searching for a missing Polish farmhand have found a body concealed in a shallow grave.Danuta Domagalska, 27, went missing a fortnight ago from New Moor farm near Darlington, County Durham.Her brother, Piotr Lawniczak, 31, went missing after she disappeared and his body was found hanging in woods on Wednesday.Inspector Paul Etherington of Durham police said: "We can confirm that late yesterday afternoon specialist police search teams found the body of a female concealed in a shallow grave close to the farm."The body has been recovered by police and forensic specialist officers, and was taken to Darlington Memorial hospital where a postmortem was carried out overnight by a Home Office pathologist."The cause of death for the female has not been confirmed at this time."The body may not be formally identified for several days.Domagalska lived with her husband, Marcin, in an estate cottage at New Moor farm where they both worked. Her brother also lived there.She was described as a popular, hard-working and friendly member of staff at the dairy farm which also operates a successful ice-cream business.Her failure to attend work caused owners John and Susan Archer concern and they questioned the two men in the cottage. Unhappy with Lawniczak's explanation, they then called the police.By the time officers arrived, Lawniczak had vanished and appeals were made for him to come forward.His body was found hanging in dense woodland.The search for Domagalska continued with specialists draining slurry pits and ponds.Etherington said: "The police investigation led by Detective Superintendent Adrian Green is still very much ongoing surrounding the tragic events that have occurred at New Moor farm over the last two weeks."Green is expected to release more details tomorrow.Domagalska's five-year-old son, Kuba, is being cared for by relatives in Poland.
