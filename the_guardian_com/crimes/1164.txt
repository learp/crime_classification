Narcolepsy drugs misused by cramming students and cancer drugs purchased by bodybuilders were among a record £15.8m haul of illegal medicines seized by the UK’s healthcare products regulator over the course of a month.Operation Pangea, which was launched in the UK eight years ago and now involves 115 countries, recovered 6.2m illegal doses and devices – the latter included in figures for the first time. Also among the haul were slimming pills, 60,000 fake Durex condoms and 2 million erectile dysfunction drugs.Only 0.15% of the haul was counterfeit, with traders finding that they could increasingly source low-cost generic drugs from overseas.The UK haul from the annual month-long operation that ended on 16 June accounted for more than 25% of the global haul and was up significantly on last year’s domestic seizures, which amounted to £8.6m.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) head of enforcement, Alastair Jeffrey, said the high total in the UK was because authorities were “ahead of the game” but warned that the use of social media was making its task more difficult.“The criminals use social media really, really effectively,” he said. “They get exposure to millions of potential customers and users. We need to use social media, we need to get the message across that buying medicine online, in a lot of circumstances, is dangerous.”The regulator shut down 1,380 websites, 339 of which were in the UK, during the operation and has been working with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to try to get them to take down adverts for illegal medicines. Jeffrey said that organised gangs were increasingly becoming involved because they could hide behind the internet, police were not interested in the trade, profits were high and penalties lower compared with those for narcotics.“The sanction, in my personal opinion, doesn’t reflect the seriousness of the crime,” he said.Overseas, concerns have been raised that terrorists may also be entering the market.The extent of the challenge the MHRA faces on the consumer side has been illustrated by a PWC survey that found 28% of 18-to-34-year-olds had bought counterfeit medicines.The regulator has been contacting universities to raise awareness of the fact that students are taking the narcolepsy drugs, also used by people with ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder), the MHRA’s head of intelligence, Mark Jackson, said. Other areas of concern include breast cancer drugs, used by bodybuilders to destroy breast tissue, and slimming pills, which can cause cardiac events and strokes and have proved fatal in some cases. Jeffrey said that most of the drugs come from China and India, countries conspicuous by their absence from Operation Pangea. He said that efforts were ongoing to get them on board, which would make a big difference. The operation, coordinated through Interpol, concluded with a week of raids, which, in the UK, included 12,000 doses of Polish medicines recovered from a flat in Edinburgh and more from a shop in west London.Jeffrey said: “Emerging and new communities will probably feel more comfortable buying medicine in the language they understand and from people they understand but the bottom line is there is no doctor involved.”Seven people are under investigation for possible offences, following the operation, although Jeffrey said the number could increase.
