A member of the gang convicted of killing a Matalan store manager in a botched robbery was on police bail for an earlier murder at the time of the attack, it emerged today.Anthony Maina, 20, was found guilty yesterday of the manslaughter of 33-year-old Jamie Simpson, who was stabbed in the neck by Kobina Essel – known as Aggro – at the store in Dalston, east London, in March 2008.Essel, 19, was convicted of murder by an Old Bailey jury, while Maina, of Canning Town, east London, Simeon Jumah, 25, of Manor Park, east London, and Randy Osei-Owusu, 17, of Poplar, east London, were found guilty of manslaughter.Jurors were unable to agree on a charge of murder against Maina, Jumah, and Osei-Owusu, and were discharged from returning verdicts on that allegation.It was only , after prosecutors decided not to press for a retrial on that count, that the full extent of Maina's violent past could be revealed.Judge Martin Stephens also lifted reporting restrictions which prevented Osei-Owusu being named because of his age.The jury was not told that Maina had a violent criminal history which began when he was 14 – nor that he had been arrested in connection with the murder of 17-year-old Rizwan Darbar, who was stabbed as he tried to stop a gang stealing his friend's mobile phone.Although Maina was arrested shortly after Darbar's murder in October 2007, he was released on police bail because of lack of evidence.He was at large for 15 months, during which time he took part in the killing of Simpson as well as being caught with a knife, cannabis, crack cocaine and heroin, before finally being charged in January last year over the killing of Darbar.Seven months later he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years after being convicted of Darbar's murder by an Old Bailey jury.His name, however, could not be reported as by then he was facing a second trial over the death of Simpson.A Metropolitan police spokesman described the investigation into Darbar's murder as "both long and complex", with 10 arrests made and three people charged.He added: "Maina was charged at the earliest opportunity on 30 January 2009. Evidence which secured his charge was not available to us at the early stage of the inquiry."Yesterday, Darbar's family said they had no complaints "whatsoever" about the police investigation."The case was extremely difficult from the onset, there was very little forensic evidence, there was very little CCTV evidence," said Rizwan Darbar's brother Tausif. "The police did not leave a stone unturned in terms of the investigation."If anything was to blame for subsequent events, he added, it was the "culture of no comment" that had stymied police inquiries. He said it was only after a witness agreed to give evidence "at the last minute" that the police were able to charge Maina."Maybe if he had [agreed earlier] then maybe Jamie Simpson would still be alive," he said.The Old Bailey jury in the Simpson trial heard that the gang had planned to steal between £20,000 and £30,000 from the Matalan store in Dalston, but had eventually fled empty-handed.Jurors were told that Maina, Essel and Osei-Owusu entered the store during the robbery, while Jumah was said to have been the ringleader.The three hid in the store as they waited for Simpson to cash up after the shop closed on Easter Saturday.Essel then pounced, stabbing Simpson three times with a 10in kitchen knife; once in the shoulder, once in the back and once, fatally, in the neck, severing his carotid artery and jugular vein.Simpson's colleagues tried to stem the flow of blood with clothes and towels grabbed from the display, but he was declared dead by ambulance staff.Security guard Roy Williams, 31, of Edmonton, north London, who was alleged to have been the gang's "inside man", was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter. Jammal Chambers, 18, of Poplar, east London, and Duane Owusu, 20, of Manor Park, east London, were also cleared of the killing.But Williams, Chambers, and Owusu were convicted of conspiracy to rob – a charge the other four defendants had already admitted.Chambers was said to have recruited members of the raid gang while Owusu, the court heard, was the getaway driver.Simpson's parents, Lorna and Lambert Simpson, were at the Old Bailey as the verdicts were returned.In a statement, Mrs Simpson said: "There is no sentence that can bring Jamie back into our lives. No sentence can provide justice for the sickening betrayal we've encountered at the hands of his killers."We are all living a life sentence ourselves for having such a genuine, caring soul ripped from our world."One of her three daughters, Clare, also provided a statement, in which she said: "What's the point in living when there are people like this in this world that just don't care what consequences their actions have, and behave in such a way that makes you question what kind of society this is? Is there even a thread of common decency any more?"Maina, Essel, Jumah and Osei-Owusu will be sentenced on 22 March – the second anniversary of Simpson's death.
