In Woolwich, emotions remain raw 18 months after the murder of Lee Rigby thrust the community into the spotlight. Beverly Smith, 60, who was walking past a memorial at the spot where the soldier was killed, said: “I think the intelligence services know a lot more than they let on to the general public. I feel angry [that they didn’t do more]. It was a big upset to the local community, a big shock.”In the town centre, Christy, who did not want to give her surname, was also angry. The 62-year-old, originally from Nigeria, said the killers, both of Nigerian background, had shamed their community and could have been stopped. “They [the security services] had them on record. They should have been monitoring them every minute. They let them get away with it, that poor boy died for nothing,” she said.Bilal Khan, 32, a lawyer, said the security services could not monitor all suspected extremists all the time. “People would have objections to 24-hour surveillance if there isn’t credible evidence that someone’s about to commit a crime,” he said. “With hindsight, it’s easy to say things could have been done differently.”Khan thought the intelligence and security committee’s criticism of an internet company’s failure to report an online threat by Adebowale was harsh. “Do they [the internet companies] have the facility to, on their own, screen loads of people that are posting online and then report them? If that’s the case, there would be civil liberties concerns as well.”
