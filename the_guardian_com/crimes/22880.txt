A list of eight "most-wanted" criminals suspected of offences including drug smuggling and rape who are thought to be hiding in the Netherlands has been released.It includes accused or convicted members of organised crime networks who have fled justice in the UK and are thought to be hiding in or around Amsterdam.The list, published by charity Crimestoppers, features Robert Gerrard, 50, and Michael Moogan, 28, from Liverpool, who are suspected of having links to a drug cartel that imported cocaine to Britain.They were connected to a cafe in Rotterdam that was used by international drug lords as an operations centre.Fellow Liverpudlian Mark Fitzgibbon, 42, is also on the list, suspected of being part of an organised crime gang that was linked to 84.4kg of cannabis and 57.6kg of amphetamine found in his home town.Another suspect, Mark Liscott, 53, who is originally from Birmingham, is accused of drug dealing connected to gangs in Nottingham and London.Two more of the wanted men are from Greater Manchester â€“ Thomas Tooth and Liam Fynes. Tooth, 30, who uses the alias Thomas John Quinn, was convicted of unlawful wounding and affray over a fight in the Angel pub in Royton, Greater Manchester in 2008 where a man was left with permanent eye injuries.Fynes, 56, is suspected of drug smuggling.Iraqi Rezgar Zengana, 31, is being hunted by Police Scotland after he posed as a taxi driver and raped a 25-year-old woman.The last of the eight is James Tarrant, 58, who is wanted by Scotland Yard after being convicted in his absence of drug and gun crimes.The UK National Crime Agency's head of international operations, Hank Cole, said: "The NCA and its partners continue to pursue fugitives relentlessly. Many believe they can use the Netherlands as a base to continue their illegal activities, which still have an impact on the UK, but they are finding out that it is not a safe haven."The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the Dutch authorities has resulted in many of our most wanted being captured."However, the most important thing is the support of the public. Be our eyes and ears and let us know if you have any information, no matter how small or trivial, on the whereabouts of our targets."
