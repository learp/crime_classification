A week ago Rich Hurst was looking forward to the start of the busiest period of the year, with walkers and holidaymakers preparing for their annual pilgrimage to the Northumberland countryside.But today as the residents of Rothbury waited anxiously for the latest instalment in the hunt for gunman Raoul Moat, Hurst was resigned to the fact that this year things would be different."We are already about £1,000 down," he said from behind the counter of Tully's delicatessen and tea rooms."Obviously when they closed the whole town down earlier in the week it was very quiet, but even since it has been open we have really noticed that there just aren't the tourists there usually are."Hurst also lets a small self-catering cottage. Ominously he has already had his first cancellation. "The people who were due to be here next week have just cancelled because of what has been going on," he said.But across the road at the Newcastle Hotel barmaid Jo Aynsley says the dramatic events have caused a surge in trade."We have been much busier than usual," she said. "All the locals are in here all day and no one is talking about anything else. And then we have all the journalists and police too."So far the police operation, which today saw armed officers take up position inside the town's three schools, is thought to have cost many millions of pounds as officers from around the UK converge on the area with helicopters and reinforced vehicles.Most of the cost will be borne by Northumbria police, although it should be able to recoup some of the money spent from the Home Office.The vast scale of the manhunt, which is now in its seventh day, means the final bill is likely to be significantly higher than the £3.2m spent on the 24-day search for schoolgirl Shannon Matthews in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in February and March 2008.However standing outside the All Saints Church, Trudy Gray, the assistant priest for the area, said the town and its economy would bounce back.She said: "In the last couple of years we have dealt with floods and heavy snows as well as the gas supply being cut off. The people round here will pull together."They are used to coping with things and I am sure we will be back to normal pretty quickly."
