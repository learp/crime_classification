A postmortem examination was taking place today.Tearful groups of friends, some in school uniform, laid bouquets inside a police cordon. One teenage girl said Jessie was a former pupil at Maria Fidelis Roman Catholic school for girls in north London.Speaking at the scene, she said: "She was beautiful, She was a very kind and outspoken person, a bubbly girl. She had a heart of gold and was always happy. She would have put up a fight â€¦ I have known her since we were about 12."
