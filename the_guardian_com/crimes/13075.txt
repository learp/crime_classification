Detectives are hoping two young children who were being looked after by their 19-year-old aunt when she was stabbed to death might give them vital information.Police are continuing to work with the children aged three and four but said it was "quite a slow process". They are also questioning an 18-year-old man in connection with the death of Catherine Wynter, who was staying in her sister's home in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire on Boxing Day night.Detectives were granted a 36-hour extension to hold the man, from Borehamwood, by Hatfield magistrates on Thursday. He was arrested on Tuesday, the day Wynter's body was found by her mother.Another man, aged 26, from Islington, north London, was released without charge on Wednesday. Both men were known to Wynter and her sister but were not direct relatives.Detective Superintendent Michael Hanlon said police would not give any further details about their relationship but they would come out "in due course".The process of questioning the children is expected to take some time because of their young age.Forensic examination is continuing at the mid-terrace property in Beech Drive. Hanlon said no weapon had been found but searches were taking place.It is not yet known how much the children saw or heard of what happened to their aunt, who regularly looked after them."Obviously the most important issue is the children's welfare," Hanlon said.Police believe Wynter died sometime between 7pm on Boxing Day and 8am the following day. They said on Wednesday that she and the children were the only people staying in the house overnight.Wynter, who also went by the surname Briscoe, lived elsewhere in Borehamwood. Her family have described her as "a loving auntie" and a quiet girl who enjoyed life.
