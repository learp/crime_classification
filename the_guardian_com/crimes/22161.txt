Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than are white people, according to research published today. In some areas a fifth of the entire black population aged over 10 has been arrested in the past year. Merseyside police had one of the highest rates, with nearly one in three black people aged over 10 arrested, according to the figures. The number of black people sentenced to prison terms was between four and seven times greater than that of white people in 10 selected police forces. The figures, compiled by the independent research bulletin Statewatch, come in the midst of the argument about the policing of ethnic minority communities. The bulletin suggests that 'institutionalised racism pervades the criminal justice system'. Among the survey's findings are that in 90 per cent of cases where white people have been murdered, suspects have been identified. The figure for murders of black people is only 60 per cent. Stop and search, which has increased by 21 per cent in the past year and ninefold since 1986, also points up differences. Black people are 7.5 times more likely to be stopped and searched, and four times more likely to be arrested, than white people. Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, 15 arrested the equivalent of one in five of the black population over the age of 10. The use of stop and search in general varies widely. Dorset, with four stops per 1,000 population, and Essex, with six, are at one end of the scale. In Cleveland, home of 'zero tolerance', the figure is one in 10. The rate for white people in general was 19 per 1,000, for black people 142 and for Asians 45. Cleveland stopped and searched 419 out of every 1,000 black people. Merseyside was the next highest: three in 10 of the black population, according to the report. In 1997-98 there were 1,964,686 arrests in England and Wales, a rate of 43 per 1,000 of the population over the age of 10. Cleveland and Merseyside (70 per 1,000) have the highest arrest rates, and Surrey (24 per 1,000) and Cornwall (19 per 1,000) the lowest. Norfolk had the highest arrest rate of black people relative to their numbers, arresting 857 of an estimated black population of 1,400 a rate of 612 per 1,000 although Statewatch caution that the figures could have been distorted by an event attracting black people from outside the area. In Norfolk a black person is 18 times more likely to be arrested than a white person. The next highest area was Merseyside (298 per 1,000), followed by Staffordshire (291 per 1,000). The lowest rates were Cumbria (38 per 1,000) and Humberside (75 per 1,000). The proportion of arrests arising from stop and search has fallen from 17 per cent in 1986 to 10 per cent in 1997-98. At least 900,000 people in England and Wales were stopped and searched last year and allowed to go on their way. Of those arrested, 20 per cent were subject to no further action.'One of the most significant statistics, in light of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, is the huge differential in the proportion of black and white homicides in which someone had been identified as a suspect,' says the report, compiled from figures from the Home Office, Audit Commission, Office of National Statistics and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. There was no suspect in 10 per cent of cases with white murder victims, but the same applied to 40 per cent of cases with black murder victims. Cautioning was used less frequently for black people than for other ethnic groups, the survey found. Black people also serve longer prison terms on average, with 47 per cent of white prisoners serving more than four years compared with 61 per cent of black prisoners. Tony Bunyan, editor of Statewatch, said the report indicated a collective failure to tackle racism within the criminal justice system since the Scarman report of 1981.
