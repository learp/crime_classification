He died a short time later in hospital.He was with a group of fellow Indian students visiting Manchester for Christmas when he was murdered.On Monday, Kiaran Stapleton, 20, from Ordsall, Salford, was remanded in custody for 24 hours at City of Manchester magistrates court.Shortly before the hearing began, four armed officers dressed in black stood in each corner of the court. Stapleton, who was handcuffed, was then brought into the dock and asked for his name.He replied: "Psycho. Psycho Stapleton."The defendant, wearing a grey T-shirt and grey jogging bottoms and flanked by two police officers, then confirmed his date of birth.Ben Southam, prosecuting, said: "He appears charged with murder. That's a matter that can only be dealt with at the crown court by a judge under section 115 of the Coroners and Justice Act."He added: "He will be sent to Manchester crown court in due course." There was no application for bail.Bidve was studying for a micro-electronics postgraduate qualification at Lancaster University. The student arrived in the UK in September after completing an electronics degree at Pune University.The killing generated national and international shock, especially in the victim's home country.His father, Subhash Bidve, has been critical of the way the British and Indian authorities have handled the case. He found out about his son's death on Facebook at home in Pune, India, before police in the UK could contact him. Two officers from Greater Manchester police have since flown to India to meet the Bidve family.Hundreds of people plan to attend a candlelit memorial service for the student in Ordsall Lane, Salford, at 6pm on Monday, while hundreds more are expected at a peace march for him in India, starting near Nehru Park in New Delhi at 6pm and finishing at the British embassy.
