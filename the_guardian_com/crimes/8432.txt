A serving Metropolitan police constable and a former police officer were among six men arrested yesterday on suspicion of bugging phones for a central London private detective agency.Scotland Yard's anti-corruption unit made the arrests after months of monitoring and surveillance, following a tip-off from British Telecom. The serving policeman is 37 and based in Hackney, while the ex-policeman is 30 and from Kettering, Northamptonshire. The other men who have been detained are a 57-year-old from Highgate, north London; a 33-year-old from Battersea, south London; a 29-year-old from Sittingbourne, Kent; and a 56-year-old from Friern Barnet, north London. A police source said all were employed by, or in some way connected with, the private detective agency, which police refused to name but which is based in the City. All six are alleged to have been involved in illegal interception of private telephone calls, carried out for clients, although no clients have been arrested. The calls are believed to have been on personal and business matters rather than security issues. The men are in custody at a north London police station, where they will be interviewed by Scotland Yard detectives. Officers were also searching their homes and several business addresses. Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Gwilliam, of the Met's anti-corruption command, said: "Where serving police officers are suspected of being involved in any type of corruption we will not hesitate to make arrests."
