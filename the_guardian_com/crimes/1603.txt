The number of children murdered by their parents has risen by about one-third in the past year, from 24 to 33 victims, according to the latest Home Office homicide figures published yesterday. The figures reveal that this "hidden" crime of parental child murder overshadows the highly publicised murders in which five under-16s were shot dead and a further four children were stabbed to death.The annual homicide figures show that the total number of murders in England and Wales in 2006/07 fell from 769 to 757 - the fifth successive year in which the murder rate has fallen from a peak of 1,047 in 2002/03, when Dr Harold Shipman's victims were included in the total.The violent crime figures also record a 14% fall in gun crime offences from 21,527 in 2005/06 to 18,489 in 2006/07. Those who died in shootings rose over the same period - the year to April 2007 - from 49 victims to 59. But more recent figures to September 2007 published last week showed that the annual gun death toll has fallen again to 49.Knife crime led to 258 deaths in 2006/07 compared with 219 the previous year.The Home Office report also showed that British Crime Survey findings reveal a startling 28% of women and 18% of men aged 16 to 59 report that they have been victims of domestic abuse at some point in their lives. The most common type of "intimate violence" reported was partner abuse which involves non-physical abuse, threats, sexual assault or stalking. Five percent said they had experienced this in the past year.Generally those who had experienced abuse were no longer with the abusive partner. Three-quarters of victims had told someone about what had happened but only 13% actually went to the police.New police force strength figures published yesterday showed the number of uniformed officers fell by 611 to 141,731 last year. But this was more than matched by an 80% increase in community support officers to 15,391, with most of them being used to establish dedicated neighbourhood policing teams in every area from this March.Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said the figures showed that homicide remained a rare crime but the prevalence of intimate violence - family abuse, sexual abuse and stalking - shone a light on the violence hidden behind closed doors. He said the violent crime action plan to be launched by the home secretary would extend the network of specialist domestic violence courts and trained domestic violence advisers to support victims.But Katharine Rake of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality, said the results of the research made depressing reading. "Only 60% of victims who go to the police find them very or fairly helpful, while only one in five people think that the government and the criminal justice agencies are doing enough about rape. Wholesale reform is needed to give women confidence in the system and to ensure that every victim is treated appropriately," she said.
