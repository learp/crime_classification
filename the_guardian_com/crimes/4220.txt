A woman who stalked the footballer Rio Ferdinand and his family has been jailed for 10 weeks and put on a restraining order for 10 years.Susanne Ibru, 38, appeared at Crewe magistrates' court on Monday after being convicted last month of harassment of the Manchester United and England player.The defendant was living in Peckham, south London, when she made three 400-mile round trips to Ferdinand's home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on 21 February last year, and again on 16 and 18 June, her trial heard.The 32-year-old footballer told the court that Ibru left him fearing for his family's safety by turning up at his home and demanding to speak to him.Sentencing, District Judge Nicholas Sanders said he was "concerned" by the defendant's behaviour since she had been in custody.He said: "The pre-sentence report describes you as living in a fantasy world, unable to interpret social situations and boundaries."You display a predatory and manipulative lifestyle and try to deliberately mislead interviewers."On hearing the sentence, Ibru said: "I will be appealing against that."As she was led to the cells, she added: "I stick two fingers up at you."
