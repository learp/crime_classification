The uncle of a five-year-old girl who was mauled to death by an illegal pit bull terrier was jailed yesterday for owning the dog that attacked her.Kiel Simpson, 23, was sentenced to eight weeks in prison for unlawfully possessing the dog which killed his niece, Ellie Lawrenson, in the early hours of New Year's Day.The court heard that Simpson, who had previous convictions for drug dealing, felt "morally responsible" for the child's death and "wanted to crawl into a hole".At a previous hearing at Liverpool magistrates court, he had admitted owning the American pit bull terrier, a type banned under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.Ellie was attacked while staying with her grandmother, Jacqueline Simpson, at her house in Eccleston, St Helen's, while her parents were at a party.The district judge, Alan Jones, rejected Simpson's claim that he had been trying to find a new home for the dog when the attack took place. The judge told him: "This is a dog of a type nobody has been allowed to possess for the last 15 years, and for good reason. They are capable of inflicting serious injuries "The court heard that the dog had been involved in two previous incidents. In May 2006, he attacked a neighbour's Jack Russell terrier; six months later, he bit Simpson's younger sister, Kelsey, leaving her needing hospital treatment for three puncture wounds to her thigh.The judge said the fact that he had instructed his family not to let the dog inside the house did not absolve him of responsibility. Simpson was also banned from owning a dog for five years.Michael Fogarty, defending, urged the judge to impose a suspended prison sentence on Simpson. "He loved Ellie and was devastated by her death," he said. "No one is more devastated than Mr Simpson... He is being punished now and will go on being punished for some time."In April, Simpson's mother, Jacqueline, 46, was charged with manslaughter. Her trial is set to begin in September.
