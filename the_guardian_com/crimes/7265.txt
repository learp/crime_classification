A drug dealer killed a father of five then severed the body's limbs in an attempt to prevent identification of the victim, a court has heard.An angler found the left arm of Anthony Whitefield, 47, in a reed bed at a fishing lake in Roding Lane, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, on 31 March, 2011.When police investigated the discovery they also found the right arm in the lake. Detectives used fingerprints and DNA samples from the limbs to identify Whitefield, who had been reported missing seven weeks earlier.When they went to the home of Douglas Binet, the last person to reported to have seen him alive, they found Whitefield's legs and torso in bin bags in the garden, prosecutor Sasha Wass told Chelmsford crown court.She added: "The victim's head has never been found." Wass said detectives were able to establish that Binet had bought bags similar to those containing the body parts at a nearby Homebase around the time of the killing â€“ because he used his Nectar card to claim points on the purchase.She said both men were involved in the drugs trade and were involved in dealing together. Binet, 53, from Loughton, denies murder.Wass said that Whitefield had been reported missing from his home in Loughton by his 15-year-old daughter on 8 February. He had four other adult children and had worked as a taxi driver.She added: "In 2010 he was convicted for an offence and lost his taxi licence as a result."Since then he had struggled for money and it seems as though he turned to the drugs trade to cope with his financial difficulties."Whitefield was separated from his children's mother and in a new relationship with Debbie Woods, also from Loughton. Woods last saw him on 7 February, when she described him as acting "furtively".He said he was going to collect some money and, when he did not return to her home, Woods suspected he had started a new relationship. The following morning she sent Whitefield a text message calling him "no good" and "sleazy".She received a reply reading "fuck you", which the prosecution alleges was sent by Binet as part of a bid to make it appear as though his victim was still alive.Wass said: "We cannot be sure precisely when Mr Whitefield died but he was not seen alive after this date and there was no other activity from his phone."The case is expected to last three weeks.
