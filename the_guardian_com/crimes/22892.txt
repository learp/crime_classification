The attorney general yesterday asked to examine the file of a man who escaped a jail sentence after admitting he had had sex with a 12-year-old girl he met in an internet chat room.Michael Barrett, 20, received a two-year conditional discharge at Bristol crown court on Monday. The trainee croupier, who pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse, was 18 when he befriended the girl, then 12, from Manchester. The attorney general's office said it was responding to a request by Phoenix Survivors, a support group for victims of child molesters, who had asked for the case to be referred to the court of appeal, which can impose a tougher sentence. "We are considering whether the sentence is unduly lenient," a spokeswoman said. On sentencing Barrett, of Southmead in Bristol, the judge, Michael Roach, said it was an "exceptional case" as the 12-year-old had instigated sexual contact: "I trust you to behave yourself now ... Set yourself straight," he said. Barrett was also put on the sex offenders' register.
