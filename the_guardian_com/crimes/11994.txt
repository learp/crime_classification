A senior figure at a charity that provides support to victims of sex trafficking today welcomed the news thatthe government is considering prosecuting men who pay for sex, describing it as "the only answer in terms of curbing demand".Senior ministers are looking into adopting the Swedish approach of criminalising the purchase, rather than the sale of sex, in a bid to curb demand for prostitution and the growth in sex trafficking.Frances Broderick, the manager of the Poppy Project, which provides support and housing for women who have been trafficked into prostitution, said that the Swedish model was the "best example", but condemned the UK government for not having done more."The only answer in terms of curbing demand is to criminalise the buying of prostitution services, as has been done in Sweden," she said."As much research has shown, where the sex trade is legalised, the trafficking of women increases, with illegal brothels operating exactly as they did before. "Since the Swedish government passed laws criminalising the purchase of sexual services, prostitution, together with the trafficking of women and young girls into Sweden, has diminished."She added that the UK government had failed to act on its own recommendations, as contained its 2003 review of British laws on prostitution.The recommendations included greater enforcement of laws prohibiting kerb-crawling and looking at "innovative ways" to halt the sex trade.Maddy Coy, from the Child and Women Abuse Unit at London Metropolitan University, cautioned against assuming that prosecution would be an effective deterrent.Ms Coy was one of the authors of a report that attempted to find out what would deter men from paying for sex.She said that the study reached no clear conclusions and that there was a need to explore "the attitudes and beliefs that support the sex industry and how do we address them"."I would welcome a debate on the wider issues of men buying sex rather than simply criminalising them."But Cari Mitchell of the English Collection of Prostitutes said that the Swedish model had been a "disaster" for Swedish prostitutes."Criminalising clients forces prostitution further underground. Women have even less time to check out men fearful of arrest. "Instead, women are pushed into more isolated, less well-lit areas where they are more vulnerable to attack. Whatever anyone thinks about men paying for sex, safety should be the priority."Ms Mitchell said that the issues that needed to be addressed were "poverty, debt, rape and domestic violence, lack of housing, cuts in benefits, and low wages in other occupations which force women into prostitution and which the government itself found in its review of the prostitution laws".She said that the government should follow the example of New Zealand and decriminalise prostitution.
