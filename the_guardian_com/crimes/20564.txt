Ireland's high court has cleared the way for the extradition of an English journalist to France over the murder of a French film-maker more than 14 years ago.Ian Bailey is wanted by French authorities in relation to the killing of Sophie Toscan du Plantier, who was beaten to death in Cork in December 1996. Bailey, 53, of Schull, County Cork, was arrested during the initial police investigation but was never charged and has denied any involvement in the killing.Toscan du Plantier, 39, was found with severe injuries outside her holiday home at Toormore, near Schull, two days before Christmas 1996.The savage nature of the killing shocked the quiet French expatriate community of west Cork where the well-connected film-maker, whose late husband was a friend of the former French president Jacques Chirac, had chosen to live.Like Toscan du Plantier, Bailey moved to Ireland in the 1990s to seek a new life in one of the republic's most idyllic coastal regions. A former freelance journalist who had a number of articles published in the Irish Times, Bailey has since graduated with a law degree and successfully sued a number of British and Irish newspapers for libel for linking him to the murder.At Dublin's high court, Mr Justice Michael Peart ruled against an objection from Bailey's lawyers that the extradition was prevented under the Extradition Act because the alleged offence was committed outside France.Bailey, who is originally from Manchester, also argued that the warrant was only valid if the French authorities were intent on a prosecution. However, Peart was satisfied it was issued with the intention of bringing proceedings, and ruled that the decision of Irish prosecutors not to prosecute him had no bearing on the extradition. The judge said there was no "cogent or compelling" evidence that Bailey would not receive a fair trial if surrendered to France.Bailey, who has said he is prepared to go all the way to the European court of justice to prevent the extradition, has until Tuesday to challenge the ruling in Ireland's supreme court.
