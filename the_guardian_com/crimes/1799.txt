The surgery where serial killer Harold Shipman is believed to have murdered at least five of his patients is to be closed, it was announced yesterday.Health authority officials have decided that it would be "inappropriate" for relatives to have to use or even pass by the surgery in the centre of Hyde, Greater Manchester.Shipman operated a one-man practice from the surgery for six years during which he set out on a killing spree which led to him receiving 15 life sentences at Preston crown court last month. The decision to move to new premises was endorsed last night by the Tameside and Glossop community health council. "We think it would be very unsettling for patients to be treated in premises where at least five women have died at the hands of their GP," said Pauline Davenport, chair of the council. "We need to restore some of the trust in the patient-doctor relationship that has been eroded by recent events. The West Pennine area health authority does not expect any move for at least three months. "In the short term, the only realistic option is to keep the surgery open," said a spokesman. He said the medical practices committee would be asked to declare a vacancy. The health authority and the community health council believe more than one doctor should take over Shipman's list of more than 3,000 patients.
