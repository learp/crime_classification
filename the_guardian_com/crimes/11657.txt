Teenager Luke Mitchell, who murdered his 14-year-old girlfriend Jodi Jones, was told by the high court in Edinburgh today that he will spend at least 20 years in prison.The 16-year-old was detained for life by Lord Nimmo Smith after being found guilty last month of what the judge called a "truly evil" murder. Jodi was stripped, tied up and stabbed to death in woods near her home in Dalkeith, Midlothian, on June 30 2003. At the time of Mitchell's conviction, the judge said: "It lies beyond any skill of mine to look into the black depths of your mind. "You have been convicted of a truly evil murder - one of the most appalling crimes that any of us can remember - and you will rightly be regarded as wicked." Mitchell was 14 at the time of Jodi's death.
