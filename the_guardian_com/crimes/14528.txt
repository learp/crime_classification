The detective leading the investigation into the disappearance of missing Yorkshire woman Claudia Lawrence said he had information that she was involved in relationships of "complexity and mystery".Lawrence, 35, was last seen close to her home on 18 March. Almost 11 weeks after she went missing, North Yorkshire police have formally classified the investigation into her disappearance as one of suspected murder.Detective Superintendent Ray Galloway told the Crimewatch programme that he was certain Lawrence had not told her family or friends about some of the relationships in her life and that information about these could be vital.Galloway appealed for anyone who had been involved in a relationship with Lawrence to come forward. "As the investigation has developed, it's apparent that some of Claudia's relationships had an element of complexity and mystery to them," he said."I am certain that some of those relationships were not known to her family or her friends."I need to know the details of those relationships, in fact I do know the details of some of them, and I would urge anybody that was involved in a relationship with Claudia, or knew of one that a friend, a colleague, a neighbour was involved in, please, if they're going to be discreet and if they want to actually enable us to deal with it in a controlled way, a confidential way, they need to pick up that phone."Lawrence's friends and family have previously dismissed speculation she had a secret boyfriend.After the programme aired, police said they had received about 40 calls offering information about her relationships.Lawrence did not arrive for a 6am shift at her job as a chef on the morning of 19 March. The Crimewatch appeal showed reconstructions of her last known movements and interviews with her father, sister and closest friend.One witness reported seeing a couple on Melrosegate Bridge at about 5.35am on 19 March, while another saw a man and a woman arguing near the university half an hour later.Lawrence's sister, Alexandria Sims, said: "I find it hard to accept that people just vanish into thin air. There must be people out there that have seen something suspicious or who know something that's happened."The investigation is the biggest North Yorkshire police have conducted since the search for the multiple killer Mark Hobson five years ago.
