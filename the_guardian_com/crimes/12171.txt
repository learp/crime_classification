Armed police today arrested three men in connection with the murder of the Hells Angels member Gerry Tobin, who was shot in the back of the head while riding down a busy motorway.The assistant chief constable of Warwickshire police, Bill Holland, said police made early-morning raids at two addresses in Coventry and one in Nuneaton.Mr Holland said the raids by Warwickshire and West Midlands police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency were a "significant development" and the men were being held for questioning at a Warwickshire police station.Mr Holland told reporters: "Armed officers arrested three men on suspicion of the murder of Gerry Tobin. Search operations are currently under way at the addresses. Other properties may be searched as part of the ongoing inquiry."Mr Tobin, 35, was killed on the M40 as he rode home from the Bulldog Bash bikers' festival in Warwickshire on August 12.Mr Holland said the investigation was "active and ongoing" and praised the public response.Police continued to appeal for information, he said, particularly from motorists who may have seen a dark-coloured Rover 600 series car on the A46 or M40 between 2pm and 3pm on Sunday August 12. On Monday, police released video footage of Mr Tobin smiling at a security camera minutes before he was shot dead.CCTV cameras at a petrol station in Stratford-upon-Avon taped a "completely relaxed" Mr Tobin filling up his Harley-Davidson motorbike in what police said was his last known stop before his death.Police confirmed that a second gunshot had hit the motorbike. Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence said he believed Mr Tobin was targeted by the killers but still did not know whether the attack was personal or Mr Tobin was killed for being a Hells Angel.Macclesfield-born Mr Tobin emigrated with his family to Canada as a boy. According to the country's National Post newspaper he led Bible studies at his home in Calgary and dreamed of becoming a missionary before returning to England 10 years ago.The murder has prompted fears of a violent feud erupting between rival motorcycle clubs, but Mr Lawrence urged bikers not to take the law into their own hands.
