A man has been arrested by police investigating the hit-and-run death of a 16-year-old boy.Callum Hilton was struck by a car shortly before 6.30pm on Saturday in Bury, Greater Manchester. The incident happened on a busy main road with several 30mph speed limit warning signs. Speaking shortly before news of the arrest emerged, Detective Inspector Amber Waywell of Greater Manchester police said the youngster's family were "going through hell".The officer added: "Callum's mother and grandfather just want to know what happened to him. It's just awful. I can't imagine what his family, his mother, will be going through."A young boy goes out on a Saturday evening and doesn't come home. She must be beside herself with grief and we are trying to support her as best we can."Callum was heading to a party which had been publicised on Facebook with two friends and a cousin. He was crossing Stand Lane in Radcliffe, near the Hawthorn hotel, when he was hit by a silver or white Peugeot and thrown about 20 feet across the road. The car was travelling down the hill towards Radcliffe town centre.Callum sustained a serious head injury and was taken to hospital where he died shortly after midnight. His family were with him at the time, police said."We don't know exactly what address they were going to," the officer said."The reason they were crossing the road was because they needed to get directions and they saw the hotel on the opposite side of the road."From viewing the CCTV footage Callum and his cousin had made it halfway across the road and the other two were waiting to cross."His cousin was slightly ahead so was narrowly missed and Callum was struck by the vehicle."She added: "It is a busy road, it's a fast road, it's a slope."
