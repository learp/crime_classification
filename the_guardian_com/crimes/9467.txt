A Sardinian chef whose wife left him for a childhood sweetheart she found through the Friends Reunited website travelled across Europe to murder his rival, a court heard yesterday.Francesco Matta's wife, Susan, started a relationship with Stephen Keen after exchanging emails more than 30 years after they had last spoken. She flew to the UK to see him for the first time since their teenage years, but eight days after she moved there permanently to be with him Mr Matta arrived at their home in Tiverton, Devon, and stabbed Mr Keen to death, a jury at Exeter crown court was told.The RAF flight lieutenant suffered two knife wounds to the front of his throat and two to the neck, and 13 defensive wounds to his hands.When the police arrived Mr Matta told them: "I came here to kill the man. I have done what I had to do. I have done my job. I am an executioner."The court heard that Mr Matta admits killing Mr Keen in July last year but denies murder. The prosecutor, Martin Meeke QC, said the 56-year-old would say he should be convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility because of depression. "We say it was not depression but revenge which drove the defendant to plan and put into effect the cold-blooded killing of the man for whom his wife had left him," Mr Meeke said.Mrs Matta, 53, and Mr Keen had been sweethearts in Tiverton when 14 and 16, and kept in touch after he joined the RAF, but then had an argument.She moved to Sardinia with Mr Matta in 2003, but the next year contacted Mr Keen, who was then living with his wife, Doreen, through Friends Reunited. He later told her he wanted to spend the rest of his life with her and in 2006 they were reunited.The jury heard that Mr Matta, from Cagliari, travelled via Milan, Locarno and Paris, and bought a knife, rope, petrol and a pick axe handle as he drove to Devon. Mr Meeke said that after he arrived he claimed there was a Mafia contract killing on Mr Keen, 54, and although he had stopped it, the killer had to be paid â‚¬50,000.He was asked to leave but Mrs Matta told officers she then saw her husband lunging at her lover.The case continues.
