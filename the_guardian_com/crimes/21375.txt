The Tesco Express store in Bristol that has been the focus of violent protests is to be reopened, the chain has said.Tesco said the store, in the Stokes Croft area of the city, would be open for business again "soon", arguing that local businesses and residents wanted it back. However, there will be fears that further protests could follow the reopening."We will reopen the store soon," a Tesco spokesman said. "We're also playing our part in a community dialogue following the disorder. Local businesses and residents tell us they see us as a catalyst for further investment and regeneration â€“ they want us to reopen."Violence broke out around the store on two nights last month. A week later, there was another night and day of violence.There has long been opposition in Stokes Croft to the opening of the Tesco. However, local protestors claimed much of the violence was caused by people travelling from outside the area.Tesco representatives have met with the community's newly-elected Green party councillor, Gus Hoyt, to discuss the unrest.Hoyt said he would be calling for an independent inquiry into the cause of the protests, adding: "The local community want to get to the bottom of what happened and move on."The councillor had hoped that Tesco could be persuaded to "bow out gracefully" for "public safety".Earlier, detective Chief Inspector Will White, of Avon and Somerset police, called for the public to help the force's investigation into the incidents. He said: "A number of people have used the large disorders to commit serious criminal offences."We are determined to identify the outstanding offenders who have done extensive damage to the Stokes Croft area to make them accountable to the local residents and businesses that experienced the consequences of their actions."We need the assistance of the public to do this, and hope that these video clips and images prompt more people to come forward and help us bring the remaining offenders to justice."
