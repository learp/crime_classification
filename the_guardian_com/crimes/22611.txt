A Northern Ireland pensioner who was seriously wounded in a shotgun attack is a convicted child rapist, it emerged on Saturday.William McKillop was shot as he worked in a shed at his home in Ballycastle on the north Antrim coast on Thursday evening.The Police Service of Northern Ireland said they are treating the attack on the 74-year-old as attempted murder.It was revealed on Saturday that McKillop was sentenced to 12 years in 2006 for the rape of one young girl and for sexually molesting another. He was released on licence last year.A former Anglican sexton, McKillop was described by a judge as guilty of abuse "of the worst kind".He pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault against one of his victims.McKillop started to abuse his first victim when she was only seven years old and continued to rape and abuse her until she turned 16.He molested the other girl from when she was aged about eight until she turned 19.His crimes were only detected after one of the girls told a local minister in the Church of Ireland about the rape and the abuse.Local SDLP councillor Donal Cunningham condemned those behind the vigilante-style shooting.He said: "No one has the right or mandate to take the law into their own hands and to act as judge, jury and executioner."
