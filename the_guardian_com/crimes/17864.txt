Paul Gascoigne has been fined £1,000 after he admitted common assault and drunk and disorderly charges linked to an incident at a railway station.Gascoigne, 46, who has battled alcoholism for many years, was fined £600 for one charge of assault and £400 for a drunk and disorderly charge at Stevenage magistrates court.He was also ordered to pay £100 in compensation to Jack Sherrington, a security guard whom he assaulted, as well as court costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £60.The former England midfielder, who lives in Gateshead, was arrested after officers were called to Stevenage rail station in Hertfordshire at about 10.30pm on 4 July.Gascoigne was originally charged with two counts of assault, one involving his former wife, Sheryl, but that charge was dropped.In court he listened to the charges being read to him and entered guilty pleas.The court heard that Gascoigne was travelling from Newcastle upon Tyne to London King's Cross but got off the train at Stevenage station.Staff at the station noticed he was drunk staggering towards the railway tracks, and tried to help him by putting him in a wheelchair, but he became abusive towards Sherrington.Elaine McMillan, prosecuting, said Gascoigne grabbed hold of Sherrington in the neck area, an assault that lasted a few seconds. Sherrington did not suffer any injuries.The court heard that Gascoigne, who received treatment for alcoholism in a US clinic this year, had been in Newcastle visiting his ill father, who has a heart condition.Gascoigne's lawyer, Gavin Harris, said his client had consumed a small amount of alcohol to relieve a "combination of stress caused by worry for his father and acute pain from a hip operation six weeks previously".Harris said that because Gascoigne had not drunk alcohol for a significant period of time, the effects were stronger than would have otherwise been the case.The court heard that Gascoigne's ex-wife and children were called to the station, and in her sentencing the chair of the bench, Carolyn Marsh, pointed out that his 17-year-old son was "distressed".The court also heard that Gascoigne was receiving one-to-one treatment for his alcoholism, which was continuing. Harris said: "Mr Gascoigne is remorseful and apologises for his actions."With his sunglasses back on, Gascoigne left the court and was driven away in a grey Porsche.In a statement outside court, Harris said: "Mr Gascoigne has asked me to say a few words on his behalf. He wants to publicly apologise for his actions that evening. He now wishes to be left alone to carry on with his recovery."
