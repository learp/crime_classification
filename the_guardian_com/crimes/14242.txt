A man jailed for life in 1993 for the gangster-style killing of a retired science teacher had his conviction quashed today by the court of appeal.The appeal judges ruled that "criticisms and failures" brought to their attention in the trial of Andrew Adams, now 36, had the cumulative effect of rendering the verdict unsafe.Jurors at the original trial had taken the rare move in December of giving testimony to the appeal that their decision was affected by "prejudice and bias" voiced by their colleagues outside the jury room.A female juror had remarked on several occasions during the trial that she knew "these lads are guilty", the appeal court heard.But the judges rejected the allegations of jury bias, saying instead that it was deficiencies in the pre-trial preparation that led to the conviction being quashed.Lord Justice Gage said a failure to use evidence relating to three topics, which was available to the defence before trial, had demonstrated that "for whatever reason, the legal advisers at trial had failed in those respects in their pre-trial preparations".Jack Royal, a 58-year-old grandfather, was shot dead on his doorstep in Gateshead in 1990 - a killing said to have been in revenge for his fatal stabbing three years earlier of his son's former business partner, in self-defence.After the jury found him guilty of Mr Royal's killing, the trial judge told Mr Adams, then 23: "You have been convicted of a brutal murder which was in every sense akin to an execution." His co-defendant was acquitted.The appeal judges today concluded: "We are not to be taken as finding that if there had been no such failures the appellant would inevitably have been acquitted. We are however satisfied for the reasons given that the verdict is unsafe."Speaking after hearing of the findings, Mr Adams said: "I am overwhelmed with all that has happened."A few minutes ago I was a prisoner serving a life sentence for a crime I did not commit. I am now a free man."He said he would now return to Newcastle to rebuild his life. "During the past 14 years my mum has died, my friends have got married, settled down and had children, whilst I have been in prison."Ben Rose, his solicitor, added: "This is a great day, a sad day and a shameful day ... shameful day because the material which has led the court of appeal to quash Mr Adams's conviction was there for his original lawyers to examine - something they failed to do." The Crown later said it would not be seeking a retrial.
