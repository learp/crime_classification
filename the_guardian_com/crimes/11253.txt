Detectives are "confident" they have identified a woman whose head was found on Tuesday morning in a plastic bag on Arbroath beach, Scotland.Tayside police said they were searching a flat in Brechin's South Esk Street where a 36-year-old woman had been reported missing by her employer. They went to the flat after a tip-off.Earlier, police had been unable to link the head to any reported missing person cases.Yesterday the coastguard reported to Tayside police the discovery of further human remains on the shoreline at Carnoustie, along the coast from Arbroath. After the head was found on Tuesday, two hands were recovered as well.Detective Chief Inspector Graham McMillan, who is leading the investigation, said: "We will be speaking to a number of people over the course of the day in a bid to establish the woman's last known movements, when she was last seen, and to establish the circumstances of her death."Establishing the identity of this woman is the first step in a very complex and detailed inquiry."Two sisters aged eight and 11 found the head, wrapped in a plastic bag.The woman was believed to have been in her mid-20s to mid-30s, and had brown eyes, brown eyebrows and shoulder-length brown hair."She had a pale complexion with light freckling over the cheeks and bridge of her nose. There is also a distinctive depressed circular scar in the middle of her forehead, just below the hairline," McMillan said."Her nails were short but appear to have been well maintained and groomed."Before today's developments, police had searched missing persons databases for all of Europe and said the search could be expanded worldwide.
