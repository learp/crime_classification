Much of a murder trial will be held in secret for reasons of "national security", an Old Bailey judge ruled yesterday.In an unprecedented decision, Mr Justice Ousley overruled protests by the defence that such a trial could be unfair, and from seven media organisations that it would result in secret justice.There was "a very real possibility" the prosecution would otherwise be forced to drop the case against Wang Yam, 45, a financial trader from north London, said Ousley; it would not be possible to use what he called "lesser measures" such as anonymity or screens for witnesses.He rejected defence counsel Geoffrey Robertson QC's claim that this threat represented "forensic blackmail". He was satisfied there would be a fair trial, and that crown counsel Mark Ellison's claim for secrecy had been "compellingly made out".Yam denies murdering Allan Chappelow, a recluse aged 86, at his Hampstead home, along with charges of burglary and deception. Yam was accompanied by a Mandarin-speaking interpreter during the crown's two-day application for a secrecy order, much of it behind closed doors.The judge said a certificate had been issued by ministers, but did not disclose its national security reasons; he gave only part of his judgment in open court, adding that even "speculating" about what was said in secret sessions would constitute contempt.
