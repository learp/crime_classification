Two members of the Outlaws biker gang have been convicted of murdering Gerry Tobin, the Hells Angel who was shot dead on the M40 motorway in 2007.Simon Turner, 41, of Nuneaton, and Dane Garside, 42, of Coventry, were found guilty today by a jury at Birmingham crown court.The jury has yet to return verdicts on four other defendants: Malcolm Bull, 53, of Milton Keynes, and three men from Coventry, Karl Garside, 45, Dean Taylor, 47, and Ian Cameron, 46. All have denied murder and the possession of two guns.Tobin, a mechanic from Mottingham, south-east London, was riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle back from the annual Bulldog Bash festival when he was killed with a single bullet to the back of the head near Warwick services on August 12 2007.Turner and Garside were members of the Outlaws gang, which the prosecution said singled out Tobin because he was a "fully patched" member of the rival Hells Angels.
