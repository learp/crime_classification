Lawyers for a man jailed for attempted sexual assault believe his release is one step closer after the Crown Prosecution Service agreed to examine clothing for crucial DNA evidence that was not provided at his trial 14 years ago.Victor Nealon, a former postman, has consistently denied the attempted assault of a woman leaving a nightclub in Redditch in 1996, for which he was convicted the following January.The CPS has agreed that there is no record of police sending the clothes for examination. Samples of DNA on items of the victim's clothing were shown in independent tests to be from another man. The CPS now intends to carry out its own DNA comparison.The lawyer acting for Nealon, Mark Newby of Jordan's solicitors, said: "We're very happy that they've taken this step, and hope their results match our own and that it will lead to a speedy hearing for Mr Nealon."The Criminal Cases Review Commission appointed a case manager in December to consider referring Nealon's case to the court of appeal. Submissions from Nealon's lawyers also challenge the conviction on the grounds that an identification parade was unsafe, and that Nealon did not have the distinctive facial features described by witnesses.A decision from the CCRC may come as soon as March. Nealon's supporters hope the case will move even more quickly if the CPS forensic tests confirm what they have long maintained: that the true culprit is not the man who has spent almost 15 years behind bars protesting his innocence.
