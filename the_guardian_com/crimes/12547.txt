Existing women's prisons should be closed down and replaced with small secure units as part of a radical 10-year reform programme, an official report recommended today.The study by the Labour peer, Baroness Corston, was commissioned by the Home Office to investigate the way women offenders are treated by the criminal justice system.It was prompted by the self-inflicted deaths of six women at Styal prison in Cheshire between August 2002 and 2003.If adopted by the home secretary, her radical approach would see the 17 women's prisons in England and Wales shut down or converted to male jails.Women offenders would instead be held in small, secure centres where they could be closer to their homes and families.Lady Corston also recommended a significant reduction in the overall number of women who are sent to jail, with a new framework for community punishments as an alternative.Among 43 recommendations, is a call for a ban on routine strip-searching of women in prison, a government "champion" to oversee policy on women offenders and a network of women's community centre for those at risk of offending.There are currently 4,300 women in jail in England and Wales. A study by the Prison Reform Trust found that 40% of female prisoners have attempted suicide at some time.The report was welcomed by criminal justice charities, which have long argued that women would be more effectively diverted from crime through treatment and support.Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, described the report's recommendations as a "once in a generation opportunity".She said: "For women who offend, prison simply doesn't work. It is time to end the use of traditional prisons for women."If the government fails to take radical action it will be held accountable for the deaths and injuries of women in prisons for years to come."A group of 16 charities, including the Fawcett Society, Inquest, Nacro and the Prison Reform Trust, issued a joint statement welcoming the direction of the report.The coalition said: "The Corston Review signals a profound shift in the debate on women's imprisonment away from abstract questions of what to do. The burning questions for the government now are how and when to implement the recommendations."Last year, three women took their own lives in prison, following four in 2005 and 13 in 2004. So far this year, two female prisoners have apparently taken their own lives.Home Office minister Baroness Scotland welcomed the report and described it as a "significant step forward" in the care of women prisoners.
