Two brothers will receive £25,000 in damages against Merseyside police after a jury found that one had his head dunked in a bucket of urine and the other was threatened with a bottle by police.Gary and Ian Doran, from Bootle, were arrested in a police raid on their father's home in September 1997, during which officers dunked Gary's head into a bucket of urine and water, and punched him in the side of the head, the jury found. Mr Doran's brother, Ian, 34, had his hands cuffed and was threatened with a beer bottle, according to charges upheld. Gary was awarded £10,000 and Ian £15,000 by the jury at Liverpool county court. Merseyside police will also have to pay legal costs of up to £100,000. A spokeswoman for Merseyside police said yesterday that the force had never accepted the truth of the charges. "Throughout, Merseyside police vigorously contested these claims but a jury found in favour of some of their claims... We therefore have to accept the decision," a statement said. Other claims by the men and their co-plaintiff Jackie Sargent, who was arrested with them, were rejected by the jury, including an accusation by Gary Doran that he was maliciously prosecuted for affray. He was taken to court in 1998 on charges including possession of cocaine, but he was acquitted. The men then sued police for assault, malicious prosecution and wrongful imprisonment.
