Denis MacShane wants to be "free from fear" in Rotherham. Apparently, his working class constituents live in terror of the "loutish, often violent, sometimes feral behaviour of different groups" and are crying out something along the lines of: "Ay oop our Denis, 'appen as like thee can get us some mooer Asbos, when the boot comes in."Or some such. If only we whinging London civil liberties types who Denis meets at dinner parties would realise this and stop twittering. "Rilly Denis it's just gharstly those frightful little police oiks. You must come out happy-slapping with Torquil and Jemima - it's a blast."I must say that "loutish, even feral" behaviour sounds pretty bad. I grew up in north Wales and there were some pretty rough kids there, but none of them were actually feral. If Rotherham is "feral", then that is surely the sort of thing that would show up in the crime statistics. Let's have a look, shall we?RotherhamKensingtonHampsteadIslingtonAha, much as I thought. Central London (even quite posh London boroughs like Kensington & Chelsea or Barnet) is a much more dangerous place to live than Rotherham. Rotherham is actually a perfectly pleasant northern provincial town, with about the same levels of burglary, robbery and violence against the person as Winchester or Maidenhead. It is a bit rougher than Sevenoaks but that's about it.Either Denis and his dinner party guests are in far more danger than they realise as they step away from the canapes to hail a minicab, or his constituents should stop being such great big wet northern jessies. Or possibly, there are working class people everywhere and MPs for northern constituencies have no special empathic sense of what they think about ID cards than anyone else (including journalists) who troubles to ask them.
