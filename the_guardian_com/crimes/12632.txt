A mother-of-five found guilty of stabbing and battering her husband to death will serve 15 months after a judge heard of the "frightening" abuse she suffered.Rina Begum, 33, attacked her husband Anhar Miah last April with a kitchen knife, rolling pin and hammer leaving with more than 100 injuries, including 70 slash wounds.She was given a four-year sentence after an Old Bailey jury found her guilty of manslaughter by reason of provocation.Begum, of East Ham, east London, will serve half the sentence, minus the 264 days she has spent in custody.Judge Richard Hone told her that under new sentencing guidelines he would pass the shortest jail term that "matched the seriousness of the offence". He said: "I accept that over a number of years the relationship with your husband had been deeply unhappy and indeed from time to time frightening."But he added: "I do not think that he was the wholly bad man that some of the evidence suggested."Michael Worsley QC, prosecuting, told jurors: "It was a frenzied, sustained, ferocious assault."The trial heard that her 37-year-old husband kept Begum and her children in conditions akin to "slum squalor".Begum initially denied knowing anything about the killing but later claimed she was suffering mental and physical abuse at his hands, and feared for her life.Police found the couple's flat littered with dead mice and a repulsive stench.Begum told officers her husband would physically abuse her, swear in front of their children, use pornography and often appear glassy-eyed and intoxicated, apparently on drink or drugs . The judge said there had been a "cumulative period of provocation" punctuated by bursts of violence and "unpleasant verbal threats"."I am wholly satisfied that you did feel degraded and lost self-esteem."The judge added: "It exemplified the degree of loss of control and the build-up of the provocation which led to this explosive violence.""But you must appreciate the harm and damage you have done to your five children and also to the family of Anhar."
