The government cantalk tough all it likes over an immigration tribunal's decision not to deport the killer of the headteacher Philip Lawrence, but it is unlikely to get it reversed.That was the opinion today of human rights and immigration lawyers, who also questioned a call by the Conservative leader, David Cameron, for the Human Rights Act to be repealed in the wake of the ruling and said it had very little to do with the case.The justice secretary, Jack Straw, said the government would "very vigorously" appeal against the decision, by the asylum and immigration tribunal, that Learco Chindamo, who murdered Lawrence in 1995, would not be deported to Italy after he was freed from jail.The human rights lawyer David Enright said this was "pure posturing", adding that the government had minimal chance of success.Rather than the Human Rights Act, he said, Chindamo's appeal had hinged on EU-wide regulations about immigration and deportations incorporated into UK law last year.The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 state that EU nationals who have lived in the UK for 10 years or more continuously - Chindamo moved from Italy aged five - can only be deported on "imperative grounds of public security".This "basically means you have to be an al-Qaida operative or something", Mr Enright argued. "There's no two ways about it," he added. "It's very clear. The Home Office have accepted this in previous cases."The first key test of the regulations took place last year when two EU nationals, named only as MG and VC, appeared before the asylum and immigration tribunal, which was reconsidering the pair's successful appeal against a Home Office decision to deport them.The panel, headed by the tribunal's deputy president, Mark Ockleton, ruled in favour of the duo.Their judgment noted that the definition of "imperative grounds of public security" was "not absolutely clear".However, the Home Office's representative told the hearing he had been instructed that the phrase referred only to "the commission or suspicion of commission of terrorist offences".According to Jawaid Luqmani, of the north London-based solicitors Luqmani Thompson and Partners, who represented MG and VC at the tribunal, the definition could perhaps be stretched further but would be unlikely to cover Chindamo's case."As well as terrorism, it could perhaps mean someone plotting to target one specific section of the community, for example by race, or age, or for example trying to disrupt parliament," he said.However, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, in whose name an appeal over Chindamo's case would be launched, faced "very big obstacles".Chindamo must not only be shown to be likely to commit a very serious crime but the word "imperative" also meant he must be "immediately masterminding" this now.Chindamo - who could be eligible for parole early next year - would also have to be shown to be a greater threat now than he did at the time of the crime, Mr Luqmani said."It would be very unusual for a parole board to release someone they thought posed a greater risk now than when they were jailed," he added."I am sure the secretary of state wants to apply for appeal, and I wouldn't be surprised if she was granted an appeal," he said. "However, I would be very surprised if she won the appeal."
