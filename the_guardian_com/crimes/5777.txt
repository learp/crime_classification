An 85-year-old woman has been stabbed to death by a burglar in her north London home.Anne Mendel, who was deaf, died in her terrace house in Golders Green. Her husband, Leonard, 80, found her body at the foot of the stairs when he returned from a shopping errand. Detectives believe Mrs Mendel, an orthodox Jew who was described by friends and neighbours as a "lovely, sweet woman" and a pillar of the local community, was attacked between 9am and 11.30am on Monday. A police spokesman said she apparently disturbed "the perpetrator or perpetrators. There are no indications or intelligence to suggest that this crime has any racial or religious motivations." Police are analysing local burglaries and examining the modus operandi of known burglars. The Mendels, who have a son in Manchester and a daughter in Israel, had lived in the same street for 20 years and Mrs Mendel worked as volunteer at a local charity shop for almost as long, as well as helping neighbours with shopping and babysitting. Pat Allen, the volunteer co-ordinator at the Michael Sobell community centre, said she was devastated by the murder. "She was a private person, but lovely to work with. Our hearts go out to her family." Rabbi Chaim Pearlman, of the Machzike Hadath Synagogue in Golders Green, of which Mrs Mendel was a member, said she was a deeply religious woman, who had spent her life helping others, from serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service during the second world war to working for a charity in her 80s. "She was born in the East End, close to the original Machzike Hadath Synagogue in Brick Lane, " he said. "She devoted her life to charitable causes, always willing to help others." Mrs Mendel is one of a number of people stabbed in or close to their homes by burglars. Recent victims include the millionaire financier John Monckton in Chelsea and teacher Robert Symons in Chiswick.
