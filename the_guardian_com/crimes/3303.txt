A Paralympic weightlifter from Jordan has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting two 14-year-old girls in Northern Ireland.The powerlifter also pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman during a physiotherapy session while preparing in Northern Ireland for the London Paralympic Games in 2012.Omar Qaradhi changed his plea from not guilty on all three counts at Antrim crown court on Tuesday.The 33-year-old received a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, for the assaults at a training base at the Antrim Forum in the run-up to the Games.In two of the incidents, Qaradhi had touched the girls, both aged 14, after persuading them to have their pictures taken with him. A third incident happened during a physio session when he touched a therapist.A doctor for the Jordanian Paralympic team told defence lawyers that Qaradhi had been born into poverty with a terrible disability. He had moved around at home with his hands and had to leave school at a young age to earn money after his father died, the doctor said.The court was told Qaradhi was at the top of his sport and would have almost certainly won a gold medal in the London games.The Jordanian Paralympic Committee removed him from the team following his arrest.A defence lawyer said "a lifetime of achievement had been put at naught" because of what happened in Antrim. He said his client offered a "complete and unqualified" apology to the victims for the indignity, distress and hurt he had caused them.
