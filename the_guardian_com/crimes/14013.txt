Anxious parents are buying body armour for their children after the recent spate of highly publicised fatal stabbings in London.An Essex-based firm, which says it might expect a couple of requests a year for children's armoured vests, says it has supplied 50 jackets in recent weeks.Shaun Ward, the sales director of VestGuard UK, said: "Parents are saying 'your Nike trainers are going to have to wait - we're getting you some body armour'. Some of the parents have been almost distraught on the phone."The stabbing two weeks ago of Adam Regis, the nephew of Olympic sprinter John Regis, in east London was the latest in a series of violent incidents.Three days earlier, 16-year-old Kodjo Yenga had been killed while walking with his girlfriend on the other side of the capital in Hammersmith. In February three teenaged boys were shot dead in south London.Mr Ward said most of the vests, capable of stopping a crossbow bolt or knife, have been sold for boys, but parents are also concerned about their daughters being attacked by bullies on the way to and from school, he said. More expensive vests can stop a bullet.Prices of this form of protection range from £300 to £500 and the body armour, manufactured in Bolton, is being bought increasingly by local councils for their housing and environmental health officials.
