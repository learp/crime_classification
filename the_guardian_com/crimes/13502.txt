The death of a policeman who was stabbed in Birmingham last week has prompted debate on whether all officers should wear body armour.Detective Constable Michael Swindells, 44, was attacked on a towpath on Friday after confronting a man wielding a machete. He had gone to the aid of his colleagues who had requested back-up. He was unarmed and not wearing any protective clothing. Yesterday, as senior officers paid tribute to the father-of-one, West Midlands police force confirmed it was to review its policy on protective vests. They are standard issue among frontline officers but the latest death is expected to increase pressure for officers across the country - including plainclothed detectives - to be given similar protection. Colleagues have described DC Swindells (left) as a warm, charismatic man who "worked hard to make a difference". Yesterday church leaders in Birmingham said there would be a mass on Wednesday to remember the fallen officer. The Archbishop of Birmingham, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, said: "We deeply appreciate the service offered by the police in the community but never more than at a time like this. "I offer my prayers and condolences to the family and colleagues of Michael Swindells." DC Swindells' wife, Carol, and daughter Kelly, 19, were said to be going through a "terrible time". A 48-year-old man was due to appear before Birmingham magistrates today charged with murder.
