Police investigating an incident in which a 14-year-old schoolgirl said she was abducted and raped have now said she was not snatched off the street.The girl told investigators that two men made her get into a car as she was walking along the road in Summertown, Oxford, on 28 September. She said she was raped in the car. On Friday, Thames Valley police said: “The evidence gathered indicates that the reported abduction did not take place.” Officers were still investigating the rape claim and were “following all lines of inquiry to establish what has taken place”, the spokesman said.“Specially trained officers and staff from the police, Oxfordshire county council children’s services, health and other agencies continue to work with the victim, at her pace.” The girl was found at midday knocking on doors in the Marston area of the city. At the time, police said the girl was extremely traumatised by her ordeal and was unable to provide a description of her attackers, other than they were white men whom she did not know.On Friday, officers said they had carried out a “thorough review”, including sifting through CCTV and dashcam footage, and gathering witness statements, and had concluded that there was no abduction. Supt Joe Kidman, the local police commander for Oxford city, said the incident had caused “a great deal of community concern” but that such reports were rare. “In the weeks after the incident higher-visibility patrols were in place to provide reassurance and gather information,” he said. “We have worked with schools in the area on their security plans and are ready to respond to concerns raised. “Working with vulnerable and young victims is an extremely complex and lengthy process, and it is paramount that they are protected appropriately.”
