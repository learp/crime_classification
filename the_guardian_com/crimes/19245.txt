A man has been left in a critical condition after being stabbed through the heart in what police believe was a fight that got out of hand.The 21-year-old victim was stabbed multiple times in a pub carpark in Dudley in the early hours of Sunday, West Midlands police said.Two men, aged 21 and 23, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and were helping officers with their inquiries.Police were called at about 4.15am after the victim's friends took him to hospital following the attack outside the Earl of Dudley Arms pub in Wellington Road.He underwent surgery but remained in a critical condition in hospital, according to detectives.Officers have asked for help from the public and have also issued a direct appeal to any other party involved in the fight to come forward.DI Warren Hines of West Midlands police said: "A young man is in very serious condition in hospital. He has undergone surgery for multiple wounds, including one to his heart."I need to understand what happened this morning and speak to anyone who may be able to help."At this stage, we're working on the theory that this was a fight which got out of hand as opposed to a random attack on a stranger."If this is the case, it is vitally important that the other person or people involved call me immediately so that they can put their side of the story to me."If they don't come forward now, they can expect a visit from my team to their home or workplace in the very near future."Anyone with information is urged to call police on 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
