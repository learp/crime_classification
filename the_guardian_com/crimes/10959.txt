The Home Office does not know what impact its £1.2bn-a-year programme to tackle problem drug use is having, a report by a cross-party group of MPs discloses today.The Commons public accounts committee says it is unacceptable that the Home Office has failed to properly evaluate its programme to tackle the 330,000 problem drug users in England and does not know whether the strategy is cutting the cost of drug-related crime.The MPs say that the number of problem drug users, mainly chronic heroin or cocaine users, is estimated on 2003-04 figures to cost society £15bn a year – mainly as a result of their criminal activities.The committee reports that a quarter of all problem drug users are hardcore offenders for whom drug treatment has proved ineffective. In many cases their criminal activity actually increased after going into treatment."Given the amount of public money that is being spent, it is unacceptable that the Home Office does not know what overall effect this spending is having. It does not carry out enough evaluation of its work and does not know if its drug strategy is directly reducing the overall cost of drug-related crimes," said Edward Leigh, the chair of the committee.He said it was of particular concern that measures to cut problem drug use by young people were having limited effect.The report, which is based on an investigation by the National Audit Office, says that all drug users receiving treatment need motivation to stay off drugs when back in their local communities, with some problem drug users who have been through prison treatment programmes quickly relapsing on release.New schemes to ensure that prisoners are met on release at the prison gates and escorted to community services and ongoing treatment may be important to prevent their relapse.The MPs' report also suggests that residential rehabilitation may be effective for those who have failed to "go clean" in other forms of treatment.Sir David Normington, the Home Office's permanent secretary, told the committee's inquiry that his department had evaluated the main areas of spending on problem drug use but accepted that it had not done an overall evaluation.Giving evidence, he said: "We evaluated, for example, for instance, the huge spending that there has been on treatment and there is a very good return on investment for every pound. We estimate – and this is well validated – a £2.50 return for every pound spent on treatment in terms of benefit in cutting crime and other harms."Normington added that the other large element of spending – on drug intervention programmes that ensure problem drug users are referred to an assessment for treatment on arrest – was also showing very good returns. "Although we have not evaluated the whole programme and we accept that, we have evaluated the main areas of spending," he said.
