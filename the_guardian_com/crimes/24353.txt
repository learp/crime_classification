A ringleader of what Scotland Yard has called the biggest people smuggling network it has ever encountered was jailed for eight and a half years today.Turkish national Ramazan Zorlu, 43, was sentenced at Croydon crown court after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to his role in the highly lucrative ring.Reports have claimed that the network was responsible for bringing thousands of illegal immigrants into the UK and police estimated the gang had made around £5m.Nine other people have been arrested in connection with the investigation and have also admitted smuggling offences.Zorlu ran the smuggling enterprise with two other Turkish nationals, Ali Riza Gun and Hassan Eroglu, both 47. Gun was due to be sentenced today but will now be sentenced at a later date while Eroglu was jailed for six years at an earlier hearing.Sentencing Zorlu today, Judge Nicholas Ainley said: "I find it hard to conceive of a more serious case of this type of offence coming before the courts."The racket was smashed by police in a series of raids in October last year which marked the culmination of Operation Bluesky, Scotland Yard's largest investigation of people smuggling. It was coordinated by the Metropolitan police and involved law enforcement agencies in 21 other countries.Outside court after today's sentencing, a police spokeswoman said that the people smugglers had believed incorrectly that they were "untouchable by the law".She said the gang used 37 mobile phones to try to evade detection. Asylum seekers were charged up to £14,000 each to be smuggled into the UK.The spokeswoman said the people who were smuggled, sometimes in secret lorry compartments, were put in dangerous conditions, sometimes spending days hidden without food.Law enforcement officials from France, Italy, Holland, Belgium and Denmark, and Europol all contributed to the investigation. The raids were carried out at houses and business premises across London in Enfield, Bexleyheath, Barnet, Haringey, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Hammersmith.
