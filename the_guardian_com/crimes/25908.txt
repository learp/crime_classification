Scotland Yard is investigating claims that an aide to the mayor of Moscow assaulted a protester during a civic reception at London's City Hall, it emerged yesterday.Detectives are examining footage of a confrontation between Sergi Tsoi, press secretary of Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, and gay activist and journalist Nikolai Alekseev, who unfurled a protest banner after Mr Luzhkov joined Ken Livingstone and counterparts from Paris, Berlin and Beijing, on the podium. The fracas, which was broken up by a security guard, occurred as Mr Luzhkov answered questions. It was broadcast to millions of viewers on Russian television.Mr Luzhkov has become a target for protesters worldwide after banning the Moscow Gay Pride event and describing the march as "a satanist happening".Scotland Yard said no arrests had been made but inquiries were continuing.Footage on Russian TV channel NTV's website shows a brief struggle between the two men disrupting the prestigious ceremony in the capital. As the mayors field questions and swap quips, Mr Alekseev pulls out a rainbow-coloured flag and drapes it across his chest. An enraged Mr Tsoi rushes across to wrestle it from him.Speaking from Moscow, Mr Alekseev told the Outrage website: "In Russia, people of such high standing get away with such incidents, but in Britain there is a slightly different perception of law ... Mr Tsoi appears to have committed a crime, he should be held responsible for his actions. [He] has used homophobic statements before. This time he has resorted to physical force."The gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, outside City Hall at the time, said: "Mayor Luzhkov may be able to muzzle free speech and the right to protest in Moscow, but he cannot get away with such tactics in London ... I hope the London police will press charges."A spokesman for the Russian embassy in London would not comment.
