Dog owners whose pets are involved in a fatal attack will face up to 14 years in jail under plans announced by the government.The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said the government also proposes raising the penalty for the owner of a dog which causes injury to five years.In a written ministerial statement, he said there would be a maximum three-year sentence if a guide dog is killed or injured by a dangerous dog.Paterson said the new sentences would be line with the penalties imposed on motorists whose dangerous driving leads to someone being killed.But householders or business owners whose pets attack burglars will not be covered by the new sentences.The changes will be introduced to the antisocial behaviour, crime and policing bill when it reaches the committee stage in the House of Lords. The new sentences should come into force next year if the bill is passed.Paterson said: "The maximum penalty of causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment and the maximum penalty for causing actual bodily harm is five years' imprisonment."The government proposes, therefore, to increase the maximum penalties for aggravated offences under Section 3 of the 1991 [Dangerous Dogs] Act in England and Wales to 14 years' imprisonment if a person dies as a result of a dog attack, five years' imprisonment if a person is injured by a dog attack, and three years' imprisonment if an assistance dog either dies or is injured by a dog attack."Paterson said the changes were being introduced after an online consultation. He told MPs that 91% of the 3,180 responses wanted the maximum sentences increased.
