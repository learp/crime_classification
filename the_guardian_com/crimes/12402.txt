Child welfare campaigners are set to demand that the attorney general doubles the minimum jail term two young brothers will have to serve for beating and torturing another pair of boys to 10 years.The brothers, now aged 11 and 12, were given an indefinite custodial sentence yesterday by a judge who said they must spend five years in detention before they are considered for release.The founder of the charity Kidscape, Michelle Elliott, said today the sentence should be increased for the sake of the victims, then aged nine and 11, who suffered a "prolonged, sadistic" attack in April last year in which they were beaten, stamped on, choked, burned and forced to sexually abuse one another.The call from Elliott, a psychologist, came after South Yorkshire Police confirmed they would consider criminal action against the attackers' parents.Elliott said: "I'm grateful for the indeterminate sentence but I would have urged a 10-year minimum before they are assessed for release."I will be appealing to Baroness Scotland [the attorney general]. Several groups are doing that."Elliott accepted that the brothers would not necessarily be released after five years, but believed the possibility of them being let out while still only in their mid-teens was too worrying for their victims."I think, for them and their families, they need to have a clear 10 years," she said. "They would then all be in their 20s."Elliott thought the prognosis for the recovery of the two victims was good but believed the brothers could pose a risk to society for many years.She said the pair would be "better off" now they were in an environment away from the "feckless parents" who "dragged them up". "They've got security now that they've never known," Elliott said.Another prominent campaigner against child abuse, Shy Keenan, said she was also urging the attorney general to look at the sentence.The Phoenix Survivors founder told the Sun: "We have appealed [against] the five-year minimum tariff on this sentence to the attorney general on the grounds that it is unduly lenient."We do hope that the authorities involved will now pursue the offenders' parents for their neglect and abuse in this awful case."Detectives will study evidence of the boys' "toxic home life", which could lead to charges of child abuse or neglect against their parents."It's something we will be looking at with partners in the light of what has come out in court," temporary superindendent Ian Bint said outside Sheffield crown court yesterday.The court heard how the brothers' upbringing was marked by "routine aggression, violence and chaos", regularly watching their father punch and kick their mother, sometimes while drunk but often when sober, driven by a jealousy which saw him forbid her from even talking to other men. The brothers learned not to intervene, the court was told; doing so meant either their mother was hit harder, they were struck, or both.The mother, meanwhile, treated the boys as adult confidants, pouring out her "intimate" secrets to them, the court heard.Once she threatened to leave home, prompting the father to promise he would track her down and slice her face "to bits" with a knife.Left unsupervised, the boys smoked cigarettes and their father's home-grown cannabis and drank spirits. They watched pornographic and violent films, identified in court as a possible inspiration for the sexual element of their attack.The judge, Mr Justice Keith, told the boys: "You never had any guidance at home about the way you should behave. You come from a dysfunctional family where the environment has been described as 'toxic' and the adults were hardly role models."One of the victims' fathers told the Daily Mirror: "I blame their parents. They should get done for it as well."The mother is believed to now be living in a caravan on the Lincolnshire coast. Friends of the father say he remains in Doncaster but keeps a low profile.A revealing insight into the brothers' domestic life came shortly before Christmas as the house was gutted by a team of workers before the arrival of new tenants."It was in a hell of a state when we started work. Just look at this," said one of the workers, pointing at an interior door. "It's just black with grime, with grease. We've just stripped out the bathroom. It was in a real mess before we took it out, just filthy. There was a real stink."The children's secretary, Ed Balls, said the brothers had been deeply damaged by years of abuse."What we've now got to do is make sure that in custody they get the support to try to turn things round for them and we also learn lessons in Doncaster so that in future we don't have a repeat of such a terrible, unusual and horrific case."
