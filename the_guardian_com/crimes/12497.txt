One of the men originally accused of planning the July 21 terror attacks in London was yesterday jailed after admitting a lesser offence. Adel Yahya was sentenced to six years, nine months - minus 546 days already served - after admitting collecting information likely to be useful to terrorists.The judge sitting at the high court in London said he would only serve half his sentence, meaning Yahya will be freed after 22Â½ months.Yahya, 25, from Tottenham, north London, had originally faced a retrial at Kingston crown court next week on charges of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions. These charges have been withdrawn by the prosecution and not guilty verdicts entered.Four other men were jailed for life at Woolwich crown court, south-east London, in July over the failed 2005 attacks. Muktar Said Ibrahim, Yassin Omar, Ramzi Mohammed and Hussain Osman were told they will all serve a minimum of 40 years in prison. The attacks took place on three Underground trains and a bus.Nigel Sweeney QC, prosecuting, said Yahya had pleaded guilty to a charge of collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing an act of terrorism, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.He said Yahya collected information about the purchase of liquid hydrogen peroxide which he knew his former co-defendants were planning to use to produce terrorist explosive devices.Yahya is originally from Yemen and Ethiopia and has been a UK citizen since 2003.Mr Sweeney said Yahya had known Omar since schooldays in London, and it was through Omar that he met the other former co-defendants.
