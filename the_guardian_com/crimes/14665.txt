Guidance must be issued to the courts to jail offenders for shorter periods and to use imprisonment less often to cut Britain's record prison population, according to an independent report published today.The study, based on interviews with 133 judges and magistrates, warns that the government's plans to provide a wider range of tougher and more demanding community penalties will not be used as an alternative to prison. The prison population in England and Wales rose by a further 150 last week to a record level of 73,627 and is projected to go even higher. The report which is endorsed by the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, and the Magistrates' Association, said that the rise in the prison population was not the result of more people being convicted or held on remand. Instead, courts were getting tougher and sending people down who would have been given community penalties and they were being sent to prison for longer sentences. The study, The Decision To Imprison, for the Prison Reform Trust and the Rethinking Crime and Punishment initiative, said that the rise in the prison population was partly due to the fact that people convicted of petty offences such as theft and handling stolen goods were now three times more likely to go to prison than in 1991.
