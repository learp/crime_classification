The modus operandi has become familiar to police. A gang dresses up in high-visibility jackets, sets up a line of cones and begins ripping out underground cables.Following a credit crunch dip last year, the price of copper has been on the rise again – the London Metal Exchange was quoting £4,950 a tonne yesterday – and so criminals are stealing as much copper telephone cable as they can carry away. Recently, a gang hauled out 200m of cable from beneath a road in Ewell in Surrey. They were loading it into a van when they were spotted by the police and scarpered.Millions of miles of copper cable lies beneath streets and alongside railway lines, where interfering with signal cables can put passengers at risk. "We just can't keep an eye on it all," said one police officer.Often thieves get it wrong. In Oxford earlier this month a gang sectioned off a bus lane and set about cutting out a 150m-long piece of copper cable. Unfortunately for them, they slashed the wrong wire and couldn't get it out, but still caused huge inconvenience to almost 3,000 homes and businesses.So next time your internet connection goes down or the train is late, it may not be the fault of your internet service provider or the train company. It could be down to those copper cable crooks.
