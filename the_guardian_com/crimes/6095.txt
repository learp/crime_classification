Two former soldiers who firebombed a mosque after the murder of Lee Rigby have each been jailed for six years. Stuart Harness, 33, and Gavin Humphries, 37, made petrol bombs and threw them at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre while being filmed on CCTV cameras they thought were turned off.They were jailed on Friday by Judge Mark Bury at Hull crown court after admitting to the charge of arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered, at an earlier hearing. Bury told the pair: "This was a crime of violence where a particular religious group was deliberately targeted in an act of retribution."He said: "This kind of attack cannot be tolerated. A severe sentence is required to punish but, more importantly, to deter."He also jailed a third defendant, Daniel Cressey – who denied aiding and abetting the other two but was found guilty by a jury – for six years.Bury said: "Whatever your feelings of outrage were, you should have allowed justice to take its course."Instead you carried out a retaliatory act of throwing petrol bombs at the Grimsby Islamic Cultural Centre."As is usual in these cases, the victims had nothing to do with the events that so enraged you."They were entirely innocent law-abiding Muslims who were practising their religion in a peaceable way."Bury heard how Harness and Humphries launched two petrol bombs each at the mosque in Weelsby Road, in Grimsby on 26 May – four days after Fusilier Rigby was murdered. They were spotted by patrolling police community support officers and followed back to Harness's house nearby, where they were arrested.Detectives found the pair had earlier inadvertently filmed themselves on a CCTV system at Harness's home, bringing petrol into the house, building the bombs and leaving with them .Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, said the defendants thought they had turned the system off when they switched off the laptop it was connected to.The CCTV footage, excerpts of which were played to Hull crown court, showed the whole process of making the bombs until they left in Cressey's car.Evans said the bombs exploded outside the main doors of the mosque.He said it was "lucky" that the people remaining in the building were just on the other side of the doors and realised quickly what was happening.They put out the flames despite being scared and there were no injuries and minimal damage.The judge heard how both Harness and Humphries had served in the army with unblemished records.Evans told the court how Harness had been in the army for 13 years and experienced "active warfare" during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.He said Harness had been based at Woolwich barracks, telling the judge the former soldier lived there with his family and his children went to local schools.Richard Hackfath, defending Humphries, said his client had also served in the army with distinction, most notably as a close protection officer for senior officers.Evans told the court the pair threw the devices as if they were lobbing grenades, as they would have been trained to do.Harness and Humphries admitted arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered, and Cressey, of New Holland, north Lincolnshire, was found guilty of aiding and abetting that crime at a trial last month.Cressey drove the other two men to the mosque but did not throw any of the bombs, the judge heard.The judge said the offences were all religiously aggravated.Hackfath said his client was a "thoughtful, moral and caring man" who acted completely out of character on 26 May when he and the other defendants had been drinking.He said Humphries, who served with the Royal Artillery, was not a racist and the judge noted that he had worked in Qatar, teaching English to Muslim children.Bury said he was very impressed with a letter of apology Humphries had written.Charlotte Baines, for Harness, said her client apologied for his "foolish, absurd and reckless behaviour" and said he was "ashamed and disgusted" by what he had done.She said Harness was "struggling to understand how his personal feeling about that situation in London (the murder of Fusilier Rigby) transformed into him taking direct action in the way he did".
