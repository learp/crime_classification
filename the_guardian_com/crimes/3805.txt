The European Union yesterday offered some welcome relief for the home secretary, John Reid, by agreeing to allow Europeans imprisoned abroad to be sent to their home country to serve their sentence.The deal, agreed by EU justice and home affairs ministers, means that for the first time nations will be able to transfer convicted criminals without their consent.Mr Reid hailed the outcome as an excellent result for Britain. The prison population in England and Wales has risen past 80,000 and persistent overcrowding has led to hundreds of prisoners being held in police and court cells.There are now 840 UK nationals held in other EU prisons but 2,432 EU nationals held in English and Welsh prisons, which means yesterday's agreement would theoretically free up almost 1,600 places. It takes full effect in three years' time.Mr Reid, who is due to deliver a speech on overcrowding today, said the deal would improve prisoner transfer arrangements, which are conducted by the Council of Europe, the human rights body.He said it would "considerably speed up the process by putting in place time limits of no more than three months for consideration of transfer requests rather than the existing arrangements which can take up to two years".A deal had been held up by Poland, which has 278 nationals serving sentences in English and Welsh prisons and was worried about the cost and impact on its own overcrowded prisons, but ministers agreed to allow the country to delay implementation of the rules for five years. About a third of foreign nationals in German prisons are Poles.Brigitte Zypries, the German justice minister who co-chaired the meeting, said the decision would aid social rehabilitation as offenders would be closer to family and friends. "If the offender is already in his home country, the foreign judgment is sent to that country for the purpose of enforcement," she said. "The consent of the home country to the transfer of the offender or transmission of the judgment for the purpose of enforcement is not required."Under Council of Europe rules the two countries concerned must come to an agreement in each individual case and the convict must consent - unless there is an expulsion or deportation order.Ministers meanwhile moved closer to agreeing pan-European rules for imposing prison sentences for incitement of Holocaust denial, incitement to hate and racist violence - a measure to impose minimum jail terms still opposed by Britain.Ms Zypries said she hoped for an agreement by June when the German presidency ran out, saying all 27 countries "felt that the continent of Europe must give a clear message that we will not tolerate racism and xenophobia". Britain, which is pushing for a traditional opt-out from pan-EU rules, says the proposals so far could infringe the right to freedom of expression.
