A burglar who preyed on pensioners was jailed for seven years and effectively barred from every home in the country, under an unprecedented antisocial behaviour order which will begin on his release.John Cash was told by Judge Barrington Black that prison was not enough for his "despicable" life of crime, which made him more than Â£70,000 in cash, jewellery and other valuables in a year. Cash, 32, a heroin addict of Stanmore, north-west London, admitted four burglaries and asked for 258 offences to be taken into consideration. Harrow crown court heard he had left hundreds devastated by his raids after sweet-talking his victims - aged between 80 and 96 - into letting him into their homes. He went from door to door in a street. One couple died within weeks of him stealing a few pounds. Judge Black ordered that for five years after his release Cash would not be allowed to "call at any residential premises" in the country, whether "by way of doorbell, knocking or telephone call" without permission. Nina Crinnion, prosecuting, said Cash would pose as a police officer or a milkman. Sometimes he would claim his victim had "won a prize in a raffle". He would strike as soon as the householder was distracted but some of his victims were so poor there was nothing worth stealing. He was tracked down from fingerprints.
