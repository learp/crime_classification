A nurse and a chef have been arrested on suspicion of murdering five elderly residents of a care home, Avon and Somerset police said today.Husband and wife Leigh and Rachel Baker were initially questioned after the death of 97-year-old Lucy Cox in January at the 16-bed private Parkfields home, in the village of Butleigh, near Glastonbury in Somerset.During the investigation, detectives also had the remains of three other former residents exhumed for toxicology tests to establish whether they had been poisoned.Answering bail this morning, the Bakers were arrested on suspicion of the murder of four women and one man, and other charges.A police spokesman said: "A 45-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man have this morning attended Yeovil police station."Both have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of four women and one man, theft and unlawful possession of controlled prescribed drugs and attempting to pervert the course of justice."Both arrests relate to ongoing inquiries into deaths at the former Parkfields residential care home in Butleigh. Both the man and the woman remain in custody at Yeovil."Rachel Baker, a registered nurse, was arrested on suspicion of administering a noxious substance on January 5, four days after the death of Cox. She had run the home for 19 years until resigning later that month.Her husband was arrested on January 7 on suspicion of being involved in the same offence and was also questioned by officers. Both were released on bail.The investigation into the care home deaths marked the first time that Avon and Somerset police had exhumed bodies.The remains of Nellie "Mary" Pickford, 89, were removed from Glastonbury cemetery on June 5. Marion Alder, 79, a grandmother of four, was exhumed from the graveyard of St Leonard's church, Butleigh, a week later.And the remains of Fred Green, 81, were removed from a graveyard in the village of Kingweston, near Somerton in Somerset, on July 11.Green, a grandfather of 10, died on January 6 last year, while he was a resident at Parkfields residential home in nearby Butleigh.Three other residents, whose deaths were being treated as suspicious by officers, had already been cremated.The Commission for Social Care Inspectorate, which monitors care homes in England, obtained a court order to immediately close Parkfields on March 16 after six weeks of checks revealed "serious concerns" about its standards.
