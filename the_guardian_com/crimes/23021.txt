Jamie Kyne and Jan Wilson were still in their teens when they died in an arson attack in North Yorkshire last September. Despite being at the beginning of their riding careers, both were fulfilling their dreams and showed the potential to make it to the top.Kyne, 18, had quickly become a popular figure in the racing town of Malton, North Yorkshire, after leaving his home city of Galway in the west of Ireland to join trainer Declan Carroll in 2007.Having shown his talent on the track, he joined the stable of John Quinn at the start of 2008 and quickly attracted attention as an exciting prospect.Kyne was lying third in the apprentice jockeys' championship at the time of his death, having already ridden 29 winners during the season. His services were much in demand from many stables.He rode with a strength and confidence belying his age and baby face, and quickly carved out a reputation as a young jockey with a bright future, who would give his all to every ride.Leading rider Paul Hanagan, another well-known figure in Malton, said he believed Kyne had "the world at his feet"."I met Jamie when he moved to Malton and the first thing that struck me was what a well-mannered guy he was," said Hanagan. "Some young lads that come into the weighing-room ride a winner and they think they know it all. Jamie was never like that."His riding was improving all the time and I've no doubt that he could have gone to the top."Saturday's meeting at York will be a poignant anniversary for it was here 12 months ago that Ishetoo produced a whirlwind finish to gain a narrow verdict in the £40,000 feature race and give Kyne his biggest success.Forfar-born Jan Wilson, 19, had also achieved her lifetime ambition and experienced success in the saddle, riding Imperial Sword, a horse owned by her parents, to victory on three occasions.David Barron, for whom Wilson worked as an apprentice, said at the time: "She was very good, very capable and had tremendous potential. Everyone in the yard is just devastated."Few make the grade as jockeys, and most young apprentices hang up their saddles without ever having experienced the thrill of success. In their short careers, Kyne and Wilson had already achieved far more than many of their peers.Wilson's father, Drew, said: "Jan set her heart on becoming a jockey from an early age and wouldn't let anybody put her off that goal."We had suggested she got herself a proper job and that we would buy her a horse so that she could continue her showjumping, cross-country and other equestrian events."She made the best Yorkshire pudding I have ever seen – and we thought we could steer her into catering or something a little more secure. But nothing could stop her and she did indeed live the dream, if not for long."
