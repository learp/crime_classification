A trauma expert called by the defence in the Damilola Taylor murder trial said yesterday he could not rule out the boy having been stabbed with a broken bottle.Alistair Wilson had told the court he believed 10-year-old Damilola died accidentally after falling on broken glass. But in cross-examination he told the Old Bailey it was impossible to be sure. Mr Wilson, an accident and emergency consultant, said he had not come across a deliberate stabbing in the thigh with a bottle. He had come to his opinion after examining photographs but not Damilola's body, his clothing or the partially reconstructed bottle. Mark Dennis, prosecuting, told him the pathologist Vesna Djurovic believed he was "fundamentally wrong". He replied: "I would disagree in clinical terms." Dr Djurovic, who had said Damilola was wounded in a deliberate stabbing and cutting motion, may be recalled next week before the prosecution begins its closing speech. Two brothers aged 16 deny murdering Damilola, who was found bleeding to death on a stairwell on the North Peckham estate, south London. They also deny manslaughter and assault with intent to rob. Earlier this week, counsel for one of the boys said he would not be giving evidence; yesterday the other boy confirmed he would not either. The judge, Mr Justice Hooper, told the jury it might be sent out to consider verdicts on April 16. The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday. Press Association
