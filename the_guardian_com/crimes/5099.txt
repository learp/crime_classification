Two men have been charged with drug offences after a teenager died from a suspected overdose.Nicqueel Pitrora, 18, from Croydon, and Ryan Kirk, 20, from Beckenham, both south London, are accused of being concerned in the supply of class A drugs. They will appear at Uxbridge magistrates court on Wednesday.The pair and another man, 19, who has been bailed until March, were arrested after Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, died from a suspected drug overdose after going to an illegal rave.It is believed that he fell unconscious after taking ecstasy at the party at an industrial site in Hayes, west London. Paramedics were called at around 4am on Saturday and he was taken to hospital and put on life support. He died on Monday.The following day, his father, Tim, warned: "It could happen to anyone." At the family home in Croydon, he described his son as "a lovely, mercurial kid".Spargo-Mabbs, 50, said: "He was up for adventure. He was a really normal kid. He spent a bunch of his spare time with his girlfriend and played a lot on his Xbox."This was the first time he'd taken anything and if it could happen to him it could happen to anyone. We very much want to get that message across."Spargo-Mabbs added that Daniel's girlfriend, a fellow pupil at Archbishop Tenison's Church of England high school in Croydon, was "traumatised" by his death.His mother, Fiona, said she would always hug and kiss her sons, Daniel and Jacob, before they left the house. She told reporters: "Danny always used to say, 'I love you too Mum, I promise I won't die.' And that's exactly what he said when he went out on Friday."His headteacher, Richard Parrish, described him as "a boy of huge potential", and said the school would pay tribute to him. Daniel, who was in the first year of his A-levels, was "just beginning to find his niche" and was interested in "a whole range" of things, the teacher said.
