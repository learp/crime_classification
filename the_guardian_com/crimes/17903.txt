A senior civil servant is to appear in court after being charged over the loss of top-secret documents on a train, police said today.An investigation was launched in June after the highly sensitive Whitehall intelligence files relating to al-Qaida and Iraq were left on a train from London.Richard Jackson, 37, of Yateley, Hampshire, has been summonsed under the Official Secrets Act to appear at City of Westminster magistrates court on October 20, the Metropolitan police said.A force spokesman said he would answer the following: "That on the 9th day of June 2008 being a crown servant and by virtue of your position as such you had in your possession two documents which it would be an offence under any foregoing provisions of this Act to disclose. "Without lawful authority you failed to take such care to prevent the unauthorised disclosure as a person in your position may reasonably be expected to take in contravention of S8(1) of the Official Secrets Act 1989."The Ministry of Defence confirmed Jackson was one of its employees. It is understood he was on secondment to the Cabinet Office at the time the documents were lost.A member of the public found them inside an orange cardboard envelope on a train from Waterloo station to Surrey, and passed them on to the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner.One of the documents was a seven-page report by the joint intelligence committee entitled "Al-Qaida vulnerabilities", which was understood to look at the state of the Islamist terror network in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan.The second document, commissioned from the committee by the MoD, contained an assessment of Iraq's security forces.
