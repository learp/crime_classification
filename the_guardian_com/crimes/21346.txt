A child protection charity has called for an overhaul of the criminal justice system after a victim who gave evidence in a high-profile child street grooming case said she was unwilling to take part in any future trials.The teenager was left so distraught by her experiences during the recent Old Bailey trial of nine men on street-grooming charges she is no longer prepared to give evidence, it has emerged.The girl, who was raped and sold for sex, was one of several victims who gave evidence that resulted in the conviction of seven of the defendants. During the trial the defence teams alleged that the victims told lies and were unreliable witnesses. There has been speculation that more men could be charged in due course, but the victim has said she will not give evidence. "She is aware of several more offenders but has made it very clear she can't go through that ordeal again," the victim's mother told the Oxford Mail.Alison Worsley, Barnardo's deputy director, said: "It is essential that we take steps to manage the impact of the invasiveness of court proceedings on vulnerable young people."The lord chief justice, Lord Judge, has rejected calls for specialist courts to be set up for street-grooming trials to give greater protection to victims. But Worsley said it was now clear that more needed to be done to reassure victims that they will be protected. "Convictions play a vital role in enshrining confidence in the legal system," Worsley said. "If we are to see more young victims coming forward it is paramount children believe they will be supported to pursue justice for themselves."
