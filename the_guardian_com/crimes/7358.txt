The head of the national criminal intelligence service, John Abbott, is to leave his post in the new year.In his five-year tenure the organisation has more than doubled in size and increased its power. NCIS, which is exempt from freedom of information laws and is responsible to the home secretary, David Blunkett, has the power to bug telephones, intercept emails, and even have people followed by undercover officers. Possible replacements for Mr Abbott include David Bolt, the deputy director-general of the NCIS, Peter Hampson, the chief constable of West Mercia constabulary, and David Venness, assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard. A spokesman for the NCIS would only say yesterday that Mr Abbott was retiring. A former assistant chief constable, he is understood to be standing down early next year. The body was formed in 1992 after a "turf war" on intelligence between MI5 and the police. The NCIS gained control of the national identification bureau, the national drugs intelligence unit, national football intelligence unit, the animal rights index and the police national computer. It also took hold of the arms of Europol and Interpol; Mr Abbott has been vice president of the latter since 1999. NCIS has more than 900 staff, up from 400 in 1992, and a budget of Â£93m - three times more than in 1997 when Mr Abbott took up his post.
