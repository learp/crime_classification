Police have charged 17 people in connection with a multi-million-pound VAT fraud investigation, it emerged last night.It comes after hundreds of customs officers swooped on suspected fraudsters in what they said was their biggest operation to date against gangs suspected of being behind an international fraud ring that attacked Britain's tax system.Those charged were from the Strathclyde area of west Scotland, according to HM Revenue and Customs. "We carried out this operation and detained 22 people, 17 of whom have now been charged," said a spokesman, although he declined to comment further on the identities of those charged or the precise nature of the charges.The arrests were linked to a complicated business deception known as "carousel fraud" that cost the UK up to Â£1.9bn in 2004-2005.In its simplest form it involves obtaining a VAT registration number in the UK to purchase goods free from VAT in another EU state. These are then sold on at a VAT-inclusive price in the UK, but the tax is never passed to the Treasury.A more abusive form of carousel fraud involves passing the same goods between bogus companies many times and stealing the VAT on each occasion.The goods most commonly associated with this fraud are mobile phones and computer chips.
