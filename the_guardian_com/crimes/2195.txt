Judges are to be given the power to override the automatic early release of prisoners after serving half their sentence as part of a shakeup of court sentencing policy to be unveiled by the home secretary, John Reid, this week.Ministers also want to end the convention by which judges "halve the tariff" of a prisoner given a life sentence when they calculate the minimum term to be served. In both cases judges will now be given the power to decide how much of the sentence an offender should serve, based on their likely threat to the public and chances of rehabilitation.The changes, expected to affect only a small number of offenders, follow the outcry over paedophile Craig Sweeney, when a crown court judge made clear that Sweeney would become eligible for parole after five years of his time in prison, despite being given an indefinite "life" sentence. John Reid attacked the length of the minimum term, which included a discount of one third for an early guilty plea.The sentencing changes will form part of the criminal justice bill that Tony Blair intends to make the centrepiece of his last Queen's speech as prime minister in two weeks' time. The legislation is also expected to include proposals to abolish juries in serious fraud trials, an "instant justice" community payback scheme to tackle low-level crime and antisocial behaviour, and tougher penalties for carrying knives. The sentencing changes to be outlined on Wednesday will also include more discretion for judges about the amount of "time off" they give for guilty pleas, and legislation to ensure that parole board decisions are unanimous when they release long-term prisoners.The restoration of discretion to judges about the proportion of the sentence to be served by convicted criminals marks a further step away from reforms introduced by David Blunkett when he was home secretary. Under the 2004 Criminal Justice Act prisoners given time-limited sentences for non-violent or less serious violent offences - those serving one to four years - automatically serve half their sentences in prison and half in the community, supervised by the probation service. In the 2005 criminal justice legislation this was extended to all those given a time-limited or determinate sentence.In the wake of the Sweeney case ministers said they were also reviewing the convention that when judges hand out a life sentence or an indeterminate sentence they must set the first possible release date at the halfway point of the minimum term that they have calculated.A Home Office review published in the summer said that very few offenders on life or other unlimited sentences were actually released at the halfway point, and it was simply the earliest point at which their release could be considered by the parole board.
