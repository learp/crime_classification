A five-year-old girl shot in the chest during a gang attack on a south London shop was left permanently paralysed, the Old Bailey heard on Monday.Thusha Kamaleswaran had been "playing happily" in her uncle's convenience store in Stockwell when the three masked young men chased what they thought was a member of a rival gang into the shop and fired two shots through the open door.Thusha, who had been in the shop with her older brother and younger sister, was hit by a single bullet, which went through her chest.She went into cardiac arrest as she lay bleeding on the floor. Medics performed emergency surgery at the scene before taking her to King's College hospital, where she suffered a second cardiac arrest.Prosecuting, Edward Brown QC said: "She remains paralysed throughout much of her body. This is a permanent condition. She will never walk again."The attack last March also left Roshan Selvakumar, 35, who had been buying groceries in the shop, with serious injuries. He was shot in the face, and the bullet remains lodged in his head.Brown said: "Both victims were remarkably lucky. The intention of the gunman and his accomplices – to kill – was plain …"They very nearly succeeded. Equally plain is that they were acting as a team of three, together."Kazeem Kolawole, 19, Anthony McCalla, 19, and Nathaniel Grant, 21, all of south London, deny causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Thusha and to Selvakumar.All three also deny the attempted murder of one of the two men who ran into the shop, Roshaun Bryan, and having a firearm with intent to endanger life.Prosecutors told the jury at the Old Bailey they would be shown CCTV footage of Thusha dancing and playing in the aisle of the shop moments before the intended victims ran into the store.The jury heard that the three defendants then circled on bicycles outside the store before one of them fired two shots into the shop, the second of which hit Thusha in the chest.Brown said the gun was fired at least twice, and that the alleged gunman – Grant – would have been able to see Thusha when he fired the second shot.He told the court: "At the moment of the second gunshot, she was in an aisle, and in fact must have been in the sight of the gunman and in the sight of perhaps the others ... Circling again and again the first shot was fired by the gunman whilst on the move and the second after the gunman had stopped, steadied and then fired."The jury heard that the attack was the result of an increasingly violent feud between two rival south London gangs – the OC/GAS gang based around Brixton and the ABM gang based in nearby Stockwell."The events of the evening are not isolated," Brown told the jury. "There had been violence between gangs."The GAS gang was involved in an ongoing and violent rivalry with an opposing gang known as ABM. A tit-for-tat escalating in degrees of violence. The three defendants are closely associated with the GAS or OC gang that often congregates in a square in Brixton."He said the defendants had met earlier in the evening and tested the gun by firing it at a tree before donning masks and setting off on their "mission" into the rival gang's territory.Brown said CCTV footage shows one of the defendants imitating the firing of a gun as they left the square in Brixton to carry out the shooting.He said: "They leave together … very likely by that time to be armed with the loaded handgun … within a quarter of an hour Thusha and Roshan Selvakumar had been shot."The three stopped off on the way to the shooting and put on masks before carrying on towards Stockwell, the court heard.The jury was told how witnesses saw the defendants – now masked – riding "very fast" and as if they were "on a mission" as they made their way from Brixton into the rival gang's territory in Stockwell.A few minutes later they arrived at Stockwell Food and Wines store and opened fire."The events of that evening bear all the hallmarks of what on occasion is the result of rivalry between young gangs in south London," said Brown."The tragic reality is that the origin of the events of 29 March 2011 lay not in anything that might have happened, for example earlier that day … but in what had happened in the weeks and months before between rival and young gangs in south London – gang rivalry that often involves needless posturing but on occasion leads to needless but very serious violence."The court heard that Selvakumar, who lived in a flat above the store, had been chatting to shop workers at the time."The reality of this shooting may be that, whilst there was an intention to kill the suspected rival gang member, the gunman and his accomplices couldn't have cared less if someone else was shot too," Brown said.
