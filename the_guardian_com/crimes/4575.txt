A retired teacher who groomed and sexually abused young boys at a private school more than 35 years ago has been jailed for eight years.Christopher Jarvis, 70, pleaded guilty to 14 charges of indecent assault and gross indecency on nine boys aged from 10 to 14 between 1964 and 1976.At Hove crown court, Judge Guy Anthony said Jarvis's victims had been left with "long-lasting, maybe lifelong" problems. Sentencing him on Monday, the judge said: "It shows there were two sides to your character and sadly it's the darker side that brings you here today."Jarvis's victims were pupils at the now-defunct St Peter's preparatory school in Seaford, East Sussex, the former school of the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Jarvis taught at the school between 1962 and the early 1980s, when it closed. He was arrested after one victim came forward for the first time in October last year.Jarvis was held on 5 November and further inquiries resulted in more victims coming forward. He was eventually charged when he answered police bail on 3 June.Detectives said Jarvis, of Eastbourne, used his position of trust to groom young and vulnerable boys who were powerless to prevent him abusing them.DC Hannah Elmer, of Sussex police, said afterwards: "At the time of his offending Jarvis was employed as a teacher at St Peter's school. During his time there he targeted young and vulnerable boys who were powerless to say no to him. He systemically groomed each of his victims, becoming someone who they liked and trusted."He was then able to use this, and his position as a teacher, to his advantage by getting the boys on their own and sexually abusing them."This was a complex and distressing case during which each victim showed great courage in coming forward and reliving events which had occurred many years before."Thanks to their strength we have been able to investigate this to a positive outcome and have provided many others with some form of closure."This investigation shows that all such incidents, no matter how historic, can be investigated and justice served. We have also, equally importantly, been able to offer the victims sources of counselling and support."
