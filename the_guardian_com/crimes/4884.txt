By the time child B was identified as being at risk in 2001, she was 15 years old and was already being raped and trafficked by a much older man. He told her, along with the other children he had groomed, that he loved her. She was convinced that she loved him.Her school got in touch with Risky Business, a youth service set up to support young girls at risk of sexual exploitation, because they feared she had been groomed but her files show that even though a child protection referral was made for her, there is no evidence that any action was taken to help. Her abuser trafficked the girl to Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield – putting her up in a flat and organising for other men to come and have sex with her.Child B's situation deteriorated rapidly – within a few months she and her family were living in fear of their lives. They were bombarded with threats, the windows of their house were put in.At the command of the groomer, child B was beaten up by other victims he had groomed. She was stalked, had petrol poured over her and was threatened with being set alight.Her family was also targeted – an older sibling was hospitalised in a serious attack, while a younger sibling had to go into hiding to escape the abuser's reach. They refused to have anything to do with the police, believing they could do nothing to protect them.Girl B was left completely alone. She tried to end her life on several occasions. She lived in abject fear. By the time she was 18 her relationship with her family had broken down and she was left homeless. As a last resort she referred herself to children's social care where she was given advice about benefits, but no further action was taken.
