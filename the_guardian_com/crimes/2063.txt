Women's groups responded with scepticism to the announcement today of a government review of how rape cases are handled, saying that officials needed to take urgent action on the findings of previous reviews rather than commission new research.The new review will look at how effectively the police, health workers and the Crown Prosecution Service respond to rape allegations, and how well they handle evidence.The government announcement follows a BBC report yesterday that revealed new figures showing that some police authorities are failing to record as many as 45% of rape claims on official crime records, with large numbers of complaints never resulting in a full investigation.Harriet Harman, the minister for women and equality, said: "Convictions for rape have increased 50% since 1997, but with less than 7% of reported rapes leading to a successful prosecution we clearly must do more."The crossbench peer Baroness Stern has been appointed to lead the review, which officials said was fuelled in part by alarm at police failures to stop multiple rapists Kirk Reid and John Worboys, who were both convicted this year. Reid had committed 17 indecent assaults and one rape before he was prosecuted, and Warboys, a London taxi driver, had committed multiple sexual assaults and one rape before he was arrested."Many more women are reporting rapes, but the Reid and Worboys cases show that despite this these men were getting away with it time and time again," Harman said. "So I am concerned that we must have a systematic examination of the way rape complaints are handled: the Stern review will help identify good practice and where those failures are happening so that we can take action."However the announcement was greeted without much enthusiasm by groups which offer support to rape victims."What is different about this review?," a spokeswoman for Rape Crisis asked, adding that there had been similar reviews in 2001, 2005 and 2007."None of the previous research or reviews has resulted in a major shift in how rape is investigated or prosecuted. We are concerned that as we receive the recommendations from this review in 2010 we will be in exactly the same position â€“ with more promises, when what we really need is change."The Fawcett Society welcomed the initiative, but stressed that "words will need to be followed up with action"."It is a national scandal that thousands of rape victims have no access to justice, and frequently face a culture of disbelief, delayed responses which may lead to the loss of vital evidence and a lack of support services," Sharon Smee, a policy officer at the women's rights group, said."The telling fact will be whether the recommendations of the review are followed up with committed and consistent action which results in real cultural change within the criminal justice system."Lisa Longstaff, spokeswoman for Women Against Rape, said: "We have had review after review, research project after research project and still women are not getting the protection of the law when they are raped or suffer domestic violence."
