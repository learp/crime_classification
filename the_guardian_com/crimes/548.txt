The husband of a retired teacher who disappeared 16 months ago was today charged with her murder.Adrian Prout, 46, is accused of killing his wife, Kate, 56, a campaigner on milk payment prices, who vanished from the couple's Â£1.2m Redhill farm in Redmarley D'Abitot, Gloucestershire, on 5 November 2007. Her body has never been found. Police had said in January that Mr Prout, who runs a pheasant shoot, was no longer a suspect.Prout was arrested at the home this morning. He was taken into custody at Cheltenham police station and will appear at the town's magistrates court later today.The head of the Crown Prosecution Service's complex casework unit, Ann Reddrop, said: "We have been working closely with the police over the past months to investigate all aspects of Mrs Prout's disappearance before reaching a final decision on charging."We have also sought advice from leading counsel. Accordingly, we have authorised the police to charge Mr Prout."Acting Detective Superintendent Neil Kelly said: "This has been a complex, thorough and necessarily lengthy investigation to bring us to this point. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those affected, especially Mrs Prout's friends and family, for their understanding, tolerance and patience."The search for Mrs Prout at her farm and in the village failed to uncover her remains.Divers combed waterways and JCBs ploughed through earth. No body was found but police believed that she had been murdered.Mrs Prout was reported missing on 10 November 2007, but had not been seen since 5 November.At the height of the police investigation there were more than 100 officers involved in both the search for Mrs Prout and in following up leads.Mrs Prout's brother, Richard Wakefield, 57, spoke at an earlier press conference of the family's agony at not knowing what had happened."Discovering the truth, whatever that may be, will put us out of this agony of not knowing," he said.Mrs Prout spent 20 years as a primary school teacher before taking early retirement. At the time of her disappearance she was involved in a campaign to persuade the government to increase milk payments to dairy farmers.
