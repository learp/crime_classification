Police have found no signs of a forced entry into the building that houses the Hatton Garden safety deposit vault, increasing speculation that the thieves who made away with precious jewels and gold during an Easter weekend raid had inside knowledge.  The Metropolitan police’s flying squad said the thieves disabled the communal lift on the second floor and used the lift shaft to climb into the basement, before drilling into the vault walls with heavy-duty tools.  DCI Paul Johnson said police were called on Tuesday at 8.10am. “[The thieves] forced open shutter doors into the basement where Hatton Garden Safe Deposit is, then made their way to the vault where they used a Hilti DD350 drill to bore holes into the vault wall. The wall is two metres thick and made of reinforced concrete.”  DCI Johnson described what officers found: “The scene is chaotic. The vault is covered in dust and debris and the floor is strewn with discarded safety deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars.”  Johnson refused to elaborate on claims that the building’s alarm had been activated on Friday, and would not confirm or deny the claim that police had been called to the building, saying it would form part of the investigation.
