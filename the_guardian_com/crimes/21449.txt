A military historian who faked an illustrious army career has been found guilty of perverting the course of justice.John Livesey, known as Jack, told friends and colleagues he had served with distinction in the Parachute Regiment and had been awarded a medal for gallantry.The 57-year-old, who worked at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, won the admiration of genuine veterans.He claimed to have seen action in the Falklands war and carried out six tours of Northern Ireland, when his army career had in fact amounted to a stint in the Catering Corps between 1971 and 1974.The truth began to unfold when Livesey was convicted of a £30,000 benefit fraud in 2004. Investigations following the conviction found that references submitted by senior military veterans were based on false claims he had made.Major Gordon Corrigan, who served in the Royal Gurkha Rifles and was made an MBE in 1995, was one of those who provided references.Giving evidence at Peterborough crown court, he said he "felt a fool" to have misled the court but that it "was not deliberate".During his trial Livesey admitted making up his army career but denied perverting the course of justice. He claimed he did not remember the references being submitted in court, and said he had constructed a "fantasy world" to compensate for his early discharge from the army on medical grounds.His partner, Bridget Pollard, gave evidence, saying she had compiled the references and at the time had been taken in by Livesey's claims.She told the court she stood by him. "We just want this trial over so that we can get on with our lives – whatever happens, we will be able to get on with our lives."The jury found Livesey guilty after three hours of deliberation. Adjourning sentencing until 26 August, the judge, Nic Madge, said misleading the courts was a serious offence.Livesey was released on bail.
