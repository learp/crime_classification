After leaving Oldham the smartly dressed couple called at more banks on the eight mile stretch of main road to Manchester.A Manchester police spokesman said that his force was satisfied that it knew the identity of the couple, but was still unsure whether they were connected with the mail train robbery.Darlington (County Durham) police are making inquiries into the case of a man in a Darlington night club who was offering £5 notes for sale at £3 each.
