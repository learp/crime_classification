A former gangland boss who frittered away tens of thousands of pounds on Royal Opera House tickets and private health treatments was ordered to pay back £650,000 of his criminal earnings, after a high court judge rejected pleas of poverty.Terry Adams, described in court as the former leader of one of the most notorious crime gangs in the UK claimed that he and his wife were scraping by on £200 a week. He told Mrs Justice Nicola Davies he got by on £23,000 a year and felt "like a ponce" living off his wife, Ruth, who is an actor.However, the judge threw out his case after hearing evidence of the Adams' lifestyle – including several visits to the opera, spa memberships and expensive dental treatments.Far from struggling to pay the rent as Adams claimed, the court heard that the couple's "identifiable" spending was £97,000 a year – nearly four times the national average.The pair spent £15,000 on flights, hotels and entertainment between August 2009 and September 2013, including a massage at The Dorcherster hotel, a visit to The Ivy restaurant and 13 meals at Browns restaurant in Mayfair.Ruth Adams, who recently appeared in Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East in London, spent £12,044 on dental treatment and £2,500 on special diet food over three months in 2013, the court heard.In June 2010, she bought her former gangster husband a spa membership at a north London country club for £3,850 as a birthday present when he was released from prison. Another £5,351 was frittered away on parking charges and fines.Striking out Adams' plea of poverty, judge Mrs Justice Nicola Davies said she was "not satisfied that Terry Adams has provided full and frank disclosure to the court" of the assets "which fund his life and that of his wife". The high court decision means Adams faces a legal bill of £5m, including £4.6m in publicly funded defence fees dating back to his conviction in 2007 for plotting to conceal the proceeds of criminal conduct over a six-year period.During the high court hearing, Adams' barrister, Ivan Krolick, said his client had lived his life in a "goldfish bowl" with every aspect pored over by the authorities. Krolick said that Adams was "bitter" that MI5 had bugged his house for 22 months, recording the most intimate moments of his private life.Nick Price, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's proceeds of crime unit, said: "Through a series of nefarious means, Terry Adams has consistently sought to hide the proceeds of his crimes. However, today's judgment is proof of our determination to see that crime doesn't pay and that those who seek to hide their wealth will be challenged and held to account."Mr Adams argued that he couldn't afford to pay what he owed and yet his lavish lifestyle showed this was not the case."
