Tony Blair today backed the home secretary, John Reid, in the deepening row over the sentencing of offenders.Mr Blair's comments came after the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, rebuffed Mr Reid's criticism of "unduly lenient" sentencing.The row broke out when the home secretary intervened in the case of Craig Sweeney, a 24-year-old convicted paedophile who kidnapped and sexually assaulted a three-year-old in January, days after his licence for release from prison expired.Sweeney was jailed for life by the Cardiff recorder, Judge John Griffith Williams QC, yesterday, but was told he could be considered for parole after just over five years in prison.The decision prompted Mr Reid to write to the attorney general's office, urging that the sentence should be appealed."The home secretary is concerned that the tariff Craig Sweeney has been given does not reflect the seriousness of this crime, and is writing to the attorney general to ask him to consider referring the sentence to the court of appeal as unduly lenient," a home office spokesman said.The swift action ruffled feathers in Whitehall, because the attorney general is responsible for sentencing issues and Mr Reid's action risks being seen as political interference in judicial matters.Since being appointed as the home secretary last month, Mr Reid has cultivated a tough on crime image and has promised to rebalance the justice system in favour of victims' rights.The prime minister's spokesman said the decision to write to the attorney general was justified."Where there appears to be a disconnect between the public's common sense view of right and wrong and how it sees that reflected in judicial decisions, then it is right and proper for the home secretary to articulate that concern," he said."That's why he asked the attorney general to consider - I stress consider - this case."The prime minister's view is we do need to right the balance more in favour of the victim. But there is not one single thing you can do - it is a variety of measures you can take."The Guardian today reported that Lord Goldsmith's office had been irritated by the pressure implicit in Mr Reid's action.The office issued a statement saying that the matter would be considered "purely on the merits of the case and not in response to political or public pressure"."He will only refer a sentence to the court of appeal if he believes that it falls significantly below what any judge could reasonably have passed," the statement said.The family of the girl attacked by Sweeney supported Mr Reid's move, with their solicitor demanding a "significant increase" in the sentence, which could serve as a benchmark for future cases."The family believes today's sentence is an insult to their three-year-old daughter and that there are grave failings in the criminal justice system that need to be urgently addressed," a family statement said."The victim's family is now calling for the government to urgently review sentencing guidelines for crimes of this type and to significantly increase the prison sentences given to paedophiles."Figures released by Lord Goldsmith's office last week found 339 cases had been referred to appeal for being too lenient in the past three years. One in ten judges were involved in the referred cases, the figures showed.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the shortness of Mr Sweeney's sentence was the result of early release guidelines introduced by the government. He added that Mr Reid needed to admit he had "got it wrong"."It is act of rank hypocrisy for John Reid to blame judges for sentences which are a direct consequence of recent legislation introduced by this government," he said."It is bad enough that John Reid gives himself the right to second guess a sentence within hours of it being passed, but it is also extremely cynical when he must know that the possible deductions in Mr Sweeney's custodial sentence result from legislation which only came into effect in April last year."
