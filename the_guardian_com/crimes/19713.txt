While the political world was busy this week speculating on the future of William Hague and focusing on the government's response to the Libya crisis, the Labour party was quietly experiencing a wobble.A Guardian article by Sadiq Khan prompted fears within the shadow cabinet that the leadership was planning to abandon Tony Blair's electorally successful pledge to be "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime".Alarm bells started ringing when shadow ministers read an accompanying article by Alan Travis, the Guardian's home affairs editor. Travis wrote:Labour made a mistake by "playing tough" on crime and allowing the prison population to soar to record levels during its time in government, instead of tackling sky-high reoffending rates, the shadow justice secretary, Sadiq Khan, is to acknowledge for the first time on Monday.In a break with New Labour's hardline rhetoric, Khan is to argue that the party should declare a new policy aim of jailing fewer people.The key sections in the article by the shadow justice secretary, highlighted by Travis, were:I feel it was a mistake to not focus more on the issue of reducing offending. We became hesitant in talking about rehabilitation and the merits of bringing down reoffending rates.A focus on rehabilitation and reducing reoffending was seen as being soft on crime, when in fact it is effective in reducing crime.Senior Labour figures feared that Khan was breaking with one of the key planks of New Labour – its emphasis on cracking down on crime while not abandoning the left's traditional focus on its causes. This did, after all, help the party win three successive election victories.Khan's role as campaign manager to Ed Miliband fuelled suspicions that the Labour leader had endorsed a break with New Labour which he had mocked during the leadership contest.Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, moved tonight to calm nerves when she uttered the words ignored by Khan. In a speech in the West Midlands, Cooper said:The Labour Party will make fighting crime a central part of our local election campaign. We will be campaigning against cuts to the police which go too far, too fast and put communities at risk.And we will keep up our long standing determination to be tough on crime and on the causes of crime and reoffending too.Cooper's speech was designed to show that the apparent message in the Khan article – that Labour has moved on from the Blair approach – was wrong. But she did acknowledge an important element of Khan's thinking when she added that dealing with "reoffending too" would be at the heart of Labour's plans.So there are two questions tonight. Has Khan been brought down to earth by a more senior shadow cabinet colleague after floating an idea on his own? Or did Ed Miliband sanction his loyal aide to float an idea and the two of them have now been nicked by the increasingly formidable winner of last year's shadow cabinet elections?
