Police rescued eight children from alleged sexual abuse after uncovering a suspected paedophile ring based in Britain with more than 300 members worldwide.Jim Gamble, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, said that officers had successfully infiltrated "one of the largest paedophile rings in the world".The London-based centre coordinated a global undercover operation which pinpointed alleged "principal suspects" in the UK. Officers from Britain, the US, Australia and Canada operated a shift system to infiltrate the suspected paedophile ring on the web. Mr Gamble said the investigation had uncovered a circle of unprecedented scale. "We're talking hundreds of people who share images, ideas, locations where they can get access to children - and even the children they have access to."The operation marks the biggest success for Ceop since it was formed last April. The organisation, a branch of Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, focuses on finding abusers who operate over the internet. A conference is opening in Washington on the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT), a joint initiative to ensnare online paedophiles across the globe.Mr Gamble said information on alleged paedophiles in other countries will be shared with their local law enforcement agencies. Ceop has led to 27 paedophiles being placed in custody and about 70 children safeguarded, he added.
