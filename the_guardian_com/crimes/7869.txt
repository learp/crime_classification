A former Olympic judo competitor who once allegedly tortured a man by forcing his hands into a toaster was today found guilty of being part of a gang that turned over almost Â£1m a week selling cocaine and ecstasy.The jury was told that police stumbled on a drugs factory at James Waithe's flat in Bristol after being called to investigate a suspected burglary. Officers were shocked to find a 10-tonne hydraulic press, white powder and cutting agents, as well as rifles, handguns and stun grenades.Waithe, 47, a teacher who represented Barbados at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and England in the Commonwealth games, said he owned the flat but did not live there and had nothing to do with the racket.He was convicted of conspiracy to supply cocaine but was found not guilty of conspiracy to possess an explosive substance. The jury at Bristol crown court has still to reach a verdict on other counts of possession of a firearm. Waithe, who was said to be the gang's enforcer, taught PE and citizenship at Withywood community school and Bristol Gateway special school. He was also a coach at a judo club.Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, told the jury the operation was on an "industrial scale" and worth millions. Mooney said Waithe's claim that he did not live at the flat was undermined when police found a judo suit in the washing machine as well as awards and documents relating to him.The court heard details of his alleged violence, including that he had once held a man's hands in a hot electric toaster.Robert Brooks, 63, of no fixed address, was found not guilty of six firearms charges but guilty of conspiracy to possess explosives and conspiracy to supply drugs. Grant Richmond, 29, Craig Rodel, 46, and Luke Downes, 22, all of Bristol, all admitted conspiracy to supply drugs.
