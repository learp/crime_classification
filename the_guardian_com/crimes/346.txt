An international hunt for a convicted murderer has ended after he was arrested in Italy celebrating Christmas with his mother.Simon Wastall, 47, was given a life sentence in 1994 for stabbing his estranged partner, Catherine Carey, to death while their eight-year-old daughter slept in the next room.He was granted conditional release in 2005 and moved to a home for ex-offenders in Exeter but went missing in August.Acting on a tip-off from British police, Italian officers staked out the house of Wastall's mother near Turin. In a bin outside police found an envelope reading: "Happy Christmas Simon." Wastall was arrested as he emerged from the house two hours later."He was very cool and very English ... asking us 'I assume you will tell me at the police station the reason for this arrest,'" said an Italian police spokesman.In November 1993 Wastall broke into Carey's home near Leicester. He returned three days later, taking his shoes off to avoid leaving footprints before stabbing her 17 times.This year his mother June left Britain to move to Pino Torinese, where Wastall's sister and her Italian husband lived.
