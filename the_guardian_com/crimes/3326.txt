A woman whose teenage daughter was beaten unconscious in a "happy slapping" attack has denounced the craze as "sickening".Becky Smith, 16, lost consciousness and suffered temporary paralysis when she was attacked by teenagers near her home in Blackley, Manchester, 10 days ago in the new pattern of random assaults recorded on mobile phone cameras. Her mother, Georgina, revealed yesterday that a video of the assault was circulating around her daughter's school and had been seen by Becky's 13-year-old brother, Craig. "This is absolutely horrendous," said Mrs Smith, 39. "She was jumped from behind by another girl and five boys looked on and videoed it. "Becky was rushed to hospital unconscious. They could have killed her. We are very lucky she is alive." The video had begun doing the rounds of Plant Hill High School in Blackley a day after the attack and her daughter was too scared to go back there. "I just want whoever did this to be caught. She was left in a hell of a state. What happened to her was just sickening. "The school should get rid of video phones, or are they going to wait until someone has been murdered before they take the phones off the kids?" Becky, who is taking GCSEs, was attacked at 7.15pm on May 9. She suffered serious head injuries and spent two days at North Manchester General Hospital before going home. Greater Manchester police are investigating the attack. A spokesman for Plant Hill High school said: "This is a police matter which happened outside school." The Victims of Crime Trust yesterday condemned the craze, which is thought to have originated in London, as "completely and utterly unacceptable".Norman Brennan, the trust's director, said: "We have got innocent teenagers going about their business being attacked and the attack being filmed. This is not a bit of fun. It is a very serious crime."
