A Birmingham police sergeant has been given a seven-and-a-half year sentence for his role in a criminal gang that supplied drugs and ran brothels in the West End of London.Osman Iqbal, 37, was caught after fellow officers became suspicious after seeing him arrive at work in a Ferrari worth about £170,000 – and they began to investigate how an officer earning a modest salary could afford to be behind the wheel of such a car.Iqbal was in court on Wednesday to admit to new charges relating to an attempt to access confidential police intelligence systems.In September, Warwick crown court heard how an investigation by the Serious and Organised Crime Unit uncovered a conspiracy that included Iqbal’s three cousins, his sister and brother-in-law. Detectives found they were enticing clients from strip bars in the West End to properties linked with the gang, with the promise of drugs and prostitutes. The court also heard that clients had money stolen from their bank accounts but did not report it due to fear of being exposed.The court heard the gang used limousines and sports cars owned by two front companies – City Chauffeurs Ltd and Capital Event Management – and the firms’ bank accounts laundered the proceeds of their criminal dealings.Iqbal admitted conspiracy to possess class A drugs, conspiracy to manage a brothel and conspiracy to launder money. He was given seven and a half years.When sentencing Iqbal in September, Judge Sylvia de Bertodano told the court that he had previously been seen as a pillar of the Kings Heath, Birmingham community. She said: “You are not only a man of previous good character, you were a police officer who played a significant role in the community and your record as an officer was an extremely good one.”He will be sentenced for the new charges at a later date.
