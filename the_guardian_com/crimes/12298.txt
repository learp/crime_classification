A village shopkeeper has denied murdering his postmistress wife and told a jury he would never hurt her.Robin Garbutt, 45, is accused of bludgeoning his wife, Diana, 40, three times over the head as she slept in their living quarters above their shop and post office in Melsonby, North Yorkshire, in March last year.The prosecution at Teesside crown court alleges Garbutt killed his unfaithful wife, then raided the safe and pretended an armed robber had carried out the murder.The jury has heard that the couple had credit card debts of £30,000, but went on expensive weekend breaks.Jamie Hill QC opened the defence by asking: "Mr Garbutt, did you kill your wife?"The defendant replied from the witness box: "No, I would never hurt Di."He said he grew up near York and was managing director for a family business when he met his future wife.She worked for Group 4 as a security officer in magistrates and crown courts. Garbutt said they decided to buy the post office so they could spend more time together.The court has heard that the shop turned over more than £200,000 in 2009-10. Garbutt said the couple made a gross profit of £40-45,000, out of which they paid bills, the mortgage and some food. The court has heard the net profit was around £4,000."I would say we were doing OK," he told the court.Garbutt said they had built up the business, which had a turnover of £148,000 when they bought it in 2003."It's a gradual process, you have to build up a rapport with your customers and make sure what they like is on the shelf and just generally be nice to people," he said. "They tend to be nice back to you."The court has heard that Diana Garbutt had been involved with three men – becoming "intimate" on the sofa with one, sharing sexual banter on Facebook with another and apparently kissing her cousin's husband.Garbutt told the court: "Di had a larger sex drive than myself. When you work in a shop, you get up at 4.30, you are tired. I know it's a poor excuse but you do tend to be tired."The defendant said he became upset when his wife confessed that she had shared a kiss with a man on the settee. Hill described the incident as a "sexual encounter"."I think Di was more upset than me," Garbutt told the court and said they worked on their problem.Garbutt said he did not know about his wife flirting on Facebook but added that she had a cheeky sense of humour and he "wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on it".He said she had denied relatives' claims that she kissed her cousin's husband."We had the best relationship," he said. "I thought we were a loving couple and I miss her terribly."The trial continues.
