Detectives are to question an Eminem karaoke impersonator facing life in jail for killing a law student about the murder of an American artist in an east London park almost three years ago.Christopher Duncan, 21, who dressed like the rapper and even had the same tattoos, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey on Thursday to bludgeoning 26-year-old law student Jagdip Najran over the head with a metal baseball bat and stuffing her in a suitcase to bleed to death in May last year. He will be sentenced on Monday.Now it has emerged that he is a suspect for the murder of Margaret Muller, a 27-year-old student at the Slade School of Fine Art stabbed while jogging in Victoria Park, Hackney, in February 2003.She was found slumped on a path between a rose garden and a playground after joggers heard her screams.Duncan, a petty criminal with a history of drug abuse, was sleeping rough just metres away from Ms Muller's studio apartment at the time of her death but was not interviewed by police about the crime.However, when he was arrested over the Najran murder, his father allegedly told officers that although his son had admitted killing the young law student, they would not be able to "pin" the American on him.Detective Chief Inspector Mark Kandiah, from the Muller murder inquiry, said: "Christopher Duncan has killed a young woman - Jagdip Najran - and he lived near to Ms Muller at the time of her murder. Of course he is being considered along with others, but we cannot comment on ongoing operational activity."But a Scotland Yard source said it would be folly to rule out other possibilities. He pointed out that while the two murders had some similarities - both were brutal attacks on petite, brunette women in their mid-20s - there were also differences.Ms Najran willingly went home with Duncan, whom she had met before and fancied, after watching him perform at a karaoke night in a City pub, and he killed her in his flat, where he kept a stash of weapons. Ms Muller was apparently ambushed unawares in the park.The night he killed Ms Najran, Duncan ran to his mother's flat nearby and confessed in tears. He gave himself up to police three days later. "Could he have held out for years over another murder?" said a police source.Detectives previously thought the person who stabbed another young jogger in Clissold Park, north-east London, leaving her for dead, in December 2003, also murdered Margaret Muller. But it turned out that 16-year-old Elias Cecchetti - convicted of grievous bodily harm for the Clissold Park attack - had been in juvenile detention on the day of the Muller murder.A spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that the investigation into the murder of Margaret Muller in February 2003 is still active and ongoing."
