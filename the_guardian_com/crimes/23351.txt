Police investigating the deliberate tampering with saline solution at Stepping Hill hospital say a bottle of milk there may have been contaminated with bleach. The incident is not thought to be connected to the saline inquiry.Greater Manchester police (GMP) said officers were alerted by staff on Saturday evening to the new allegations of tampering at the hospital in Stockport.No one was harmed as a result of the milk incident, although an elderly patient tasted a small amount of the tainted liquid.A spokesman said: "GMP are now investigating this incident but there is nothing at this stage to suggest this is in any way linked to the wider police inquiry currently ongoing at the hospital."Stepping Hill is made up of a large community of people and it is unlikely that every incident reported is connected to the concerted and deliberate criminality already being investigated."The alarm was raised when a patient was given a drink on D2 ward, which cares for elderly patients.One patient drank a "very small amount" of milk but was unharmed.A hospital spokesman said: "Stepping Hill Hospital can confirm that an incident relating to the possible contamination of a small quantity of milk took place on Saturday night."The police have been informed and the hospital is helping them with their enquiries. There is nothing at this stage to suggest this is in any way linked to the wider police inquiry currently ongoing at the hospital."Police also said on Monday that they have ruled out four further deaths from their inquiry.They are still treating three deaths – those of Arnold Lancaster, Tracey Arden and Derek Weaver – as suspicious. All three died after treatment at Stepping Hill in July."We can confirm these people have been unlawfully administered insulin," Greater Manchester police said. However, detectives have yet to establish if this was a significant contributing factor in the deaths. The results of toxicology tests and other tests are still pending.Police had said previously that two other deaths were no longer considered suspicious. The families of the six patients ruled out of the inquiry have all been informed.Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said: "The decision to rule out the deaths of these six people will provide their families with some level of reassurance. They will now be able to continue grieving for their loved ones in the knowledge that they have not been taken from them in suspicious circumstances."I know relatives of the confirmed victims affected and the public in general will be anxious and want answers and we are working as quickly as we can without jeopardising the quality or integrity of the investigation."He described it as an exceptionally complex and difficult process and one that could not be rushed or completed quickly. "Should we identify any further deaths that will be investigated by us as part of this investigation we will, of course, make the relevant announcement once we have spoken to family members."Officers are continuing to work closely with medical experts to scrutinise postmortem reports, medical histories and records of any drugs that patients received while they were in the hospital.More than 300 people out of 700 patients, staff and visitors at the hospital have been interviewed. Detectives say there are now 30 potential victims.Weaver, from Stockport, died on 21 July after suffering a hypoglycaemic episode on 11 July, a day after he was admitted from a care home with breathing problems. Arden, of Heaviley, who had multiple sclerosis, died on 7 July, and Lancaster, of Romiley, died on 11 July.Rebecca Leighton, a 27-year-old nurse who was arrested in connection with the inquiry, was released after the CPS dropped charges against her on 2 September. She spent six weeks on remand in Styal prison, and after her release she spoke of the "living hell" of being under suspicion when she was innocent.The General Nursing and Midwifery Council is meeting on Wednesday in London to consider revoking the interim suspension of her registration.
