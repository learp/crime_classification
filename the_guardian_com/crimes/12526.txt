An independent inquiry is to be held into how a gay foster couple duped social services over photographs of young boys in their care whom they abused.They were jailed at Leeds crown court yesterday by a judge who accused them of wholesale betrayal of trust once their "ridiculous" reason for taking a picture of a foster-child urinating was believed.Craig Faunch, 32, was sentenced to six years and his partner Ian Wathey, 41, to five. Judge Sally Cahill QC accused them of showing no remorse, empathy with their victims or responsibility in the role of foster parents.The couple, who were convicted at an earlier trial, targeted boys from difficult backgrounds. Judge Cahill said one 14-year-old victim suffered from autism while another had a background of drug-taking and sexual and physical abuse.Referring to one teenager singled out by Faunch, she said: "You saw him as the ideal victim. You then chose to victimise and abuse him, showing the very depths of what you are prepared to do."The court heard that Faunch and Wathey, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, had abused four boys fostered to them by Wakefield, after checks showed that they had no police record and met all the council's requirements. Suspicions were raised when the photograph was found by the child's mother. But the court heard that staff had decided that the men had been "naive and silly", accepting their explanation that they used the picture to embarrass boys into closing the toilet door.Judge Cahill said: "Once you realised social services would not take any action and believed your ridiculous story about why you had taken the photograph, you went on to abuse others in your care, believing yourself safe from the authorities."Both men were convicted of multiple charges of sexually abusing 14-year-old boys. Wathey was cleared of two charges of having sexual activity with an eight-year-old.Kitty Ferris, Wakefield's director for children in need, said that internal procedures had been reviewed pending the independent inquiry. But "correct procedures had been carried out at every stage", including unannounced house visits.She said: "Allegations were referred to the police as quickly as possible. The council has offered support to children who have been affected."Both men have been banned for life from working with children and will remain on licence for three years after release.
