A British businessman will pay $229,000 (Â£145,000) to settle allegations that he authorised his company to pay multimillion-dollar bribes to Iraqi and Indonesian officials. Paul Jennings, chief executive of Cheshire-based chemical firm Innospec between 2005 and 2009, had been accused of approving bribes to boost sales of toxic fuel additives after they had been banned in western countries for endangering children. Jennings, who admitted no wrongdoing, will pay the money to settle the allegations from the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Innospec admitted the allegations last year and paid $40m to settle related investigations by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK and US prosecutors.
