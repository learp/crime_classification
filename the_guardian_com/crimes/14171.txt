Drinkers in Norfolk will soon be offered free taxi rides home to cut crime. A high proportion of antisocial behaviour occurs after pub closing times in Watton, Norfolk, and the initiative could reduce it substantially, police said. The scheme would offer free pre-paid taxis on Fridays and Saturdays to take people short distances home. Watton town council has given officers and the Safer Neighbourhoods team £350 to support a trial of the scheme. The mayor of the market town, Margaret Holmes, said: "Some people might say [the scheme] is expensive … but we think it is a good thing to support the police in this case."
