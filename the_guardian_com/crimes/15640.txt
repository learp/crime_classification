The powers of Home Office officials charged with ensuring the "fair and lawful treatment of prisoners" inside Britain's private jails are to be handed over to the private companies to boost their competitiveness.Leaked Home Office internal correspondence seen by the Guardian discloses that the responsibility of these officials -known as controllers - for internal prison discipline is also to be transferred to the director or governor of each private prison.The plan involves the transfer of powers to authorise the use of physical force against inmates and the use of segregation "punishment" cells, despite the fact that officials admit they are "potentially controversial". Ministers have already given outline approval, according to the papers.Prison service managers say that private prison directors, the equivalent of prison governors, need the new powers to "create a more level playing field" in the competition between private and public prison sectors.The reform, which will leave the Home Office controllers mainly with the task of monitoring the performance of each private prison, is to be included in a new correctional services bill to be introduced this autumn.The controllers are crown servants who were introduced into the 1991 Conservative legislation setting up private prisons to ensure that prisoners' rights were not infringed by the private companies.There are nine private prisons in England and Wales. Each has a Home Office controller on site. Two more are due to open in the next 12 months.The internal prison service paper from Trevor Williams, the Home Office's assistant director for the Office of Contracted Prisons, was leaked to Prison Privatisation Report International, published by the University of Greenwich.In it Mr Williams admits to the prisons minister, Paul Goggins, that the proposals are "potentially controversial" but claims they are unlikely to meet widespread public opposition."Interest is likely from the same sources that opposed the creation of private prisons when the 1991 Criminal Justice Act was introduced [prisoner rights groups, such as the Prison Reform Trust, and the prison service trade unions]," wrote Mr Williams, omitting to mention that the strongest opposition to private prisons at that time came from Labour's then home affairs frontbench team.Mr Williams says: "As a response to this, the role of controller was created to ad minister the internal prison discipline system of adjudications; to authorise the use of physical force against prisoners and their segregation; and to investigate allegations of inappropriate behaviour by contractors and their staff."But he argues that private prisons have proved themselves capable of delivering decent and innovative regimes and it is time to recognise their "strong record" by transferring the powers to them.Mr Williams says that the move, which requires primary legislation, is "designed to improve the conditions for contestability [the new buzzword for competition] and maximise the transfer of risk to private contractors".In a separate letter dated May 17 2004, Mr Williams reveals that he has the backing of ministers and is to include his plans in legislation this autumn. It confirms that the directors will also have the power to impose restrictions on visits and ban certain inmates from outside exercise.The paper has been given outline approval by the prisons minister and Martin Narey, chief executive of the new National Offender Management Service, which runs prisons and probation.But Mr Williams also discloses that Mr Goggins blocked a proposal to give private prison directors the power to authorise "covert intelligence gathering and handling of informants".The paper admits that the human rights group Liberty might raise concerns that a private company should be given the power to manage a prison's intelligence system, including controlling the location of prisoners and having access to the security information regarding relationships between prisoners. theguardian.com/prisons
