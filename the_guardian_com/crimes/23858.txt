The Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs is to be released from prison on compassionate grounds, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, announced tonight.Biggs, who is severely ill in hospital and being watched by prison guards, was told earlier today of Straw's decision, which will take effect from tomorrow."In this case, I have had to consider the medical evidence against well established criteria – specifically whether death was likely to occur soon and whether the prisoner was bedridden or severely incapacitated," Straw said."The medical evidence clearly shows that Mr Biggs is very ill and that his condition has deteriorated recently, culminating in his readmission to hospital. His condition is not expected to improve."Biggs, who turns 80 this Saturday, was moved to Norfolk and Norwich hospital, suffering from severe pneumonia 10 days ago. After a series of strokes, he is bedridden, fed through a tube and communicates by pointing at letters on a card.Although the decision to free him was made today, Biggs will remain on bed watch overnight.The three Prison Service staff watching him will be withdrawn tomorrow, once the licence for his release is finalised.Biggs, from Lambeth, south London, was a member of a 15-strong gang which attacked the Glasgow to London mail train at Ledburn, Buckinghamshire, in August 1963, and made off with £2.6m in used banknotes.He was given a 30-year sentence but after 15 months he escaped from Wandsworth prison, in south-west London, by climbing a 30ft wall and fleeing in a furniture van.Biggs was on the run for more than 30 years, living in Australia and Brazil before returning to the UK voluntarily in 2001, in search of medical treatment.He was locked up in Belmarsh high-security prison on his return, before being moved to a specialist medical unit at Norwich prison.When he was moved to Norwich hospital 10 days ago, his son, Michael, made a desperate plea for his father's release.Tonight, Judy Totton, a spokeswoman for Michael Biggs, said: "He is absolutely delighted and he hopes that his father will survive long enough to see his 80th birthday on Saturday."Biggs's legal adviser, Giovanni Di Stefano, told Sky News: "He is being released effectively to die and that cannot be considered a victory. But it's a victory for common sense and Mr Straw has made the right decision."He went on: "This man is ill, he's going to die, he is not going to any pub or going to Rio, he is going to stay in hospital."
