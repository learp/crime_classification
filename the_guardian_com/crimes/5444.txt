The mother of schoolgirl Alice Gross has spoken of her anger at her daughter’s killing and how she misses all the hugs and snuggles she got from a teenager who still called her “mummy”.Ros Hodgkiss revealed she keeps asking herself if there was anything she could have done to prevent the “random, incomprehensible tragedy” of the 14-year-old’s slaying.She and Alice’s father, Jose Gross, spoke to hundreds of people who attended an emotional memorial service for the teenager in Greenford, near her west London home, with scores waiting in the pouring rain beforehand to pay their respects.Alice was last seen alive walking along a towpath in west London on 28 August. It is believed that she was murdered by convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who was caught on CCTV following her on his bike.Despite the biggest police search since the aftermath of the 7 July bombings, it was more than a month before her body was found weighted down in the bed of the River Brent, near her Hanwell home.Zalkalns, who had previously served seven years for murdering his wife Rudite in his native Latvia, was found hanged in nearby Boston Manor Park on 4 October, four weeks after he was reported missing.Many of the assembled crowd at the service on Sunday were in tears as Mrs Hodgkiss said: “I have been numbed by shock and grief, I have felt outrage and anger at the loss of her life and unbelievable sadness at the emptiness that has been left.“I have racked my brains for all the ‘what ifs’ of that day, anything that might have stopped this random, incomprehensible tragedy.“It is even harder to talk about that pain than it is to talk about Alice. I cannot imagine life without Alice.”Mrs Hodgkiss added that she would miss Alice most on all the special family occasions, like Christmas, Alice’s birthday on Valentine’s Day, Mothers’ Day and her own birthday.She added: “I think of all the ... hugs, shared jokes, evenings spent snuggled on the sofa, goodnight kisses, the confidence of after-school conversations, Alice playing the piano in her dressing gown (and) singing, shopping, baking, the way Alice still called me ‘mummy’.”Alice was buried 10 days ago in a private ceremony but her family held Sunday’s event to say thank you to all the people in the local community, who came together to help find her when she was missing and who rallied round after their worst fears were realised.  The service was played a recording of Alice singing and playing violin to Leonard Cohen’s emotive song Hallelujah, with her father Jose joining her on guitar.A video was also shown on a big screen at Greenford Hall of her performing one of her own songs, called Don’t Go Away, in a rich and powerful voice.Mr Gross paid tribute to the “extraordinary support” given to him, Ros and Alice’s sister Nina.A Facebook page set up to help find Alice attracted 22,000 followers, “yellow ribbons of hope” appeared across west London and 6,000 runners in the Ealing Half Marathon also wore them. After her body was found Hanwell Clock Tower became a focus for tributes to her.“The response of the community was astonishing,” Gross added.“I was amazed by how much people were touched by our ongoing tragedy and how much they cared.“For five or so weeks the area became emblazoned in yellow ribbons, delivering a very powerful message of support to the public at large and anyone passing by.“No one could pass through Hanwell and beyond without being aware that Alice was missing and that the community cared.“When I felt very low the sight of the ribbons lifted my spirits.”Alice’s family asked that any donations be made to Alice’s Youth Music Memorial Fund at Alice’s Youth Music Memorial Fund.
