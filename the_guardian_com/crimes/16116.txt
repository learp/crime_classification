The biggest pirate DVD factory ever to be discovered in the UK was closed down yesterday, halting an operation capable of churning out 60,000 illegal film discs every day.Some 300 film titles were discovered, spanning from the latest children's animated blockbuster, Ice Age 2, which goes on UK general release in cinemas tomorrow, to pornography films featuring bestiality.Experts said the piracy operation illustrated the growing trend for gangs to set up ever bigger DVD burning factories in the UK, after Customs officers successfully stemmed the flood of pirate films from Asia.The factory, in a grimy industrial space in Leyton, east London, was more than twice as big an operation as any discovered in the UK previously.It was estimated that the Leyton set-up could have been capable of creating enough discs to yield a daily turnover of £250,000, selling on streets, pubs and market stalls for around £5 each.Piracy costs the film industry an estimated £300m a year and police say it is increasingly linked to international organised crime, and the illegal drugs trade.At the factory yesterday more than 500 DVD burner machines were discovered and five Chinese people arrested: four men, aged between 21 and 36 and one woman, aged 41. The five face prosecution under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and last night were being held at a police station in east London. A number of knives were also found at the factory; police said the pirate gangs were scared of being caught and also terrified of being robbed by other gangs.The Guardian was permitted exclusive access to the factory shortly after the raid yesterday lunchtime.It appeared that the gang had been there for some time: plates of food had been left and there were boxes of bananas, tomatoes and lettuce. A filthy mattress was propped against the wall near to boxes of pornographic DVDs which it was estimated accounted for around 30% of the total seized discs."All of the machines were running when we came in, making copies of Ice Age 2 and they were probably running them 24 hours a day, seven days a week," said Michael Buchan, a senior investigator with the Federation Against Copyright Theft (Fact).The organisation had tipped off the police and trading standards about the factory after a vehicle suspected of transporting pirate films was seen in the vicinity.Mr Buchan said: "There was just a sea of boxes full of discs when we came in and vehicles were probably arriving all the time to take them to multiple addresses where they are stored before they go onto the streets all over the UK."He said that many of the new films were sourced by the pirates by using camcorders to film new releases in the US, or from illegal download sites.Eddy Leviten, a spokesman for Fact, said the factory was probably one of the biggest of its kind to have been discovered anywhere in the world.He said children were often used by gangs to sell the discs - including the pornographic material.The majority of the DVD pirate gangs were made up of Chinese nationals, Mr Buchan said. "Most of them are illegal immigrants who are working off a debt to pay for them being brought over here illegally. Some of them are sending thousands of pounds back to China every week."One seller told me he could make £2,000 a week. Don't feel sorry for these guys traipsing around pubs trying to sell them. There is a mind boggling amount of DVDs being sold. We need to change attitudes among the public and stop the demand."In Barcelona and Madrid you get fines for buying them - we need to make it illegal here too."One of the colour inlays for the packaging of one DVD disc seized yesterday had a graphic saying "Piracy creates jobs ... piracy does not support Terrorism."But Raymond Leinster, director-general of Fact, said: "In fact piracy robs people of jobs in the film industry ... we are determined to work together with the police and other enforcement bodies to ensure that we continue to disrupt the supply chain and affect the distribution of counterfeit films across the UK."
