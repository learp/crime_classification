The results of DNA tests on evidence dating back more than 20 years, which was believed to have been destroyed, are due to be released within days, revealing whether a man convicted for the rape and murder of his ex-wife was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.John Robertson, known to friends as Jocky, was sentenced to life in prison in October 1988 after a jury found him guilty of killing Selina Parkinson at her flat in Wester Hailes in Edinburgh.He was ordered to serve a minimum term of 14 years and was later detained under the Mental Health Act after suffering a breakdown.DNA testing of evidence was not available at the time but last year, John McManus, the co-founder of the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation, referred the case to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) for the second time after he discovered that forensic evidence, previously believed destroyed, had never been tested."I don't know that this guy's a miscarriage of justice but there's a high probability he is, looking at the circumstantial evidence," he said. "The fact they've got physical evidence and no one's ever checked this is appalling."In 2005, the SCCRC wrote to McManus saying that it had been advised by the Lothian and Borders Forensic Science Laboratory "that in view of the age of the case, all of the biological samples had been previously destroyed".But McManus was determined to find out for himself whether that was true. He approached the interim procurator fiscal for the area, who wrote to him last year confirming "the forensic team have advised me that there are microscope slides retained covering swabs taken from mouth/anal and vaginal".When informed of this potential breakthrough, the SCCRC agreed to test the swabs, some of which are believed to contain semen, for DNA evidence.McManus said the SCCRC told him three sets of tests had been carried out but will not let him know the results until the written report is released. That is expected at the end of this week or the beginning of next week, McManus said.If the semen turns out not to be Robertson's the SCCRC is likely to refer the case to the high court. McManus said that if the tests proved inconclusive he would ask for independent corroboration.Parkinson's decomposing body was found on 7 June 1988. The police concluded that she had been murdered on the night of 22 April that year, based on date-specific items found in her flat and the last sighting of her.A witness said she saw Parkinson outside the flat talking in an agitated manner with a man the witness said was Robertson on that evening. That formed part of the case against Robertson, who turned 65 yesterday.Another witness, a bus driver, identified Robertson as alighting from his bus after asking him for directions to reach Wester Hailes the same night.The court also heard that the following evening Robertson made statements in the pub such as: "Check on my wife, I have left her lying in a pool of blood."Robertson, who was a heavy drinker, claimed that he had rowed and tussled with his partner – not Parkinson – that evening, which explained his comments.
