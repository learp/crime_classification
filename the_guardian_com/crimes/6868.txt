Senior judges are locked in a new battle with the lord chancellor over moves to make the judiciary more diverse, which the judges fear could dilute its quality.Lord Falconer issued proposals yesterday aimed at creating more judges who are women, from ethnic minorities, and younger, and to open some posts to candidates who are neither solicitors nor barristers.But Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, who has been in discussions with Lord Falconer for weeks on the issue, said the judges had "concerns" over the plans.He added: "I am very supportive of increasing the pool of applicants from which the judiciary is drawn. But we must ensure that no action is taken that would undermine the high quality of the judiciary and the need for appointments to be made on the grounds of merit alone. "Legal executives, who have professional qualifications and work in solicitors' firms doing some of the work of solicitors, will be eligible for the first time for posts as district judges, the lowest rank of the judiciary, or to serve on tribunals. Their inclusion is expected to boost the numbers of women judges, because 60% are women.Patent agents and trademark attorneys will be able to apply to become judges in the patents court.At present, lawyers are required to have had "rights of audience"- the right to appear as an advocate in court - for a number of years to be eligible for a judicial post. Under the new arrangements, they will need only to have a number of years of legal experience, and the qualifying periods will be reduced.They will drop from 10 years' experience to seven for some posts, and from seven to five for others, with the aim of producing younger judges. Minis ters hope to bring in the reforms next April, when the new independent judicial appointments commission begins work.Under the old system, the lord chancellor made judicial appointments after "secret sounding" with senior judges and other top legal figures.Critics argued that the system had a "cloning" effect, and the judiciary remained overwhelmingly white, male, middle-aged and public school educated, despite Labour's attempts to make it more diverse. At present, only about 17% of judges are women, and fewer than 4% come from ethnic minorities.Lord Falconer said: "The public needs to have confidence in judges who more closely reflect the diversity of the nation, and who have a real understanding of the problems faced by most people."These changes do not mean any lowering of standards. Those who apply for judicial appointment will face a rigorous, competitive, competence-based selection process."Last night Lord Woolf stepped into a simmering row between barristers and the lord chancellor over payments for criminal legal aid work, which is threatening to boil over into strike action.He told the lord chancellor, sitting beside him at the lord mayor of London's dinner for the judges at Mansion House, that he had to devise methods of funding criminal cases which provide "reasonable but not excessive rewards" for both solicitors and barristers.He also urged the lord chancellor to seek extra funds from the treasury to remedy the "parlous" state of the courts."Chronic and massive overspending in the legal aid budget" had depleted the courts of resources, he said, and the myth espoused by the government that the civil courts could be self financing was "totally inconsistent with equal justice for all.
