A bank clerk convicted of stealing Â£120,000 from two elderly customers has been found hanging from a footbridge after running out of a court moments before she was due to be sentenced.Bhindi Dhanji, 31, of North Circular Road, Neasden, was facing up to six years in jail after admitting two counts of theft from her employer, HSBC.She fled Southwark crown court on Tuesday before sentencing, prompting a warrant to be issued for her arrest.She was found hanging early yesterday morning alongside a man, believed to be her husband, from the footbridge near Staples Corner on the A406.A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "Police and London Ambulance Service attended after the bodies of a man and woman were found near the A406 Staples Corner at 6.40am."A postmortem is due to be carried out tomorrow, he said.On Tuesday, Detective Constable Malcolm Jolly of City of London police said Dhanji had abused a position of trust to steal from two vulnerable women and appealed for her to turn herself in.Richard Parry, defending Dhanji, told the court she "clearly seems to have panicked" after admitting her guilt.He said she arrived at court with her husband on Tuesday morning and he last saw her shortly after 11.30am."She seemed to be, I thought, fairly stoical about the outcome," he said.
