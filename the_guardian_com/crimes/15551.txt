North Wales police have referred Sky News to the Crown Prosecution Service and the attorney general's office following the accidental broadcast of a rape victim's name.Officers from North Wales police on Thursday questioned four staff at Sky News' Osterley headquarters in south west London after the broadcaster inadvertently displayed a Twitter feed that named the 19-year-old victim on air last month.The on-air mistake occurred as part of a report on Twitter users who allegedly revealed who footballer Ched Evans's victim was following his conviction for rape.Sky News said in a statement: "Yesterday we met with North Wales police to demonstrate and explain the technical error which caused the inadvertent broadcast of the victim's name in a recent serious sexual assault case."The name was on screen for a fraction of a second and was visible only when viewed in slow motion. We apologised to the victim and her family as soon as we became aware of the error and are co-operating fully with the police."A formal interview took place with Sky News staff and the investigation will continue, according to the north Wales force, which said that it was now up to the CPS whether to press charges.A North Wales police statement confirmed: "The case, as with all other cases in the investigation into the naming of the victim on social media sites, will be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service and the attorney general's office."Detective chief inspector Steve Williams said that Sky News "has fully co-operated with the investigation".Sixteen men and women from north Wales and South Yorkshire have been arrested and bailed during the investigation so far.The police statement added: "The force is reminding people that the law gives rape victims and other victims of serious sexual offences, anonymity for life and that if anyone publishes a victim's identity they will be subject to investigation and possible criminal proceedings."Evans was jailed for five years last month at Caernarfon crown court after being found guilty of raping the woman who was "too drunk to consent".• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
