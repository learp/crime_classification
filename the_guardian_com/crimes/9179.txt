The official inquiry into racism in Britain's prisons, which has taken more than 2 years and is expected to damn the service, is to publish the first of its findings next week.The initial report is expected to deal with issues surrounding the murder of Zahid Mubarek by a racist skinhead in Feltham youth jail, west London three years ago. But the second, more substantial, part of the inquiry report, studying allegations that racism is rife in some parts of the prison service and in particular at three named prisons: Brixton, Feltham and Parc, in south Wales, has been delayed again until at least September. The commission for racial equality launched the investigation in November 2000, partly at the request of the then director-general of the prison service, Martin Narey, following concern at the Mubarek murder and the treatment of Claude Johnson, a black prison officer at Brixton prison. At the time, the then chairman of the CRE, Gurbux Singh, said: "It is unacceptable to allow racist bullying, harassment, violence and murder to continue unchecked in our prisons." The investigation was portrayed as "no holds barred" and likely to be as influential in the prison service as the Stephen Lawrence inquiry has proved for the police. But a year ago Mr Narey attacked the CRE's handling of the inquiry, saying it had taken far too long. He claimed it had not been about a search for truth but about pinning the prison service to the wall on issues of racism. Parliamentary written answers this year put the cost of the investigation at more than Â£630,000, including fees to hire the leading barrister, Sir Anthony Scrivener QC, to conduct a public hearing. The draft report was passed to the prison service last December when parliament was told it would be published "in the new year". Chris Myant, the CRE's head of external affairs, and author of the report, defended the delays: "It has been going on for a long time but this is big and complex issue."
