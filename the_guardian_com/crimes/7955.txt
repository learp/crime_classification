Thirteen retired or serving police officers have been identified as "suspects" in the continuing investigation into the police cover-up after the Hillsborough disaster, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has said.The commission said 11 of these had already been interviewed under caution relating to a range of offences including manslaughter, misconduct in a public office, and perverting the course of justice.A spokesman said the other two would be interviewed in the near future. It is not clear what rank of officers have been identified as suspects or how many are serving or are retired. Four of the individuals have been identified by both the IPCC investigation into the cover-up and the new criminal inquiry into the 1989 tragedy.The news emerged on the eve of the opening of inquests into the 96 Hillsborough victims in Warrington on Monday.The IPCC is investigating allegations surrounding the alleged cover-up by police after the disaster, including evidence that statements were doctored.The linked criminal investigation under retired chief constable Jon Stoddart is examining the events that led up to the disaster, including crimes of manslaughter.At a pre-inquest hearing on Thursday lawyers expressed their "considerable regret" for a delay in providing pathology reports to the families of the deceased.As a result the coroner, Lord Justice Goldring, was asked to delay Monday's opening of the hearing.Counsel to the inquests Christina Lambert QC acknowledged that it was an "extremely difficult and tense time".Judy Khan QC, representing 74 families, asked the coroner for a three-week break so the families could consider the late pathology reports.Khan asked for this to take place after the opening statements from the coroner and the families, which are due to start next week after a jury has been selected.The coroner agreed to allow a delay but said he wanted lawyers at the inquest to liaise on how long this should be. He agreed this will take place after his opening statement and after the background "pen portraits" of the victims which are to be presented by the families after the coroner has finished his opening. hese are scheduled to be completed by April 29.Ms Lambert said: "It is matter of considerable regret that we were not able to provide the families with the pathology reports earlier. We recognise fully this has placed an emotional burden on families at an extremely difficult and tense time for them."Making his ruling, the coroner said it was a difficult decision because he was having to juggle the interests of the families with the convenience of the jury in the inquest.He said: "I understand the emotional commitment of the families to the start date and all that that involves. In the end, it seems to me I have to decide between the families and the convenience of the jury. I have decided that the families' interests will prevail."About 250 family members, lawyers and journalists gathered for Thursday's hearing â€“ the first at the inquest venue on a business park on the outskirts of Warrington.A jury will be selected at the start of the inquests on Monday, nearly 25 years on from the disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium.Britain's worst sporting disaster happened on 15 April 1989 during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest as thousands of fans were crushed on the ground's Leppings Lane terrace.Verdicts of accidental death from the original Hillsborough inquest in March 1991 were quashed in December 2012. The action was taken after the Hillsborough Independent Panel delivered its final report earlier in 2012.
