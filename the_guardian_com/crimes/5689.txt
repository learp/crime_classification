"They ran away when the police arrived.""There were three police there and I was told to leave. I'd had to go all the way around the rioters to get there so I'd put a hoodie on and put the hood up and I could see them.""I only found out later that they had jumped him. I could see he was wearing shorts and T-shirt, and he had grey hair."Commander Simon Foy, of Scotland Yard, said: "This was quite a grave assault and [the victim's] condition is causing us some concern."Scotland Yard said officers were in the area dealing with violent disorder when they became aware of the man, aged in his 40s or 50s, being attacked.Commander Simon Foy, of Scotland Yard, said: "It was quite a grave assault and his condition is causing us some concern."Officers managed to reach the man to administer first aid and then had to ensure the safety of paramedics who attended despite coming under fire from projectiles, the police said.The road remained closed off by police as forensic teams examined the scene.
