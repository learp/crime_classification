Police officers have been given permission to take the government to the high court for cutting their latest pay rise to 1.9%, instead of the 2.5% determined by an independent panel.A judge said today he had "no hesitation" in finding police had an arguable case to bring an urgent application for judicial review.It is the first step in their legal battle to receive the full 2.5% recommended by the Police Arbitration Tribunal, the independent body for deciding police pay. Police Federation lawyers say forces around the country had a "legitimate expectation" they would receive the full increase.In December, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, rejected backdating the 2.5% award recommended by the pay tribunal to September 1, the beginning of the police pay year.The Police Federation, which is at the centre of today's challenge, claims Smith had no power to overrule the pay tribunal unless it was for reasons of "utmost national importance". It accused Smith of approaching the negotiations "with a closed mind", saying she "had no intention of accepting any award that did not produce a figure for 2007 of less than 2%".The challenge also says Smith's decision was "procedurally defective" and an "abuse of the Police Negotiating Board process" because she failed to inform the federation before announcing her decision.The action claims that the human rights of officers have been infringed - in this case, a right to freedom of association - because they have given up the right to strike over pay.Jan Berry, chair of the federation, said the ruling was a positive step for the 140,000 police officers in England and Wales in their fight for fair pay. "The fact that our application for a judicial review has been successful adds weight to what we have been saying all along - that the home secretary betrayed police officers by failing to honour the decision of the independent Police Arbitration Tribunal," she said. Two weeks ago, more than 22,000 off-duty officers marched through Westminster in protest. It was the biggest gathering of police in Britain's history, with every force in England and Wales represented. A petition signed by more than 40,000 people was also handed in to 10 Downing Street.The pay rise has been backdated for police in Scotland.
