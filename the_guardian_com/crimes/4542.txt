 Age: 56. Appearance:  Deeply misleading.  Profession:  Doctor, serial killer, Guardian reader.  Come again?  It's true. Shipman's prison correspondence, reprinted in the Sunday Telegraph, reveals him to be a devotee of this very newspaper.  You mean he just came right out and admitted it?  Not quite, but the facts speak for themselves: "Each day his cell is unlocked at 7.30am in time for breakfast over the Guardian..."  Tell me this isn't the basis of a new ad campaign. Not at all. Simply a fascinating insight into the mind of a mass murderer.  Any obvious clues which might have tipped us off?  Well, he does have a beard, and his letters are riddled with childish mistakes. "Dr Shipman's surprisingly poor spelling, punctuation and grammar," says the Sunday Telegraph, "suggest that he is less well-educated than he took himself to be, and was perhaps always operating at the limit of his intellectual capacity."  He certainly fits the demographic.  I think we are in danger of crossing the boundaries of printability with such libellous denigration of our readers.  Stop using such big words!  It's just that lots of people read the Guardian every day and never kill anyone.  Of course. So what other famous or unlikely Guardian readers do we know about?  Raymond Blanc, Bobby Robson, Graeme Le Saux, Dennis Nielsen, Myra Hindley.  Some regular Guardian features which might be likely to catch Shipman's eye:  Health, obituaries, A Life Inside, today's Pass Notes. And others - wait for it - he might be less interested in:  Reader offer holidays, Going Out, Corrections and Clarifications.  Most likely to say: "That wasn't very funny."  Least likely to say: "I did it!" (with regard to Guardian Crossword No 22,579).  Not to be confused with:  You, gentle reader (H Shipman, please ignore).
