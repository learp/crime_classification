A 17-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to the murder of a teenage army cadet who was stabbed to death as he stood outside a youth club in Liverpool with two friends.Joseph Lappin, 16, was attacked and chased by a group of youths outside the Shrewsbury House Youth Club in Everton in October 2008 where he had earlier been listening to music.Today, James Moore, one of 10 defendants charged with murder, changed his not guilty plea to guilty after two days of legal argument at Liverpool crown court.Nine other defendants, also from Everton, deny murder and will go on trial this week.Lappin had spent a night watching friends play in a band at the youth club before the attack.He and friend Callum Naden, now aged 18, and another boy had been chased around the building and were trying to get back inside when they were set upon.Lappin, a cadet member of the Liverpool Scottish Regiment, suffered a fatal stab wound and Callum was stabbed twice, but survived.Moore pleaded guilty to the murder of Lappin and intent to cause Naden grievous bodily harm.The trial judge, Mr Justice Henriques, told Moore: "You had the good sense and have been well advised to plead guilty. It cannot have been an easy task for you to admit the crime of murder."Two other teenagers, aged 16 and 17, who cannot be named because of their ages, will now stand trial later this week alongside seven men.Moore was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the conclusion of the trial.
