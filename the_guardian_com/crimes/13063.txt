Scotland's most senior legal figure yesterday lodged an appeal against the "unduly lenient" sentence handed out to the Lockerbie bomber.Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, 51, the Libyan intelligence agent who murdered 270 people when he planted the Lockerbie bomb, was told by a judge in Glasgow last month that he must serve at least 27 years before he can be considered for parole. But the lord advocate, Colin Boyd QC, claims this is unduly lenient. He is also challenging the court's view that 30 years was the maximum sentence it could hand out. Megrahi was convicted in 2001 following a special trial in the Netherlands, when the trial judges recommended that he spend at least 20 years in prison. But introduction of human rights laws north of the border means that prisoners must now be told how long they will spend in prison before they can apply for parole. In November, the trial judges reconvened in Glasgow and Lord Sutherland told Megrahi the minimum time he must spend in his specially constructed cell in Glasgow's Barlinnie prison.But the judges' sentence angered American relatives, who claimed it amounted to only around a month in jail for each of Megrahi's victims.Tam Dalyell, the veteran Labour MP who believes Megrahi is innocent, yesterday said he was "very unhappy that it looks as though pressure from the American relatives of the victims has caused the lord advocate to do this".Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed and who now acts as a spokesman for most of the UK relatives, was unavailable for comment yesterday. But his wife, Jane, said she thought Megrahi's sentence was long enough. Speaking in a personal capacity, she said: "He is going to be in jail until he is an old man, as it stands."
