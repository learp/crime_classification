Sex offenders will be offered lie detector tests to help police assess the risk they pose to the public when released.Police and crime commissioner for South Yorkshire Shaun Wright has decided to introduce the technology despite questions over its accuracy.He will spend Â£35,000 training two officers to carry out the tests, sending them to Texas to complete a 10-week, 400-hour basic training course, followed by another 80 hours of training.The tests will be offered to sex offenders who are on bail or being dealt with by probation and will be used only for risk assessments, not in court.Wright said that in trials by Hertfordshire police, three-quarters of offenders had their risk level increased.The tests could be used to assess the risk posed by suspects who are arrested for possession of child abuse images and released on bail while police carry out technical investigations.Wright said : "The benchmark for experts in polygraph assessment is held by the American Polygraph Association. I have therefore provided funding for two South Yorkshire police officers to complete their polygraph training programme and become accredited. I will also fully support two police officers working full-time on the testing of sex offenders."I made plain in my police and crime plan that protecting the most vulnerable people in society was one of my key priorities and this important initiative is further illustration of how I am trying to achieve that aim."The programme will reduce investigation costs and help us protect more vulnerable people as we come to understand the risks associated with some of this criminal behaviour."This is an excellent opportunity for officers to be proactive in their management of suspects on police bail and contribute to protecting and safeguarding more children at risk of sexual abuse."
