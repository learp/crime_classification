One of two brothers convicted of killing Damilola Taylor has been returned to prison after breaching licence conditions that were applied to him after he was released last year.Ricky Preddie, who was jailed at the same time as his brother Danny in 2006 for the manslaughter of 10-year-old Damilola, was released in September after serving two thirds of his eight-year sentence.He was arrested on Friday evening after he failed to conform to a curfew on a number of occasions.Damilola, who had moved to Britain from Nigeria a few months before his death, was stabbed with a broken bottle in November 2000 as he walked to his family's home in Peckham, south London, and was found bleeding from a leg wound in a stairwell on a housing estate.The Preddies, south London gang members who were 12 and 13 at the time of the manslaughter, were convicted of his killing after two police inquiries and three trials which cost an estimated Â£16m. Police forces around the UK initiated reviews of scores of murders after serious failures at the government-run forensic science laboratory were exposed.A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to confirm Preddie's recall but said: "All offenders subject to probation supervision on release from prison have to adhere to a set of strict conditions.""They are subject to recall to custody if they breach their conditions or their behaviour indicates that it is no longer safe for them or for the public if they remain in the community."At the time of Preddie's release, Gary Trowsdale, chief executive of the Damilola Taylor Trust, said the charity had urged the authorities to ensure he received the help he needed.Mr Trowsdale said: "We have very strongly recommended to the authorities that the boy is mentored."We hope the Probation Service will do its job and he is properly mentored."Danny Preddie remains in prison serving a sentence for another offence and is due to be released this year.
