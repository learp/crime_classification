A man who fled from prison and committed a string of crimes while on the run was jailed for life on Friday.Lee Cyrus, 48, carried out sexual offences, acts of grievous bodily harm, burglaries and robberies after he went missing from an open prison in Boston, Lincolnshire, in October 2012 when on day release.Acting Det Supt Raffaele D'Orsi said Cyrus was a forensically aware predator who relied on the "utmost cowardly approach in selecting victims â€“ lone vulnerable women in open spaces or in their homes, to whom he used excessive and unnecessary violence".Cyrus, also known as Ivan Leach, received sentences ranging from two years to life for offences at Southwark crown court in London. All sentences are to run concurrently.Among his offences, Cyrus indecently exposed himself to two women at Boston cemetery, which was a desecration of the victims' time with the dead, Judge Deborah Taylor said. She added that the victims came forward with great fortitude and resolve and she found their evidence "chilling".Several crimes of indecent exposure took place on Hampstead Heath in north London within weeks of him going on the run, the court was told.Cyrus, armed with a knife and wearing a black balaclava, targeted women. A glove containing his DNA was found at one of the crime scenes where Cyrus had indecently exposed himself outside Jack Straw's Castle pub on the heath.The offences increased in seriousness, graduating to brutal attacks on elderly women alone in their homes. They included a robbery at knifepoint of one woman and an aggravated burglary, also using a knife, of an elderly woman's home.Police received a call from a member of the public who recognised Cyrus from a leaflet on 2 December 2012. Another later call was received when Cyrus exposed himself and threatened to rape a woman who was walking home. Within minutes, officers in Camden, north London, spotted Cyrus, who was arrested after a brief struggle.An iPod, which had been stolen from one of his victims in Barnet, north-west London, as well as a black balaclava, black boots and black gloves, were found after searching the room where Cyrus was staying, Scotland Yard said.He was sentenced to life imprisonment for each of four offences. They were two counts of grievous bodily harm, aggravated burglary and knifepoint robbery, which took place in November 2012.He was sentenced to a total of two years for the five indecent offences; and two years in total for burglary and affray, which included threatening a woman with a knife on Hampstead Heath in October 2012, and stealing an iPod and a bag containing a wallet, cash, cards and driving licence from the home of a man in Barnet in December 2012.DS James Mason, who led the investigation, said: "This was a complex investigation which saw a combination of evidence gathered from CCTV, mobile phone cell location, clothing, several key witnesses and various evidence which was presented at the court to bring to justice this very dangerous man. I'd like to pay tribute to the unfortunate victims who all suffered at the hands of this violent offender."D'Orsi said: "It will take a significant length of time for the victims who suffered at the hands of Lee Cyrus to come to terms with the horrific attacks he committed on them and I would like to praise their courage and resilience in supporting this prosecution."
