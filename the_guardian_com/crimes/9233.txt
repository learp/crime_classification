Two policemen at the inquest into the 7 July 2005 bomb victims spoke yesterday of their frustration at leaving the scene of the bus explosion and being "locked down" inside the nearby British Transport police HQ, because it was feared that the building could also be a target.Minutes after Hasib Hussain detonated his bomb on the top deck of the bus in Tavistock Square, rescue workers urgently needed supplies and back-up, but the radio network was not working. "There were so many active messages going across the air that we just couldn't cut in," said PC Neville Lazenby.The radio network was overloaded and the mobile networks were also down, so Lazenby and his colleague PC Gary Sims went to the nearby British Transport Police headquarters on Camden Road on foot.After passing on their requests for help, the men were told that the base was close enough to the explosion that it was thought it might be targeted and was put on "lock down", meaning they were not permitted to leave.Lazenby said: "I was told that force headquarters had been put into lock down, that we didn't know what the pattern was as regards to the terrorist attacks. It was though that force headquarters could be the next target because of the proximity of where it is to both incidents, ie Russell Square and the number 30 bus," .He added: "The order was a direct one and I had no option but to obey it."Both men said they were unhappy at being unable to return to the scene of the explosion to help."I was frustrated to say the least," added Lazenby, "but I do see the reasoning behind it because if I'd left there, having received that, and something had happened and I became a casualty â€¦ "Sims said he shared Lazenby's feelings. Describing himself as "very frustrated", the officer told the inquest: "I wanted to get back."But echoing his colleague, Sims said he understood why they were forbidden to. "We didn't know exactly what was going on and we had to accept the fact that the people telling us to stay had better knowledge of the overall situation than we did," he added.
