The former boyfriend of Hayley Richards, the pregnant 23-year-old found stabbed to death this month, was last night charged with her murder.Hugo Quintas had earlier arrived in the UK under police guard after being found in Spain. He touched down accompanied by the detective leading the murder hunt, and was taken to a police station in Wiltshire where he was charged. Mr Quintas, 23, had flown from the UK to his native Portugal on June 11, the day on which the body of Miss Richards, who was three months pregnant, was found at her home in Trowbridge in Wiltshire. He went on to Spain, where he was arrested last week under a European arrest warrant after being stopped in the Basque region by traffic police. He has not challenged the extradition process. Detective Superintendent Mike Veale, heading the inquiry, was accompanied to Spain by three officers from the Metropolitan police's extradition unit, who are trained to undertake prisoner escorts. Mr Quintas is due to appear before Chippenham magistrates this morning.
