It is well worth listening to the BBC Radio Four documentary on the legal action being brought by the group of eight women.The File on Four documentary interviewed some of the women who say they were tricked into forming long-term relationships with undercover policemen.One thing which comes across again is the level of intrusion into the lives of the women.For example, one woman, called Lily in the documentary, had a two-year relationship with Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated the environmental movement for seven years.She describes how Kennedy, then pretending to be "Mark Stone", moved in with her and a group of her friends and became involved in "pretty much every aspect of my life".He was at her grandmother's 90th birthday where he seemed very "comfortable".Lily's mother said :"He seemed absolutely devoted to my daughter. He used to stay here, slob around, watching TV with us, all that stuff that you do in a relaxed way with people in the family".Lily told the BBC why she is taking the legal action : "It wasn't just that someone lied to me, it was that there was a whole team of secret people digging away at my life - and personally for me it is very important to know how deeply they were intruding into my private space"."These shadowy figures were presumably making decisions about my dinner dates and whether or not I was going to spend the night with my boyfriend, reading emails, listening to phone calls - deeply personal stuff."I wonder if the undercover officers who had these relationships will listen to the programme and where some of them are now.The documentary, which was broadcast last night, is here and will be repeated at 5pm on Sunday.
