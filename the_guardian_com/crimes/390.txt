A children's charity today condemned the sentencing policy of a judge as "disturbing", after he had a second child sex case referred to the court of appeal.In January, Judge Julian Hall, sitting at Oxford Crown Court, imposed a three-year supervision order on a 17-year-old boy who abused two young children, opting not to jail him because he did not believe him to be sufficiently dangerous.The Solicitor General last night confirmed the case had been referred to the court of appeal.Last June Judge Hall sparked controversy when he imposed a sentence of just two years on a man who raped a girl of 10. When sentencing the man, Hall remarked that the 10-year-old liked to dress older than her years, and had appeared as old as 16.The case was also referred to the court of appeal, and the sentence was doubled after being deemed unduly lenient.Today Claude Knights, director of the charity Kidscape, said of the latest case: "It's another disturbing judgment ... We now have a second child sex offence case involving a judge who has made some very disturbing decisions.Knight claimed that the judge had made inappropriate remarks about young victims, and that Kidscape – set up to combat child sex abuse and bullying – was concerned about his approach."If we get another case like this I think there would need to be some sort of review of the judge's knowledge of this area," she said."These are real victims and real situations."A spokesman for the Judicial Communications Office said today: "From time to time sentencing decisions are referred to the court of appeal for them to consider. If they are wrong they are corrected."This process shows the strength of the system which provides a proper mechanism for review both of unduly lenient sentences and those which defendants argue are excessive."
