Two teenage brothers are to be retried over the death of the schoolboy Damilola Taylor, prosecutors said today.The youths, aged 17 and 18, face a retrial on manslaughter charges in what will be the third trial over the death of the 10-year-old in 2000.The Crown Prosecution Service announced the decision at an Old Bailey hearing this morning. Both brothers - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were cleared on Tuesday of murdering Damilola. They were also found not guilty of assault with intent to rob. Jurors could not agree on the third charge of manslaughter, and the jury was dismissed. The brothers had denied all the charges, and said they had not been involved in any attack on Damilola. The schoolboy died in November 2000 when he was cut in the leg with a broken beer bottle in Peckham, south London. Four different youths were cleared of his murder in 2002, and Hassan Jihad, a 20-year-old from Peckham, was cleared on Monday. Damilola's parents - who have expressed their "profound disappointment" that nobody has been found responsible for his death - were informed about the decision to hold a retrial yesterday. The decision was made after discussions between CPS lawyers, the police and Ken Macdonald QC, the director of public prosecutions.
