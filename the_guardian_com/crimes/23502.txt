A teenage sex attacker who raped a five-year-old boy just over a week after he was spared a custodial sentence for a child rape was jailed today.The 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to a number of charges against a young child. They included rape and kidnap with intent to commit a sexual offence and attempted rape.Minshull Street crown court in Manchester heard the attack happened in July this year, eight days after he had been given a three-year community order on 26 June for the rape of a seven-year-old boy in Tameside, near Manchester.The original sentence handed down by Judge Adrian Smith prompted an outcry at the time from Greater Manchester police and the Crown Prosecution Service, which launched a legal challenge.Today the boy was detained indefinitely for the public's protection for a minimum of three years before he is eligible for parole.Judge Peter Larkin told him: "The offences you have committed are deeply disturbing and very serious. You are a devious and manipulative young man with an unhealthy and completely unacceptable sexual interest in young boys. It is likely you will not be released for some considerable period of time."The judge said the attacker had lured the boy to his home and cynically taken advantage of him. "You took away his innocence," the judge said. "What you did has had a devastating effect on the boy and his family."The judge said it was highly unusual for a court to categorise a 16-year-old as a danger to the public, but in this case it was merited. "I have to say I have absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in reaching the conclusion that you are indeed a dangerous offender," he added.The boy was sentenced to three years and four months, but with the time he has already spent in custody taken into account, he will serve a minimum of two years and 359 days before he is eligible for parole.Larkin also revoked the community rehabilitation order passed by Smith and resentenced the teenager for the earlier rape against the seven-year-old boy.For the earlier offence he was given three years and four months to run concurrently. He was also banned from working with children and placed on the sex offenders register.When sentencing the teenager for the first rape, the other judge is believed to have taken into consideration the views of the victim's family, who forgave him because of their Christian beliefs.But the three-year community order prompted an appeal by the Crown Prosecution Service and the police.At the time, the CPS said: "It is rare to lodge these kind of sentence appeals with the attorney general, but we felt very strongly about this case. We appealed two days after he received his sentence; unfortunately he committed another assault eight days later."
