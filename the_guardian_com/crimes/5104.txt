A prisoner is alleged to have committed rape after being released early under a government scheme to reducing overcrowding in jails.The assault was one of six sexual offences alleged to have been committed so far by inmates released under an early release scheme brought in a year ago, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, said today."Four offenders have allegedly committed six sexual offences while they were subject to the end of custody licence, of which one was rape. Five were other sexual offences," Straw said in a written answer to MPs.No further details were revealed about the incidents.During the first nine months of the end of custody licence (ECL) scheme, 24,000 inmates shared £2m from the Treasury to help them reintegrate to life outside.Each prisoner received about £82 on top of the standard £47 discharge grant on leaving jail, the Conservative party said.The Tories accused the handouts of adding "insult to injury" because the offenders were being "paid for the privilege" of leaving early.Straw said: "Subsistence payments are made because prisoners on an ECL are released under temporary licence from prison. [They] are statutorily ineligible to receive benefits payments."The shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, said: "The human cost of this discredited scheme is clear in hundreds of unnecessary victims of crime. Now we learn the financial cost to the taxpayer is more than £2m.A justice ministry spokeswoman said: "Any offending carried out by an offender during the ECL period is regrettable."However, just 1% of those released on ECL so far have been notified to us as allegedly committing offences during the ECL period."The latest blow comes after the probation union, Napo, said prisoners with a history of domestic violence were still being awarded early release – increasing the threat of further crimes.The union said not enough checks were being carried out on inmates.Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the union, said: "The scheme was introduced quickly and is clearly flawed. Men convicted of offences of domestic violence are being let out without any accommodation check and returning to their partners' addresses."
