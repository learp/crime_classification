Many had been drinking heavily all day before rioting broke out when a screen in the largest fan zone failed before kick-off.Gangs of fans had running battles with police, showering officers with bottles and bricks. Police launched Operation Gale to find the culprits, with officers analysing thousands of hours of CCTV pictures to identify hooligans caught on camera.
