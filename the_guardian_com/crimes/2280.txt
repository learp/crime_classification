Police were today forced to defend their handling of the investigation into events leading up to the torture and robbery of two boys after it emerged that their attackers should have been interviewed by officers on the day they carried out the attack.Speaking outside Sheffield crown court, Acting Superintendent Ian Bint said police had been actively looking for the brothers after they did not turn up at a police station for questioning about an assault the previous week.He said police initially did not have any suspects for the first attack but identified the two brothers, aged 12 and 10, after investigations.He insisted that the brothers could not have been questioned any earlier as police had not gathered enough evidence about the attack and would not have been able to charge them. It also took time to make arrangements to interview them due to their young age.Asked whether the second attack could have been prevented, Bint said that, given the possible charges from the first attack and their ages, it was unlikely they would have been in custody.He said the force's handling of the case would be looked into as part of a serious case review, which will also look at the role of social services."I am quite satisfied that we dealt with it promptly," he said. "If there are lessons to be learned then we will learn them."Detective Superintendent Mick Mason said the victims suffered a "traumatic experience" but were "recovering well"."This crime was extremely shocking and it does rank up there with the most serious that I've ever dealt with," he said. "Being a father, it does come across and strike home how horrendous the crime has been."He praised the community in Edlington and said one of the victims could have died if it had not been for members of the public helping to search for him.Describing the effects the attack had had on the boys, Mason said: "The victims are still suffering, certainly mentally, and also recovering from the physical wounds. The families are really supportive, genuinely nice people and I think it's because of their caring the lads have recovered to the extent they have."People living near the brothers' home before they moved to a foster family in the weeks before the attacks said they appealed to the council and police for help to deal with the problems they were causing.At the time of the attack, the 10-year-old was on bail to appear before the youth court on two charges of actual bodily harm and one of burglary, while his brother had received a 12-month supervision order two months earlier after being convicted of battery.The younger boy had no previous convictions but did have reprimands for actual bodily harm and common assault.
