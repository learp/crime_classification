The girlfriend of the Hell's Angel shot dead on a motorway last weekend said today that his murder had left "a hole that can never be filled" in the lives of those who knew him.Rebecca Smith's statement came as detectives investigating the killing of Gerard Tobin said they wanted bikers to come forward with information that might lead them to the killer.Ms Smith, 25, from Mottingham, south London, said: "I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and love to all that have supported me and our club at this awful time."Thank you to all for your kind words, respects, sentiments and tributes. A hole that can never be filled has been left in the lives and hearts of so many. Gerry was my life."Tobin, 35, was shot in the back of the head by a hitman travelling at 70mph as he drove home from the Bulldog Bash biker festival last Sunday. The Canadian-born mechanic was riding his Harley Davidson FX STV 1500 Night Train when a green Rover 620 drew alongside and someone fired two shots from a handgun.Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, who is leading the inquiry, said his officers would be going wherever crowds of bikers gathered in a bid to find evidence."Clearly motorcycle enthusiasts from all over the country attend the Bulldog Bash event and we want to target as many potential witnesses as possible," he said.Detectives visited a gathering of motorcyclists at the Waterman pub at Hatton near Warwick on Wednesday night.Friends of the dead man have said there was no trouble at the Bulldog Bash, which was celebrating its 21st anniversary, and they could think of no reason for the shooting.Some bikers have suggested that he might have been the victim of mistaken identity. Police are considering whether he might have been the victim of a feud between bikers' clubs.
