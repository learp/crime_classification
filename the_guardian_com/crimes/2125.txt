The footballer Adam Johnson has been refused permission to appeal against his conviction for child sex offences.The former Sunderland and England player, 28, was jailed for six years in March for engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old fan. Johnson’s trial at Bradford crown court heard that he had kissed and sexually touched the girl in his Range Rover at a secluded spot in County Durham.The jury found him guilty of one count of sexual activity with a schoolgirl, and cleared him of another count in which it was alleged she had performed a sex act on him. On the first day of his trial Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of grooming and one count of kissing the girl.A statement from his solicitor said: “We have received notification that Adam Johnson’s applications for leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence have been refused by the single judge.“He [Johnson] is obviously disappointed. Having carefully considered all of the information, we will be lodging renewed applications on conviction and sentence in the coming days.”Although Johnson’s legal team has lost the first stage of the appeal process, in which a judge decides whether to put the case before three appeal court judges, they can still apply for a court to examine the case again without public funding. The footballer, who once earned £60,000 a week, has 14 days to make a renewed application to appeal.Johnson’s sister, Faye, posted a message on Twitter on Tuesday morning saying she was “absolutely devastated” that the judge had rejected her brother’s appeal. “I can assure every supporter that it has made me stronger and I will never give up,” she said.Johnson filed an appeal against his conviction six days after he was imprisoned, and the news was reported on a Facebook page for Johnson’s supporters previously run by his sister. “Adam’s appeal against his sentence has now been lodged! Thanks everyone for your support it means a lot! X,” the post said.The Facebook page had previously been reported to the trial judge, Jonathan Rose, after several supporters posted abusive comments about Johnson’s victim, who remains anonymous for legal reasons.
