A violent paedophile described by a senior detective as a "monster and a bully" has been jailed for life for committing offences against 10 victims.Karl Clay, 39, from the Wood End area of Coventry, was ordered to serve at least 15 years before becoming eligible to be considered for parole.A judge at Warwick crown court, Leamington Spa, was told Clay's offences, including violent and sexual assaults on children and adults, spanned 16 years.In a statement issued after the case, DI Chris Hanson of West Midlands police said: "Karl Clay is easily the vilest offender I have ever dealt with in the 21 years that I have been a police officer and his victims have been terribly brave in giving the evidence that was crucial in convicting him."Whilst our inquiry uncovered 10 of Clay's victims, I would be surprised if there aren't others out there. I would urge anyone else who has suffered because of him to contact the police."Clay poured petrol over three of his victims, including two children, and subjected another to an attempted drowning.Describing the offences as horrendous, Hanson added: "Clay stopped at nothing and Coventry is a safer place with him off the streets."Clay was found guilty in July of counts of rape, causing actual bodily harm, attempted rape, indecency, indecent assault, making threats to kill, causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, and harassment.
