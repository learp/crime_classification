The mother of schoolgirl Danielle Beccan today pleaded for help in tracing her daughter's killers.Speaking from her home, just yards from the spot where Danielle was shot dead in the St Ann's area of Nottingham four days ago, Paula Platt said her daughter deserved justice.She said: "Someone must know who did this. I cannot believe they have gone home and not acted differently. I feel very angry. At this moment my child is lying in a refrigerator. She should not be there."I want to speak directly to parents. If my child did something like this, I couldn't harbour them. I always knew Danielle was bright and intelligent. She was destined for great things."She was ambitious and I wanted her to touch the world, but not like this. Danielle could put her hands to anything. She was so creative - always drawing, doodling and writing stories. Her favourite subject at school was English."As parents we all have a responsibility to equip our children to go out in the world and be independent and strong. My daughter has been taken away from me and no parent should have to go through this."If anyone knows anything, please examine your consciences and come forward and tell police. Danielle deserves justice."
