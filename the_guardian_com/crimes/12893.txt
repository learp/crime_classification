The awful Sheffield incest case is being openly compared with that of Joseph Fritzl – the Austrian who raped, abused and fathered seven children with his daughter over nearly a quarter of a century, and whom he kept imprisoned in a cellar of their house in Amstetten.However, there are a number of differences between what has happened in Sheffield and what took place in Austria – even if power, torture, isolation and fear are the common dynamics, and whether or not the much-used "Stockholm syndrome" allows us to gain an insight into what might have been happening on a day-to-day basis in Sheffield and Lincolnshire.The first difference relates to the idea that sexual abuse – in this case incest – needs to be covert and hidden. It does not, but can often be public, without necessarily being visible or acknowledged. By "visible" I mean that it is obvious and clear to the viewer that it is sexual abuse that is taking place, and here we should acknowledge that this Sheffield abuser adopted a number of strategies to ensure that visibility was difficult.For example, he ensured that he moved his family regularly to rather isolated villages in Lincolnshire, where it was easier to hide what was happening, and where he must have hoped that suspicions, and perhaps even accusing files, would be lost. So too, when injuries were visible – so terrorised were his daughters to reveal the truth about a broken arm, or a burn – that they covered these up by telling anyone who asked that their injuries were the result of bullying.By "acknowledging" I mean to suggest that there were clearly some people who did appreciate that abuse was taking place but refused to do anything to bring that reality to the attention of those who might have been able to do something about it. For example, this man's ex-wife clearly knew that her daughters were being sexually abused but chose – for whatever reason – not to say, or do, anything about that fact. As a result, these poor women were forced to undergo 19 pregnancies and give birth to nine children.The second difference also relates to visibility and acknowledgement, but this time of our courts. I know the name of Joseph Fritzl, and also the names of his daughter and of the children that she bore to her abusive father. I know the name of the village where they endured this personal hell for 24 years. I know all of this because the Austrian courts allowed the details of the case to be in the public domain – a decision that our courts did not take. I also know that this secrecy is meant to "protect" the women who were abused and the children that they gave birth to, but in Austria the public's knowledge of the names of the Fritzl victims, and more importantly the details of the circumstances in which they came to be abused, has not led to their needing protection, but has instead brought much support, sympathy and understanding.Understanding not just of their specific needs, but also understanding about how to prevent similar cases from happening in the future.Of course I appreciate that there is likely to be a (hopefully) public inquiry – and indeed the Sheffield Brightside MP, David Blunkett, has called for such an inquiry in today's press, but should we not start also start to question how the covert nature of an appalling, abusive man is being replicated by the covert nature of our court's secrecy?
