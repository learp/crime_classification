A 37-year-old man has been arrested over the death of a widow whose handbag containing her husband's ashes was stolen by muggers. Nellie Geraghty, 79, suffered serious head injuries as she tried to cling on to her bag during the attack in Oldham, Greater Manchester, last month. She died in hospital almost a week later. The bag, which contained the ashes of her husband Frank, who died 17 years ago, was missing when Geraghty was discovered. The bag strap was in her hand. The ashes have not been found. Two teenage boys arrested in connection with the death have been bailed until 9 January.
