Almost one in 15 senior police officers in England and Wales is being investigated over criminal or disciplinary offences, The Observer can reveal. The Police Superintendents' Association (PSA) said that 100 of its members are under investigation for claims ranging from high-level corruption to harassment.In some inquiries as many as five superintendents are being investigated by other police officers over criminal or disciplinary matters. By comparison, less than 1 per cent of the population is under investigation at any one time by the police.Tom Moran, professional standards co-ordinator for the PSA, said: 'Around 100 are under investigation. That is still too many and there are still serious issues, but the situation has improved over the last five years.'Among the cases being examined by independent police investigators include claims that senior officers failed to prevent the fatal shooting of a middle-aged couple in Lincolnshire. Another involves allegations against four superintendents in a sex discrimination dispute.Senior officers claim that criminals often level charges against officers in an attempt to throw doubt on their own guilt. Moran, a former detective chief superintendent of West Yorkshire Police, added that one of the reasons for the high volume was that complaints were often aimed at superintendent level. A new independent panel examining conduct among superintendents is due to be introduced.
