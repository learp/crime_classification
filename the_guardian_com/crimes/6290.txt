A 26-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering the heavily pregnant teenager Nikitta Grender.The body of the 19-year-old was discovered at her burnt-out flat in Broadmead Park, Liswerry, Newport, south Wales, on Saturday. She had been stabbed twice before her home was set on fire.There has been huge anger on the tightly-knit estate over the killing and talk of reprisals from vigilantes. Announcing the arrest, Gwent police said the suspect was a Newport man, but also revealed that he was not from Broadmead Park or surrounding areas.Police refused to confirm whether the arrested man was known to Grender and her boyfriend, Ryan Mayes.In a statement, the police said: "Officers investigating the murder of 19-year-old Nikitta Grender have arrested a 26-year-old man from the Newport area on suspicion of murder. He is currently in custody."Searches are continuing in and around the estate. Officers are searching six premises across the city â€¦ house-to-house inquiries are continuing and forensic analysis is also continuing."Grender was due to give birth in two weeks to a baby girl who had already been named Kelsey-May. She had moved to the flat with Mayes about six months ago, and the couple had decorated a room in preparation for the baby.Detective Superintendent Geoff Ronayne said: "We are continuing to appeal for information from the communities of Broadmead Park, Moorland Park and Pontfaen, specifically for private CCTV outside their addresses, which could be really helpful to the investigation. We also want any friends of Nikitta's, or anyone who has been to her flat, to contact us."
