The Moors child murderer Ian Brady has ended 40 years of ignoring letters from the mother of one of his victims by sending her his first reply since he and his accomplice, Myra Hindley, were jailed for life in 1966.The unexpected move by the killer who is detained for psychiatric reasons at Ashworth high security hospital near Liverpool may lead to renewed police attempts to find the body of Keith Bennett, who was 12 when he disappeared from his home in Longsight, Manchester, in 1964.Keith's remains are the only ones not to have been recovered during four decades of post-trial inquiries into the fate of Brady and Hindley's five victims. Bennett's mother, Winnie Johnson, who is 72 and has frequently appealed for Brady's help in finding the boy's body, said yesterday she had been shocked and upset to finally hear from him.Covering two pages and addressed "Dear Mrs Bennett," the letter is dated December 21 last year. Mrs Johnson said much of it consisted of complaints about the force-feeding which has kept Brady alive for six years, but there were references to the clarity of his recollections of events in the 1960s.Mrs Johnson said that there was no direct reference to her son or any claim that he could lead investigators to the grave."It was a shock to me. He knows lots more than what he is saying," she said. "He's admitted [to other people] he can take police to within 20 yards of where he buried Keith, so that man's not insane. It's a human life that's gone 41 years ago, and I have had hell since Keith has been gone."The junior Home Office minister Fiona McTaggart will be briefed on the letter when she visits Manchester next month to discuss the latest police review of the case. A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said the inquiry was continuing but Brady, 68, had refused to meet officers when they attempted discussions with him three years ago.
