A teacher will serve at least 22 years in jail for murdering his fiancee and then blackening her reputation with a series of lying excuses.A judge insisted that the parole board would have to account for Andrew Lindo's "extraordinary cunning" in any application for parole from a life sentence.The 29-year-old showed no emotion as Mr Justice Andrew Smith accused him of a catalogue of heartless deceptions and lack of remorse. The judge said he had been ruthless, cruel and chilling, not only in strangling, battering and stabbing Marie Stewart last December, but in leading a double life and trying to escape the consequences when it fell apart.A jury at Bradford crown court took less than an hour to reject Lindo's claim that he had lost control over Stewart's supposed mistreatment of their young daughter, who was sleeping upstairs at the time of the murder.Smith said: "Your allegations reached new depths in accusing her of mistreating her own daughter. I am sure that this was without truth and that it was a deliberate and despicable fiction."Stewart, who left her husband for Lindo after meeting him at Huddersfield University, where he was studying music, was described by friends and neighbours as a devoted mother. She worked with disabled children.Smith said: "I cannot tell why you killed Marie Stewart â€“ still less why you killed her so brutally, or whether there was a motive and, if so, what it was. But I do not accept that you were provoked or suffering prolonged stress. And that evening you faced a crisis in the double life that you were leading."The trial heard that Lindo's philandering had led to a string of affairs with women whom he charmed and misled into believing he was a single parent. Witnesses said he removed all traces of Stewart from their house during assignations before the murder, making out that it was a bachelor pad.But suspicions grew when two teaching colleagues confronted him after discovering he was conducting supposedly exclusive affairs with both of them. The murder came as he was straining to pull off the same deception with his latest target, Angela Rylance, who was due to call that evening.Smith told Lindo, who hid Stewart's body in a suitcase in their garage: "Within minutes of the killing you were cool and calculating enough to send Angela Rylance a text message assuring her that you would collect her to bring her home."The murderer then comforted his children and launched a new lie, that Stewart had left them, backing this up with fake posts on Facebook and her mobile's messaging service.He admitted manslaughter but did not give evidence. Instead the court heard his claims of losing control in statements to detectives after Stewart's body was found in the garage on 13 February this year.The judge praised the behaviour of Stewart's family as "truly moving" but told Lindo: "The dignity and restraint that they have shown during this trial cannot disguise the enormity of what you inflicted upon them."Speaking after the sentence hearing, Detective Superintendant Dick Nuttall, who led the inquiry, said Lindo's behaviour had caused "revulsion" among experienced officers.He said Lindo had wept "crocodile tears" when interviewed by police and that the murder had been "a series of assaults which began in the bedroom and continued down three floors, ending up with Marie's body callously consigned to a bag in the garage".Samantha Davidson, reviewing lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service in Yorkshire and the Humber, said: "Lindo forced Marie's family and friends to endure a trial, but the jury saw through his lies. Our thoughts are with Marie's family and friends and we hope that this verdict can bring them some measure of closure."
