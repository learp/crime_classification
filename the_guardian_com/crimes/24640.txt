Four police officers have been sacked after they admitted sharing a racist joke by text message.Greater Manchester police took the decision after one of the officers showed it to an inspector, who reported it to his senior colleagues.A 10-month internal investigation was held and the four were dismissed following a disciplinary tribunal at the force's headquarters.The men, two of whom are 41 while the others are 31 and 38, are the first serving officers to be dismissed because of an offensive text message. Three of the officers were based in Salford and the other was at a station in south Manchester.They admitted at the tribunal either sending, receiving or showing the text message to colleagues from their private mobile telephones. After the incident came to light, in September last year, two of the officers were immediately removed from frontline duties.A spokeswoman for the force refused to release details of the message, but said it contained "offensive racist terminology".The four sacked officers have a fortnight to request a review of the case with the force's chief constable, Michael Todd. If the tribunal's decision is upheld, they can take the case to an independent police appeals tribunal.
