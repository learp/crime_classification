Detectives investigating the brutal murder of a Saudi Arabian student in Essex have released from custody a man arrested in connection with the attack.The 52-year-old man, who was arrested and questioned over the murder on Tuesday night, was "positively eliminated" from the investigation and released late on Thursday, Essex police said.The development means the killer of Nahid Almanea, 31, is still on the loose.Detectives are investigating whether Almanea, a Saudi Arabian national who only arrived in Britain in January to begin her University of Essex degree, was targeted because her full-length robes and hijab headscarf marked her out as a Muslim.Almanea was ambushed and stabbed 16 times in the face, body, neck and arms as she walked alone to university on a secluded footpath in Colchester on Tuesday morning.Police have declined to rule out a connection between the attack near the university and the killing of James Attfield, 33, stabbed more than 100 times in nearby Colchester Castle park in March.DCS Steve Worron, of Essex police, said at a press conference earlier this week that there were obvious similarities between the murders of Almanea and Attfield."It is extremely unusual to see an attack of this type," he said. "We remain open-minded as to the profile of the offender or offenders, and we remain open-minded as to whether or not the two murder investigations would be linked."The murders were being treated as "separate but parallel" investigations, he added.Ch Insp Richard Phillibrown has appealed to people in Colchester to remain vigilant until police have enough evidence to arrest the killer. "It's true we've had two knife murders in Colchester in recent months where the motive remains unknown and I would urge anyone to remain vigilant," he said."It is important that people are aware of their own surroundings, that they don't go out alone in isolated places, that they take precautions."This murder is an attack on the whole community of Colchester and it's important we all pull together."
