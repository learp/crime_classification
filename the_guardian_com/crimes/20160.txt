A partial climbdown over a ban on prosecution material being handed to the press was announced by the Crown Prosecution Service last night.The CPS issued guidelines last month which barred the public from seeing photos and video footage of criminals at work, and prevented other material, such as interview transcripts, being made public. Last night it said some material would remain subject to "consideration" before it could be released. But "non-contentious" prosecution evidence could be released to the media once it had been shown to a jury or at the end of a trial. Material which will require consideration includes: · CCTV footage of a defendant which has been viewed by the jury and public in court, especially where it shows a defendant and/or a victim shortly before or during the crime; · Video and audio tapes of police interviews with defendants, victims and witnesses; · Victim, psychiatric or medical statements. Material which may usually be released includes: · Maps, diagrams and photographs, including "mug shots"; · Videos showing the scene of the crime after the event; · Videos of seized property, such as weapons and drugs; · Sections of interview transcripts or statements as read out in court, unless subject to reporting restrictions; · Videos or photos showing reconstructions of the crime.
