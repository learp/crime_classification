A photograph of Barry George holding a gun and wearing a military respirator, above, was shown to the Old Bailey jury hearing the retrial of the man accused of killing Jill Dando yesterday.The gun was found at George's home in Fulham, London, after his arrest in 2000, the jury was told. The gun was of a type which, if converted, could have been used to kill Dando, the prosecution said. George, who denies murder, claimed to police that the gun in the picture was a replica, although he said it was capable of firing blanks.He was said to be obsessed with guns and the military, the prosecution said. He was said to have shown residents at a hostel a replica Heckler and Koch machine gun as well as another gun.George ordered "a number of items of military equipment" in April 1999, just two weeks before Dando was shot dead, the jury was told.The hearing continues.
