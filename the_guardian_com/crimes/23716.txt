Conservationists accused police chiefs of pushing crimes against wildlife "to the back of the queue" today.More than 100 organisations, led by the RSPB, called for a review of how police protect the nation's rare animals and plants.They said a lack of agreed standards across forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has led to an inconsistent approach.A shortage of specialist officers and the low priority given to wildlife crimes means criminals can break the law with little fear of getting caught. Ian West, head of investigations at the RSPB, said the review should be led by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).He said: "Strong laws to protect our wildlife are a sign of a civilised society, but they are only of value if properly enforced."Wildlife crime was targeted in October 2006 with the formation of the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU). It gathers information about wildlife crime and supports police forces and customs officers across Britain. ."The NWCU has listed priorities for wildlife crime enforcement in the UK, including the killing and persecution of birds of prey. Yet, in parts of the English uplands and on the edges of some towns and cities, bird of prey persecution continues at unacceptably high levels."There are many competing demands on our police, but wildlife crime is all too often pushed to the back of the queue," he added.Based in East Lothian, the NWCU's most high-profile priority is protecting rare and endangered species such as birds of prey. Members also work to safeguard badgers, fish and hares from baiting, poaching and hunting.Lesser known priorities include protecting roosting bats and identifying people who steal and damage fresh water pearl mussels.In June, an annual report revealed just nine people are manning the unit after bosses were unable to secure permanent funding. They have been swamped with tip-offs and other information from police forces, local authorities and charities.The number of offenders monitored by the unit continued to grow with 1,503 recorded in the last financial year, an increase of 161 on the previous 12 months.Senior members said they are struggling to counter the surge in sales of endangered species on the internet.Paul Wilkinson, of The Wildlife Trusts, said: "It is important that we achieve much greater clarity and rigour in our approach to wildlife crime. The current uncertainty around what constitutes a wildlife crime is surely unacceptable. This grey area helps those who commit wildlife crimes and puts the enforcement agencies, and wildlife itself, at a disadvantage."
