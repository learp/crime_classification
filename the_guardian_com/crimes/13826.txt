Prosecutors have been accused of behaving "ludicrously" by concealing the cause of a miscarriage of justice in which an undercover police officer is alleged to have used his fake identity in court to hide his covert infiltration.Prosecutors have agreed that an environmental campaigner's conviction for assaulting a police officer should be quashed but are refusing to explain why.Lawyers for the campaigner and three media organisations – the Guardian, BBC's Newsnight and the Press Association – are taking legal action to compel prosecutors to give an explanation.On Monday at Southwark crown court in London, His Honour Judge McCreath, who said he had "considerable concerns" about the case, that he did not spell out, decided that prosecutors be granted a private hearing in which they can seek to justify the need to keep secret the reason for the miscarriage of justice.The judge added that he had a "profound distaste" for excluding the public from court hearings, but there was no other option.Matthew Ryder, the QC for environmental campaigner John Jordan, said the actions of the prosecutors were "bordering on farce", following revelations that one of Jordan's co-defendants was an undercover policeman who allegedly gave false evidence on oath.The undercover policeman, Jim Boyling, spent five years pretending to be an environmental and animal rights campaigner in the 1990s. During his deployment, he was prosecuted alongside Jordan and other cycling protesters following disorder at a demonstration. However, it is alleged that Boyling claimed in court that he was Jim Sutton, a cleaner from east London, to keep secret his covert infiltration of the campaigners.Fourteen years after Jordan was convicted, Boyling's undercover role and alleged use of his fictitious identity in the prosecution were uncovered by campaigners and their lawyers.Ryder told the hearing on Monday: "Everybody knows that Jim Boyling was Jim Sutton. Everybody knows that Jim Boyling was a police officer."Criticising the position of the prosecutors, the QC added: "It is ludicrous to suggest that it's a mystery." He added that the Metropolitan Police had admitted that he was an officer.Tom Little, for the crown, told the court that prosecutors were "maintaining the well-established principle of neither confirming nor denying whether Jim Sutton was an undercover police officer". He added that there was no legal power to compel prosecutors to give any reasons to explain why they had decided not to oppose the overturning of Jordan's conviction. He successfully asked the judge to grant prosecutors a private hearing to argue the case for secrecy in what he said was an "exceptional" case.The prosecutor had been challenged by the judge, who noted that if the public were not told the reasons for the unsafe conviction, "what kind of justice is that?', adding that a cardinal principle of the legal system was that judicial decisions were explained to the public.Guy Vassall-Adams, barrister for the media organisations, said this was "not an isolated case" as other convictions of political campaigners had been quashed after prosecutors and police had admitted they had concealed vital evidence gathered by undercover police officer Mark Kennedy.He added that there was a pattern of "systemic failure" emerging.In the original prosecution in 1997, Boyling, who was acquitted, had been among a group of protesters who had occupied a government building and cycled slowly around Trafalgar Square in support of striking Tube workers.
