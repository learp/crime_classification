EastEnders soap character Sam Mitchell has been charged with murder and remanded in custody. The question of her guilt is of course sub-judice, but viewers may have been cheered by the ease with which Sam maintained her family ties during the ordeal.Since her internment, Sam has been constantly ringing cousin Billy, who is a regular visitor. Sam's mum, Peggy, was in Spain when the arrest took place. Upon hearing the news, Peggy hopped on a plane and rushed straight to the slammer for a tearful reunion. The scriptwriters clearly think that visiting a prison is as easy as popping to the local shops.Here's the real script: Sam waits at least a week to get a phonecard; her family wait an average of around three hours to book a visit (prison inspectors once spent 25 hours getting through to a jail, and some prisons have an average waiting time of a fortnight to see an unconvicted prisoner). Billy slams the phone down in anger.Facts: many prisoners - including remands - are held in jails many miles from their homes. Action For Prisoners Families says two-thirds of their helpline calls concern problems with visits. The prison service has targets for every issue under the sun, but has no targets for visits.Thousands of prisoners and their families watch EastEnders. The scriptwriters should stop winding these people up. That's the Home Office's job.Â· Eric Allison is the Guardian's prisons correspondent.
