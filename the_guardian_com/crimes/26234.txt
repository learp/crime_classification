The Northern Ireland police ombudsman has been called in to investigate the murder of Sunday World journalist Martin O'Hagan.The move comes after the public prosecution service (PPS) said it was no longer in a position to review the reduced jail term handed down to a loyalist supergrass, Neil Hyde, who had agreed to name the people responsible for the shooting.In a statement the PPS said its director, Barra McGrory QC, was exercising his powers to refer the murder case to the ombudsman.O'Hagan, 51, was shot dead as he walked home from a night out with his wife in Lurgan in September 2001. He had previously received death threats. The National Union of Journalists has given a guarded welcome to the announcement. The union says the circumstances that have led to the review are "deeply disturbing" and highlight major defects in the original investigation and are a cause for public concern.No one has ever been convicted of O'Hagan's murder. Irish NUJ secretary Seamus Dooley said the announcement about the reference to the ombudsman was "a depressing reminder of the failure of the police to investigate properly and impartially the murder of Martin O!Hagan".He said: "A deal was done with Neil Hyde and he received a three-year prison sentence in February 2012 for a range of of offences. The judge made it clear that he would have received an 18-year sentence if he had not agreed to identify those involved in the murder of Martin O'Hagan."It subsequently emerged that his uncorroborated evidence was not sufficient to secure the conviction of suspects. The PPS now says there is no basis to refer Hyde's sentence back to the court. "The 75% reduction in his sentence for his co-operation will not be reversed and we are still waiting for justice for Martin."Sources: Belfast Newsletter/NUJ
