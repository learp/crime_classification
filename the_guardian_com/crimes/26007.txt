There are no longer any terror suspects subjected to special prevention and investigation measures after the system which replaced control orders has been allowed to wither on the vine.Theresa May, the home secretary, has confirmed to MPs that there is currently nobody subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measures notice (Tpim) with the last one allowed to lapse on February 10.David Anderson, QC, the official terror laws watchdog, blamed the lack of use of Tpims on the ending of a power to relocate suspects away from their home area, often London, and the political and media fallout from two high profile abscondments. In one case a terror suspect simply disappeared by hailing a taxi in Camden Town, north London. The second slipped his surveillance by disguising himself in a burka and vanishing.Anderson said that since the new regime had replaced control orders in January 2012, there had been 10 people subject to Tpims: "All are men believed to have been involved in al-Qaida related terrorism, some at the highest end of seriousness, including the planning of credible mass casualty attacks."He said in his annual report on the operation of the Tpim restrictions, which can include overnight residency requirements and controls on movements, contacts and communications, that the orders on 7 out of the 10 had expired after reaching their two-year limit. Two of the other three suspects had absconded and one was in prison.Anderson said that Tpims had been effective in disrupting terrorist networks and preventing terrorism but had been no more successful than control orders as an investigative measure."Intelligence on Tpim subjects is not leading to prosecution (save in respect of Tpim breaches, where the conviction rate is low)," said Anderson.He said that the system had been described as being 'allowed to wither on the vine' since no new Tpims had been imposed since 2012.He said their use had been considered in several dozen terrorist cases in 2012/13 but it was decided not to use them because the authorities were able to convict and deport those involved instead.However, he added that the lack of use may also be consequence of the ending of powers to relocate suspects outside of their home area which, he says, has made it easier for them to keep in touch with their local networks and may have made it easier for them to abscond.He said the political and media fallout from the high-profile abscond cases had led to extra burdens on those responsible for enforcing the remaining Tpim notices and they also contributed to a sense of powerlessness, and even a 'dangerous' perception that 'those who want to abscond will'.Anderson says that Tpims or similar measures should be retained because, when properly deployed, they are a useful means of disrupting potentially dangerous terrorists for up to two years."There is no need to put the clock back. The majority of changes introduced by the Tpims Act have civilised the control order system without making it less effective," he says in his annual report. "The two-year limit is a reminder that executive constraints of this kind are no substitute for the criminal process, and no long-term solution."He does, however, recommend to the home secretary that the power to relocate a suspect to a new area two or three hours away from their home should be restored and the power to impose exclusion zones extended.
