The rocketing costs of legal aid for criminal and asylum cases are threatening the survival of the civil aid scheme which helps the poor and vulnerable with debt, housing, family and other legal problems, a committee of MPs said yesterday.Too much had been squeezed out of the budget for criminal and asylum work, said a report by the Commons constitutional affairs committee.Low rates of pay were driving young lawyers out of legal aid work, creating one of the most serious threats to its survival."There is a significant danger that the system will not survive if urgent efforts are not made to recruit young entrants into legal aid work.," the report said.Burdened by student debt, young lawyers were concentrating on commercial work to enable them to pay off loans.Alan Beith, the chairman of the committee, said restrictions on the civil legal aid budget meant many people were being denied access to justice."Civil legal aid has become the Cinderella of the government's services to address social exclusion and poverty. Eligibility, scope and funding are increasingly restrictive. This process has now gone too far," he said.The report called on the government to ringfence the civil legal aid budget to rescue it from the pressure of the budget for criminal legal aid.The MPs said it was "unacceptable" that fewer people were now being helped by civil legal aid, spending on which has dropped from £564m in 1999/2000 to £483m in 2002/2003, while the cost of criminal legal aid had soared.Growing numbers of solicitors were dropping out of legal aid work, citing low pay and the auditing system of cost control which they say ties them up in red tape. The MPs said the auditing process was "wasteful and self-defeating" with "little relation to quality".Legal aid, originally set up to help people of "small or moderate means", was increasingly being restricted "to people of no means at all", said the report. There was a danger that people of modest means who happened to be homeowners would fall out of legal aid altogether.The Department for Constitutional Affairs said measures had been introduced to target expenditure on the most needy.
