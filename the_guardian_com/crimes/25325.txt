A mother was jailed for 10 years today for smothering her three-year-old son to death with a pillow.Tara Haigh, 24, was found guilty, by a 10-2 majority, of murdering Billy at their home in Guildford, Surrey, in November 2005. She was jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years.The Old Bailey was told she was trying to find a boyfriend online within hours of suffocating the boy.After attempts to resuscitate him in hospital failed, Haigh went to her parents' home.Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said: "An examination of the computer showed that within a few hours of her son's death, she was accessing messages sent to her by men on the website Girls Date Free."She even arranged a date with one man, posting a message on the website saying her son had died from a tumour behind the ear.Howes told the court Billy was on the local social services at risk register for neglect.Haigh had learning difficulties and Billy's father was in prison at the time for assaulting her. She told medical staff she put the boy to bed but found him collapsed when she checked on him.On a previous occasion in January that year, an ambulance had been called to a previous address where Billy and his parents were living.The caller said Billy had stopped breathing, but he was found to be fit and well. He was later seen by a specialist, who could find nothing wrong with him.Judge Peter Thornton QC said it was not clear why Haigh had killed Billy. He told her: "Billy was a well and happy child whose life was cruelly taken away from him. You killed your son, a vulnerable child in your care and protection."You were, I accept, a good and loving parent doing the best you could. There was no accusation of cruelty and losing your child, all be it by your own hand, must have been a punishment for you."The circumstances of Billy's death do not bear thinking about. He would have struggled for his life, fighting against his mother whom he had loved and trusted, until he was overpowered by your superior strength and will."
