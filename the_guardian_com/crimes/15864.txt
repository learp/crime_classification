Police are hunting two young men who stabbed a train inspector in the back after he challenged them for not having tickets.The 42-year-old needed three stitches after the attack on board a train from Southend, Essex, to London's Fenchurch Street on Friday evening.Police released CCTV images of the attacks â€“ both white and aged in their late teens. One wore a black hooded top, the second a grey flat cap and a grey top.The ticket inspector was said to be in a stable condition after treatment in hospital. He was expected to be discharged later on Saturday.Paul Brogden, British Transport police chief superintendent, condemned the incident and appealed for witnesses to come forward."This was an appalling and disgraceful attack on a man who was simply doing his job and who had quite rightly asked the men to leave the train," he said.Julian Drury, managing director of the train's operator C2C, said he deplored the attack. "Thankfully incidents of this nature are extremely rare and maximum efforts are being made to identify the suspects," he said.Bob Crow, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: "The perpetrators of this vicious and cowardly assault must be caught and the authorities need to show that those who attack public service workers will be severely punished."
