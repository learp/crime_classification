Raoul Moat, the fugitive who shot himself dead early today in a standoff with police, may have used a network of underground storm drains to evade capture.A construction worker who worked on the installation of the drains system in the Northumberland village of Rothbury, where Moat is believed to have hidden over the past six days, said the gunman could have spent hours beneath the feet of officers hunting for him.The builder, who would only give his name as Jason, said the circular pipes are big enough for a man of Moat's stature. The pipes may also have shielded him from heat detectors used by police during the manhunt, he added."He could have made his way up from the riverbank to the main street using the pipes," said Jason."They are round pipes which lead to the river, they're not very long. He could crouch down and get through there."He may have come out of a manhole cover near to the main street. A man of his size could have easily pushed the lid off with his shoulder."The storm drains, which run under the main street of the village and out to the riverbank, were updated by Jason and his colleagues last year after severe floods swept the village in September 2008.Having evaded capture for almost a week, Moat was surrounded by armed snipers in Rothbury for six hours last night while he pointed a shotgun at his own neck.He was wanted over the shooting of his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and the fatal shooting of her partner, Chris Brown, last Saturday, followed by the shooting of PC David Rathband on Sunday.At 1.10am a single gunshot was heard at the scene of the standoff and officers were reported to have surrounded Moat and jumped on him. In a statement, the police said "no shots were fired by police officers" and it "appears the suspect shot himself".Apart from the site of the shooting, most police attention today was focussed on the large storm drain, or culvert, which threads under the centre of Rothbury, helping relieve the River Coquet after heavy rain.Police are not confirming whether Moat knew of it from his frequent visits to the town as a child but it is on their list of possible hideouts used by the gunman during the six days he spent in Rothbury or nearby.
