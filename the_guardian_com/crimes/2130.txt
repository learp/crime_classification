   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest "Not me, guv; it's my brain wot done it" is akin to proclaiming that I didn't shoot the sheriff, but the bullets did ('My brain made me do it …' US defendants turn to science to try to explain crimes, 11 November).Of course, the very possibility of moral responsibility may be questioned. All actions result from neurological changes which themselves result from chains of prior causes or even indeterminancies.
