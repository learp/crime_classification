Canterbury police have found the body of a woman in a flat after police shot a man in a supermarket in the city.Officers fired at the man at 8.40pm yesterday after being called to the Morrisons supermarket in Ten Perch Road, near the centre of Canterbury.A man was arrested and taken to hospital with a gunshot wound to the arm. Kent police are waiting for him to be treated before he can be questioned.Police said later they had recovered a semi-automatic air-powered BB pistol, which fires small ballbearings and is intended for target shooting.In the early hours of this morning police found the body of a woman in a flat about half a mile away. A police spokesman said: "The death is being treated as suspicious and police are carrying out a forensic examination at the address in Victoria Street."Detectives are waiting to question a man who is currently in hospital receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the arm."A shopper who was in the store at the time said she saw a man, reported to be aged 32, who was unkempt and apparently drunk, holding what looked like a handgun under the sleeve of his coat."I thought it was a toy gun because you don't expect someone to be walking round carrying a real gun in a supermarket," said Pamela Elvidge."We went to pay for our shopping and then went to the cigarette aisle and then there was this almighty gunshot sound, and then the staff all told us to get out of the shop."I heard just the one shot but it was quite loud. We all went out into the car park but we couldn't leave."The area where the woman's body was found was described by neighbours as having a significant transient population, with many living in bedsits.The landlord of the building where she lived, Kulvinder Singh Dosanjh, 55, said the victim was east European and had initially lived in a first-floor bedsit with her husband and daughter. Another man had moved in about six months ago when the marriage broke up."There were a number of problems between them," he said of the newer relationship. "Two weeks ago he damaged a wall outside the room â€“ they said he was drunk."The Independent Police Complaints Commission announced an investigation into the shooting, as is routine in such cases. It said later that given the circumstances, this would be continued locally by the Kent police professional standards department.
