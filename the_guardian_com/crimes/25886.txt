I was surprised to be informed (The foul reign of the biological clock, 10 May) that 1.5 is “the number of children the average American woman had in 1976”. At a rough estimate this means 120 million children were born in 1976. There’s an old joke about an American asking “Do you have children?”, and a British person answering “Not if I can help it.” But it’s not apparently a distinction that your editors are aware of.Vivian CookColchester• The case for a universal national DNA database has once again been made by the case of Melanie Road, killed over 30 years ago, but whose murder has only recently been solved following the fluke sampling of the killer’s daughter’s DNA after she was arrested for criminal damage (Report, 10 May). Of course a compulsory DNA database invades individual privacy but, provided there are adequate safeguards, I believe it is a price well worth paying to remedy the gross inadequacies in the justice system.Benedict BirnbergLondon• Mea culpa, Jenny Brook (Letters, 10 May). Straining for effect as I was, I used words which I would never have applied to my clients over 48 years of practice (“jail fodder”, “nuisance value”). Prisoners are flawed human beings as are we all, striving like us given half a chance to forge out a meaningful life. My essential message, though, remains intact.Malcolm FowlerSolicitor and higher court advocate, Tipton, West Midlands• Your fashion feature (Hot style hacks, G2, 9 May) says “Take a hard look at last summer’s shoes. Do you have a pair of leather gladiator sandals? They’ll work for another summer, won’t they? Sorry, no. Absolutely not.” I see “Keep it in the ground” has died the death.Melinda DraytonHalifax• The king who died at Bosworth was Norman, not English (Letters, 9 May). The last English king was Harold Godwinson. The last one with a legitimate claim to the throne was probably Edward the Confessor.Rodney SmithChapelton, South Lanarkshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
