Detectives hunting the killer of Jodi Jones today said that they have received reports of the first possible sightings of the teenager on the night she died.Her body was discovered by a wooded path near her home on the outskirts of Dalkeith, Midlothian, 16 days ago.Two independent witnesses have now contacted police about seeing a girl who fits Jodi's description on Monday June 30.They also told officers they saw a man walking closely behind the girl along Easthouses Road, towards the entrance to a path where Jodi's body was later found.One witness said they had seen the same person on the night of a police reconstruction a week later.Detectives are eager to trace the man, who they say could be a key witness in the investigation.Detective Inspector Tom Martin, one of the lead officers in the case, said: "This information is important, and it is very helpful that we have two independent witnesses who saw a girl fitting Jodi's description at a time when we might have expected Jodi to be in that area."The man seen walking behind this girl could be a crucial witness, and was seen again a week later meeting two friends."Who is this man? Do you recognise the description? Could it be you and your friends?"If you think you know who any of these people may be, please call the police. If you think it may be you but you also think you saw nothing of importance, we still need to talk to you to help us build a complete picture of everyone who was in the area on the night Jodi was murdered."The sightings follow repeated appeals by detectives for witnesses to Jodi's last movements after she left her home in Parkhead Place, in the Easthouses area, to meet her boyfriend.The 14-year-old never returned home. Her body, which was partially clothed and had been attacked with a knife, was found by family and friends several hours later.Det Insp Martin said: "This is a significant development for the inquiry team. "Both witnesses saw the girl walking in Easthouses Road towards the entrance to the Roman Dyke pathway at around 5pm. Both also noticed a man walking closely behind the girl."The man appeared to be in his late teens or early 20s, and was wearing a dark-coloured sweatshirt top, possibly with a hood, and dark trousers, which were possibly jogging bottoms, Det Insp Martin said.According to the male witness, when police staged a reconstruction of Jodi's last movements the man was walking in Morris Road, on the way to Easthouses Road, at around 6pm.The witness saw him meet two friends who were around the same age, according to police.The friends gave each other high five-style welcoming handshakes before pulling each other into a hug.One of the young men was on a bike and wearing shorts, while the other appeared to be carrying a videotape. Both were wearing dark clothing, and the group were standing in Morris Road, just past the Morris Club.Meanwhile, officers are still trying to trace a blonde woman with a high ponytail and miniskirt who was pushing a buggy along Easthouses Road in the direction of Jodi's house on June 30.According to police, she should have passed the girl with the man following behind her.Police also want to trace the drivers of two cars parked in the turning area outside nearby Newbattle high school on that same night.Anyone with any information is asked to contact the incident room at Dalkeith Police Station on 0131 654 5576 or by e-mailing jodijonesenquirylbp.pnn.police.uk
