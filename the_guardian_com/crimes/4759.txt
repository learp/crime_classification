Tony Blair will today outline new measures to crack down on anti-social behaviour, announcing a major extension to schemes designed to force parents to rein in their yobbish children.In his first keynote speech since returning from his Caribbean holiday, the prime minister will propose that schools apply to the courts to make parents go on parenting programmes.Under the measure, parents must undergo counselling or guidance on raising their children and agree to ensure that they behave. More than 2,000 parents have already signed orders saying they will make sure their children attend school.Mr Blair's announcement comes after a summer of criticism of the government's plan to extend licensing hours, with police, local authorities and the Conservatives arguing that it will lead to an increase in binge-drinking and alcohol related anti-social behaviour.A Downing Street source said: "He will make no apology for saying the government's respect agenda is about going further to tackle anti-social behaviour."Bad parenting is not a private matter for the family which the state should ignore. It can affect us all and is one of the biggest factors in anti-social behaviour."Parenting orders, which force parents to attend parenting programmes, originally applied to the mothers and fathers of children with criminal convictions, but were extended last year to cover cases of anti-social behaviour, school exclusion and truancy.Now the government wants to apply them at an earlier stage. The source said this would allow the authorities to nip problems in the bud.Anti-social behaviour teams and housing officers will be able to apply for the measures and the government is to consider whether schools should be able to do so. The proposals will be published in a policy paper in November.The government has made it clear that its "respect agenda" is a priority for its third term, despite the security threat facing Britain and its plans for radical reform of public services.Speaking to parents and anti-social behaviour teams in south-east England, Mr Blair will say the issue is not about protecting individuals from the state, but protecting the law-abiding from the threatening actions of a minority.Parenting contracts are voluntary. But refusal to enter a contract can be used as evidence supporting an application for an order, which is compulsory. Failure to comply with an order is a criminal offence carrying a fine of up to Â£1,000.
