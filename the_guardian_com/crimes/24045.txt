Police have begun calling the owners of security boxes at the Hatton Garden safe deposit company to tell them their valuables were stolen.Flying Squad detectives have so far identified the owners of 30 boxes, but believe up to 70 boxes were raided in an audacious Easter weekend heist at the vault, which acts as a safe for many of the jewellers who operate from the heart of London’s gem district.Many other owners were still waiting to hear if their valuables – thought to includes precious gems, diamonds, gold and jewellery – had been taken or were among the boxes that had been left untampered. One deposit-box owner said he had been told that police had identified 30 boxes and were starting to ring the owners on Thursday morning. The man, who asked not to be named, said: “I think they have done 30 so far and are ringing those up. There are another 40 to do after that and it could take all day, possibly tomorrow morning as well. That is what the forensics officer told me.”The deposit-box owner – who didn’t know if he was a victim of the raids – said he had been told only people whose boxes were definitely hit would be contacted. He said: “They won’t call if there is nothing wrong because there are 600 safe boxes down there.”The man also said he understood that some of the boxes had just been tampered with in the heist, and that other items, such as documents, may have been dumped on the floor of the vault. “I suppose they have just picked what they want from the boxes. Some of the things can’t sell, so it is just gold, diamonds or cash,” he said.The man, who has offices in the building above the vault, said people were present on Friday and would have heard the thieves if they were still at work. Another client who was waiting for news said: “We still know nothing. I just wish they would put us out of our misery.”
