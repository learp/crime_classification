A female police constable punched a mother in the frozen food aisle of a supermarket after her police officer boyfriend was accused of eyeing up the woman, a court heard yesterday.PC Carla Street, 34, of Stretford, Greater Manchester, was said to have gone "mad" as she hit Kelly Osborne, 28, who was shopping with her partner and their two-year-old son in the Asda superstore at Trafford Park, Greater Manchester, last July.Rochdale magistrates court heard the alleged assault happened after an argument between Miss Street's partner, PC Lee Gregory, and Miss Osborne's partner, Kevin Reid. Miss Street denies common assault. Miss Osborne's injuries included a bruised eye and swelling to the head.She told the court yesterday that Mr Gregory, also 28, had been looking at her in a "sexual way" while pushing an empty trolley. She said: "He was looking me up and down. He was making me nervous because I had my partner and child with me and I wasn't looking to find a boyfriend ... I got to the freezer aisle. I saw him again - I turned to my partner and said I was going upstairs." She returned a few minutes later and found Mr Gregory arguing with her partner, Mr Reid, 33."Mr Reid had been made aware of what he [Lee Gregory] was doing," said Roderick Priestley, prosecuting. "He approached Mr Gregory and asked what his problem was and a verbal argument began between the two." Initially Miss Street had walked away from the argument, but she returned and her involvement was allegedly verbal and physical."She launched an unprovoked attack on Miss Osborne. Witnesses describe her calling Miss Osborne a bitch," Mr Priestley said. But Martin Pizzey, defending, said Miss Osborne was the aggressor. "Someone looked at you with a friendly smile and nothing more," he said. "It was you that went mad ... lashed out and security guards had to pull you back."The case continues.
