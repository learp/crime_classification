The home secretary, David Blunkett, today told Britain's police chiefs that the public had to play a greater role in tackling crime.Mr Blunkett said communities should not "grumble" about the problems of drug dealers and antisocial behaviour affecting their communities, but instead see themselves being as in partnership with the police. Although police forces have new powers to close down drug dens, impose curfews and temporarily shut pubs that are notorious for public disorder, Mr Blunkett said people had to take responsibility for reclaiming their neighbourhoods from criminals. Addressing the Association of Chief Police Officers' annual conference in Birmingham, Mr Blunkett said: "The days have gone when we could blame someone else."The home secretary was discussing the challenges facing policing in the 21st century, and stressed that organised crime posed particular problems.Mr Blunkett told delegates that police forces faced the challenge of employing new legal powers and technology to reduce crime, but said this had to be "matched by a response from the community". He said communities must overcome the "breakdown of respect, a breakdown in the culture of belonging". "It is no longer a matter for the police alone," he said. Earlier, Mr Blunkett, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, spoke about how antisocial behaviour laws could improve life in communities. He also warned that pubs and clubs allowing persistent binge drinking would face overnight closure.Defending plans to relax licensing laws, Mr Blunkett said that turning thousands of drinkers onto the streets at the same time created a "very major public order issue". Speaking prior to the home secretary's address, the Acpo president, Chris Fox, said: "The police service has achieved a lot in recent years ... this conference will give us time to reflect on these issues and turn thoughts into real policing actions in neighbourhoods around Britain."
