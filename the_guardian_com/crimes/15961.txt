Dear John,I was amazed to hear of your appointment as adviser to the PM on crime. Although we have known each other somewhat for three decades, I had no idea of your interest or knowledge in this field. Perhaps you are coming to it fresh.Many would regard that as a liability. On the other hand, the current inspector of prisons, David Ramsbotham (a distinguished soldier), was appointed for his lack of knowledge. So too was his predecessor, Stephen Tumim, a civil court judge, and Lord Woolf, the current lord chief justice, author of the Woolf report on prisons, another civil judge. All were so outraged by what they saw when they visited prisons, they became radical reformers. Perhaps that will happen to you. By coming fresh to this field, you will also bring with you the expensively learnt lessons of management consultants during your time at the BBC. Having spent two years filming McKinsey's and others, I know how comfortable they are at reviewing their client's business and recommending changes without prior knowledge. They argue that this apparent weakness is in fact a strength, as they are not trapped in the blinkered culture that resists change. Of course one problem you will face at once is the question: who is the client? Is it the government - currently under fire? Is it the community - such as the frustrated residents of estates where crime really is high? Or is it the media and politicians, who wrongly imagine that the crude language, numbers and solutions they toss around have a bearing on the complex and often intractable problems that make up the causes and patterns of crime? There is no magic bullet, though there are things which can work. I hope you will be able to bring to bear the McKinsey techniques of talking extensively to people at all levels of the system - most particularly victims and offenders. You will hear how being a victim increases your chance of victimisation. And that most persistent offenders already think that sentences are longer than they are - and yet still offend. To them the courts and prison are just a game, or occupational hazard. Your goal must be to increase victim satisfaction while reducing offender criminal productivity. This may involve organisational reform around new principles - indeed your biggest shock may be learning that there are no guiding principles in the justice system, and the customers are seen as the judges and lawyers. Having looked at the evidence, and braindumped what you found with colleagues, you come up with a view of what works and what needs to be abandoned or changed. In policing, this is known as problem-oriented policing (Pop) and has worked wonders both here and in America. Instead of just pouring more officers on to the streets, they are targeted at known offenders, and hotspots - areas and times of day when offending is occurring - such as Friday night outside certain pubs at closing time. It leads to imaginative partnerships and civil actions, such as making the landlord liable for violence outside his pub. But Pop (I know you like acronyms) soon leads you to the bit which politicians find hardest to accept: that the causes and predictors of persistent offending have nothing to do with the justice system. They involve poor housing and frequent moves, domestic violence and child abuse, drug and alcohol problems, unemployment, poor physical and mental health, learning problems, school failure and exclusion, and harsh and erratic parenting. To speak to those factors, you need a radical reorganisation of their job description that consultants are famous for - such as combining radio and television news. When you look at the market research, like all good consultants you will find a meta-analysis by Mark Lipsey of Vanderbilt of 40,000 young offenders. He found that much the most effective form of rehabilitation was a job. The next most effective were high quality "multi-modal" programmes (I know you don't mind jargon) tailored for the offender's specific problems. Then comes the hard part, assessing personnel for what McKinsey calls a skill/will rating. You must decide who has the skill to take the venture forward in its new form, and who also has the will to do this. By putting both together, you can see who to keep and promote as change agents - champions in consultant-speak - and who will be excess to requirements. Meanwhile the old, largely redundant, part of the justice business - the prison complex - still lumbers on, vacuuming up resources and hindered from following best practice in a lean and efficient way by outdated sentencing practices that overload the system. You know the sort of thing: too much throughput lowers the quality of the final product, and demoralises the staff. Of course firms call in outside consultants for a few obvious reasons: often they are in deep trouble and need to change dramatically, but don't know how to achieve it or how to tell their workforce. This government knows the answer. They just need to trust it, and get the credit for it. Yours, Roger. cc Tony Blair, Jack Straw Â• Roger Graef is a criminologist and filmaker comment@theguardian.com
