At the retrial which ended in Barry George's acquittal yesterday, the only remaining piece of forensic evidence that the prosecution claimed could link him to Jill Dando's doorstep murder was a single fibre of grey-blue polyester discovered on the raincoat worn by the presenter. The crown alleged it came from a pair of C&A trousers found at his home.Having chosen not to expose Barry George to cross-examination, his defence lawyers targeted the polyester fibre. It provided "weak support" for the case against George, prosecution lawyers maintained.But Dr Roger Robson, a former Home Office forensic scientist who runs his own consultancy, challenged the significance of the discovery, claiming the thread could have come from another sourceThe coat had been on the ground for between six and nine hours after the murder, Robson suggested. The fibre might have been dropped by anyone passing. "It could have come from the suits or trousers in Miss Dando's wardrobe or from [her fiance] Alan Farthing's wardrobe," he said. "It could have been contaminated by people walking past [on the path]."The tests carried out on the single polyester fragment were not conclusive. One gave a negative result before turning positive when the test was run a second time. Robson claimed the analysis provided no backing to the case against George. "I would not be confident in putting any weight on the fibre," he said. "I would put in my report 'insufficient tests performed'."
