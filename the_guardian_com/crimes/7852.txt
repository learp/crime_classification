Two primary school teachers have been suspended after their arrest on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children, it was revealed today.The men have been bailed "pending further investigations" following checks by the child online safety team and public protection unit of the West Midlands police force.A spokeswoman said one man, aged 43, worked at St Patrick's school in Earlswood, Solihull, and the other, who is 37, taught at Monkspath school, in the Shirley area of the town.She said: "At this stage of the inquiry there is nothing to suggest any physical contact between the suspects and the children featured in the images."The men were arrested at an address in Solihull on Wednesday and property seized there was being examined.Solihull council said both men had been suspended. It had sent letters to parents whose children attended the schools, informing them directly of the arrests and telling them where they could seek advice and support.Detective Chief Superintendent Gareth Morgan, head of West Midlands police public protection unit, said: "This is clearly a very sensitive case which will raise many questions among parents."It is an immediate priority to reassure them by providing as much information as and when we can to answer those questions. To do that effectively we will progress the investigation as thoroughly and quickly as possible and continue to engage with families and the wider community."
