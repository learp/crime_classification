Sean Mercer, the teenager convicted of the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones, has launched an appeal against his conviction and sentence, it emerged today .In December a jury at Liverpool crown court unanimously found Mercer guilty of killing the boy, by firing three shots across the car park of the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park in August 2007.Mercer was a member of the Crocky Crew gang, of north Liverpool, and had been firing at rival gang members from Norris Green. Rhys, who was walking across the car park after football practice, was caught in the crossfire and killed by a single shot to his neck, fired by Mercer, who was then 16.Yesterday the criminal appeal office in London confirmed that papers for appeals against Mercer's conviction and sentence had been received from lawyers this week.The Liverpool-based solicitors James Benson, who represented Mercer during his trial, declined to comment on any aspect of the appeals.Mercer was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum tariff of 22 years, following the 11-week trial at Liverpool crown court. The trial judge, Justice Irwin, condemned Mercer and his fellow gang members, branding them cowards as they attempted to cover up their crime. "You have no discipline, no training, no honour. You do not command respect. You may think you do, but that is because you cannot tell the difference between respect and fear. You are selfish, shallow criminals," he told them.The appeal arguments for Mercer will be considered on paper by a judge, who will decide whether they are strong enough to go to a full appeal hearing before three senior judges.If the applications are unsuccessful, lawyers will be able to renew their arguments directly to the appeal court for a full court to determine whether the appeal could be "arguable".
