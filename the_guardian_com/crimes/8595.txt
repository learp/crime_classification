If a member of the public reports a crime to the police, then surely – with the possible exception of really absurd claims – all such reports should be taken seriously (Met signals a shift in attitude to rape claims, 11 February). It is not the job of a police force to decide at the point of the reporting whether or not the claim is true. The job of the police is to make preliminary investigations, to ascertain whether there is any likelihood of the crime having been committed in fact: and if there is sufficient prima facia evidence to take it forward. Then it should be passed on to the relevant authority to decide if it should be prosecuted. Then begins the second duty of the police; the gathering of evidence. At no point should the personal beliefs of individual police personnel come into the equation. And certainly at no point should it be obvious that any individual from the police holds a belief one way or the other. The police investigate, the courts decide. Belief is a matter for the magistrate or for a jury to have to decide during a formal trial.Francis BlakeLondon• Bernard Hogan-Howe’s admission that suspects have rights is a long overdue departure from traditional police attitudes. The blinkered approach of officers to investigating sexual allegations is a perennial problem.Ten years ago, an innocent man was accused of driving young girls to the woods and abusing them in his van. He said that he had never owned a van, learned to drive, taken a test or held a licence. This was true, but the police did not check and he endured a six-week trial in Liverpool before being found not guilty on all counts. As he shuffled from the dock, a broken man, his devoted family and friends left the public gallery, enveloped him in their arms and very quietly escorted him out of court. Justice was done, in spite of Merseyside police.John Bromley-Davenport QCMalpas, Cheshire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
