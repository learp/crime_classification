The longest serving prisoner in British legal history has died in jail 55 years after being convicted of murdering two school girls, it was confirmed today.John Straffen, 77, was initially sent to Broadmoor asylum in 1952 after being found guilty of strangling to death two girls, aged nine and six, but he escaped and - after being declared sane - was tried for the murder of a third young girl in the four hours he was at large.Though Straffen was sentenced to death, the then home secretary, David Maxwell Fyfe, reprieved him and he served his sentence in maximum security prisons. Medical documents released later indicated that Straffen had in fact been declared insane and that Maxwell Fyfe reprieved him on those grounds. Despite this, Straffen was not sent back to Broadmoor and remained in maximum security at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire. He died in the healthcare unit at Frankland prison in County Durham this morning following an illness.Six years ago solicitors acting for Straffen called for his case to be reopened, saying that he should not have stood trial, as he had a mental age of just nine and a half.Successive home secretaries blocked his release and in 2002 politicians lost their power to decide minimum terms for life sentence prisoners.Straffen's death comes as the European Court of Justice reviews whether "whole life" prison sentences are a violation of human rights. If lifelong imprisonment had been outlawed, Straffen's case would have been referred to the high court and he would have received a new minimum term.
