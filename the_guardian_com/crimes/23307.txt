Lucas Leiva has become the latest Liverpool player to fall victim to burglars. The midfielder returned to his home in Woolton following Liverpool's Champions League game with Atl√©tico Madrid on Tuesday night to find that thieves had taken items of football memorabilia, including the bronze medal he won with Brazil at the Olympics three months ago."We will be carrying out a thorough investigation," said Peter Parry of Merseyside Police. "Taken from the address was an amount of jewellery and some very distinctive football and sports memorabilia. These items have significant personal importance to Mr Leiva and they were associated with some very cherished memories."The incident follows a string of burglaries on the homes of Liverpool players which started in June 2006, when former goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek had his Porsche and football mementoes, including his 2005 Champions League winners' medal, taken from his home in the Wirrall. Dirk Kuyt, Steven Gerrard, Pepe Reina, Daniel Agger and former Anfield striker Peter Crouch have all been burgled subsequently, each of the incidents occuring while the players concerned were on match duty.
