The dramatic 7% fall in crime last year means that the much-predicted "credit crunch crime wave" has so far failed to materialise. It is remarkable that after 18 months of the longest and deepest recession seen in England and Wales the underlying crime rate has continued to fall. This may be due to a lower than expected rise in unemployment but it also may reflect a longer-term change in the nature of crime itself.The latest figures confirm that since 1995 – before Tony Blair was elected prime minister – England and Wales have been experiencing the longest sustained fall in crime since the beginning of the 20th century. But this is not necessarily the product of the 50 criminal justice acts since 1997, which have created more than 3,000 new offences. It may well be true that, encouraged by Jacqui Smith when she was home secretary, renewed targeted campaigns by the police against burglary have played a major role in containing the recession-related upward pressures on the crime rate.New Home Office research published today offered a mundane explanation for why serious "acquisitive crime" – burglaries, car break-ins and robberies – has fallen by half since 1995.It says improved security measures such as car immobilisers and the changing nature of consumer goods may have had a significant effect. In 1995, 65% of cars were broken into by the simple method of forcing the lock, but by last year improved security meant this happened in only 32% of cases. A car generally has to be left unlocked now, or the thief has to have already got hold of the key, for it to be targeted by criminals.Over the same period the proportion of homes with window locks and double or deadlocks for doors has also soared.Consumer goods have changed as well. Computers and cameras are now the main targets for burglars, who are no longer interested in CD or DVD players. Televisions have become less attractive since it is difficult to conceal a 32 inch screen under a coat. Alan Travis
