In the last 10 days, the word 'heist' has been used more often by the British media than Hollywood has managed in a decade.It is a word filled with silver-screen glamour, smacking of a world where handsome movie stars perform cunning deeds, outwit dowdy figures of authority, make off with unimaginable riches and, naturally, wear pretty cool clothes.It is hardly surprising that when, following the Â£53m robbery from the Securitas depot in Kent, it looked like we were about to have a real-life crime thriller of glossy proportions here in little old Blighty, many of us got very excited.Certain columnists have reminded their readers that the heist wasn't all fun and games. We have been told to think of the trauma suffered by the family held at gunpoint; we have been reminded of the simple fact that this was theft and that theft is wrong.But it isn't fooling anyone. Every description of the gun-brandishing, ruthless villains builds up their legend. And so the nation is in the grip of heist-mania.What might bring it all to an abrupt close are the suggestions that this particular crime might give heists a bad name.The trails of evidence in farmhouse and warehouse would never have been left by a gang led by George Clooney. Sacks of loot shouldn't be discovered all over the place. Even the Great Train Robbers did better than this and they ended up in jail.It could turn out that what we actually have here is nothing more than another messy crime, more Ealing comedy than Hollywood blockbuster.Though not if a mastermind Mr Big is reading this by the pool in his South American hide-out.
