Furious parents have staged a protest at the school where a 15-year old boy suffered severe head injuries after being attacked by a gang of men with a hammer.Around 20 parents, who believe that the attack on the white schoolboy by a group of Asian men was racially motivated, refused to leave Ridgeway school in Wroughton, near Swindon, until they saw the headteacher, Mr Colledge. The parents said that a gang called the 'Asian Invasion' was behind a campaign of bullying at the school, and demanded that security guards be employed to protect pupils.Police are still questioning six men - two aged 18, three aged 19 and one 20 - and two boys, aged 14 and 15, who were arrested over yesterday's attack.The victim, Henry Webster, was allegedly pinned down on the school tennis courts and hit repeatedly with a claw hammer during the incident. He was taken to Swindon Great Western hospital and has since been transferred to Frenchay hospital in Bristol for surgery.Some parents said they would not be sending their children back to the school until they were happy it was safe. "None of our children are going to school until this is sorted out," said one woman as she left the school grounds. "The security of the school needs to be seriously looked at, so does the racial tension around the school," she added.A neighbour of the victim, whose younger brother Joe, 12, also attends the school, said Henry's mother was "furious" about what happened. The neighbour added: "She can't understand how her son could have been so viciously attacked while he was under the protection of his school."A meeting will be held at the school on Monday to discuss parents' concerns. However, Mr Colledge said there was no proof that the attack was racially motivated and warned against jumping to conclusions.He has sent a letter home with all pupils asking them to contact the police if they have any information about the incident. Many of them are thought to have witnessed the attack.Last May, police said extra patrols would be sent to the Wroughton area after teenagers leaving the school were beaten up by a gang of men.
