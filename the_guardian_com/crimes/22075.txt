There were no children playing out on the street in the bright sunshine on Crompton Drive today.Rhys Jones, the 11-year-old boy shot dead outside a local pub last night, lived in a semi-detached house on this huge estate of private homes in the Croxteth area of north Liverpool. At his home today, all the blinds were drawn and a Ford Fiesta and a Mazda were parked on the driveway as a police officer stood guard.Neighbours said that Rhys was a "shy, polite boy" who loved nothing better than to ride his bike in the close and to kick a ball into a goal set up at the garage of his home."It's got to be mistaken identity," said Jane Towey, who lives only a couple of doors from Rhys's home. "Why would anyone want to shoot Rhys?"What was emerging today was that Rhys may have been the innocent victim of a feud between two notorious Liverpool gangs, the Croxteth Crew and the Norris Green/Strand crew.The estate, which has some 3,300 homes and is said to be one of the largest in Europe, is bookended by two gang territories and residents say that the Fir Tree pub, where Rhys was shot in the carpark, is often the centre of trouble on Saturday and Sunday nights.One resident said: "The quality of life on the estate changes overnight if the pub is shut."In the pub carpark today were two cars covered with green and blue tarpaulins, and a white tent erected over the spot where Rhys fell.The whole area has been cordoned off but already some flowers have been brought by friends and wellwishers.Red roses were brought by a boy called Joe, who laid them with a message reading: "Good night, god bless, Rhys. Sleep well. We will miss you loads mate."
