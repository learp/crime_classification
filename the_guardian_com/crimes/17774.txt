Scotland Yard has rescued a hostage captured during an underworld dispute following its longest ever kidnap operation.The 42-year-old man was freed last night after a nine-day ordeal. He had been kidnapped following a dispute between drugs gangs and was held at an address in Liverpool.The man was freed by armed police who raided a series of addresses in Knowsley, Liverpool, Denham in the Thames Valley area, and Brentwood, Essex. Twelve people were arrested and officers seized 1kg of cocaine, Â£200,000 in cash, as well as guns.The hostage was kidnapped on his way to work at 5am on March 13. He was beaten in captivity and suffered superficial injuries to his body and face. At any one time in the last nine days, up to 200 police officers were involved in the investigation. "Officers from the kidnap unit are used to working in some of the toughest policing conditions, with investigations invariably involving violent criminality on both sides," said Detective Chief Superintendent Sharon Kerr, of the specialist crime directorate. "That makes the risks extremely high and the threat to life real and constant. We are rightly proud of our track record when dealing with kidnaps, but we never take it for granted and no matter the background of those involved we take our duty to preserve life extremely seriously." Not only have we saved this man's life, we have got a lot of intelligence and ripped the heart out of one of the most significant criminal networks operating in this country."Ms Kerr said it was the "longest running kidnap that the Met had ever investigated" and that it had been "incredibly difficult" to track.
