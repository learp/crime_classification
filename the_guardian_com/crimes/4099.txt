Some of Britain's streets have been "lost" to thugs, Conservative leader David Cameron said today.In an interview with GMTV, Cameron said he agreed with comments made by Helen Newlove, whose husband Garry was kicked to death by three teenagers. The three were convicted of his murder this week.Cameron said Mrs Newlove "spoke for millions when she said that in too many parts of the country the streets have been taken over by thugs and society has retreated".The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, did not accept that there was "social breakdown", Cameron went on."Well, in parts of our country there is social breakdown. Society stops at the front door of our house and the streets have been lost and we've got to reclaim them. And that means really big action right across the board."Cameron said there was a need for "big social, cultural and political change" to tackle the problem of social disorder. He highlighted his plans for a voluntary "national citizen service" for over-16s as the sort of idea that could make a difference."I don't think you can bring back national service. I don't think that would be good for our army. I don't think that would be right for our country."But I think what was good about national service is it did bring people together and say, 'Look, you're part of something bigger than yourself, part of a country, and you have responsibilites and duties as a citizen'. That's what I think we ought to be doing in the future."
