A woman who had sex with a 12-year-old boy on almost 200 occasions has been jailed for nine years.Angela Sullivan, 36, gave the boy a pair of trainers as a reward after he slept with her for the 100th time.When police arrested her in October last year they found her diary marked with childish entries and 191 stars against dates when they had sex.Sullivan of Middlesbrough, Teesside today admitted 10 charges of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Prosecutor Richard Bennett told Teesside crown court that the abuse started on the night of a party she threw at her home in January 2009."On the 3rd to the 4th January the defendant threw a belated new year party," he said."Alcohol, including spirits, was available and it seems the young children at the party were freely able to consume it."The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later told police he had consumed 10 bottles of the vodka-based drink WKD and was very drunk.The defendant, who has a son of her own, "took the intoxicated boy up to bed", said Bennett.The next day the boy, a young-looking 12-year-old, had a heavy hangover and she told him: "I had sex with you and if anyone finds out it's classed as rape and everything."Jailing Sullivan for nine years, judge John Walford described the case as "shocking". He also condemned her for the psychological effect her conduct would have on the victim and her own son.Sullivan, who had no previous convictions, was also placed on the sex offenders register for life.Acting detective inspector John Wrintmore of Cleveland police said the force was pleased with the outcome."Angela Sullivan has clearly preyed on and taken complete advantage of a vulnerable young boy."He said sexual offences, particularly where children were victims, were treated extremely seriously by the police and courts.He also commended "the courage and strength of character shown by the young victim".
