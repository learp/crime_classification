A Waking the Dead-style police unit investigating unsolved crimes of Northern Ireland's Troubles has accused a British soldier of lying about the death of a woman he claimed was a result of Russian roulette.The PSNI's historical enquiries team (HET) said the ex-soldier should have been charged with the murder of the Derry woman in 1975.A report released today to the family of 22-year-old Bernadette Friel said a claim that she was shot during a game of Russian roulette was fabricated.The team said Thomas Ramsay deliberately shot Friel and then told investigators a series of lies about what happened. In 1975 Ramsay's version of events was accepted and he spent eight months in jail.Friel died from a single wound to the head, two days after she was shot in the bedroom of Ramsay's home in Carnhill, Derry.Ramsay was charged with murder, but it was reduced to manslaughter, after the director of public prosecutions accepted his version of events.The Russian roulette story was the officially accepted version of events for 34 years, until the publication of the HET report today.Ramsay's 16-year-old brother-in-law Hugh Stanley was also staying at the house on the weekend of the shooting. On Sunday 19 October 1975, Ramsay and Stanley followed Friel upstairs to a bedroom. Almost immediately a shot was heard and Friel sustained a single gunshot wound to the head.During a subsequent search of the house, firearms were discovered.Stanley was given a two-year conditional discharge for firearms offences, but no action was taken over the manslaughter offence, on the direction of the DPP.
