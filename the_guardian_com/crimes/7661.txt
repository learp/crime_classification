Although Nick Davies's report on criminal justice and specifically the probation service is very readable (Staff use one word to describe the service: 'Chaos', April 14), it is not an accurate portrayal of a service that is performing well. Like any corner of the public sector, there are pressures created by the complexities of the system and our potential being greater than the finite resources that we share.Life prisoners are not being incarcerated for two or three years longer than necessary for the want of probation reports, nor are probation hostels private institutions that turn away offenders on a managerial whim. Investment is reaching the service, with, for instance, staff numbers growing by 15.6% from December 2001 to Sept 2003. Probation staff deal with offenders as individuals and will continue to do so as part of the National Offender Management Service. Tried and tested assessment methods, properly managed and validated programmes to tackle offending, and new educational opportunities are now available nationally. Courts have a far greater range of reliable community penalties than ever before and soon short-sentence prisoners will be brought under community supervision to stop the cycle of repeated short stretches in custody, a problem which Davies rightly criticises. In the interests of effective rehabilitation, as well as public expectation, we will bring offenders back under supervision or take them to court if they do not stick to their court order or release licence - offenders who do not turn up cannot be rehabilitated.
