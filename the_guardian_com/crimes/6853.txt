The home secretary, John Reid, today told rank-and-file police officers he would rebalance the justice system away from the rights of suspects and convicted criminals towards those of "ordinary, law-abiding citizens".He said that people still did not feel that the police and courts behaved with fairness to keep them safe and secure.In his first speech to police officers' union the Police Federation, Mr Reid hit out at some of the perceived failings by the Home Office that have dominated headlines in recent weeks."I want a system that is fair and seen to be fair by the majority of law-abiding citizens in this country, one which balances individual rights and public protections," he said."If we need legislation to do it, then we will have legislation. This is not something I will shy away from, even if it brings us into conflict with some of the civil liberties lobby."The government has attracted strong criticism from rights groups for its plans to modify the way the human rights act is applied. The proposed laws could potentially see judicial decisions overruled by ministers.Mr Reid had strong words for the performance of his own department, which he has headed for only 12 days since the cabinet reshuffle on May 5. In particular, he struck out at some of the perceived failings of the home office that have dominated headlines in recent weeks, to the applause of delegates."Any system that allows foreign prisoners back on our streets without even considering deportation has something wrong with the system - full stop, no excuses, no qualifications," he said."Any court judgement that puts the human rights of foreign prisoners ahead of the human right to safety and security of the millions of UK citizens is a wrong decision - full stop, no qualifications."Any parole board decision which emphasises and acts upon the rights of a convicted murderer over the rights and the safety of his potential victims is tragically, murderously, a wrong decision - full stop, no qualifications to that either."The remarks refer to last month's foreign prisoner release scandal, and the cases of Mustaf Jamma, a Somalian national wanted for the murder of Bradford police officer Sharon Beshenivsky, and Anthony Rice, a convicted rapist who killed a woman nine months after his release from prison.Mr Reid took a hardline stance on those who would defend the rights of offenders or criminal suspects."There can be no rights without commensurate responsibilities, and we ought to be talking more about responsibility rather than concentrating on rights. There can be no protection for the majority without penalty for the minority of transgressors. The safety and security of the individual must be weighed in the balance with the safety of the public," he said.An Audit Commission study released today found that 60% of people think crime is getting worse, despite 11 years of falling crime rates. The report said that people's perception of crime had much to do with low-level anti-social behaviour, litter and graffiti, and recommended that resources should concentrate more on pockets of high crime rates.
