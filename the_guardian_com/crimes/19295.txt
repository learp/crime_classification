A telephone appeal by the parents of Madeleine McCann led to nearly 350 phone calls and has generated new leads for investigators, the family's spokesman said today.Kate and Gerry McCann broadcast the plea for information - which was filmed at their home - on Saturday.Over the weekend 347 people called about their missing four-year-old daughter, who disappeared from her parents' apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz nearly eight months ago.Clarence Mitchell, the McCanns' spokesman, said investigators from the private detective agency Metodo 3, which has been hired by the family, were going through callers' information "with a fine-tooth comb"."Any that need to be acted upon swiftly, are being acted upon swiftly," he said."We don't go into detail because if there is any significant information, we need to act on it before we talk about it."Saturday's broadcast was screened around the world and included previously unseen footage of an excited Madeleine opening her gifts last Christmas.Writing in his internet diary, Gerry McCann said Madeleine "should not be spending Christmas away from her loving family"."The person who took Madeleine has it in their power to end our suffering and will be able to appease their conscience that they have done the right thing - especially at this time of year."The parents remain official suspects in the case. They have denied any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance.
