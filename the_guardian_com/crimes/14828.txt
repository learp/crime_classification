A former Soviet soldier was today found guilty of murdering a Lithuanian woman whose head was found by children playing on a beach in north-east Scotland.Convicted killer Vitas Plytnykas, 41, suffocated Jolanta Bledaite at her flat in Brechin, Angus, in March after forcing her to give him access to her savings.The Edinburgh high court heard that the Lithuanian then chopped up the 35-year-old's body and dumped the mutilated parts in the sea.Two young girls found the victim's severed head and hands washed up on Arbroath beach.Accomplice Aleksandras Skirda, 20, also from Lithuania, pleaded guilty to murder last October and testified against Plytnykas, who had been previously convicted of manslaughter in June 2001 after stabbing a man to death in Germany in a row over money. Both will be sentenced later.Bledaite had arrived in the UK to earn enough money to buy a home in Lithuania and had saved around £10,000, close to the amount needed, when she was murdered.Having initially travelled to Ireland, in 2006 she moved to Angus in Scotland, an area popular with migrants seeking work as fruit pickers. For around two years Bledaite, who was 35 when she died, worked on local farms.Skirda became her flatmate in Brechin at Earlsden House, known locally as the Polish Palace due to its high proportion of eastern European tenants.Despite being bound and threatened, Bledaite refused to give in to her attackers, initially giving them an incorrect pin number when they demanded her bank details.In court, Lord Pentland told Plytnykas he had committed a "truly monstrous and evil crime".He added: "With chilling composure and determination you put this evil plan into effect."Jolanta Bledaite was reading quietly, you burst into her bedroom, forced her to disclose her pin number, and having taken money from her bank account you suffocated her."Speaking after today's verdict, Detective Inspector Gordon Cryle, of Tayside police, described her killing as one of the most horrific murders to have been committed in Angus in living memory. "Jolanta Bledaite's final moments of life must have been filled with terror and dread."These evil men showed her no mercy whatsoever, blinded by a callous determination to rob her of her hard-earned savings."From everything we have heard, Jolanta was a hard-working, conscientious woman who arrived here with aspirations of making a better life for herself. By every account she was a good woman – an innocent victim far from home."Police believe the killers must have thought they had committed "the perfect murder" because Bledaite had made it known she was leaving the country imminently and they could create the impression she had left.
