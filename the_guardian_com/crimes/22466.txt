Maxine Carr, who is accused of perverting the course of justice after the deaths of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, faces two new charges of assisting an offender, it emerged today.The crown prosecution service alleged today that Ms Carr knew school caretaker Ian Huntley had either murdered the girls or was involved in their disappearance. But the CPS claims that she lied about his whereabouts, helping him evade arrest. She faces two charges of assisting an offender (one charge for each of the two victims).Mr Huntley is accused of murdering the girls. He and Ms Carr are both listed for a pre-trial hearing at the Old Bailey at the end of next week. Neither is expected to attend. The indictment against them was lodged at the court today and it contains the two extra charges against Ms Carr, who is currently in London's Holloway prison on remand. More than 441 police officers in 25 forces were involved in the search for the 10-year-old girls after they vanished from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in August last year. Some 3,000 witnesses have been interviewed.
