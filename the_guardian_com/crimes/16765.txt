Jack Slipper, the detective famous for leading the inquiry into 1963's Great Train Robbery, died today aged 81.The former detective chief superintendent was involved in many high-profile cases, and became known simply as Slipper of the Yard.Scotland Yard said today that Mr Slipper, a former head of the Metropolitan police's elite flying squad and a driving force behind police innovations in investigating armed robberies, died this morning after a long illness.Friend and former colleague Mike McAdam hailed him as "one of the finest detectives in the last century".Mr Slipper arrested the 15-strong gang of great train robbers in 1963 and then spent much of his career trying to get Ronnie Biggs - who escaped 15 months after being sentenced - back behind bars.Most dramatically, Mr Slipper travelled to Rio de Janeiro in 1974 and arrested Biggs after a tip-off from the Daily Express. But Mr Slipper had to return to England empty-handed because Biggs's girlfriend was pregnant and Brazilian law protected him from extradition as the father of a Brazilian child.Mr Slipper said in recent years that he had come close to persuading Biggs to return: "All he talked to me about in those days was Bermondsey and Kennington. I said, 'Well, come back, come back', but he said, 'We'll wait and see, I've got too long to do'."Biggs, who came back to the UK of his own accord in 2001 and who is now aged 76, is critically ill after contracting MRSA in hospital, and his lawyers said last week that he should be released from prison to die at home with his family.In a statement announcing Mr Slipper's death, Scotland Yard said: "Mr Slipper played a pivotal role in many major investigations over the last 40 years."It said that despite the recognition he gained over the Great Train Robbery, that was not the case that gave him his most satisfaction."At a meeting of the ex-flying squad officers committee last year, of which he was a member, he proudly recalled the role he played in bringing to justice the murderers of the three police officers in Shepherds Bush in 1966, when his knowledge of the criminal underworld in West London came to the fore."Detective chief supt Barry Phillips, from the flying squad, said: "Through the illustrious history of the flying squad, Jack Slipper is a name that sits above all others as a tenacious investigator and well-respected head of the flying squad."Through his work with the robbery squad in the early 1970s, he established the current flying squad model for the investigation of armed robberies that has proved a huge success."His detective ability, professionalism, commitment and dedication is something that all detectives should aspire to." Mr Slipper leaves his wife Annie, two daughters and five grandchildren. His funeral will be held next week.
