A wealthy businessman kicked to death by a gang of youths outside a part-time police station in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, was named last night as Stephen Langford. The 43-year-old was apparently targeted after a "staring out" confrontation with four youths as he went home at 1.45am on Saturday after an evening with friends.First aid was given by a police officer returning to check the station at the end of his shift, and taxi drivers also tried to resuscitate Mr Langford before paramedics arrived. He died later at the Royal Berkshire hospital.Two youths, aged 17 and 18 and both from Henley, have been arrested on suspicion of Mr Langford's murder.Yesterday two 17-year-olds, who were questioned in neighbouring Maidenhead about the killing, were released. They were arrested in Henley, where the police station went on to weekdays-only opening three years ago.Mr Langford was a friend of Peter Harrison, brother of the late Beatle George Harrison, who lived in a mansion near Henley. Mr Harrison said last night: "I'm deeply shocked. Steve and I used to meet at Henley golf club. I've known him for five or six years. It is terribly sad."Tony Lane, a former mayor of the town, said it had been a mistake to end the 24-hour police service. "There's no police protection any more. They take the fact that we are a relatively honest, crime-free town for granted."
