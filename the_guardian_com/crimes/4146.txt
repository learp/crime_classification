A murder hunt was launched yesterday after a man was shot dead in broad daylight on a residential street in London.The shooting took place shortly after lunchtime, apparently in full view of passersby, on Barry Road, East Dulwich, south-east London.Detectives had last night begun forensic examinations of the area. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the inquiry was in its "very early stages". Residents last night described what appeared to be a brazen attack in full view of shoppers using the busy road, which links two parks."There was an awful lot of commotion after about 1pm," said Mark Corbett, 28, who lives close by. "I am told the man was shot after coming out of his house, but that is all I have heard."
