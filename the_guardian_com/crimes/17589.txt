Portuguese police hunting for the missing British three-year-old Madeleine McCann today said they had no firm leads on where she might be.Chief Inspector Oligeario Sousa, leading the operation, said officers had searched 500 apartments, interviewed 100 people and followed up 350 lines of inquiry since Madeleine vanished, presumed abducted, from her bed in an Algarve resort five days ago.Mr Sousa also said a possible sighting of Madeleine in the town of Nelas, more than 300 miles north of the Pria da Luz coastal resort where she vanised, had been a false alarm.Local police set up a series of roadblocks after a man with a young girl was seen behaving suspiciously in a supermarket, local television stations reported.Madeleine vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on Thursday night while her parents, Gerry and Kate, both doctors, were having dinner nearby.Earlier today, Manchester United's Portuguese winger, Cristiano Ronaldo, appealed for help in tracing the girl."I was very upset to hear of the abduction of Madeleine McCann, and I appeal to anyone with information to come forward, please come forward," Ronaldo told Sky News.Antonio Santana Carlos, the Portuguese ambassador in London, defended the police handling of the case and said Portuguese law meant investigators were unable to disclose much information."We are cooperating with Europol and Interpol and also with the British police," Mr Carlos told the BBC. "So for the police, of course, it is a completely open matter - but investigation is quite secretive and it has to carry on that way, due to our legal obligations that exist in Portugal. "I ask you to trust the authorities. They are doing their best. If they cannot give you more information, it's because they can't." Few details about the investigation have so far been made public, prompting criticism that police are not doing enough to find Madeleine.RTP reported that around 180 police officers, firefighters and republican national guard personnel were involved in the search for the three-year-old, while around 1,000 A3-sized photographs of her have been distributed across the Algarve."This morning 1,000 photos were sent to petrol stations, tourist offices, large commercial centres and supermarkets in the Algarve," the president of the Algarve Regional Tourist board, Lusa Jos√© Dias, said.Madeleine's mother yesterday made a direct appeal to the person presumed to have snatched her daughter while the family was on holiday in Portugal."Please, please do not hurt her," she said. "Please don't scare her. Please let us know where to find Madeleine, or put her in a place of safety and tell somebody where."Members of the family are understood to be growing impatient with the response of police in the Algarve to Madeleine's disappearance. The McCanns, from Rothley, in Leicestershire, released details of the pyjamas she was wearing on the night she vanished.The pyjamas, bought from M&S last year, had white bottoms with a floral design, and a pink, short-sleeved top with a picture of the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore.
