Two women prisoners who are threatened with having their toddlers taken from them and put into care will ask the high court today to rule that the Home Office's upper age limit of 18 months for babies in prison is unlawful.The case, brought under the Human Rights Act, is the first challenge to the rule, though lawyers have been anticipating such a claim since the act came into force last October.The case is seen as so important that it was rescheduled from later this week to Monday and Tuesday, so that the lord chief justice, England's most senior judge, could hear it. The two women will seek a confidentiality order before the hearing begins today, and their lawyers were reluctant yesterday to give many details of their personal circumstances.The two children are believed to have already passed the 18-month age limit and will have to go to foster parents soon unless the court intervenes. One of the women is serving a five-year sentence and her earliest date of release is just over a year away. The other has been jailed for eight years and faces deportation at the end of her sentence.In family court cases, judges take account of the serious risk of permanent psychological harm to young children in removing them from their mother. The women's lawyers will argue that the prison service ignores this in operating its upper age limit."The blanket policy means there could be grave injustices to individual children," said Harriet Wistrich of the London law firm Thanki Novy Taube, which acts for one of the women. "There seems to be a conflict between the basic principle that the court should always act in the best interests of the child and these cases where there is a blanket policy which could be totally against the best interests of these children." Richard Gordon, the women's QC, will argue that there is no objective justification for the rule. He will contend that it breaches article eight of the European convention on human rights, the right to respect for private and family life, and article 14, the ban on discrimination, because it discriminates between the children of prisoners and those of others.Lawyers for the Home Office are expected to argue that the 18-month limit should remain pending further research.There are only 72 places in prison mother and baby units, though more than 1,000 women prisoners at any one time have children under five. The Home Office is considering proposals for increasing the number of mother and baby units, and for special units to accommodate children up to the age of four with their mothers.A report last year from the Council of Europe's social, health and family affairs committee concluded that prisons were not an appropriate environment for children, often causing long-term developmental retardation. "Yet, if babies and children are forcibly separated from their mothers they suffer permanent emotional and social damage," it said.The report recommended that prison should be a last resort for mothers of young children, and should be used only for those women convicted of the most serious offences who represent a danger to the community.They should be housed in small secure and semi-secure units with social services support, and access to the outside world under supervision.In Germany and Spain, mothers are allowed to have their children with them in prison until the age of six, in the Netherlands until four in one prison, and until three in Portugal and Switzerland. One German jail has an open unit outside the prison walls in which each mother has her own apartment.
