One of Britain's most wanted men has been arrested in Spain, Crimestoppers said today.Martin Anthony Smith, from North Shields, was wanted in connection with a rape of a child under the age of 16, gross indecency with a girl under 16, indecent assault of a girl under 16 and attempted rape of a girl under 16, according to the charity.The alleged attacks took place between 30 April 1995 and 29 April 2005.The 45-year-old was arrested in Barcelona on Friday, more than two years after he had failed to answer bail in the UK.Smith was placed on the Operation Captura most-wanted list in September following his failure to answer bail on 21 January 2008. The operation identifies those wanted in the UK who are suspected of having committed serious crimes and thought to be living in Spain.Dave Cording, the Crimestoppers director of operations, said: "This man was being sought in connection with an extremely serious crime."Operation Captura continues to go from strength to strength, which is due to law enforcement in both the UK and Spain working so successfully together with the help of vital information provided by the public."A spokesman for the British embassy in Madrid said: "The latest arrest is another example of how close co-operation between UK and Spanish police forces can help ensure that dangerous fugitives are returned to face justice in the UK."The public and media response to the ongoing Captura campaign has been incredibly effective so far."Detective Superintendent Andy Slattery, of Cumbria constabulary's public protection unit, said: "Last year we joined Crimestoppers and the Serious Organised Crime Agency in appealing to people in Spain for help tracking down Mr Smith, who had fled the country."He said the force was working with Soca and the British embassy in Spain to bring Smith back to Britain.
