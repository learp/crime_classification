The cost of fraud to the British economy could be at least £20bn a year - equivalent to the government's entire transport budget - a report revealed yesterday.The report, for the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), carried out by Morgan Harris Burrows LLP and Professor Michael Levi of Cardiff University, estimated the cost of fraud at £14bn.Once estimates for areas of criminality, such as income tax and EU fraud, where statistics are not available, are added, the total cost could easily reach £20bn and possibly much higher, the report says.Mike Bowron, ACPO member and commissioner of the City of London police, said: "To put this figure into perspective, such losses would pay for an additional 200,000 police officers or save every man, woman and child £330 a year.""Lying to secure financial benefit is fast becoming endemic in British life. Fraud threatens to blur the boundaries between what we see as right and wrong. Unabated, fraud will undoubtedly change the way future generations view the world."The authors urge the government to follow through on last year's fraud review and establish a national fraud reporting centre. Next week, the government is due to publish its response to consultations on the review, which highlighted weaknesses in the public sector response to fraud and the paucity of police resources .The government said it welcomed the ACPO report and would "carefully" study its conclusions.
