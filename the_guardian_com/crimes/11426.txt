The children's secretary, Ed Balls, today insisted he did not try to influence the inspectors' report he used to justify removing Haringey's head of children's services, Sharon Shoesmith, from office over the Baby P affair.Shoesmith's legal team allege that documents released yesterday show the emergency report into Haringey children's services, north London, was "beefed up" after Ofsted was told by a Whitehall official that Balls had demanded "clear attribution of responsibility".But Balls insisted the watchdog's report which followed the death of Baby Peter, a child on Haringey's child protection register, was independent and said he would make the same decision - that Shoesmith was "unfit to lead" the department – today."At no point did I or anybody in my department ever seek to influence the outcome of the independent Ofsted report," he said."The reality was when the inspectors came to see us they said to us the situation in Haringey was terrible, and they said things to us in the meeting which were seriously tougher than even the very damning report they published on the day."It was on that basis that I acted, I don't think I had any choice at all, and nothing I've read in any of the months since then and all of these detailed papers changes my view on that at all ... There was a huge failure of management leadership and we had to act and we did."Shoesmith was dismissed without compensation by Haringey council from her £130,000-a-year post in December 2008, a week after Balls ordered her summary removal.Her case for judicial review claims that the actions of Balls, Ofsted and Haringey were unfair and in breach of natural justice, and have left her penniless and practically unemployable. All three parties contest the application.Thousands of pages of documents only disclosed by Ofsted after the hearings in the judicial review had finished were released to the media following a legal application by the Guardian and other newspapers.Yesterday the watchdog said it stood by the inspection and the team that produced it. Changes to the drafts were normal practice, and the final version of the report reflected the concerns of the first draft that safeguarding arrangements for children in Haringey were inadequate.Mr Justice Foskett, who is hearing the judicial review, is expected to deliver his verdict after Easter.
