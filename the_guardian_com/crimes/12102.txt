The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday May 21 2008 In the report below we said that the British Horseracing Authority offered to part-fund the investigation by the City of London police. The British Horseracing Authority says that the request for funding came from the City of London police and that it was declined. Serious errors were made by City of London police during its inquiry into alleged corruption in horseracing, according to an internal review published yesterday.The force acknowledged its flawed investigation had contributed to the collapse of the case against former champion jockey Kieren Fallon and five other defendants, including jockeys Darren Williams and Fergal Lynch, who were accused of conspiring to fix races.Commander Patrick Rice, who led the review on behalf of the City of London police, conceded errors had been made but defended the decision to investigate."We have been thorough in our efforts to identify exactly what we could have done better - or differently," Rice said. "I am pleased to say that we got a lot of things right, including the overall direction and control of the investigation. However, we have also identified some areas where we need to tighten up our processes and modify our ways of working."However, we believe that we were right to bring the case to court. We had several strands of evidence, including contact and association between individuals, betting patterns, surveillance and documentation, all of which was pointing towards this group of people that were participating in the alleged activity."The race-fixing allegations arose after a race at Lingfield Park, Surrey, in which Fallon's mount, Ballinger Ridge, was passed by the favourite, Rye, in the closing stages having looked certain to win. The police case rested on the contention that, by deliberately losing races, Fallon and the other jockeys were enabling their co-defendants to profit because they had bet on the horses to lose.The case against Fallon and his alleged co-conspirators was thrown out by the trial judge, Sir Thayne Forbes, after defence submissions that there was no case to answer after two months of evidence. The prosecution case collapsed largely because of the evidence of expert witness Ray Murrihy, a race steward from Australia, who conceded that he had insufficient knowledge of British racing to say whether the jockeys really appeared to deliberately lose the races. The police investigation was undermined by a series of damaging allegations made in court.The revelation that the British Horseracing Authority offered to part-fund the police inquiry, and the allegation that it offered a job to investigating officer Mark Manning when the case was over, proved particularly damaging to the police.The police were also revealed to have had an inadequate understanding of the nature of online betting exchanges and the process of laying a horse to lose, the mechanism by which the defendants were alleged to have attempted to profit from fixed races.Among recommendations is the suggestion police should enter into formal ties with governing bodies for similar cases. The nature of the relationship between the BHA, whose own security team began the investigation into the alleged conspiracy, was highly contentious.Rice said: "When dealing with regulatory bodies as part of an investigation, the force should ensure that there is a formal framework in place to govern the relationship," the report concludes.He also said the police should have made better use of the expertise within the Jockey Club and the BHA to determine whether there was a case to be answered, rather than holding them at "arm's length"."Had this case occurred today, with the nature of the BHA as it is, I think there would have been the potential to work with the regulator while satisfying the requirements of independence and making the most of the expertise within the racing industry."
