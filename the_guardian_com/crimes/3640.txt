Politicians “have blood on their hands” for failing to keep track of foreign offenders, according to the father of a 12-year-old girl who died after a hit-and-run collision with an Iraqi motorist who had previous convictions.Paul Houston spoke out after a National Audit Office (NAO) report revealed that one in six foreign offenders living in the community had absconded, including 58 dangerous individuals who have been missing since 2010.The NAO also found that police were failing to conduct overseas criminal record checks on more than two-thirds of arrested foreign nationals.The report is likely to increase pressure on the home secretary, Theresa May, who will be well aware that the Labour home secretary Charles Clarke was forced to resign in 2006 after neglecting the management of foreign national offenders (FNOs).Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. has been granted an urgent question in the Commons on the issue on Wednesday.Cooper said: “This report is a damning indictment of the home secretary’s failure to deport foreign criminals. The number of foreign criminals deported is lower now than it was in 2010. More foreign criminals have absconded. And they are still doing less than other European countries to prevent foreign nationals with criminal records entering the country in the first place.“The National Audit Office has made clear that bureaucratic failures account for a large part of the problem, and there have been delays in modernising the warning index – the tool used to identify criminals from overseas.At the same time Theresa May and the government have been wobbling about opting out of EU cooperation – even though this is the vital information we need to stop foreign criminals coming in.“When people come into the country, they should abide by the law. The prime minister said foreign nationals would be deported, and it was a major priority for his government. Yet despite all Theresa May and David Cameron’s promises, the government is still failing on this basic duty to deport foreign criminals.”Houston, whose daughter, Amy, died six weeks after she was knocked down by an Iraqi-Kurdish asylum seeker, Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, in Blackburn in 2003, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the failure to keep track of foreign offenders had ruined lives. “Ultimately, the responsibility falls on the politicians because what’s happened in the last 10 years has been a social experiment and we are the guinea pigs. The politicians have blood on their hands because families’ lives have been ruined and people have died because of this,” he said.“They have a responsibility to protect society and its citizens – that’s their number one priority. I feel too much is given to the rights of the criminal and not to the protection of society and victims.”Home Office minister James Brokenshire said 22,000 FNOs had been removed under this government, though he admitted the authorities were struggling to cope with a 28% increase in appeals.He told the Today programme that the government had reduced the number of appeal routes from 17 to four. “Too often people have been playing the system, playing the appeals merry go round to delay things,” he said.Brokenshire said British involvement in two key EU programmes – the Schengen information system and the European criminal records system – would help improve the monitoring of foreign offenders. The Schengen system allows authorities in EU countries to share information on people who may have been involved in serious crime.He said: “We intend to join the Schengen information system – an EU system to highlight and flag alerts – during the course of this year to ensure we are giving our border the best possible position. But we are one of the biggest users of the European criminal records information system to ensure we have the best possible information. But I know that we must do more and that is what we will do.”The NAO discovered the failings despite successive governments throwing resources at the problem of monitoring, arresting, prosecuting and deporting FNOs. Auditors found there were 10 times the number of staff employed on the issue than in 2006.But far from deterring or speeding up the deportation of prisoners, the number of FNOs either in prison or deported has remained broadly unchanged.The report will increase pressure on May, who has faced questions from Ukip and Labour over the effectiveness of police background checks after the case of Arnis Zalkalns, the prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Alice Gross. He had served seven years for murder in his native Latvia.In 2011, the prime minister pledged to deport more FNOs, revealing plans to remove those who are given indeterminate sentences as soon as they have served their minimum jail term.The report found public bodies spent an estimated £850m on foreign criminals, although the figure could be up to £1bn, which it said equated to roughly £70,000 a year per criminal.There were 12,500 FNOs in Britain at the end of March, either in prison or living in the community pending deportation. The government had made little progress on the issue since 2006, the NAO said. Foreign prisoner numbers have risen 4% from 10,231 to 10,649 since 2006, while removals have fallen to 5,097 from a peak of 5,613 in 2008-09. This comes despite an increase in the number of Home Office staff working on FNOs from 100 to more than 900.Despite the 2006 crisis, the NAO discovered the Home Office does not hold records on the number of foreign offenders released without being considered for deportation before January 2009.Teams set up to manage foreign offenders still use old technology, with referrals from the Prison Service being sent to the Home Office by fax and manually entered into the records system.At the border, the UK is also lagging behind its European counterparts in preventing foreign criminals from entering the country, the report shows. Britain is one of four countries in the European Economic Area, of which there are 30 member states, not to sign up to the Schengen information system, which uses warning alerts about foreign nationals. Up to £70m a year could be saved if early opportunities to identify FNOs were seized upon, auditors said.In 2013, the National Security Council realised more could be done and ordered the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Foreign and Commonwealth Office to step up their efforts, auditors said. In June 2013, the three departments established the “FNO action plan”.The report discloses the case of a foreign offender who has been jailed twice for sexual offences, including assaulting a girl under 14, but who remains in the UK despite a near eight-year battle to deport him. The man, who arrived in the UK as a student in 1980, was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2005, despite being jailed for three counts of indecent assault of a female under 14 five years earlier in 2000.But it was not until 2007, when he was serving a second jail sentence for indecent exposure, that the Home Office told the man of its intention to deport him, the report says.Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, said the government’s performance in reducing the number of foreign national prisoners continued to be “frustratingly poor”.“It beggars belief that the Home Office and Ministry of Justice are managing the removal of foreign national offenders without knowing basic costs and how best to target their resources,” she said.“Government is not helping itself – continued use of outdated IT and too much reliance on form-filling mean that crucial checks and information gathering are not happening at the right time.”
