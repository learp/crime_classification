Almost 8,000 sex offenders in England have been cautioned instead of charged and prosecuted over the past five years, according to a survey of police forces.The figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act show that 1,600 of the offences involved children, 350 of them victims under 13. In 230 cases the offence was rape. The list of offences also included child porn offences, bigamy, exploitation of prostitution, indecent exposure, sexual offences against animals, sexual grooming and incest.The Association of Chief Police Officers defended the practice, saying that a caution did not mean that the offender was "being let off" as it still meant an admission of guilt, a criminal record and an entry on the sex offenders' register.Acpo also said cautions were likely to be given in cases where, for example, a 16-year-old boy had consensual sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend, who may be in the same class at school as him.Terry Grange, the chief constable of Dyfed Powys, said: "Every incident will be treated on its own merit, taking into account the circumstances of the incident and the people involved."Ministers said that the use of cautions was a matter for police but there were circumstances - such as where the victim does not want to go ahead with a prosecution - where they were appropriate.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: "It is bad enough that so many offenders are getting away with effectively no punishment, it is outrageous that this is happening in very serious cases of sexual assault involving children."
