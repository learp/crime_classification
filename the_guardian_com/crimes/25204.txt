The head of the Metropolitan police yesterday blamed the fashion for iPods and flashy mobile phones for a 26.4% rise in the number of street robberies in the last year.The distinctive iPod headphones made their wearers more vulnerable in the streets, said Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner.He made the comments as he published new crime figures which showed a 26.4% increase in robberies and a 35.4% rise in gun crime in April compared with the same month last year. Violent crime increased by 13.4%. The police blamed a significant part of the rise on alcohol-fuelled "yobbery". Sir Ian told a meeting of the Metropolitan police authority yesterday: "In street robbery our concern has been around the smaller portable pieces of kit - the new generation of mobile phones and iPods." He said the 35.4% increase in gun crime in April was not expected to be repeated this month. Initial figures for the beginning of May revealed it was "coming down again". A statement by the Metropolitan police containing the figures highlighted the part that alcohol plays in violent crime but also noted that changes in the way crimes are reported would account for some of the increases for April. A spokesman for the Home Office crime prevention unit said: "Expensive mobile devices are attractive to thieves and we are working with manufacturers to improve safety. "Owners of iPods and other devices can protect their property by being aware of their surroundings at all times."
