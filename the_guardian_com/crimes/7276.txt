A pair of dogs belonging to a controversial judge have been seized by police, who also arrested their owner after the third biting incident involving the animals in a year.The two German shepherds have been kennelled by Northumbria police who bailed Judge Beatrice Bolton, 57, after questioning her about an alleged attack by the dogs on a walker close to her home.Bolton is suspended from sitting at Newcastle crown court pending the outcome of an inquiry into her conviction in December for failing to control one of the animals. She had to apologise to Carlisle magistrates after chewing gum during the hearing and then storming out, calling her guilty verdict and Â£2,500 fine "a fucking travesty".Northumbria police said the German shepherds had been taken from Bolton's home in Rothbury, Northumberland, after a 22-year-old complained of being attacked. The force is already waiting to hear from the Crown Prosecution Service about whether charges will be brought over another alleged attack, on Rothbury postman Kenneth Auld in April.The Royal Mail suspended deliveries to the judge's house and two of her neighbours after Auld was invalided off work because of his injuries.A police spokeswoman said: "Beatrice Bolton was taken to Alnwick police station for questioning after the latest report and we will continue our investigation to see if there will be any charges brought. Due to the history of the dogs accused, the decision was taken to seize her dogs for the protection of the public."Bolton, meanwhile, won a planning appeal over a fence she put up in her garden without official permission. Her dogs' notoriety was raised at the planning committee when councillor Trevor Thorne said: "This is the famous Judge Bolton with the vicious dog, so there may be a case for keeping the fence up."The committee agreed that the fence had a harmful impact on views of a nearby fortified medieval pele tower, but agreed a two-year temporary permit while an adjacent hedge grows. The local Whitton and Tosson parish council argued that any fence would need to be a lot higher to contain the infamous dogs.
