A man jailed for eight years for inflicting "biological" grievous bodily harm by infecting two lovers with HIV has won the right to a retrial.Mohammed Dica, 38, the first person in 137 years to be convicted in England and Wales for sexually transmitting a disease, had his original convictions quashed by the court of appeal in London today. But the appeal judges refused to release him on bail pending retrial before a high court judge and jury at inner London crown court in about six weeks. The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, sitting with Lord Justice Judge and Mr Justice Forbes, ruled that the judge at the original trial last October should not have withdrawn from the jury the issue of whether the women consented to intercourse, knowing Mr Dica was HIV positive. Judge Philpot had held that consent was irrelevant and provided no defence because, under legal precedent, the women had "no legal capacity to consent to such serious harm". Kenyan-born Mr Dica, of Mitcham, Surrey, was found guilty on two counts of causing grievous bodily harm under section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act. Giving the court's judgment today, Lord Justice Judge said consenting adults had always taken risks of infection or pregnancy or even of danger to a woman's health through childbirth. Modern society had not thought to criminalise those who willingly accepted the risks and no one had been convicted in such circumstances. But prosecutions could be brought against those who, knowing they were suffering from HIV or some other serious sexual disease, recklessly transmitted it through consensual intercourse and inflicted grievous bodily harm on a person from whom the risk was concealed. The judge noted there had been recent significant increases in the recorded rates of syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia. He said a legal precedent set in 1889 when a husband was cleared of causing bodily harm by infecting his unknowing wife with gonorrhoea had no continuing relevance.
