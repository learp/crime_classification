Online job hunters are being used as unwitting "money mules" to launder the proceeds of criminal activities, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) warned today.Soca said those looking for the work during the recession needed to be on their guard against "too-good-to-be-true" earning opportunities which could actually be scams run by fraudsters.It said criminals were making use of legitimate channels, including mainstream recruitment websites, to offer jobs such as financial manager, money transfer agent, shipping manager or even mystery shopper.Some criminals issue official-looking "employment contracts" to be signed by those offered jobs. They then transfer money into their account and pay them a percentage or a set fee for making payments to other organisations.Campaigners say the adverts posted by the criminals are so sophisticated, many job hunters are persuaded that a genuine job exists.An advert on a professional looking American site targeted at US residents, seeking a checks processing manager, offered the opportunity for training courses and a full-time job, as well as 10% commission on money transfers.Those who fall victim can end up having their bank accounts suspended and find themselves liable to repay the full amount of laundered funds.Sharon Lemon, the deputy director of e-crime at Soca, said criminals were reliant on money mules to receive and forward money they had stolen through online banking fraud."Some money mules know exactly what they are doing. However, many end up unwittingly laundering profits for overseas criminals as a result of being taken in by fake recruitment sites," she said."The consequence is that they end up liable for all the criminal funds they've received, which must be repaid. Their bank accounts are frozen and they may be subject to criminal investigation."The warning comes at the start of Get Safe Online week.Tony Neate, the managing director of GetSafeOnline.org, said, at any given time, there are about 100 known mule recruitment sites targeting the UK, each of which may have about 50 active mules."Even though many mules are unwitting accomplices, they are the easiest part of the criminal chain to track down - and by allowing their bank accounts to be used to receive and transfer illegal funds, they are breaking the law, even if they do not realise it," he said."With many people looking for ways to earn money during a recession, it's critical that people learn to spot the warning signs to avoid becoming a victim."According to Get Safe Online, tips to avoid falling victim include:• If it's too good to be true, it probably is: be cautious about any opportunities offering the chance to make relatively large sums of money for very little work or prior experience.• Watch out for approaches from overseas: be wary of offers from people or companies overseas, as it is harder to verify if they are who they say they are.• Do your research: look into any company that makes you a job offer and check their contact details (address, phone number, email address and website) are correct and whether they are registered in the UK. Never give your bank details to anyone unless you know and trust them.• Contact your bank: if you think you may be a victim of one of these scams, contact your bank immediately.Recently, Guardian Work warned of another scam targeting online job hunters where fake recruitment sites advertise jobs that do not exist to lure consumers who are then charged to have their CV updated.
