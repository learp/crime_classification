A government white paper to be published on Wednesday will reveal details of the much-publicised overhaul of the criminal justice system.Under the proposals, thousands of defendants will lose the right to trial by jury. Judges would sit alone in cases where jurors might be subject to intimidation and in complicated fraud cases where it is believed the evidence will be too difficult for a jury to understand. Magistrates' powers to impose prison sentences would be increased from a maximum of six months to 12, and a formal system of sentence discounts would be introduced to encourage defendants to plead guilty, in an attempt to reduce the number of jury trials. Ministers believe the compromise will allow them to scrap controversial proposals to curb the right of defendants to choose trial by jury, while still cutting the number of jury trials by 6,000 a year. The white paper will also reveal plans to scrap the double jeopardy rule, which means defendants cannot stand trial for the same charge twice. Other proposals would see an extension of jury catchment areas to avoid white-only panels and the introduction of police powers to allow officers to impose bail conditions on suspects before charging them.
