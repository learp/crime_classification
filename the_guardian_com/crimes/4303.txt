Both were jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years.Judge Peter Thornton told them: "This was a deliberate execution carried out in a public street in the presence of the victim's wife. You have brutally take the life of a man loved by his friends and relatives."Mr Ofori was shot twice by a gunman in Catford, south London, just after midnight on June 23.Aftab Jafferjee, QC, prosecuting, told the court: "The intended target of this roadside execution was in fact another man all together.
