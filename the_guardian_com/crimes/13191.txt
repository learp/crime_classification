A man who lured two police officers into a gun and grenade attack while on the run for murdering a father and son has gone on hunger strike in an apparent bid to be moved to another prison.Dale Cregan was already on the run for the murders of his criminal rivals David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed police officers Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32. After shooting the women at an address in Manchester he threw a grenade at their bodies.The 30-year-old, who was given a whole life sentence at Preston crown court in June, is refusing food at HMP Full Sutton, near York, reportedly in an attempt to get transferred to Strangeways prison in Manchester.Jonathan Reynolds, MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, told the Daily Mirror he believes Cregan was just trying to grab people's attention.Reynolds said: "He is clearly proud of the reputation he has gained and this is now one of the few ways he has of getting the attention that he craves. Hopefully he will be dealt with accordingly and can get right back to serving his sentence in whichever way the authorities see fit."Strangeways is closer to the notorious gangster's hometown of Droylsden, Greater Manchester, and his family.Cregan's four-month trial laid bare the brutality of Manchester's underworld, with the prosecution alleging that last summer's violence was sparked by a "longstanding feud" between two rival Manchester families.Cregan – who claims he lost an eye after getting into a fight with a Thai policeman with a knuckleduster – is believed to be held in segregation at Full Sutton to for his own safety, with reports suggesting there is an underworld reward of £20,000 for anyone who damages his remaining good eye.A Prison Service spokeswoman refused to comment on Cregan's status or condition, but added: "We take food refusal extremely seriously. If a prisoner chooses to refuse food for any reason, the Prison Service works with healthcare staff to monitor their physical and mental health."Prisoners who are considered mentally capable are entitled to refuse health interventions, provided they fully understand the consequences of their decision."
