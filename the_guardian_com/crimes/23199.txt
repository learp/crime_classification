British businessman Shrien Dewani would be seen to have committed a "sissy crime" if convicted and jailed for allegedly ordering his wife's murder on honeymoon in South Africa last November, a court heard on the third day of his extradition hearing.Prosecutors suggested his high profile would give him protection against violent treatment by other prisoners.But said the "white collar" nature of the crime – and the 31-year-old Briton's wealth and looks – could count against him behind bars.Giving evidence on the third day of his extradition hearing, Sasha Gear from Johannesburg's Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation said: "In the case of Mr Dewani, I'm positive that there's a potential for [his high profile] not to play such a protective role because of the extent to which it could highlight factors about Mr Dewani that indicate vulnerability."For example, the type of crime he is alleged to have committed would be considered a sissy crime in the prison culture; also that he comes from a well-to-do background, what he looks like. These sort of things are magnified with publicity."Hugo Keith QC, representing the South African authorities, cited the case of another Briton whose high profile had protected him when he was jailed in the country for murder.The unnamed prisoner was said to have claimed that press reporting of his crime "helped me", adding: "If you're known outside you won't suffer anything."But because Dewani's alleged victim was a woman and he was not directly involved in any violence meant his high profile would not guarantee his safety, Westminster magistrates, sitting at Woolwich in south-east London, were told.Anni Dewani, 28, was shot dead in the back of taxi in Cape Town on 13 November after a hijacking alleged to have been staged by Dewani and three other men.Taxi driver Zola Tongo claimed in a plea bargain that Dewani offered him cash to arrange for two hitmen to ambush his vehicle as they drove through the dangerous Gugulethu township.Dewani and Tongo were ejected from the cab, while Dewani's Swedish bride was driven off and killed.The 31-year-old Bristol man denies any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition.A key argument against extradition is that his human rights would be infringed while he awaited trial in prison and if he was convicted and jailed.
