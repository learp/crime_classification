The age at which knives can be bought is to be raised from 16 to 18, under plans to be announced by the home secretary, David Blunkett, this week.The move is expected to be agreed on Wednesday with police chiefs at a Downing Street summit to discuss progress in dealing with gun crime and other violent offences. The plan will also include imposing stiffer penalties on teenagers who are found to be carrying knives when they are searched on the street. Mr Blunkett wants to introduce a maximum five year sentence for carrying a knife on the street. The summit will be used to discuss the proposal with senior representatives of Britain's chief constables. But the home secretary is said to be keen to push ahead with the changes. "We must do everything we can to get knives off the streets, including strengthening the law," said Mr Blunkett. He added: "I think there is a very strong argument for having to be 18 to buy a knife, just as with alcohol and fireworks. The education secretary, Charles Clarke, and I are working together to tackle the dual menace of young people carrying knives in our schools and on our streets." The outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, has been pushing for tougher punishment for violent crimes involving knifes. He said earlier this month that gun crime had been reduced in London, but that the problem had moved on to knives. Sir John believes those who carry knives "for the wrong reasons" should receive a mandatory sentence of up to three years.
