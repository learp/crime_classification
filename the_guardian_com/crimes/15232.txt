Two brothers have pleaded guilty to conspiring to attend a terror training camp in Syria.Hamza Nawaz, 24, and Mohommod Nawaz, 30, were stopped by police in September last year as they arrived at the port of Dover from Calais.Officers who searched their car allegedly found a balaclava, "heavy-duty clothing", six mobile phones, a sim card inside a Qur'an and five rounds of ammunition.It was claimed that the pair had driven from their home in Stratford, east London, to Calais and then flown from Lyon to Turkey. From there they allegedly travelled into Syria.At a brief hearing at the Old Bailey, both men pleaded guilty to conspiring to attend a place used for terrorist training between 1 January 2012 and 16 September 2013.Mohommod Nawaz also pleaded guilty to having ammunition without a firearms certificate. The same charge against his brother was ordered to remain on file.An additional charge of being in possession of a laptop computer containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism was dropped.The brothers were remanded in custody until sentencing at the Old Bailey on 9 June.Charges against brother and sister Zahir and Nabeila Nawaz, 31 and 26, of the same address, were not proceeded with by the prosecution. Nabeila Nawaz was accused of perverting the course of justice, while Zahir was charged with making a false statement.Following the hearing, Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner Helen Ball said: "Travelling abroad to engage in terrorist-related activity is a serious offence and we will continue to prosecute, where appropriate, anyone engaged in this type of activity."Our concerns include the actions of people who have attended terrorist training camps or who have fought in war zones, as well as the possibility that they return to the UK radicalised. The police work with partners to identify individuals of concern in order to manage the risk they may pose."She added: "If you have concerns about someone who is planning to travel to Syria – for whatever reason – you should contact police."
