The home secretary, David Blunkett, today promised to put more police officers on the beat as he launched a new UK-wide pilot project.Under the scheme, 10 forces will share £13m to employ more civilian staff to do the station-based jobs traditionally performed by police officers. Mr Blunkett made the announcement while visiting Newcastle upon Tyne with his ministerial team. "We have more police officers than ever before," Mr Blunkett said. "But too often officers find themselves trapped in the station, dealing with paperwork and other duties that can, and should, be carried out by other staff. "We need to ensure that those officers are out in their communities, reducing crime and reassuring the public through high visibility policing. "This £13m will enable 10 forces to pilot projects to investigate new, better ways of working, cut bureaucracy and improve the service they provide to the public." The Northumbria and Surrey forces will share just under half the cash between them. Northumbria has been given £4.4m over the next two years to employ more civilian staff in custody suites and to liaise with witnesses. This will see 91 officers return to front line duties. Surrey Police will receive £1.5m to employ extra civilian support staff. · The 10 forces taking part are: Northumbria, Surrey, the Met, Dyfed-Powys, Humberside, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and Wiltshire
