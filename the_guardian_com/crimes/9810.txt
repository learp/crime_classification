Although Philip Lawrence was murdered more than a decade ago, his brutal death remains a constant reference point for those concerned about violence, especially knife crime among the young.When the first reports emerged, on December 8 1995, they caused immediate shock: the headteacher of a comprehensive school in the north London suburb of Maida Vale had been stabbed by a gang of teenagers after he came to the aid of a 13-year-old pupil under attack.It soon became a murder case after the headteacher, by now named as 48-year-old Lawrence, died from a single stab wound three inches deep, which cut through his heart and a lung.Rarely has a killing so clearly illustrated a moral chasm separating victim and attacker: Lawrence was a Catholic father of four, devoted to the welfare and security of his pupils; Learco Chindamo, then 15, was a member of a gang that modelled itself on the Chinese Triads and was linked to other serious crimes, including rape and attempted murder.A fund was swiftly set up in Lawrence's name, attracting contributions from donors including the Queen. It still operates, giving awards to young people who perform good works in their communities.Chindamo's trial, the following year, heard how the teenager, who came to Britain from Italy at the age of five, sneered as he slapped, punched and then stabbed the headteacher. He was jailed indefinitely, with a recommended minimum tariff of 12 years.Since his death, Lawrence's widow, Frances, has become a reluctant, though eloquent and impassioned, advocate of his beliefs.It was a role that began for her just days after the murder, when a letter from her to bereaved pupils was read out over the school's public address system."Violence grows, like a poison tree, inside people who have not learned to value other human beings," she wrote. "Now, I trust you to work as hard as you can, in school and at home, to create a world in which goodness is never again destroyed by evil."Mrs Lawrence has spoken out often about what she today said was a plague of knife crime.She has repeatedly stressed that the Lawrence family gains no pleasure from seeing a young man confined to jail. But she is equally vehement that he should be punished properly.Discussing yesterday's immigration tribunal decision that Chindamo should not be deported to Italy when he is freed, Mrs Lawrence said she was still struggling with her feelings, notably within the parameters of her religion."My faith has been sorely tested," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "Forgiveness is such a complex issue, or maybe such a simple one, and I don't think I really understand it yet and I am not sure what it is that I am meant to do."
