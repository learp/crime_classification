A mother who was jailed for smothering her four-month-old son had her murder conviction quashed by the court of appeal yesterday.But Margaret Smith should stand trial again for the murder, the appeal court announced. Ms Smith, 39, was found guilty in October 2002 of murdering baby Keith at the family home in September 1994. The quashing of her murder conviction was made by Lord Justice Buxton, Mr Justice Treacy and Mrs Justice Cox. The court banned the media from reporting their reasons for overturning her conviction which they said was "in the interests of justice". She had been sentenced to life for the murder after a trial at Leeds crown court. Lord Justice Buxton rejected arguments by Ms Smith's barrister that she should be set free and not face a further court case, saying: "We are satisfied that this is a case in which the public interest demands there should be a retrial." Andrew Campbell QC for the crown said they believed there was still "sufficient evidence" at a retrial "to enable a jury properly directed to convict". Anil Murray, for Ms Smith, said his client had already endured "extreme stress" from court hearings and that a retrial would be "onerous". Announcing the ban of the reporting of the reasons the conviction was overturned, Lord Justice Buxton said: "Although we do this with great reluctance, we think the interests of justice are served by our making an order that permits the publication of the result of this appeal, but until the retrial has been concluded, there should be no publication of the reasons for that decision." An application for bail was refused. The court said it hoped the retrial would be held soon.
