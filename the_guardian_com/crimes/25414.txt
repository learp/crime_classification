Broadmoor and Leeds general infirmary were not the only healthcare institutions where Jimmy Savile abused.Allegations about the broadcaster have been made in relation to hospitals, hospices and other centres across Britain and reports have been published in relation to each of them.Moss Side hospital, LiverpoolThis used to be part of Ashworth hospital and is now one of three top-security mental hospitals in England, with Rampton and Broadmoor.Two female former patients accused Savile of sexually abusing them in a ward and a third allegation came from a male ex-patient who claimed that he witnessed Savile stroke a patient's breast at a hospital social event.The report said: "Ms Y stated that she and other female patients were encouraged to sit on JS's knee and have their photograph taken. She did not describe who encouraged her to take this action."Whilst she was sitting on his knee, he put his hand on her thigh and moved it upwards, towards her intimate area. She remonstrated with him, screaming in protest, and as a result was isolated by staff when she tried to explain what had happened to her."The report went on: "Mr A described how female patients sat on one side of the hall and male patients on the other side, and some patients were invited on to the stage with JS."He remembers seeing JS put his hand down the front of a female patient's clothing. Mr A was not able to recall her taking exception to this alleged behaviour. He did suggest that the prevailing culture at the time would have meant that patients would have been too frightened to have made a complaint."He did not raise his concerns about JS's alleged behaviour, as he initially thought it was all part of the act."Digby hospital, ExeterThe report found that Savile raped a woman in a motorhome at this mental hospital in 1970.It said: "Ms X stated Jimmy Savile was in a motorhome/caravan and he invited her to see the vehicle, where he then raped her. She did not report the incident to anyone at the time and did not believe anyone was aware of what had happened."Melanie Walker, chief executive of Devon partnership NHS trust, said: "On behalf of the NHS, I would like to apologise to Ms X. Suffering serious sexual abuse whilst in the care of the NHS is, quite clearly, unacceptable and deeply traumatic."We have provided support to Ms X since she first brought her experience to the attention of the police. Raising issues of this nature requires a great deal of courage and we hope that the investigation process may have helped her, in some small way, to address the events that took place more than forty years ago."High Royds hospital, LeedsA former patient at the mental health unit and a member of staff both reported that Savile had inappropriately touched people during a fancy dress fun run in the 1980s. The report said the allegations were accepted and appeared to be true.Shotley Bridge hospital, County DurhamThere were allegations of inappropriate behaviour during a visit in 1981, but The report said: "No evidence of anything untoward or inappropriate taking place during the visit involving Jimmy Savile and the children on the ward has come to light."Dryburn hospital, DurhamAn allegation was made that someone connected with the hospital helped procure children for Savile. The report said: "This investigation has … not found any evidence of any procurement of boys or girls for Jimmy Savile connected to Dryburn Hospital."The allegations … raise the question of whether or not any such procurement took place elsewhere in the North East but that is a matter beyond the remit of this investigation."St Catherine's hospital, BirkenheadA victim, then aged 14, reported that in 1964 Savile jumped into bed with her and touched her inappropriately.The report found her "credible and convincing" but no other victims have come forward.Saxondale hospital, NottinghamOne victim alleged that Savile pulled up her skirt with a hockey stick at a disco. The report said: "There was no reason to doubt that she gave an honest and truthful account of the incident as she recalled it."Royal hospital, PortsmouthA man alleged he had been told by a cleaner that he was abused by Savile while unconscious. But The report said: "The lack of any evidence that corroborates the account of the complainant and the disparities in the accounts given to the police and myself leads me to believe that it is highly unlikely that the alleged incident took place."Dewsbury district hospital / Pinderfields hospital, WakefieldA woman alleged she was sexually assaulted by Savile when she was 15 and an in-patient. Investigators found the woman was actually a patient at Staincliffe hospital, now demolished. They concluded that the incident did take place.The report said: "This allegation related to a disclosure by Ms X that, whilst she was an in-patient on a ward in a hospital in Dewsbury, Savile sexually assaulted her by attempting to lay on top of her and 'French kissing' her. Ms X was 15 years old at the time."The investigators also found that Savile was heard making a lewd remark to a young woman patient at a opening ceremony at Pinderfields Hospital in 2010. The report said: "The investigation into this incident concluded that the ward sister should have reported this incident at the time and the management of official visitors into clinical areas should be improved."Wheatfields hospice, LeedsA woman reported that, as a girl under 16, she was at the opening ceremony of the Sue Ryder-run hospice in 1978.The report said: "He approached her directly, asking her age and what she was doing there, and saying 'squeeze up' as he wanted to sit right next to her. As he sat down, he stroked her leg and, on feeling the suspender belt under her skirt, stared at her before announcing 'grown-up, wearing stockings, goodness gracious me' to the room full of people."The investigators found the woman to be credible.Cardiff royal infirmaryA former patient reported an incident she said happened when she was in her early 20s. Her allegation, according to the report is that: "At midnight on New Year's Eve, Matron (or the night sister) attended the ward with three men. Whilst the nurse stood at the end of the ward with the two men talking, Patient A was approached by an individual believed to be Jimmy Savile."He was dressed in a tracksuit and had long blond hair. He was wearing jewellery and was walking quickly around the ward. He took the patient's left hand and started to kiss it and moved up kissing her arm whilst leaning on the bed. When he got near her shoulder/armpit she felt very uncomfortable and pulled the sheets over herself."Ruth Walker, director of nursing for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: "The health board has conducted an exhaustive investigation into this one case from the 1960s, reviewing hundreds of archived documents over a period going back 50 years and interviewing staff who worked at Cardiff Royal Infirmary at the time."Those efforts have found no documented evidence to support the patient's account or place Jimmy Savile at the hospital during the time in question."Whilst we have no reason to disbelieve the patient, the health board has examined every possible avenue of inquiry and, given the patient's request not to be involved in any further investigations, there is no additional action that can be taken."Great Ormond Street hospital, LondonOn one allegation from more than 40 years ago, the hospital said on Thursday: "Despite rigorous examination of information provided by the informant, the trust has found no evidence that the alleged incident took place."We also found no evidence of Jimmy Savile fundraising on behalf of Great Ormond Street hospital and there were no, and never have been, access arrangements or privileges accorded to Jimmy Savile at Great Ormond Street Hospital."Barnet general hospital (BGH), LondonA former patient said that nurses in 1983 told her Savile "liked to have sex with dead bodies".The report said: "She described having a conversation with the nurses in which they allegedly said they spied on JS when they worked at another hospital and observed him having sex with a dead body."The witness confirmed that this was not something that happened at BGH and she thought that it had happened at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, but could not be certain of that."It concluded: "The conversation reported by the witness happened at BGH, however the incident of JS having sex with dead bodies did not happen at BGH."Booth Hall hospital, ManchesterA woman said she was assaulted by Savile at the hospital in about 1958 when she was about seven or eight-years-old and a patient.

The report said: "He alleges that the nurses told the patients Jimmy Savile was coming to visit and that they were to hide under the covers and pretend to be asleep. Savile then came over to the bed put his hands under the sheets and on to the victim's genitals. The victim alleges he then chased Savile from the ward."The report concluded: "It has not been possible therefore to produce conclusive evidence that the events described by both alleged victims took place."De La Pole hospital, HullAn allegation was made that Savile was witnessed sexually assaulting a teenager who was in traction at the time. But investigators traced the patient, who denied that it happened.Hammersmith hospital, LondonOne allegation was that Savile made inappropriate comments during a visit and another related to an allegation of a serious sexual offence by a senior employee of the hospital.
