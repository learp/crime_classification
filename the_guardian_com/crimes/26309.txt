Long prison sentences for drug barons are ineffective as a deterrent and should be cut by up to two years, according to official proposals published yesterday.Sentences for drug couriers who import small amounts of heroin or cocaine but are very often "naive and vulnerable" women from the developing world are also to be reduced under the recommendations.But the advice, from the panel that draws up sentencing guidelines, says that heavier sentences should be given to dealers who focus on psychiatric hospitals, drug treatment centres and bail hostels, or who try to smuggle drugs into prisons.The proposals feature in a consultation paper published yesterday by the Sentencing Advisory Panel.Its proposals will be considered by the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which is chaired by Sir Igor Judge, the lord chief justice, and includes the director of public prosecutions. The council lays down the sentencing framework for all the courts in England and Wales.Prof Andrew Ashworth, the chairman of the panel, said the point was not that a robust approach to sentencing drug barons was inappropriate: crown court judges were giving longer sentences in the most serious cases of importing drugs than they were for adult rape or causing death by dangerous driving.The panel said that a recent study, based on interviews with 222 convicted serious drug offenders, showed that there was no evidence that long prison sentences had any deterrent effect. Those involved saw jail as an "occupational hazard" and research indicated that they made such large profits they were more concerned about "financial reprisals" by the authorities than possible loss of liberty.The panel said the latest figure for the average sentence for convicted drug importers was 84 months, compared with 79.7 months for rape and 50 months for death by dangerous driving. These figures date from 2004.The panel recommended that the starting point - when sentences are decided for those guilty of the most serious cases of importing or supplying drugs (bringing in at least 5kg of heroin or cocaine, or 50,000 tablets of ecstasy) - should be cut from 14 years to 12 years. The final sentence, depending on the nature of the case, should be in the range of 10 to 14 years.The members advise that the shorter sentences should be accompanied by much more extensive use of asset confiscation orders, which can cover not only ill-gotten gains but also legitimate assets such as houses, cars and yachts. Confiscation orders are only used in one in eight serious drugs cases at the moment.Ashworth said: "Current sentencing levels sometimes go beyond the levels that are justified by the seriousness of individual offences. We have compared them with the starting points for other serious crimes, such as rape and grievous bodily harm, and we want to know what other people think about comparative levels of sentences."He said the sentences they were proposing were more proportionate when drug suppliers also faced the threat of losing the proceeds of their crimes and no longer enjoying lavish lifestyles.In January George Stokes, 62, was sentenced to 16 years for trying to flood London with nearly a million ecstasy tablets, and in December two drug barons, Keith Jeremy and Martin Askew, were ordered to pay back Â£1m after the largest seizure of cocaine in the history of the West Midlands police. But the shadow justice secretary, Dominic Grieve, said that given the government's decision to reclassify cannabis (from class C to the more serious class B), the public would be surprised that it was now being suggested that those who produced, imported and supplied drugs should get shorter sentences. "The last thing we need is yet more mixed messages from Labour on drugs," he said.The panel also suggested that the sentences for drug mules or couriers should be much shorter. Often their role in criminal organisations was a minor one. "They are very often naive, vulnerable, men and women from third world countries whose fates are totally disregarded by those at the top of the drug supply chain," said the panel members.
