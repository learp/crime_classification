People who have never qualified as lawyers could become judges for the first time in England and Wales under moves to be announced today by Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor.University law teachers and legal executives may be considered for the bench, he will tell the Woman Lawyer Forum in London.At present only barristers and solicitors may apply to become judges, usually after seven to 10 years in practice. Legal executives who work in law firms pass exams set by their own institute but are not lawyers.As part of attempts to diversify the judiciary, judges may be allowed to take career breaks to help them "balance their working life with their commitments as parents and carers", Lord Falconer will tell delegates at the forum.Judges at lower levels may also be permitted to sit on the bench for a time and then return to practice, a move forbidden by convention.And lawyers who sit as lay magistrates could be fast-tracked to the judiciary.The moves are designed to attract more women and lawyers from ethnic minorities to a judiciary that remains overwhelmingly white and male. Only 16% of judges are women and just 4% come from ethnic minorities.The initiative also aims to encourage lawyers with disabilities to apply for office.Lord Falconer will tell the forum: "A diverse legal profession is a healthy legal profession. Judicial appointments will continue to be made on merit."But our aim must be to encourage more talented people to apply, whatever their gender, whatever their background. We need to widen the pool of those who wish to become a judge and those who are eligible to do so."From next month, judges in permanent appointments below high court level will be allowed to work part time.A communications campaign will target younger lawyers and encourage students to plan careers aimed ultimately at the bench.Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, said the judiciary was "strongly supportive" of moves to increase diversity.However, it was critical that the desire to increase diversity did not lead to a sacrifice in the maintenance of standards, he warned."We must therefore continue to make clear that the sole criterion for appointment to a judicial office must be merit."
