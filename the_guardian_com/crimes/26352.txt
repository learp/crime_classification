The judge in the Damilola Taylor case yesterday gave the jury instructions about mobile phone records which may suggest the two defendants were more than a mile away when the boy was injured.Defence counsel has claimed that a series of calls made from the defendants' phones soon after Damilola was hurt proves they were not there. Mr Justice Hooper told the jury it could not convict the two brothers accused of murdering Damilola unless it was certain they were not using the phones. The prosecution alleges that the 16-year-old brothers were part of a group which stabbed Damilola, 10, as he walked home from a library in Peckham, south London, in November 2000. As the trial nears its conclusion, the judge, Mr Justice Hooper, reminded the panel that it had been told the 999 call reporting Damilola's injury was made at 4.47pm. It had heard that a phone "associated" with one of the brothers, who can only be identified as Boy A, was used at 4.47pm and another "associated" with Boy B at 4.50pm. Both calls were made more than a mile from Blakes Road, where Damilola was injured. Beginning his closing speech, Mark Dennis, prosecuting, said the crown's case had not changed - though two of the four defendants originally put on trial have already been found not guilty. He alleged the brothers were part of a group of youths known as the Young Peckham Boys who launched a "concerted assault" on Damilola. They had used "gratuitous violence... borne of cruelty and bullying". Mr Dennis reminded the jury it had heard from 16 witnesses who had allegedly heard one or both of the brothers making "damning" remarks in which they admitted being part of a group which attacked Damilola. The brothers deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob. The trial continues.
