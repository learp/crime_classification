Twenty killers and rapists who have been released on parole after serving a life sentence went "missing" and could not be traced by the authorities, the Home Office said yesterday.The lack of contact by prison and probation staff with the group of 20 serious criminals only came to light when Home Office researchers asked for current details of all 138 "discretionary lifers" released between 1992 and 1997.Their report published last night showed that the Home Office's lifer review and recall section and the probation service could not come up with details of 20 of them.In eight cases they said the reasons given were understandable but in the remaining 12 they were "problematic". In four cases the probation area identified by the Home Office lifer unit had no record of the prisoner concerned.The researchers told ministers that the missing cases needed to be traced and an updated database of the whereabouts of all released lifers with details of supervising probation officers should be set up as a priority.The study also said that in the cases of the 118 other released lifers, backup and supervision arrangements were not always in evidence owing to high caseloads and limited resources.The findings are published less than a week after a catalogue of supervision failures were revealed in the case of Damien Hanson who was convicted of the murder of City financier John Monckton, only three months after being released from a 12 year sentence.The Home Office published figures earlier this week showing that reoffending rates among adults released from prison have gone up under Labour from 53% to 58%, despite efforts to end the "revolving door" syndrome of criminals in and out of jail."The whereabouts of a minority of offenders [9%] in the original sample provided by the parole board could not be traced. Given that these offenders have committed grave offences and received life sentences, this is an issue that requires further investigation," said Catherine Appleton and Colin Roberts of Oxford University's centre for criminology, who compiled the report.Those sentenced to discretionary life can include rapists and those convicted of manslaughter and other violent crimes such as armed robbery and GBH. The study looked at what had happened to the the first discretionary lifers to be released by the parole board from 1992 to 1997.The researchers were able to interview the supervising probation officer and analyse the case file in 117 of the 138 cases during their study, carried out in 2002 and 2003. They showed that 53 lifers had been sent back to prison at least once during their release.Eleven had committed a sex crime, six had committed violent offences, and two had carried out further robberies. Others were recalled for "unacceptable behaviour".A Home Office spokesman said the reasons why it had not been possible to trace individuals' details varied but that did not imply that these individuals were lost to the supervision system.But he confirmed that they were only traced after the researchers had revealed they had gone off the official radar."Since the research was undertaken further investigations have traced 11 of the 12 supposedly 'missing' cases. The 12th has a very common name, and without additional information it is not possible to be certain about the identity of this individual," he said.
