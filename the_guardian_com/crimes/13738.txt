A man wearing a Phantom of the Opera-style mask and wig has stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death and then turned the knife on himself, according to police and witnesses.The 23-year-old woman was at work as a receptionist at St George's International College in Plaistow, east London, when she was attacked last night. She received stab wounds to the neck and chest and died at the scene. A second woman, a friend and colleague at the private college for international students, was also attacked during the incident but managed to escape and call for help. According to witnesses, she ran out of the building screaming: "He's killing her."A 29-year-old man is under police guard in hospital today, after being arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.Police said he was seen just before the attack wearing a curly black wig and a mask similar to that worn by the lead character in the musical the Phantom of the Opera. When police arrived at the scene just after 6pm yesterday, the attacker tried to take his own life, stabbing himself in the neck.Detective Chief Inspector Bob Mahoney, who is leading the investigation, praised the bravery of the officers who tackled the man. He said: "I would like to pay tribute to the bravery of the first officers on the scene who, with little regard to their own safety, ran inside and disarmed the suspect of the knife he was holding. They then made the arrest."The dead woman has not been named but is thought to be from Dagenham, east London. It has been reported that the attacker was her former boyfriend.Officers are at the hospital bedside of the suspect and will transfer him to a police station when his condition improves. Scotland Yard said detectives were not looking for anyone else in connection with the attack.
