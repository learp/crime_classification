Two men have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a young mother who vanished while walking to her parents' home almost 21 years ago.The arrests were made in Coventry, West Midlands, as a detailed search continued of parkland off Purcell Road for the remains of Nicola Payne, 18, who was the mother of a seven-month-old son.West Midlands police said on Wednesday that the men, aged 74 and 45, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to prevent the lawful and decent burial of a body.Detective Chief Inspector Matt Markham said the arrests of the men, both from Coventry, were directly linked to information police had been given on Tuesday.He said: "News of these arrests may cause people to reconsider their position and if they haven't so far felt able to come forward with information, then I would urge them to now do so in light of these arrests."We're committed to investigating any new information with the aim of bringing closure to Nicola's family, who have endured a painful and traumatic 21 years since her disappearance."Police said her relatives were being kept informed as the investigation progressed.The two men are being held in police stations in Coventry where they will be questioned by detectives in connection with Nicola's disappearance.Detailed searches of an area of parkland in the city were continuing after preliminary searches by police and scientists found areas of interest. These areas will be examined further by a team of 30 officers using specialist equipment including metal-detecting devices, trained dogs and x-ray. Scientists from the Home Office centre for applied science and technology were also attending the scene.The site where police are focusing their search is a few hundred metres away from where Nicola was last seen, close to the home she shared with her parents and her seven-month old son, Owen.An area of land behind flats on Purcell Road was cordoned off by police early on Tuesday.Payne went missing from the Wood End area of the city on 14 December 1991 on her way from her boyfriend's home in Winston Avenue to her parents' house.Since her disappearance her family has campaigned relentlessly to find out what happened.Speaking in 2007, her son, who is now 21, described how he had missed out on memories with his mother."During my early years at school I wished that my mum could meet me at the school gates after school to collect me, as other mums did with my friends. School plays, sports days and open days - there was no mum there to spoil me."My dad and all the family were always loving and caring, but it wasn't the same."In a statement, Nicola's family said: "It has been nearly 21 years since our daughter Nicola went missing. For many years we have suffered not knowing what has happened to her. This demonstrates that there are people still providing vital and important information to the price around her disappearance."If there is anyone who has information that will assist the police around this new site or witnessed anything around this location back in December 1991 please make contact with the officers. We are appealing as a family to find Nicola and to give us the clue we deserve."In 2007, a man was arrested in connection with her disappearance and released on bail. No one has ever been charged in connection with the case.
