There were five separate sightings of a potential suspect connected to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, according to British detectives hired by the family to find their missing daughter.

Photograph: Channel 4/APThree were of a man seen behaving suspiciously outside the McCann's apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in the day's before the abduction on 3 May 2007.The other two were of a man observed carrying a sleeping girl, who was not wearing shoes, away from the holiday complex.The full tally of witnesses who spotted what may have been the same suspect is revealed in a Channel 4 television documentary broadcast tonight and commissioned to coincide with the second anniversary of her disappearance. Most of them have been previously publicised.More than Â£100,000 has been spent by the Find Madeleine Fund on translating the documents released by the official Portuguese police inquiry.Former detective inspector Dave Edgar, who served with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Cheshire force, and former detective sergeant Arthur Cowley, from Merseyside police, are reinvestigating the crime.As well as featuring a new image of what Madeleine would look like now, at the age of six, the film shows an artist's impression of the man seen outside the family's apartment.In the programme, Madeleine's mother, Kate, is seen talking to the two detectives, saying: "So it looks like we have got five sightings really. Two [of] a man with a child and three just a suspicious individual."Edgar replies: "There's three of exactly the same location. I don't know what the Portuguese authorities have done to eliminate these people from the inquiry. So we have to presume they haven't done it and go with that."As a former policeman, Edgar's view is that: "Abduction is the most likely motive, most likely done by an individual who has close links with Praia da Luz."The Cutting Edge documentary, Madeleine Was Here, is broadcast at 9pm on Channel 4.
