A man who used a JCB digger to bulldoze his landlord's house during a "frenzy of destruction" that caused more than £300,000 worth of damage was jailed for six years yesterday.Chelmsford crown court heard that Robert Taylor, 53, of Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, "completely lost it" after James Harvard and Janice Gledhill asked him to leave the campsite where he lived.Taylor claimed he had bought the pitch and caravan for £38,000 but had only been offered £14,000. Feeling he had been "ripped off", Taylor hired the digger and drove to Mr Harvard and Ms Gledhill's house early on the morning of June 27. Ms Gledhill saw him arrive and called the police, but Taylor set about wrecking their £260,000 bungalow. Taylor admitted destroying the house and being reckless as to whether life was endangered.He also admitted destroying a Chrysler Crossfire and a Chrysler C300 - together worth £50,000 - destroying a police car and assaulting a policeman.Police officers eventually managed to wrestle Taylor from the cab but he collapsed with suspected heart problems and had to be taken to hospital.The house was left in ruins with furniture, food cans and possessions piled in six metre (20ft) heaps of rubble.The court heard that three weeks before, Taylor had been given a 24-month community order for harassing his ex-partner and threatening members of the public with a pick axe.In May he received an 18-month community order for damaging property after using a tractor to force his ex-partner's son off of the road.Judge Anthony Goldstaub QC said Taylor's "frenzy of destruction" had been "calculated and planned".He said: "You systematically smashed and destroyed the bungalow ripping off much of its roof ... and reducing it mostly to rubble. You have since shown some, but only little remorse." Speaking after the hearing, Ms Gledhill described the sentence as "atrocious".
