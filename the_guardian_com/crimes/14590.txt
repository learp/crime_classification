A search is under way tonight for an 18-month-old girl, who was taken from a police station by a mystery woman.Scotland Yard released CCTV footage of the woman seen at Walworth police station in south east London, saying she was a friend of the toddler's mother.The girl, Audrey Nyanor, is black and of Ghanaian heritage, according to police.Metropolitan police said the child went missing after officers went to an address in De Laune Street, Walworth, on Thursday to make inquiries about a man wanted for failing to appear at court.He was not at home at the time, but police arrested the girl's 36-year-old mother in connection with alleged immigration offences.The mother and child were taken to Walworth police station, where officers spoke to family members and friends to arrange for Audrey to be looked after.Police said: "A woman attended the police station purporting to be a 46-year-old friend of the mother."The details she gave to police corresponded with the name of the woman Audrey's mother had told police would pick up her daughter, and as a result she left the police station with the child."Subsequently it became apparent that the woman was not the same person who had been organised to pick up the child."Whilst there is no evidence at this stage to suggest that Audrey has come to any harm we are very concerned that she remains missing and we are making every effort to ensure she is safely returned."When last seen she was wearing pink trousers, pink coat and a multicoloured pink and white hat.Audrey's mother was later released on bail.Six people have been arrested in connection with the investigation.
