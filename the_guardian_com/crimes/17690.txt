From November 2010, parents and volunteer adults who drive other people's children to sports or social clubs will have to register with the Home Office's Independent Safeguarding Authority under the Vetting and Barring Scheme set up in the wake of the Soham murders. A failure to do so could result in prosecution and fine for an unregistered adult, with the club facing a fine of up to Â£5,000 for the offence.Opposition politicians and others who will be affected by the new regulations have been quick to express dismay and criticise the scheme, fearing that it will deter parents from helping with children's activities and will foster intrusive and insulting suspicions about well-meaning volunteers. Child protection professionals and children's campaigners, however, point out that child sexual abuse is more common than is generally known or accepted and is most likely to occur at the hands of an adult whom the child already knows, making this new measure wise and necessary.What do you think? Is it a classic case of politicians needing to be seen to do something in the wake of one or two high-profile paedophile crimes, or a case of the "nanny state gone mad"? Or should we be realistic about the incidence of child sexual abuse and accept such safeguards, knowing how outraged we would be if our own child were to be molested by an unregistered adult driving them to a football match?
