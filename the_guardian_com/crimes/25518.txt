Jon Venables, one of the boys responsible for killing the toddler James Bulger 20 years ago, has been granted parole after having been jailed a second time on child pornography charges.A spokesman for the parole board said: "We have had confirmation that all parties have been told and we can confirm that it was a release decision. He will be released." A date has not been announced.James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, has reacted to the news with disbelief, tweeting: "Just don't believe what I've got 2 go through. AGAIN." Earlier this year, both Fergus and James' father, Ralph Bulger, had pressed the parole board to keep Venables in prison.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said that the parole board acts independently to decide on the release of life-licenced offenders once its satisfied they can be managed in the community: "Their life licence lasts for the rest of their lives, and they may be recalled to prison at any time for breaching their licence conditions. Additionally, they will be subject to strict controls and restrictions for as long as their risk requires them."Venables was 10 years old when he and his classmate Robert Thompson, also 10, abducted and murdered three-year-old James Bulger in 1993.Venables and Thompson were released on licence in 2001 and given new identities due to the notoriety and outrage caused by their crime.In 2010 Venables had his parole revoked and was jailed for downloading and distributing indecent images of children.Bulger's solicitor, Robin Makin, said on Thursday: "Ralph Bulger and the paternal family of James Bulger are disappointed and dismayed to have been advised that the parole board have decided to release Jon Venables back into society."In 2011 the parole board determined that it was 'not safe' for Jon Venables to be released. It is not known what has changed. No reasons for the decision have been given."For Ralph and his family the living nightmare continues and is exacerbated by the problems now created by the reckless decision to free Jon Venables without any publicly disclosed safeguards."Jon Venables is a sex offender who has murdered once and made it clear when posing as the mother of a child that an 'ultimate thrill' for him was the sexual abuse of a child."The authorities have already experimented with Jon Venables living a lie and it did not work."
