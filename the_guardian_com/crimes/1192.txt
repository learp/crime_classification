"They meant everything to me and I loved them with all my heart. They have been taken from me and my whole family is in pain. They are irreplaceable. I just want them back."We have so many good memories. We all used to sing together and go shopping. I was so proud to walk down the street with my two beautiful daughters - they were so clever."He said Davina had been close to finishing her GCSEs and had wanted to become a social worker, while Jasmine was academically gifted and worked hard at school. "Both the girls had a sharp sense of humour," he added. "I hope they are at peace.
