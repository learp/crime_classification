Charlie Gilmour, son of the Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, has been committed for trial over the attack on a royal convoy of cars during a student fees protest.The 21-year-old Cambridge University student made a brief three-minute appearance at City of Westminster magistrates court where his case was adjourned to Southwark crown court on 26 April.Gilmour is accused of violent disorder during the student tuition fees protest on 9 December, when a car carrying Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, was attacked on its way to the royal variety performance in London's West End.He allegedly threw a rubbish bin at one vehicle containing the prince's security officers, and sat on the bonnet of the same car.He was remanded on bail with the condition he must not enter the City of Westminster without approval. His solicitor indicated the charge would be contested.Gilmour, who spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth, was among thousands of people who protested in Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square and was photographed hanging from a union flag on the Cenotaph during the march.He issued an apology the day after the demonstrations, describing it as a "moment of idiocy", and added he did not realise the Whitehall monument commemorated Britain's war dead.Gilmour's biological father is the poet and playwright Heathcote Williams but he was adopted by the rock star when his mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson, remarried.
