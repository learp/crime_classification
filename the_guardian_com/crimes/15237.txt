A patient of the serial killer Harold Shipman asked his relatives not to leave him alone with the doctor - whom he described as the angel of death.Kenneth Smith became increasingly sceptical about the medical profession after the death of his 76-year-old brother, Sidney, during a visit by Shipman in August 1996. Shortly before Christmas that year, he said to his niece: "Don't let him come here. He's the angel of death." Two days later, on December 17 1996, Kenneth Smith, 73, was found dead. His neighbours, Tommy and Elsie Cheetham, also died in their adjoining terrace homes in Hyde after they were visited by Shipman. Tommy, 78, died on December 4 1996 and Elsie, 76, died in April 1997. The Smiths' nephew, Stephen Phelps, told the Shipman inquiry in Manchester yesterday that following the death of Tommy Cheetham, Kenneth Smith had referred to Shipman as "Dr Death" and "angel of death". When Mr Smith died, Shipman pronounced him dead at 4pm, but he made a computer record of the death 15 minutes earlier at his surgery. Mr Phelps said his other uncle, Sidney Smith, had been happy and contented and he had cooked meals for his less mobile younger brother and fetched shopping for him. Days before his sudden death, Sidney had been on a trip to Southport with some of his family and had walked along the promenade and gone shopping. But the following week he collapsed and died during a visit by Shipman. His brother Kenneth had gone into their kitchen to give them some privacy. Within five minutes, Shipman told him Sidney was very poorly and needed to go to hospital. He called him into the living room a minute later, pronounced that Kenneth had "gone" and left abruptly. Shipman's medical notes of Elsie Cheetham's death five months later said: "Elsie Cheetham - funny do." Shipman was given 15 life sentences last year for the murder of 15 of his patients by lethal injection of diamorphine. The public inquiry into his crimes is expected to take at least two years.
