Fathers raising concerns about their ex-partner's new boyfriends are one of the largest groups applying for public disclosure of details of convicted child sex offenders under a newly completed pilot scheme.Home Office ministers will today confirm the national rollout of the child sex offender disclosure scheme - known as Sarah's law - to 18 police forces this August, followed by the remaining 21 forces across England and Wales by March 2011.The decision follows the independent evaluation of a Â£600,000 pilot scheme in four police forces areas which saw 311 formal applications from parents and carers that resulted in the disclosure of the background of 21 convicted child sex offenders.The evaluation by Leicester De Montfort University said the pilot scheme had provided the public with a formal mechanism for asking for information about individuals who have unsupervised access to children and may be convicted sex offenders.The scheme was explained to all resident registered sex offenders in each area who were assured that it would not lead to their names and addresses appearing in the local press. The researchers found no evidence of offenders going underground or of any serious breaches of confidentiality taking place.The research did however reveal that while the majority of applications were made after hearing gossip or rumour - termed third-party information - about individuals, the next largest group came from fathers registering concerns about their ex-wife or partner's new boyfriend.When the pilot scheme was launched ministers suggested that it might help women who were lone parents to reassure themselves about new boyfriends. But the experience appears to show that it may have become the latest revenge tactic to be used when parents break up. The next largest group of applications came from grandparents or other family members worried about a new boyfriend.Police and probation staff voiced doubts that the pilot scheme added much to existing arrangements to monitor convicted sex offenders in the community but some of those involved said it had "sharpened up" child protection work and encouraged the public to voice their concerns.The small number of disclosures that took place - 21 out of 311 applications - showed that the scheme's main benefit was to reassure those who had anxieties about individuals in their neighbourhoods.Disclosure can only be made to those who are parents, carers or guardians of children who are then banned from passing the information on.The Home Office said the 21 disclosure decisions had led to 60 children being protected from potential abuse. The pilot scheme in each area was accompanied by a public education campaign on the issues surrounding the management of child sex offenders in the community.In a further 11 cases disclosures were made about criminal background of individuals with a history of violence rather than sex offending.Researchers cited a case in which a parent who made an application after a neighbour tried to befriend their children by offering them sweets. Checks showed he was a sex offender subject to a court order banning him from being in contact with anyone under the age of 18. He was subsequently arrested and remanded in custody.Sara Payne, who campaigned for "Sarah's law" after the murder of her daughter Sarah by a convicted paedophile, said the evaluation had shown the huge benefits of increased but controlled access to information."The input of the police, children's charities and academics to the pilots has ensured consensus has been reached and we are working together to keep children safe," she said.The four police forces that took part in the pilot were Cambridgeshire, Cleveland, Hampshire and Warwickshire. They will all continue with the scheme.
