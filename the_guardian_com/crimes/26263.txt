The man serving life for the hammer murders of Lin and Megan Russell has been granted leave to appeal against his conviction, his solicitor said yesterday.Michael Stone's legal team argued at a hearing at the court of appeal last week that adverse publicity and an unreliable witness, who claimed Stone confessed to the killings while in jail, meant he did not receive a fair trial in 2001. Yesterday solicitor Derek Hayward said Mr Justice Treacy had ruled that Stone should be given leave to appeal based on the argument centred on witness Damien Daley, but not on adverse publicity. Stone was given three life sentences in October 2001 for murdering Lin and Megan Russell and attempting to murder Megan's sister Josie, who survived. Mr Hayward said: "I hope that we will be able to quash his conviction because he continues to maintain his innocence. The cell confession, we say, was unreliable." At the trial, Mr Daley told the jury he heard a voice coming through the pipe-work at Canterbury prison confessing to the killings in Chillenden, Kent, in 1996. Mr Daley claimed the voice was Stone's but last week's hearing was told there was no evidence to support the claims. It was argued before Mr Justice Treacy that Mr Daley's evidence should have been excluded, or that the jury should have been given a firmer warning about its possible unreliability. Stone was convicted of the murders though there was no forensic evidence linking him to the attack on Dr Russell, 45, and her daughters as they walked home from a swimming gala in July 1996.
