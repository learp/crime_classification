Police on Merseyside announced yesterday that they will not take legal action against the widow of a British man who killed himself with a fatal dose of barbiturates at a Swiss clinic. Reginald Crew, 74, travelled to Zurich in January with his wife Wyn, 71, after deciding that he no longer wished to live with the increasingly debilitating effects of motor neurone disease. His death was made possible by Dignitas, a charity which helps the terminally ill commit suicide in Switzerland, where euthanasia is legal. He was examined by a doctor and taken to a special apartment where he was given a lethal dose of drugs. Merseyside Police launched an investigation into whether Mrs Crew had broken the law by helping her husband to travel to Switzerland from his home in Halewood, Liverpool. The force today announced it has no plans to take the matter further. "It is clear that Reginald Crew, after a long and traumatic illness, decided to commit suicide," Merseyside's chief constable, Norman Bettison, said. "Following our initial investigation, I am satisfied that there is no evidence to warrant prosecution of any member of Reginald Crew's family, or any other person in connection with his death." Mr Bettison said that Mr Crew's death had been seen by millions of people on television. "People were able to hear him speak directly about the impact of his illness and his reasons for wanting to take his own life." He added: "All of the subsequent investigations confirm that his decision was a rational one, taken by him alone and his death was not assisted in any substantial way by anyone under the rule of British law. "Mrs Wyn Crew and her family have lived with Reginald Crew's declining health over recent years and have supported him throughout this difficult time. "Wyn and her family have my sympathy. Their patience with, and their assistance to, the police investigation has been appreciated. I hope that they may now find peace."
