A woman has fled court before being sentenced for urinating and committing a sex act on a war memorial – the fourth case of its kind in Britain within a year.A warrant was issued for the arrest of 32-year-old Wendy Lewis, who arrived at court with her head under a hooded fleece as a dozen veterans slow-handclapped.Blackpool town magistrates earlier heard that police had been called by CCTV operators who saw Lewis urinate next to a poppy wreath at the town's main Cenotaph memorial near the seafront in June. When police arrived she was giving oral sex to a "straggly-haired man" who has not been identified.Lewis was described as "the most disgusting woman in Britain" by the former head of Blackpool's Royal British Legion branch, Ian Coleman, 71, who joined the group of protesters outside court. The sentence hearing coincided with memorial events to mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.Arriving late, Lewis elbowed cameras aside and swore back when several servicemen shouted the word "disgusting" before she went inside the building. She spent only 15 minutes in the courthouse before absconding.At the earlier hearing her solicitor David Charnely admitted that she had initially denied the sex offence but later changed her story and apologised.He told magistrates: "She had been drinking but now realises how much offence she has caused the public and what she has done."Jim Mowbray, prosecuting, said: "This offence has attracted a great of anger, particularly amongst servicemen and women and their families. It shows a complete lack of respect."Protesters in Blackpool called for a punitive sentence following the succession of convictions relating to war memorials. There was outrage in November when student Philip Laing, 19, was caught urinating on a first world war memorial in Sheffield, and later when factory worker Ian Marshall, 49, admitted outraging public decency by urinating beside a memorial in Leeds.Last month there were protests from veterans when 19-year-old Douglas Tullin was fined £50 for urinating on the war memorial in central Newcastle upon Tyne.Jim Holdsworth, 68, a Conservative councillor in Blackpool who was in the army for 25 years, said: "Enough is enough. We need to send out a message that this is totally unacceptable and is a definite insult to all the public."
