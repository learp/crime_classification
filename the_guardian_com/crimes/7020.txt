Hundreds of Chinese workers were kept in virtual slavery for years as part of a multimillion-pound pirate DVD industry uncovered in the UK.The men and women, many of whom lived 11 to a room, were the labour behind an organised crime syndicate that began on a market stall in Hackney, east London, and grew into a £5m illegal industry.The syndicate produced thousands of DVDs in houses and a shop in east London before expanding into a large factory in Walthamstow, east London, which investigators said was the first rogue DVD plant in western Europe to be identified. Mass-production factories on this scale are usually found in the far east and Russia, police said.The family that ran the cartel were convicted last week of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of film piracy and conspiracy to produce pirate DVDs after a £1.5m police surveillance operation.Detective Constable Evelyn Steeples, who was part of the team involved, said the case revealed the huge profits that could be made from organised crime. She said the manufacture of pirate DVDs, most of which are sold on street corners and in pubs across the UK, was not a victimless crime."Over the three years hundreds of Chinese people worked for them. They don't speak English, they live in poor communities, and they are extremely vulnerable," Steeples said. "The year before last there were three murders of DVD sellers. These are the invisible people, they pay around £20,000 to be brought over here, they are in debt bondage, they get abused, they get kidnapped off the street and they live in slave-like conditions."Brothers Sami and Rafi Asghar Sheikh, 28 and 26, and their father, Khalid, 51, of north Chingford, will be sentenced this month along with Xin Li, 34, from east London, who was convicted of concealing the proceeds of crime.
