One of Britain's main underground fuel pipelines has been shut while police investigate whether at least 30,000 litres of diesel has been siphoned from it.Two men were arrested after a quantity of diesel was discovered in a warehouse at West Wellow, Hampshire, 11 miles from Southampton. The fuel is thought to have been stolen from the Midline pipeline.The 35cm diameter pipeline – built in 1980 – runs 130 miles from Esso's refinery in Fawley, Hampshire, to the West Midlands.A Hampshire police spokesman said men aged 32 and 34 were arrested in Salisbury on Sunday on suspicion of conspiracy to steal fuel and were in custody for questioning. They can be held until 6.30am on Tuesday morning.The spokesman added: "Lines of inquiry include establishing the exact amount of fuel stolen and examining the suspected sophisticated method used in this alleged theft."The discovery was made by the unit's owner at around 7.30pm on Thursday. It is believed to have been illegally obtained."The exact quantity and circumstances surrounding the accumulation of fuel are central to the investigation, and detectives are focusing on identifying those responsible."Police said engineers from Fawley refinery were working to "retrieve" the diesel.An Esso spokesman said: "Esso is assisting Hampshire police with their inquiries following the discovery of a store of fuel … early indications suggest the fuel may have come from a nearby Esso pipeline. Investigations continue."Esso is committed to the very highest standards of safety. The pipeline has therefore been closed down and our specialists are working to check it and, if necessary, effect any repair. We will not resume operations of the pipeline until this work is complete."
