Ten children in the UK have been rescued over the past year after being traced from photos on the internet showing them being abused.The 10 children were among 76 rescued from abuse or the direct threat of it by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) over the past year. Many of the children were identified by their faces, which were matched to an electronic database of those at risk or through clues in the images themselves. "We treat the images as photos of a crime scene," said a Ceop spokeswoman. "Our identification team looks at anything and everything in a photo of an abused child that may provide clues to their location and when the abuse took place."The figures on children rescued from abuse were published today in the first annual report by Ceop, an agency set up to protect children from abuse both online and elsewhere. The organisation, a branch of Britain's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, focuses on finding abusers who operate over the internet.The agency said in its annual report that its investigations had also led to the arrests of 83 child sex offenders and disrupted three large international paedophile rings - all with UK connections.Jim Gamble, head of Ceop, said his officers were currently dealing with 3,000 cases of child abuse. He said: "Our suspect pool is focused on those individuals who go online and operate at the top level, who are trying to engage and lure children. They are involved in paedophile rings who share information about where you can access a child in the real world."
