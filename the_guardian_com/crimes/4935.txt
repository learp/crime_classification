The name of a teenage suspect in the murder of Rhys Jones, shot dead in Liverpool, has been given in a posting on the video website YouTube, detectives said yesterday.Police confirmed that the site features the name of a suspect still at large more than two months after the 11-year-old was shot in the neck walking home from playing football in Croxteth on August 22.The name appears in a comment section of the site attached to a four-minute video showing hooded members of a gang pointing guns, faces concealed with caps and balaclavas. One comment asks: "Why do you all call them child murderers? Rhys was hit by a stray bullet; it was not intentional."Detective Superintendent Dave Kelly, the senior investigating officer, said his force was trying to remove the name from the site. "What interests me is evidence. This is a meticulous investigation, and I don't deal in speculation. It is not enough to have a name, you have to know why that person has been named and make a judgment from there," he said. A YouTube spokesman said it had "clear policies prohibiting inappropriate content."Last night officers made fresh efforts to trace witnesses to the murder, carried out by a hooded youth on a bike outside the Fir Tree pub. They repeated a reconstruction on BBC Crimewatch, and revealed a text message appeal for information to any mobile within a 100-yard radius of a van equipped with the technology; the message also asks about the bike, and about a boy aged 13 to 14 on a silver BMX seen at the murder scene and at a vigil on September 2.There have been 18 arrests so far in the case, but no charges. Police are still hunting for the gun.
