A schoolfriend of the teenager who was stabbed to death in Oxford Street, central London, during the Boxing Day sales, has named him as 18-year-old Seydou Diarrassouba.The victim, said to be from Mitcham, south-west London, was knifed during a confrontation at a Foot Locker store, collapsing on the pavement outside in front of horrified shoppers near Bond Street underground station.Hours later, another youth was stabbed in the leg on the same street near Oxford Circus station.Munawar Shaikh, 20, who went to school with Diarrassouba, described him as a "big personality" who always had a smile on his face. He heard about his friend's death on social networking sites.Detectives appealed for witnesses with mobile phone footage of the incident to contact police, as they investigated whether the fatal stabbing was gang- related and whether the second knifing, which happened at 6.20pm, was linked to the first.Eleven people were arrested at the scene as a fight broke out following the first stabbing at 1.45pm.Amateur video footage of police remonstrating with several angry youths as paramedics attempted to revive the victim have been posted online.One video, posted on YouTube, appears to show an officer using a Taser on one of the youngsters, who is seen apparently exchanging shoves with police.A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that an officer had discharged a Taser. Police found a number of weapons from the first crime scene, thought to include a 3in (7cm) lock-knife found in a road nearby.Speaking outside Scotland Yard on Tuesday, Detective Superintendent John Sweeney said: "There were several people who witnessed this event, both inside and outside the store. A number recorded it on camera phone, and we are particularly interested in those people coming forward so we have access to that footage. But also – to anyone else who saw what took place inside and outside the store – we want them to come forward and assist us in establishing exactly what took place."Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne, the senior investigating officer from the Metropolitan police's homicide command, said: "There appears to have been two groups of young people opposing each other and involved in this incident."A Facebook page called R.I.P Seydou has been set up for friends to pay tribute to Diarrassoub.One message, posted by Justin Osei, said: "R.I.P man its not gonna be the same not seeing you around you were almost like a monument to mitcham, sad times."Police said three men had been arrested in connection with the second stabbing. Inspector Bruce Middlemiss said on Boxing Day that that shoppers should not feel unsafe, but police would conduct a review. The area was cordoned off, and some stores closed, but the street opened again on Tuesday morning."There is a high police presence here – we have a number of operations in place already for the shopping times because we were aware of the amount of people who would be here," Middlemiss said on Monday."We are going to go back and review the intelligence for both incidents and see if we need to increase the police presence here, but at the moment we are not concerned for ordinary members of the public who are shopping."Richard Dickinson, chief executive of the New West End Company, which represents retailers in the Oxford Street area, said the organisation was shocked by the stabbings and that such incidents were "extremely rare" in the area.He said the company had called for an early meeting with the deputy mayor of London, Kit Malthouse, and senior operational commanders, to ensure such incidences were "not repeated".Dickinson said all shops had opened as normal on Oxford Street on Tuesday morning except for Foot Locker.
