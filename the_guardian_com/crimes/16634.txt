An 18-year-old man has been jailed for nine years after admitting to committing “hideous” sex crimes against seven girls in Rotherham, police said.Corie Adams pleaded guilty to a string of charges at Sheffield crown court relating to girls aged between 12 and 14.South Yorkshire police said the offences took place in the town between January last year and early this year.Adams, formerly from Maltby, Rotherham, appeared before the court earlier this week charged with 11 child sexual offences, including two counts of sexual activity with a child, three counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and two counts of causing a child to watch a sexual act.These charges related to two 13-year-olds and two 14-year-olds; Adams pleaded guilty to all charges.In previous court hearings Adams admitted to four counts of sexual activity with a child, one count of rape and one count of grooming. These related to a further three girls, aged between 12 and 14.Adams was jailed on Friday morning and placed on the sex offender register for life.DI John Fitzgibbons had previously said Adams’s guilty pleas did not “lessen the awful impact his hideous crimes have had on [the victims’] lives”.Speaking after sentencing, the officer said: “Adams has been remanded since earlier this year because of the risk he posed to young people in Rotherham, and the sentence passed down to him today reflects the gravity of his crimes.“He is now behind bars for a lengthy period of time.“I hope this allows his victims, who have shown incredible bravery throughout our investigation, an opportunity to begin to heal from this horrific abuse with the support of specialist agencies.“It takes such courage to come forward and report sexual abuse and I hope that if there are other victims out there, they feel that they can come forward and report what happened to them, knowing there are officers and other agencies out there who will do all they can to put offenders behind bars.”
