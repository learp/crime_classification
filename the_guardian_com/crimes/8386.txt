The jury trying five people in connection with the Morecambe Bay cockling tragedy today visited the scene of the disaster.Jurors were given a narrated hovercraft trip around the Hest Bank area of the Lancashire bay, seeing at first hand the area in which at least 21 Chinese cockle pickers drowned on the night of February 5 last year.Wearing wellington boots and waterproof coats, the Preston crown court jury of 10 men and two women, along with barristers and a judge, were led across a pebble path and wet marshland to the 20-seat hovercraft.Today's weather conditions were in stark contrast to the cold, wet and windy night when the cocklers, all illegal immigrants from China, met their deaths.A total of 21 bodies of men and women aged between 18 and 45, were recovered from the water surrounding Warton Sands. A further two bodies have never been found.The cocklers' alleged gangmaster, 29-year-old Lin Liang Ren, from Liverpool, denies 21 counts of manslaughter. He also denies perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to facilitate illegal immigration.His 20-year-old girlfriend, Zhao Xiao Qing, from Liverpool, denies perverting the course of justice and facilitation. Lin Mu Yong, 31, also from Liverpool, denies facilitation. Father and son David Anthony Eden Snr, 62, from Irby, Merseyside and David Anthony Eden Jnr, 34, from Prenton, Merseyside, also deny facilitation.A number of police officers, some mounted, patrolled the area around today's site visit, warning off dog walkers and keeping the jurors away from the large media presence.Before the jury boarded the hovercraft, Mike Guy, the operations manager of Morecambe lifeboat station, pointed out a signpost carrying warnings about "quicksand and fast rising tides". The warnings were in place on the night the cocklers died. Other laminated signs had been put up since, the jurors were told.Once on board, the jurors were taken to an area of raised ground called Priest Skear, where the only successful rescue of the tragedy took place.Yesterday, the court saw a video from a rescue helicopter, which showed cockler Li Hua stuck on Priest Skear after he had desperately tried to save a drowning friend. The tape showed him waving his arms frantically from the sandbank, which was being engulfed by the rapidly rising tide.He was eventually rescued by a lifeboat after the rescue helicopter found him and shone a searchlight on him, but his friend, whom he called Brother Wen, drowned.The jurors stepped off the hovercraft onto Priest Skear and were also shown the Keer channel - one of the two channels in that part of the bay to regularly change course and quickly fill up with water when the tide comes in. The hovercraft then took the jury to a second position, around two miles out, to see exactly where the cocklers had been working that night.After a short shore break, they were taken out for a second time to witness the tide coming in and gradually covering the sand. They were shown the Kent and Keer Channels, seeing how the water rapidly filled them up and covering the cockle beds.The jurors were then brought back to the shore and will return to Preston crown court tomorrow morning for the fourth day of the trial.The case continues.
