Two youths were yesterday arrested by detectives hunting the killers of 10-year-old Damilola Taylor, the Nigerian boy stabbed in the leg as he walked home in Peckham, south-east London.The youths, aged 13 and 14, were arrested at separate homes in Peckham at 6.30am and taken to a police station in south London where they remained until their release on police bail last night.A spokesman for Scotland Yard confirmed the teenagers had not been arrested before. Yesterday's arrests brought the number questioned about Damilola to 15-14 teenage boys and a 39-year-old woman. Damilola bled to death in a stairwell on the North Peckham estate minutes after he was stabbed in the left leg, severing the femoral artery. He was attacked in Blake's Road as he walked home from an after-school computer class at Peckham library. Witnesses saw three youths running from the scene. None of them has come forward. Damilola's parents believe their son was being bullied at Oliver Goldsmith primary school. Seventy officers and support staff have been assigned to the murder squad, which is led by Detective Chief Inspector Trevor Shepheard.
