The man accused of murdering aspiring model Sally Anne Bowman admitted having sex with her corpse but denied killing her, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.The court heard that Mark Dixie, 37, claimed to have chanced upon the 18-year-old's near-naked, lifeless body in the early morning of September 25 2005 and under the influence of drink and drugs, had sexual intercourse with her while she lay in a pool of blood in her driveway in Croydon, south-west London.But the prosecution said this defence was "a ludicrous claim born of desperation" and a "smokescreen" and alleged that Dixie, a father of three, planned and carried out Bowman's murder.Motivated by his own sexual gratification, Dixie stabbed the victim at least seven times, possibly with one of the knives he used in his job as a chef, said prosecutor Brian Altman. Then he had sex with her bloodied body, biting her savagely, before leaving the scene.In his opening address, Altman warned the jury he could not spare them the detail of this "horrific" attack, presenting them with photos of the "grim reality" of what happened to Bowman.He also took the unusual step of revealing to the jury Dixie's history of sexually motivated violence.In 1988, aged 17, Dixie was convicted of indecent assault and causing actual bodily harm to a woman who had befriended his then girlfriend.Since he was arrested for Bowman's murder in June 2006, his DNA has been linked to an unsolved rape and stabbing carried out in Australia in 1998, when he was living and working there.Altman said he was permitted to reveal these two incidents to "undermine" Dixie's defence, to prove that what happened in Croydon in 2005 was "far from an opportunistic occurrence".Bowman, a hairdresser who was hoping to be a model, had just turned 18 when she was stabbed to death outside her own home after being dropped off by her boyfriend.She had been on a night out in Croydon with one of her three sisters on the evening of the attack.Dixie's semen was discovered in various parts of Bowman's body. She had been stabbed so brutally the knife blade had passed through her neck and abdomen, coming out the other side, the jury heard. Bite marks were found on her body.Her clothes were gathered around her waist but her bra and underwear were missing along with her white Prada handbag said the prosecution. These items have never been found.When Dixie was arrested, nine months after the murder, police found a digital camera among his possessions. On it, they found a video file showing a pornographic film being played on a television, while a man records himself masturbating over a copy of the Daily Mail bearing a photograph of Bowman.Police later discovered a copy of the Daily Mail of March 22 2006 which had a "sticky substance" on the front page featuring Bowman.DNA analysis proved this to be Dixie's semen."This was not a simple act of sexual gratification," said Altman, addressing the jury. "You will recall that the defendant's case is that he was not the person to have killed Sally Anne, although he does assert that he had sexual intercourse with her after her death."You will want to ask the question, if that was an honest claim, following the realisation that Sally Anne had been murdered in the most horrific of circumstances by some other person (as he would have it), months later, would he then seek to find remorseless sexual gratification by masturbating and ejaculating over the facial image of the young woman he claims not to have been responsible for killing?"Answering his own question, Altman said Dixie was "reliving not just the sexual acts and other indignities he had performed on her body that night in September 2005, but he was also reliving killing her".On the evening of the murder, Dixie, who had turned 35 that day, was celebrating his birthday in the pub with some friends, the jury heard.He drank beer and did two lines of cocaine, before going back to a friend's flat, a few streets away from Bowman's house, said the prosecution.When Dixie was arrested, said the prosecution, he was asked at the police station whether he had any illness or mental health condition, to which he replied: "I must be mental to do something like that, eh?"Dixie denies murder. The trial continues.
