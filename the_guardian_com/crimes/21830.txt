An 11-year-old girl who was brutally murdered more than 30 years ago died from multiple stab wounds to her heart and lung, a senior pathologist said today.Lesley Molseed went missing from her home in October 1975. Her body was found abandoned on bleak moorland three days later.Stefan Kiszko, an innocent man, was convicted of her murder and spent 16 years in jail for a crime he did not commit, Bradford crown court heard.Advances in forensic science, however, led police to charge 54-year-old Ronald Castree with the murder.Today, pathologist Professor Christopher Milroy described the 12 separate stab wounds that Lesley had suffered in the attack."I would give the cause of death as multiple stabs wounds," he told the court. "She has died because the stab wounds involved the heart, the aorta and the left lung."Prof Milroy was giving evidence on the second day of the trial of Mr Castree, who is from Oldham, Greater Manchester.The former part-time taxi driver is accused of murdering Lesley after snatching the youngster as she left her home in Rochdale on an errand for her mother.As Lesley's mother, April Garrett, looked on from the public gallery, Prof Milroy described the report of another pathologist, Professor David Gee, who conducted the 1975 postmortem examination of the girl.The court was told Prof Gee had first examined Lesley's body after it was found on moorland near the A672 Oldham to Ripponden road.The pathologist told the jury it appeared Lesley was attacked where she was found and probably on the day she was abducted. He said the most likely weapon was a knife, around 2.5in long, and the blows to her chest appeared to be "targeted not random".The court was also told how the defendant admitted abducting and sexually assaulting a nine-year-old girl within a year of Lesley's death.Yesterday, the jury heard how DNA taken from Mr Castree had been found to be an exact match with DNA taken from sperm found on Lesley's clothing.Mr Castree, who sat in the dock making notes, denies murdering Lesley between October 4 and October 9 1975.The trial continues.
