The incoming Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, will have to tackle an intray overflowing with controversial issues when he takes over the post.They range from the issue of the arrest of the Tory shadow immigration spokesman, Damien Green, to the morale of the Met's 31,000 officers and the aftermath of the race row which contributed to the demise of his predecessor, Sir Ian Blair.• Damien Green: The Met has already prepared the way for the announcement that no charges will be laid against Green over government leaks, but the Crown Prosecution Service will ultimately make the decision.If, as expected, Green is not pursued further, the new Met commissioner will need to shrug off the criticism likely to be levelled at the force and bat away a report on the issue by the home affairs select committee.• Race row: The last weeks of Blair's leadership saw the Met settling a race discrimination claim by Tarique Ghaffur, the most senior Asian officer in the country.But the rumblings of discontent continue, particularly over what the National Black Police Association says is widespread discrimination restricting black and Asian officers to lowly ranks.The new commissioner will be asked to defend the Met's race record on next month's 10th anniversary of the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which found the force was institutionally racist.• Crime figures: Although the latest data shows knife crime has gone down by 13%, Stephenson will have to deal with apparent rises in knife murders among younger teenagers.The nature of these crimes – the youth of the victims and the motiveless nature of the killings – produces high emotions and many headlines.• Child protection: In the aftermath of the death of Baby P, the Met has held several high level meetings to discuss the role of the police in the case and whether more could be done.With the focus having been on anti-terrorism for the last seven years, the issue of child protection has not had the profile or resources of other areas. As a result of the death of Baby P, there is to be a review of resources allocated to child protection.• Menezes shooting: The killing of Jean Charles de Menezes will continue to haunt the new commissioner.The Menezes family continue to pursue their case that the inquest jury should have been allowed to consider whether he was unlawfully killed.
