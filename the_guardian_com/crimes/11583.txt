A pregnant woman who was found dead with a rope around her neck after apparently killing herself had been murdered, a coroner ruled today.The Birmingham coroner, Aidan Cotter, said Kuldeep Kaur Sidhu had been strangled, but an attempt had been made to make it look like she had taken her own life.Recording a verdict of unlawful killing after a three-day inquest, Cotter expressed confidence that the 25-year-old's killer or killers would be caught.The inquest heard that Sidhu's body and a note were found after a fire at her marital home in the Quinton area of the city in May 2008. She was the early stages of pregnancy and had been married for six months at the time of her death.A pathologist told the court that although Sidhu had been found with a rope around her neck, there were no discernible ligature marks.The coroner said: "In my view, the evidence shows clearly this was not murder by a stranger."An attempt was made to destroy the evidence by burning her body to make it look as if Kuldeep had taken her own life by hanging. She had not." He added: "I am confident that with the evidence that has been obtained and secured, that sooner or later the murder will be solved."Speaking after the inquest, the police said the investigation remained open and officers were still seeking information about the murder.Detective Sergeant Andrew Houston, of West Midlands police, said: "There has been a wide-ranging, painstaking inquiry into the death of Kuldeep Sidhu."It is clear from our investigation and from the comments made during the course of this inquest by Mr Cotter that the answer to whoever has committed this murder lies closely around the scene and around those known to Kuldeep."Mr Cotter emphasised this was not, in his opinion, murder by a stranger and we believe the evidence points strongly to emphasise this fact."Houston appealed for witnesses who were in Quinton or the wider Birmingham area on 13 and 14 May 2008."In particular we would like to hear from persons who could help us piece together the last movements of Kuldeep," he said.
