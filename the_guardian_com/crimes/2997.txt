More than 520 children have been identified as likely or potential victims of sexual abuse online and 77 people arrested in a major anti-paedophile operation by police in Scotland.Detectives said they had uncovered more than 30m indecent images on mobile telephones and computers seized during Operation Lattise, a six-week inquiry launched by Police Scotland in June.The force has referred 122 children to child protection services and charged the 77 alleged perpetrators with 390 offences ranging from rape to sexual extortion, sharing indecent images, online grooming, indecent communications and bestiality.After seizing 547 electronic devices, detectives say they found 10m images of child sexual abuse or indecency on one electronic device alone, while a second suspect is believed to have communicated with more than 110 children and teenagers.The investigation is expected to uncover further offences and victims: the haul of images and leads was so large that investigations were still continuing, with further forensic examination of many seized devices ongoing.With detectives searching 83 homes so far and using covert technology to support the investigation, the force said it would need four officers working full-time for six months to assess all the images seized.Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: “This is not sexting in terms of people sending abusive messages to each other. This is children being sexually abused and these images being shared.“It is about real victims in Scotland and elsewhere. It’s about these horrific acts which ruin people’s lives and we need to make sure that stops.”He added: “Let me make it clear. Child sexual abuse and exploitation, which can range from sharing images depicting the rape, sexual torture or assault of a child to grooming or sexually extorting a child takes place solely because of decisions made on the part of the abuser.“Online child sexual abuse is not a victimless crime: children, from toddlers to teenagers, are being sexually abused and exploited now in Scotland and when an image or video clip is shared or viewed, they are being re-victimised.”The initiative has been supported by the NSPCC Scotland. Its policy manager, Joanna Barrett, said the charity was increasingly concerned about the dangers facing children online.“Too many children are exposed to dangerous and harmful content through the internet or are subjected to online harassment, grooming and sexual exploitation,” she said.“We recently highlighted how the internet is playing an increasing role in the sexual abuse of younger children in Scotland, with a 60% rise recorded over a year in the number of indecent communications offences carried out by adults against children aged under 13.“It is vital we learn more about the nature and scale of this offending in Scotland, and its impact on children and young people.”
