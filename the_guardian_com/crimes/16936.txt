A judge today criticised a wealthy landowner for not revealing where he had hidden the body of his estranged wife after he murdered her.Adrian Prout was jailed for life for the murder of retired teacher Kate Prout and told he would serve at least 18 years.Mrs Prout's body has never been found, prompting her family to appeal to Prout to end their agony and tell them how she met her end and where the body was.Sentencing Prout, Mr Justice Davis said: "One of the pieces of evidence that sticks in my mind is Kate Prout used to remember her parents by placing flowers on her grave. I expect her family would like to place flowers on her grave but they can't, and they can't because of you."The judge said: "It was said on your behalf that there was some sort of stress or a degree of provocation. I couldn't accept even that. The truth is you allowed your temper to erupt and it was your anger that killed her. How you killed her is only known to you. You most probably did it by strangling her."Prout, 47, killed his 55-year-old wife during an acrimonious divorce. A trial at Bristol crown court was told that shortly before she vanished from their home in Redmarley, Gloucestershire, two years ago, Mrs Prout had increased the amount of money she was asking for as part of the settlement.The court also heard that Prout, who had a pipe-laying business and ran a pheasant shoot, may have fallen in love with a house-sitter. He subsequently had a child with a third woman.Defending, Elizabeth Marsh told the court Prout had suffered a "prolonged period of stress" and flagged up an incident the month before Mrs Prout went missing in which she drunkenly abused him in front of friends at a local pub.Referring to the couple's divorce proceedings, Marsh added: "It's quite clear on both sides there had been lengthy and difficult periods of negotiation."Mrs Prout's family have urged Prout to reveal where her body was hidden and end their anguish.Her brother, Richard Wakefield, 59, from Lypiatt, Gloucestershire, said: "Nothing will bring Kate back to us, but we are pleased that justice has been done. We would, however, appeal to Adrian to tell us what happened to Kate and where she is because we would like to lay her to rest and say our goodbyes."
