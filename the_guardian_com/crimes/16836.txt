The mother of Naomi Bryant, who was strangled and stabbed to death by serial sex attacker Anthony Rice nine months after he was released from prison, has won a full inquest into her daughter's death after threatening a high court challenge under the Human Rights Act.The coroner for mid-Hampshire, Graham Short, has reversed his decision last June not to hold an inquest after Rice pleaded guilty to Ms Bryant's murder. Mr Short changed his mind after Liberty, the civil rights organisation, which acts for Ms Bryant's mother, Verna, argued that the state is obliged under the Human Rights Act to hold a full inquiry. Liberty had told the coroner that it planned to mount a high court challenge under the act.His change of heart means that the same act which was blamed in part for freeing Rice will also ensure that the circumstances behind his release are fully examined in public.An official inquiry by the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, said the failures in the Rice case had been exacerbated by parole and probation staff allowing human rights considerations to undermine public protection.His report sparked outrage and calls for the Human Rights Act to be repealed, although it pointed to a cumulative failure in the system, with "mistakes, misjudgments and miscommunications" at each of the three phases of Rice's life sentence for a violent attempted rape, for which he served more than 15 years. The parole board was unaware of his full record and its decision to release him in 2004 was based on "over-optimistic" reports of his progress on a sex offender treatment programme, Mr Bridges concluded. Not only was he "too dangerous to be released into the community", but after his release "there were deficiencies in the way he was supervised". Mrs Bryant, a childminder, said yesterday: "They can't bury their heads in the sand now. I can't help Naomi now but it's other people I'm thinking of."Rice, who had attacked at least a dozen women since the age of 15, terrorising some at knifepoint, had been given a 10-year minimum term in 1989 for attempted rape. Two parole requests were turned down before he was released. He was released on life licence to Elderfield hostel, in Otterbourne, Hampshire, where residents had their own keys and were not checked at night.The conditions imposed on his release, including an 8pm curfew and not approaching lone females, proved unenforceable and probation staff changed the terms of his licence without approval, including allowing him to stay out late on Wednesday to attend a pub quiz night.In August last year, only days after meeting Ms Bryant, 40, the mother of a teenage daughter, he killed her at her home in Winchester.Case law has established that article 2 of the European convention on human rights - incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act - requires the state to initiate "an effective public investigation by an independent official body" where it appears that public authorities may be implicated in someone's death.Anna Fairclough, Liberty's lawyer handling the case, said the chief inspector's inquiry had not been held in public. She said article 2 required the inquest to be broadened beyond the immediate circumstances of the death to look into "any failings" of the agencies.
