Tony Blair is to extend fixed penalty fines for anti-social behaviour nationwide after a successful pilot scheme in four police authorities.Mr Blair introduced the idea of on-the-spot fines to widespread scepticism, but police in the four areas are claiming they have been a great success. He made the announcement yesterday at prime minister's questions where he suggested he would extend the spot fines to under-18s who throw fireworks. At present the fine applies only to over-18s. The four pilot areas were West Midlands, Essex, the central section of north Wales, and Croydon in south London. Mr Blair is determined to keep his anti-social behaviour drive in the public mind in the face of polling and election results showing it remains a big issue. Mr Blair is also expected today to highlight the drive against fly tipping and abandoned cars. Legislation allowing councils to quickly remove abandoned vehicles comes into force in December. At present the police can impose £80 spot fines for threatening behaviour or making hoax phone calls designed to cause distress, and £40 fines for drunk and disorderly behaviour, being drunk and incapable, or for drinking in designated spaces.
