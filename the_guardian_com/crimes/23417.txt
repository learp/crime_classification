Your article about the growing number of single women seeking to have children without a relationship with a man (G2, September 17) raises many issues which it is important to air and discuss.Since July 2007 it has been a criminal offence to "procure, test, process or distribute" any gametes (sperm and eggs) intended for human application without a licence from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Prospective patients seeking donated gametes should only use licensed centres. That way, they can be assured that the gametes have been subject to screening checks and that the centre complies with the standards set out in the HFEA code of practice. A further difficulty with using unlicensed centres is that the HFEA is unable to hold, in its statutory registers, information relating to donors or children conceived from gametes obtained from such centres.Responsibility for prosecuting criminal offences rests with the police, and it is the practice of the HFEA to refer concerns about internet procurement to them. We strongly advise any person who becomes aware that a person or organisation may be procuring, testing, processing or distributing gametes without a licence to contact the police. The women whose stories you tell are entitled to make such fundamental choices about their personal lives within a safe, clinically sound framework. It is the HFEA's responsibility to provide that framework, and to be vigilant for the safety of those who undergo fertility treatment. The internet sperm providers referred to in one of your examples are not licensed by the HFEA. The service they offer is unlawful and unsafe.Professor Lisa JardineChair, HFEA
