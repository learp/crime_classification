The jury was yesterday given details of forensic evidence which allegedly links Ian Huntley to Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. The prosecutor, Richard Latham QC, suggested the defence's indication that it is unlikely to contest that the girls were in Mr Huntley's house and that he dumped their bodies, was due to the weight of this evidenceChalk Geologists analysed the track which runs alongside the ditch where the girls' bodies were found. The track was made of concrete rubble overlaid with chalk. The chalk was found to be of an "unusual type". Scientists were able to match chalk from the track with samples taken from inside and outside Mr Huntley's car. They also matched traces of quartz from the concrete Pollen Botanist Patricia Wiltshire catalogued 66 different species of plant - including sycamore, watercress, and meadowsweet - in and around the ditch where the bodies were found, including some "quite rare" specimens. Traces of pollen from many of the species were found on Mr Huntley's clothes and in his car Fibres Some 49 fibres matching those from the girls' shirts were found on Mr Huntley's clothes and in his house. Around 100 fibres which the prosecution claims came from Mr Huntley's clothes or house were discovered on the girls' clothing Fire  A fire expert examined the site where the girls' bodies were found. He concluded that a liquid accelerant such as petrol had been used to set fire to the bodies. The jury heard that Mr Huntley was seen with a petrol can on the day the prosecution alleges he returned to the bodies.
