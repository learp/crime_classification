The number of young motorists involved in accidents while under the influence of alcohol is increasing despite high-profile publicity campaigns against drink-driving, police warned today.Scotland Yard revealed almost a quarter of all offenders and casualties in London were aged between 17 and 24. According to a survey by Radio 1's Newsbeat, a similar picture has emerged across the whole country.Sergeant Ivan Stafford of Leicestershire police said: "They're the majority of the casualties, they're the majority of the offenders."The numbers of people being killed in a drink-related accident have increased dramatically."And they're killing themselves, they're mutilating themselves, which is such a tragic waste of life."Figures from the Department for Transport (DfT) support the police warnings. According to the DfT, 1,050 17 to 19-year-olds were involved in drink-drive accidents in 2005, the latest year for which figures are available, compared with 810 in 1995. For 20 to 25-year-olds, the figure increased from 2,170 to 2,280 during the same period.Kevin Clinton, the head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), called for an urgent reduction in the drink-drive limit. He said police should be given powers to breath-test motorists anywhere and at any time."We have seen a worrying increase in the number of drink-drive related deaths in recent years and we have to do something to stop that," said Mr Clinton."Studies have shown that cutting the drink-drive limit from 80 milligrams to 50mg would save 65 lives and 230 serious injuries on Britain's roads each year."The limit of 80mg per 100 millilitres of blood did not mean you were safe to drive, he said."Between 50mg and 80mg, you are between two and two-and-a-half times more likely to crash and six times more likely to be involved in a fatal accident."Reducing the limit would be an ideal opportunity to kick-start the drink-drive campaign again by putting out new messages to educate the public and particularly address young drivers who may have missed out on the impact of earlier campaigns."The DfT's THINK campaign is aimed at young drivers and a spokesman today defended its record, saying it spoke directly to young men.He said a new campaign to be launched in the summer would target 17 to 29-year-olds.Carole Whittingham, the founder of Scard (Support and Care After Road Death and Injury), said of the figures: "It's horrifying, but I'm not at all surprised."There are several causes of why young people think they can drink and drive. The first thing that comes to mind is confusion as to what one unit [of alcohol] actually is."Ms Whittingham said she had recently spoken to a group of learner drivers who thought that one unit of alcohol was the equivalent of one drink.She called for a "zero-tolerance" policy towards drinking and driving, which would remove the grey area.
