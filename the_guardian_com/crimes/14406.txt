A man who tried to persuade parents to sexually abuse and rape their children online has been jailed for five years.Mark Luscombe, 29, of Verwood, Dorset, was caught in an undercover operation by US and UK police officers. In October last year, Luscombe – using the username "Badmomlover" on the site motherless.com – contacted a man he believed to be the father of a nine-year-old girl.Luscombe sent the man – actually an undercover officer in San Jose, California – 93 indecent images and videos in payment for him to rape the girl over a webcam. The officer, from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's homeland security investigations (HSI), contacted Dorset police.An undercover officer for Dorset police then posed as a father and contacted Luscombe, who forwarded him two indecent images. Luscombe believed he and the "father" would later meet and together rape the man's young daughters.On 4 December officers raided Luscombe's address and arrested him. In a police interview he admitted having had sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl.He later pleaded guilty to eight counts of making indecent photographs of a child, five counts of distributing indecent photographs of a child, sexual activity with a child and arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence and possessing an extreme pornographic image.A judge at Bournemouth crown court jailed Luscombe for five years and ordered him to remain on the sex offenders register indefinitely.Anthony Johns, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "What Mark Luscombe did and was planning to do is shocking and frightening. He actively used the internet to arrange and encourage others based mainly in America to sexually abuse and rape their own children."Luscombe was fully aware of he was doing. He knew it was wrong and that he was committing very serious criminal offences. There is no doubt that he would have carried on with his crimes if he had not been apprehended."
