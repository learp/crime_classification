The father of the missing chef Claudia Lawrence called today for an independent inquiry into the police investigation of her disappearance and suspected murder.Peter Lawrence, 63, a solicitor in North Yorkshire where his 35-year-old daughter vanished in March 2009, accused detectives of an unhelpful "bunker mentality". He claimed that officers had been "uncivil, rude, abrupt and dismissive" to friends of his daughter, who was last seen at her home in York. The next day Lawrence failed to turn up for an early-morning kitchen shift at York University.The police strongly denied the charges. They have said they are frustrated by problems in getting information about Lawrence's personal life, possibly because she may have been involved with married men who are reluctant to come forward.Hundreds of interviews and highly publicised appeals for help have not provided a breakthrough, although fresh information, described as important by senior officers, is still being received.Last week police carried out intensive searches of fields at Heslington, close to York University's campus, after receiving new information. Martin Dale, spokesman for the Lawrence family's Find Claudia campaign, said it was "amazing that after a year, this information has only just come out".Peter Lawrence's criticism was prompted by North Yorkshire police's decision to seek a review of their inquiry by the National Police Improvement Agency. The force is embarrassed by the lack of significant progress in an inquiry which has now cost more than Â£600,000 and has already been the subject of an internal audit.Peter Lawrence welcomed the inquiry but called for it to be transferred to an outside, independent body."As it stands, it is the police policing police and the NPIA's reports are only made public if the chief constable wants them to be, which is unsatisfactory."After all this time, people expect to know what the police have been, and are still, doing, even if some confidential operational detail has to be omitted. What is really needed now is an urgent independent inquiry with a public report. Nothing less will do and transparency is vital if trust is to be restored in North Yorkshire police."He suggested that a new police team should take over the hunt for information about his daughter, bringing the chance of a fresh eye and overlooked insights. "Despite the great efforts of the police in devoting huge resources, we are clearly little further on in finding Claudia than on day one," he said."Sadly, although the police continue to keep in touch with the family, they have now developed a bunker mentality whereby they are not engaging with either the public or the media."He cited police unwillingness to co-operate with a Channel 4 television documentary about the case, and tardiness in following up suggestions from his daughter's relatives and friends.Martin Dale said he that he was still waiting for responses to emails he had sent to the police authority in September and March airing public worries about the investigation. Another email sent to the force's incident room last month, naming four new locations for possible investigation, had also gone unanswered.Detective Superintendent Ray Galloway of North Yorkshire police said that the force had asked for the new review after work on a list of recommendations produced by an NPIA analysis of the case last year. This had been "extremely positive" and the inquiry was considered comprehensive and effective, he said."The force has not received any complaints about incivility or rudeness of any officers working on the investigation into Claudia's disappearance and there is no link whatsoever in the rise in complaints generally and the professionalism of the team working on the investigation."Galloway said that the number of complaints to North Yorkshire police had risen from 392 in 2008 to 496 last year, but only one had been to do with the Lawrence inquiry. "This is despite hundreds of intrusive searches of people's homes and potentially difficult situations."Police are still appealing for a man who spent the night with Claudia Lawrence two days before her disappearance to come forward. Detectives gave details last month of information passed to them about the friendship, but have not had any further news.
