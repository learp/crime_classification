Detectives hunting the killers of seven-year-old schoolgirl Toni-Ann Byfield today arrested two men on suspicion of her murder, Scotland Yard said.The two are also suspected of shooting dead her convicted drug dealer father, Bertram, 41, at his flat in Harlesden, north-west London.Police said a 31-year-old man was arrested on Merseyside and a 22-year-old man was arrested in north-west London. A 28-year-old woman was also arrested on Merseyside on suspicion of assisting an offender and supplying class A drugs. All three are being questioned at a north-west London police station, police said.Before today, five people had been arrested in the police inquiry but all were released with no further action.The latest arrests come more than two years after Toni-Ann and her father died on September 13, 2003.It is thought Byfield was killed because of a drug debt and Toni-Ann was murdered so that she could not identify the killer.At the time of her death, she was in the care of Birmingham social services and had been placed with a foster family in the city.But when the family went on holiday care workers placed Toni-Ann in London with a girlfriend of Byfield.He was seeing Toni-Ann during this time and on the day of the killings the pair had been shopping for her new school uniform.At around 11pm they visited the home of some old acquaintances of Byfield - street dealers to whom he dealt crack. They left there at about 11.45pm to return to his bedsit, after which neighbours heard shots and screams and both were later found dead.After their deaths it emerged that Byfield was not Toni-Ann's natural father.There is a Â£25,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the killers.
