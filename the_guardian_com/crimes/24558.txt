Rolf Harris has abandoned his push to appeal 12 convictions for sexually assaulting four girls in the UK.Harris’s initial application was refused by a single court of appeal judge in late October and the disgraced entertainer is now out of time to ask the court to revisit the issue.A judicial office spokesman on Monday confirmed that Harris hadn’t renewed his application to appeal “and he is now out of time”.The 84-year-old Australian had 28 days to ask for a hearing before three appeal court judges but chose not to.Harris was sentenced in July to five years and nine months’ jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986. However he is expected to serve less than three years behind bars.During his lengthy trial another six women gave supporting evidence that Harris abused them in Australia, New Zealand and Malta between 1969 and 1991.Harris wasn’t charged over those alleged incidents because they occurred outside the UK.In mid-October a British newspaper reported Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the disgraced artist and singer.The Metropolitan police have refused to comment on the possibility of further charges being laid.It was also reported in mid-October that Harris had to be moved to a new prison for his own safety after being bullied by inmates. The convicted sex offender was moved from HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire to Stafford jail.
