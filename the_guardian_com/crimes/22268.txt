Two men accused of murdering church organist Alan Greaves have been remanded in custody by magistrates in Sheffield.Greaves died three days after he was attacked on Christmas Eve on his way to midnight mass at St Saviour's church, near his home in High Green, Sheffield.The two defendants, Ashley Foster, 21, and Jonathan Bowling, 22, stood in the glass-fronted dock wearing identical navy blue T-shirts and jogging bottoms.Bowling, of Carwood Way, Pitmoor, Sheffield, has short, dark hair and a tattoo on his neck.Foster, of Wesley Road, High Green, has slightly longer hair.They stood with three security guards and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth as well as to state their ages.There were no applications for bail and they were told they would appear again at Sheffield crown court on 18 January.Greave's wife, Maureen, sat at the back of the court during the four-minute hearing.As she left court with Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who is leading the murder inquiry, she said: "Justice will be done."Asked if her faith was helping her through this difficult time, she said: "Immensely. The support of the congregation and the police has been outstanding. I just want to pay tribute to all they've done, the sensitivity with which they've dealt with the case."
