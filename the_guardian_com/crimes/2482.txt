The convicted sex attacker who murdered a south London schoolgirl and dismembered her body has been sentenced to life in jail.John McGrady, a 48-year-old former butcher, pleaded guilty to attacking Rochelle Holness last September but offered no explanation for his actions.The 15-year-old's body was discovered in five bags close to a rubbish chute on the Milford Towers estate in Catford, south-east London.She had disappeared four days earlier after leaving the flat she shared with her mother and two younger bothers to make a call from a public phone box.McGrady attempted to commit suicide after the murder, which he confessed to his girlfriend.A statement read out by Rochelle's family said they had "been through hell" since the killing. The statement said the sentence was appropriate, describing McGrady as a remorseless killer."Mr McGrady yesterday claimed to feel shame, sorrow, and remorse for his actions," it said."In fact, the only shame was that he expressed to his then girlfriend. There was no explanation, no apology, not even a willingness to throw himself on the mercy of the court."The statement said that sexual offenders and murderers should not be allowed the opportunity to attack people in the way that McGrady did.However, Detective Inspector Tim Gratton-Cane said McGrady was a "wicked and evil man" whose actions could not have been prevented by legal restrictions."It's quite clear from the circumstances that he made a decision on September 25 that he was going to go and get someone to satisfy his needs," he said.McGrady, who had previous convictions for rape, indecent assault and false imprisonment, had previously been sentenced to a total of 11 years in prison for two attacks in 1988 and 1993.An autopsy found Rochelle had been strangled, but McGrady refused to tell investigators what happened before her death.On the day of the murder, he had an unsatisfactory sexual encounter with his girlfriend. The court heard how, as she left his flat, he said: "What am I going to do? That means I will have to go out and look for someone."Police believe Rochelle was snatched from the phone box where she had gone to make the call after running out of credit on her mobile phone.During the hearing, her mother, Jennifer Bennett, shouted to McGrady: "You should not live. You took my baby from me. You are not sorry."In their statement, the family attacked the "sensationalist" coverage of the case by the media. "Their behaviour has been as insensitive as John McGrady's," it said.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, last year cited the case as an example of racial bias in the reporting of crime stories.It initially attracted little coverage, despite widespread reporting on the murder of 18-year-old Sally Anne Bowman in Croydon at around the same time.
