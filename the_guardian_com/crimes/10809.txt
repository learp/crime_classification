Police today praised teenagers who helped two officers catch a fleeing suspect. They lent police their bikes and kept track of the man as he tried to evade capture on the streets of Cambridge. PC Mark Lappin and a colleague were following a man who got out of a suspicious car, and said without the teenagers' help the suspect would have probably got away. "First of all a boy came up to me and said 'he's hiding in that bush'," said Lappin. "Then I gave chase again and two youngsters came along and lent us their bikes." He said police were now looking at finding a way of rewarding them for their help.
