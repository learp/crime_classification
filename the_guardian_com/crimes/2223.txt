A coroner today returned verdicts of unlawful killing at the inquests into the deaths of two Leeds United fans who were stabbed during violence in Istanbul.Christopher Loftus, who was stabbed 17 times, and Kevin Speight, stabbed four times, were attacked during clashes between rival fans before a Uefa Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in April 2000.Summing up, West Yorkshire coroner David Hinchliffe said that the two men died in an "an organised ambush" by Turkish fans, some of whom had been seen to be carrying knives and machetes."Turkish nationals were observed charging down the streets, arming themselves with any missiles they could get their hands on and throwing them in the direction of the Leeds fans," he said.Neither Loftus, 35, a telecoms engineer, nor Speight, a 40-year-old Leeds pub landlord, had any record of violent behaviour.Two Leeds fans yesterday told the inquest how they had tried to give Loftus the kiss of life as a gang of Galatasaray supporters kicked and hit them.Delivering his verdict, Mr Hinchliffe announced his decision to write to the FA and Uefa to recommend the introduction of an international protocol to protect fans attending football matches.He also heavily criticised Turkish police for their handling of the situation. "The police gave the impression they were targeting the Leeds supporters," he said. "Many were struck with batons, many were taken to the police station notwithstanding the fact that they were injured and needed hospital treatment."He described the force, which repeatedly refused to co-operate with West Yorkshire officers, as "disorganised, uncoordinated, not in control of the situation and ill-prepared". "The police seem to be out of control, and their ability was described by witnesses as being diabolical," Mr Hinchliffe added.A 22-year-old former Turkish soldier, Ali Umit Demir, was jailed in May 2002 for the murders. However, the conviction was quashed last year, and a retrial ordered by a court in Ankara, after questions arose over the prosecution's evidence.In the original verdict, the three-judge panel had unanimously agreed that Mr Demir had murdered Speight, but voted 2-1 that he had murdered Loftus.Demir's knife had Speight's blood on it, but it was not clear whether it had the blood of Loftus, which was necessary to secure the double conviction, the appeals court ruled.
