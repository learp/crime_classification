Armed robbers escaped with more than £1m in cash yesterday after hijacking a Securicor van in Horsham, West Sussex.A gunman ambushed a male and a female Securicor guard as they returned from a cafe in Horsham, West Sussex, at around 9am. The raiders, who had parked a hatchback car in front of the van, tied the male guard up and forced him into the van. The female guard was put in the front of the van. The robbers then transferred the money at Faygate village five miles away and fled in a getaway car, believed to be a green S-registration 216 Series Rover. A police helicopter was alerted and spent 45 minutes searching for the the car. The guards were taken to Crawley hospital. Both were said to be "extremely shaken". Securicor has offered a £100,000 reward for information leading to the return of the money, or the arrest and conviction of the robbers. Detective Inspector Steve Johns, who is heading the investigation, said: "We believe a substantial amount of money has been stolen." Another police spokesman said it could be less than £1m but it could be more "obviously we can't count it".
