Gun crime in England and Wales increase by 35% last year and criminals used handguns in nearly 50% more offences, Home Office figures revealed today.Firearms were used in 9,974 recorded crimes in the 12 months to last April, up from 7,362.The figures also show the number of crimes involving handguns has more than doubled since the ban on the weapons imposed after the Dunblane massacre from 2,636 in 1997-1998 to 5,871 in the 12 months to April last year.The number of homicide victims killed by firearms increased 32%, or 23 cases, in the year to April 2002.Overall there was a 1% rise in the number of homicides to 858 in England and Wales.In all, handgun crime rose 46% year-on-year.Unadjusted figures show overall recorded crime in the 12 months to last September rose 9.3% but the Home Office stressed that new procedures had skewed the figures.With new recording procedures taken into account the actual overall rise was just 2%, the Home Office said.Robbery was up 14.5% (up 13% adjusted) but from July to September, when the government's street crime initiative was in full swing, it actually fell by 10% in adjusted figures.Domestic burglary figures increased 7.9% (or increased 5% when adjusted), figures which are likely to embarrass ministers in the wake of the lord chief justice and lord chancellor's comments on jailing burglars.Violence against individuals was up 28% in the three months to September last year, which the Home Office adjusted to a 4% rise.Over the same period sex offences were up 25.6%, but ministers said this figure was likely to be inflated by the new statistical changes.Drug offences also rose 12.3% but no adjusted figures were available for this category.
