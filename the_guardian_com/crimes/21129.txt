The government has exceeded its target for removing foreign convicts after deporting more than 4,000 foreign prisoners this year, the Home Office said yesterday.Officials said that the figure showed a 50% increase on last year.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said: "Foreign lawbreakers should be first in line for the first plane out of Britain. We promised to remove 4,000 foreign national prisoners this year and we meant it."The total includes more than 20 people convicted of killings, more than 200 sex offenders and more than 1,100 drug offenders.Gordon Brown announced the new target in July in an attempt to relieve pressure on the overcrowded prison system by accelerating the removals process.Foreign national prisoners can remain locked up in detention centres once their sentences are complete while they await deportation.The publication of the figures comes after the government was last week forced to defend itself against claims that it was failing to deport thousands of foreigners convicted of less serious offences.A leaked Prison Service memorandum stated that "as a rule" the Border and Immigration Agency would not try to remove foreigners sentenced to under 12 months, unless the courts specifically recommended them for deportation.The Conservatives claimed that at least 4,000 foreign offenders a year - including thieves, fraudsters, burglars and drugs dealers - could be allowed to remain in the UK.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the numbers being removed were equal to the numbers who would escape deportation because their sentences were less than a year."The government should not crow about meeting this artificially-set target," he said. "The government is replicating the problem they are claiming to have solved."
