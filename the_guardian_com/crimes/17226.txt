A man pleaded guilty to scrawling graffiti about Fusilier Lee Rigby's death on a war memorial in central London.Daniel James Smith, 21, of Salford, admitted writing "Lee Rigby's killers should hang" on Bomber Command memorial on June 5. Colleen Gildernew, defending, said Smith had not realised the monument in Green Park was a war memorial. "He is very disgusted with himself, even more so because of that."Smith also daubed "EDL" and "Fuck the police" on the memorial, Izolda Switala-Gribbin, prosecuting, said.Smith was planning to go to Rigby's funeral but was arrested beforehand, Westminster magistrates' court heard.Gildernew said Smith had applied for a job in the British army but was unsuccessful "because of his convictions as a young boy". The court heard he had 44 convictions and had appeared in different courts five times this year.The experiences of Smith's two army friends – one who has lost both legs and another who suffers from memory loss as the result of a bomb – had an "emotional impact on him", said Gildernew.The damage to the memorial, which commemorates the thousands of RAF crews who lost their lives in the second world war, amounted to £870.The memorial was vandalised twice in just over a week following the killing of Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, on 22 May.District judge Quentin Purdy described the content of Smith's graffiti, and its location, as "highly emotive".He added that Smith's actions clearly challenged the "tolerance we all seek to see in society". Purdy said people will want to know what the court is doing about people, "brains in gear or not", who inflict such damage.The judge said he was prepared to explore all "reasonable options" for Smith moving on rather than being sent back into custody. But he said a custodial sentence was a possibility, adding "there may be no alternative".Purdy told Smith his punishment should "reflect the public's concern about your criminal conduct". The 21-year-old his actions "caused offence to many", added the judge.The court was told that Smith has spent the past 11 weeks in Feltham young offenders' institution and was released on Thursday. Purdy said it was "slightly worrying" that he was released with few arrangements in place.Smith's previous convictions relate mainly to shoplifting, Gildernew told the court. She said he was brought up by his grandmother and had little in terms of family support, describing his childhood as "unsettled".The court heard that he left school at 15 with no qualifications, battled cannabis addiction as a teenager and struggled with homelessness.Gildernew said Smith was "shaking and very tearful" before the hearing.Smith also pleaded guilty to causing £510 of criminal damage to a wall of a commercial property in Knightsbridge.Purdy remanded Smith in custody and adjourned sentencing until Tuesday at the same court, pending further inquiries into suitable arrangements for him.
