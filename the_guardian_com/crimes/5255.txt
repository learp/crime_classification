Two men have been arrested by City of London police in connection with an alleged Â£50m fraudulent investment scheme. Both men were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud, money laundering and fraud by misrepresentation. A third man is expected to hand himself in. It follows a police investigation after a referral by the Financial Services Authority that froze the assets of three financial consultancies in 2008. Police named the businesses as Business Consulting International (BCI), John Anderson Consulting and Kenneth Peacock Consulting and called for witnesses. Jill Treanor
