A Polish man who twice broke into properties owned by Madonna was ordered to be detained indefinitely by a judge at Soutwark crown court after doctors said he posed a serious risk to the singer.Grezgorz Matlok, 30, who was said to believe he was in an intimate relationship with Madonna and being sent special messages by her, was deported to Poland for mental health treatment last year after breaking into the Wiltshire home she shared with the film director Guy Ritchie, trying on his clothes and stealing food; but he returned to Britain by coach last March and broke into her London home.The court was told Matlok used a rope to climb onto the balcony of a building next to her Georgian townhouse and then broke into her bedroom and rifled through her bedclothes, before stealing a can of Red Bull from the kitchen, where he was seen by film director Nathan Rissman. He told the police that Madonna had told him he could stay.In a statement read to the court, the singer said: "I do not know the defendant, have never had any relationship with the defendant â€¦ I have never given him permission to enter the premises or any of my other premises. I feel alarmed and distressed by the actions of the defendant."It is extremely unsettling to know that despite the extensive security I have he has been able to break into two residential properties owned by me. I am worried about the safety of my children, all of which are under 18. I am also worried about the safety of my staff and naturally I am also worried about my own safety."Ordering Matlok to be detained for medical treatment and banning him from trying to contact the singer or go within 100 metres of any properties owned or occupied by her or her family, Judge Deborah Taylor said that he clearly posed a risk of serious harm to Madonna.
