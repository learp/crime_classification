The gang of nine men found guilty of sexually abusing girls (Report, 9 May) is only one terrible aspect of a far reaching problem. The Howard League is about to publish research commissioned from Professor Jo Phoenix at Durham University into the commercial exploitation of young girls. Our research shows confusion and contradiction in the policing response to gangs that sexually exploit girls for profit. These girls, who are victims, are themselves too often criminalised rather than protected. They may be arrested, prosecuted and punished for actions related to their exploitation. We have uncovered cases of young children arrested and convicted by youth courts for loitering or soliciting for prostitution.Our full research will be published in July but we urge action now. Some areas of the country have highly developed welfare and police partnerships, but too often the youth justice system fails to recognise the fact that children are victims, perhaps because it is narrowly focused with children as offenders.Frances CrookChief executive, The Howard League for Penal Reform• There is one controversial aspect of the Rochdale sexual grooming case: that originally the Crown Prosecution Service had decided not to prosecute two of the men convicted on Tuesday and that, as a result, the offences continued for a further two years. It was only with the appointment of a Muslim, Nazir Afzal, last summer to the post of chief crown prosecutor that this decision was reversed. Was his predecessor inhibited from action by considerations of political correctness?Martin D SternSalford, Greater Manchester
