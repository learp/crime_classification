A teenager was jailed today for killing a rape suspect by stabbing him in the middle of London's Oxford Street.Anthony Costa, 19, was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection and told he would serve at least five years for the attack outside a McDonald's in central London.Judge Richard Hawkins told him the fact he regularly carried a knife made him a danger to others.Costa, of Walthamstow, east London, was found guilty last month of the manslaughter of Steven Bigby. He was cleared of murder.Bigby, 22, was on police bail having been arrested a week before for the rape of a 16-year-old who had caustic soda poured on her in Tottenham, north London.Three men have since been convicted of the offence and await sentence at Wood Green crown court, north London.Bigby was also due to stand trial for causing grievous bodily harm to a man at a snooker club.Costa and Bigby were in two groups of youths who started fighting when they met by chance in Oxford Street in May this year.Costa told the Old Bailey Bigby was stabbed by accident after he took out his knife. The judge said he accepted there had been a lack of intent to kill Bigby, but said Costa had little insight into what he had done.Bigby's younger sister Charlotte told the judge in an impact statement: "We know he was no angel, but it does not stop the pain we have been going through."
