A court in Rome today cleared all five defendants accused of murdering "God's banker" Roberto Calvi, whose body was found 25 years ago hanging under London's Blackfriars bridge.Judges at the high-security court said there was not enough evidence to convict the five of murder. The ruling follows a 20-month trial of four men and one woman, and means that one of the world's most mysterious cases remains unsolved.The 62-year-old's body was found hanging from a rope attached to scaffolding under the bridge on June 1982, with rocks and several thousand pounds of cash in three currencies stuffed in his suit pockets.A first inquest in London returned a verdict of suicide, but Calvi's family - particularly his widow Carla and his son Carlo, a banker in Canada - were convinced he had been lured to the UK to be killed by the Mafia.The five who have been cleared - who were originally charged in 2003 - are Giuseppe "Pippo" Calo, a mafia money launderer, businessmen Ernesto Diotallevi and Flavio Carboni, Calvi's driver and bodyguard Silvano Vittor, and Mr Carboni's Austrian ex-girlfriend Manuela Kleinszig.None of the defendants was in the courtroom on the outskirts of Rome when the judge read the verdicts, reached after one and a half days of deliberation.The prosecution had earlier called for Ms Kleinszig to be cleared saying there was insufficient evidence against her, but prosecutors had sought life sentences for the four men.Calo is already in prison, after being convicted in the 1980s of mafia charges unconnected to Calvi. Explaining today's verdict, one of Calo's lawyers, Massimo Amoroso, said: "The evidence was rather weak."The body of Calvi, who was 62 when he died, was found hanging from a rope attached to scaffolding under Blackfriars bridge in June 1982, with bricks and several thousand pounds of cash in three currencies stuffed in his suit.The prosecution contended that Calvi was taken to the scaffolding in a boat and was probably still alive but unconscious when a noose was placed around his neck.A first inquest in London returned a verdict of suicide, but Calvi's family were convinced he had been lured to the UK to be killed by the mafia.Calvi was the chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, one of Italy's largest banks, which had close links to the Vatican's internal bank. He fled to London as the bank collapsed with debts of Â£800m and an investigation got under way in Italy.The prosecutors argued that Calvi's killing was ordered because he was holding on to millions of pounds of Mafia money, which he had been asked to launder.There were also concerns Calvi might talk about the Mafia because of the pressure he was under due to the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.Today the judges rejected the prosecution theory, though it will not be clear why until they later publish their reasoning.The investigator Jeff Katz, who was hired by the banker's family in 1991 to look into his death, said it was likely that senior figures in the Italian establishment had escaped prosecution."The problem is that the people who probably actually ordered the death of Calvi are not in the dock - but to get to those people might be very difficult indeed," he said, speaking before today's verdict."You could have spent a very long time and not actually got there - you're talking about the Italian state and political and religious institutions."Mr Katz spent three years on the case, reconstructing the circumstances of Calvi's death and uncovering evidence that he could not have committed suicide.He showed that Calvi's shoes would have had flecks of rust and paint from the scaffolding below Blackfriars Bridge if he had shimmied there by himself; no such traces were found by police.The initial investigation of Calvi's death by the City of London police has been criticised because officers decided in the first 24 hours that it was a case of suicide.Today, a spokeswoman for the force said: "City of London police has worked closely with the Italian authorities since 2003 to bring this case to a successful conclusion."It is disappointing for Roberto Calvi's family in particular that those responsible for his murder have still not faced justice."
