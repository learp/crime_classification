Police arrested a 16-year-old boy on suspicion of murder yesterday after another teenager was found dying from stab wounds on a Newcastle upon Tyne estate notorious for knife crime.Detectives are questioning the youth from the Benwell area about the killing and a street fracas which allegedly flared up shortly beforehand.Mark Smith, who was 16 and celebrating landing his first job, as a mechanic, was stabbed in the neck late on Wednesday. He was found soaked in blood by paramedics who treated him in an ambulance, but he died later at the Royal Victoria hospital.Northumbria police are studying CCTV footage of the area and officers appealed yesterday for witnesses.Detective Chief Inspector Roger Ford, who is leading the inquiry, said: "I have no doubt that members of the public who were walking, driving or living in the area would have seen or heard something. I would urge these people to contact us urgently."Mark Smith was served with an Asbo last year but his family said he had started to turn his life round.His grandmother, Frances Cleminson, 72, who also lives in Benwell, said: "His mother is in pieces. She loves her bairn and she can't believe he has gone. He was a good lad who was like any other adventurous teenager. He'd been told yesterday he was being taken on full time as an apprentice mechanic at the garage where he had been working part time. Mark was determined not to go on the dole and he had found his perfect job."Knifepoint ambushes have upset Benwell residents in recent weeks, with an alleged spate of opportunist attacks.Superintendent Gary Calvert, of Northumbria police's Newcastle area command, said: "We have high visibility patrols in the area, liaising with residents, and we will continue to reassure the public that we deal effectively with crime and disorder at all levels. In common with other forces, we will continue to take a tough stance against knife crime, and we will deal robustly with anyone found to be carrying or using a knife."
