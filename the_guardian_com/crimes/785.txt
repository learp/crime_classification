The British boxer Amir Khan knocked down a pedestrian as he drove through a busy junction at high speed, a court heard today.The 20-year-old was driving well above the legal limit at 47mph when he struck Geoffrey Hatton, breaking the 55-year-old's leg.Bolton crown court heard that Khan, 20, had taken the decision to accelerate across the junction to avoid going through a red light.But the reigning Commonwealth lightweight champion was unaware of three pedestrians walking across a pelican crossing in front of him.Mr Khan told the court: "If I had slammed on my brakes at the light then I would have ended up in the middle of the junction, where I would have caused a problem to other drivers."It was too late to stop. I decided to just carry straight on and manoeuvred the car to the left."Mr Khan, of Lostock, near Bolton, admitted to the jury that his driving in March last year had been careless and posed a risk to pedestrians.But he claimed his actions had not amounted to dangerous driving and that he had not jumped a red light at the junction in Bradshawgate, Bolton.Earlier, the court heard that Mr Hatton had panicked when he saw Mr Khan's vehicle speeding towards him.He ran back to the kerb for safety, but instead came into the path of Khan's silver BMW 6 Series convertible.Asked about the collision by John Jones QC, defending, Mr Khan said: "It happened so quick."I have very quick reactions due to what I do in my sport, but it happened so quick I couldn't keep up with it."Mr Hatton came into the path of my car. I did not mean to hit Mr Hatton."If he had kept on walking there would not have been a collision."Mr Jones also asked Mr Khan, who had only passed his driving test eight weeks previously, how he felt after the accident. Mr Khan replied: "I was really upset. I could see Mr Hatton was hurt. I was in so much shock. It was my first accident."Under cross-examination from Alaric Bassano, the boxer denied his car was a high-performance vehicle capable of rapid acceleration.He said it could go from 0-60mph in 7.2 seconds, which was "just like an average car".Earlier, Mr Jones outlined the defendant's boxing achievements to the jury, which included winning a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics.Mr Khan, who was wearing a light grey suit with matching waistcoat, white shirt and navy blue tie, denies dangerous driving.The case continues.
