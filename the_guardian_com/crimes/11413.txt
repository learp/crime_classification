Families of some of the 52 people killed in the July 7 bombings yesterday watched previously unseen footage of the moments before and after the explosions. CCTV images from the platform at Liverpool Street station show passengers stepping on to the tube train that will go on to be blown up in the tunnel before Aldgate. Around 30 seconds after its departure a bright flash can be seen. A cloud of dust then billows down the platform as passengers start to run away. Very soon afterwards, police officers appear on the platform. Other CCTV films shown at Kingston crown court included the journey made by Hasib Hussain after his bomb failed to explode on the underground. He can be seen rooting around in his bag on the concourse at King's Cross station before going into WH Smith, where it is believed he bought a battery. He then goes to McDonald's before walking up Euston Road wearing a pair of sunglasses. The horrified reaction of people to the explosion he caused on the number 30 bus can be seen from cameras inside the British Medical Association building on Tavistock Square and on a nearby bus. Two people chatting at the front desk are thrown to the floor by the impact of the blast before getting up and running towards the injured. The bus images show panicking passengers jumping out of their seats in shock and struggling to get off the bus as they see the vehicle behind them explode. The families also saw a goodbye video made by Mohammed Siddique Khan for his daughter, Maryam. He cradles her in his arms and talks to the camera in the manner of an al-Qaida "martyrdom" video. The video, dating from November 2004, was made just before a trip to Pakistan during which the prosecution alleges that Siddique Khan's "martyrdom" mission changed from jihad in Afghanistan to bombing London.
