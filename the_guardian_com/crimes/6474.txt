The government will today announce a public inquiry into the murder of an Asian teenager who was placed in the same cell as a known violent racist, the Guardian has learned.The family of Zahid Mubarek have fought for four years for a full inquiry after the 19-year-old was bludgeoned to death by Robert Stewart in Feltham young offenders institution in March 2000. The government was forced to hold an independent inquiry after the home secretary, David Blunkett, was ordered to do so by the House of Lords last year. But the teenager's family may still boycott the hearing because they want it to have the power to compel witnesses to attend and testify. The government has appointed the high court judge Mr Justice Keith to chair the inquiry, to be held at the Royal Courts of Justice, the scene of the Hutton inquiry. He will he assisted by three advisers with expertise in race and prisons. The prisons minister Paul Goggins has told the family he believes a non-statutory inquiry is best, though if witnesses refuse to cooperate it could be given more robust powers. He believes a "less heavy handed approach" is more likely to "elicit real openness". Mr Goggins has asked the family to give his approach a chance and to fully participate in the inquiry. Already there have been two inquiries into the death which rocked the prison service, but for which no one has been disciplined. Suresh Grover, spokesman for the family, said key questions have never been addressed by an internal prison service inquiry and one held by the Commission for Racial Equality: "This inquiry has to ask why Zahid was put in the cell with a known racist psychopath and is the prison service culpable in his murder. "None of the inquiries so far has asked that simple burning question."
