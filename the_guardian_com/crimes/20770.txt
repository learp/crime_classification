Members of a gang have been jailed for up to six years and eight months after plotting to steal up to £57m in rhino horn and Chinese artefacts in a series of museum raids.The group, nicknamed the Rathkeale Rovers because of their links to the Irish town, targeted high-value objects in a string of break-ins, including at Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum and Durham’s Oriental Museum, in 2012.Birmingham crown court heard that although the items stolen in Durham and Cambridge were valued at around £17m, detectives believe they might have fetched more than three times that figure on the booming Chinese auction market.Members of the same gang also masterminded an attempted theft at Gorringes auction house in Lewes, East Sussex, and organised the disposal of stolen artefacts in what the judge Murray Creed said was “an extremely sophisticated conspiracy”.Sentencing seven of the 14-strong gang, Creed said the criminal enterprise “involved very high-value goods with significant harm caused to victims, both museums and members of the public who would otherwise have viewed the material stolen.“It is a conspiracy both sophisticated, skilled and persistent, involved significant cultural loss to the UK of museum quality artefacts and items from international collections.”In all, 13 men are being sentenced following three trials which concluded with the gang and its associates convicted of wide-ranging criminal conspiracy to steal, which uncovered connections to Ireland, Europe and China.The judge began by jailing Richard “Kerry” O’Brien Jr, 31, of Cambridgeshire, for five and a half years. His uncle, John “Cash” O’Brien, 68, of Wolverhampton was jailed for five years and three months.Also in the dock was Daniel “Turkey” O’Brien, 45, and Daniel Flynn, also 45, both of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, who were jailed for six years and eight months and four years, respectively. The judge said he had found Flynn to have played a leading role, but reduced the man’s sentence based on “the fragility of his mental health”. Donald Wong, 56, of Lambeth, London, described by the judge as “a buyer, seller and valuer”, was jailed for five and a half years.Paul Pammen, 49, of Southend-on-Sea, and 37-year-old Alan Clarke, of Newham, London, who was said to have headed the gang’s “disposal team”, were each jailed for five and a half years.Six other men convicted over the conspiracy will be sentenced on Tuesday. A 14th man was convicted and sentenced last year for his part in the crime. The judge said the operation to “plunder” rhino horn, carved horn and carved jade items started off “small-scale” in January 2012, but that after initial failures and botched thefts – in one case the burglars forgot where they had hidden their haul – their “planning paid off”. In their most successful theft, 18 pieces of Chinese jade were stolen from the Fitzwilliam Museum. Experts provided various valuations up to almost £18m, and the judge described the items as “priceless”.That haul was stored in a safehouse being taken by taxi to Purfleet in Essex, where they were spirited away.The judge said: “The conspiracy spanned England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic; references were made to France – the Cherbourg visit; Hong Kong and also the United States and Germany also featured in the evidence the court heard over the three trials.”He said the gang had either stolen or tried to steal “highly prized museum-quality” items, often with historic Imperial Chinese dynastic connections, with the exception of an attempted theft on an auction house in March 2012 in which the bungling thieves took the wrong item.On two occasions the Oriental Museum in Durham was targeted. The men carried out reconnaissance of sites including three museums in Glasgow and an auction house in Yorkshire.Creed said there had been “no expression of regret or remorse” from the men, and acknowledged there was “no prospect of recovery”.The remaining members of the gang will be sentenced on Tuesday.
