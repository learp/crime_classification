Every now and then you came across a truly shocking story. What happened to Christopher and Janet Alder is one of those.Christopher, a 37-year-old ex-paratrooper, choked to death on the floor of a police station in 1998.CCTV footage showed the father-of-two gasping for breath as police officers chatted and joked around him. The film showed that he received no help from the officers as he was struggling to stay alive. They thought that the handcuffed former Falklands veteran was play-acting.It took 11 minutes for him to stop breathing. As he lay dead, monkey-like noises could be heard on an audio tape.His sister, Janet, has been campaigning for more than a decade to uncover the truth behind one of the most controversial deaths in police custody.In 2011, it was revealed that his family had buried the wrong person when his body was found in a hospital mortuary. His body had been left there for years as a 77-year-old woman had been mistakenly buried in his place.The police and the government have apologised to the family over the saga of official failures.Last year, it was alleged that police had placed Janet under "improper surveillance" during the inquest that had found her brother had been unlawfully killed.Janet is due to speak next week at a public meeting in Liverpool. I am also on the panel at the meeting to talk about our book, Undercover, the True story of Britain's secret police.The meeting will start at 7.30 on Wednesday May 21 as part of the Writing on the Wall Festival. (Details are here).The festival organisers say the meeting will "discuss the evidence which has recently come to light of police spying tactics, espionage, telephone hacking and the unscrupulous violation of privacy which has been secretly going on for too long."Also speaking will be Phil Scraton, the academic who has done an enormous amount to establish what happened when 96 football fans died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. (For details of his book, Hillsborough - The Truth, see here).For many years, the relatives have been campaigning for justice for those who died at the FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
