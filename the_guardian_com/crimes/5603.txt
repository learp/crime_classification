The home secretary, John Reid, today admitted that he had put his head "on the block" over reforming the beleaguered Home Office.He implied that he would either resign or face the sack if he failed to bring the department up to scratch following a series of embarrassing failures such as the foreign criminals fiasco and rows over "lenient" sentences. He also admitted he had already made mistakes - namely his decision to get involved in the row over illegal immigrants being hired as cleaners at the Home Office. His comments came after Mr Reid and Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington addressed 200 senior managers from the department at a conference in central London. Mr Reid has previously been forthright in criticising shoddy managers in his department and today's meeting has been interpreted as a bid to get top civil servants behind his reform programme. Sitting alongside Sir David, Mr Reid said afterwards: "We together will be putting our head on the block." Asked what would happen if he failed to improve the department, he replied: "What happens when any cabinet minister fails at the Home Office? I think we've lost four."
