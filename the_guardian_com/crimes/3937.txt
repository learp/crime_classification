Police searching for the body of Jenna Baldwin, 15, who disappeared more than two months ago, said they were as certain as they could be that remains found in woodland are those of the missing teenager as they had discovered jewellery belonging to her.The body was found in woodland approximately eight miles from Jenna's home in Abersychan, near Pontypool, south Wales. She disappeared on September 10. Gwent police made the discovery at midnight on Monday in a wooded and bracken covered area, known locally as Fiddler's Elbow, between Abergavenny and Blaenavon. Her family have been informed and they are being supported by specially trained police officers. A postmortem examination will take place tomorrow and formal identification of the body will take place using dental records. When Jenna disappeared from her home, it was initially thought that she left of her own accord after reports that she had been seen with an older man. Just over a month after her disappearance, her family received a series of text messages purporting to be from the missing teenager. Senior police officers, forensic archaeologists and search teams had been concentrating their search efforts in the area where the body was found after they received an anonymous tip-off. Gwent police have been carrying out extensive searches for Jenna's body over the last three weeks. A helicopter using thermal imaging equipment and sniffer dogs which can detect human remains have been brought in as part of the inquiry. Jenna's stepfather, Mike Baldwin, a 36-year-old factory worker, was late last month charged with her murder. He was remanded in custody after appearing before Newport magistrates earlier this month.
