The criminal justice system was today strongly criticised for its soft powers over criminals who commit offences on bail.An inquiry into how a man with schizophrenia stabbed another man to death on a London bus after being wrongly freed from custody found officials in the courts, probation and police showed "apparent acceptance" of breached bail conditions. Anthony Joseph stabbed Richard Whelan seven times, including once through the heart, after the 28-year-old tried to stop Jospeh throwing chips at his girlfriend. The report by criminal justice watchdogs said: "There seems to be too ready an acceptance of the commission of offences while on bail, insufficient rigour in respect of checking the validity of proposed bail conditions, and an apparent acceptance of the continual breach of bail conditions."Joseph, also known as Anthony Peart, was sent to Broadmoor secure hospital in December. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after being formally acquitted of murder when two trials failed to produce verdicts. The incident on the top deck of a No 43 bus in Holloway, north London, took place just hours after Johnson's release from prison in July 2005. He was freed despite a warrant being out for his arrest over an alleged burglary. Merseyside police, who were investigating the burglary, did not know Joseph had been in custody because a computer system had not been updated. Today's report recommended that ministers should look at giving prison officials "enhanced access" to the police national computer so they had full information about individual inmates, and whether there were outstanding charges or warrants.
