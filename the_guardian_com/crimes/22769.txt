Police have spoken to train passengers who were subject to a tirade of racial abuse from an apparently drunken man captured on a mobile phone.British Transport police are investigating the incident on a Brighton-bound train in which a man wearing a hi-vis NTL jacket told a black commuter that he was a "monkey", "gorilla" and a "mongrel" for having allegedly woken him up.Fellow passengers including a young woman tell the man, who is seen gripping a bottle of beer, to sit down, asking him: "What's your problem?"In the incident which police believe took place on 26 May, the middle-aged man, who says he is Irish, threatens to kill the man and exclaims: "I don't like being rudely awakened by some mongrel."Another female passenger retorts: "That's enough, we don't accept that kind of behaviour."The man, who is understood to be already known to the authorities, says: "I'm not a racist."   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Virgin Media, formerly NTL, said it did not believe the man was connected with the company. A spokesman told the BBC: "If he is identified from amongst our thousands of excellent employees, we'll take the strongest possible action as we completely condemn the views expressed in the video."Earlier this week a court said a woman who was captured on a mobile phone hurling racist abuse on a Croydon tram last year would not be jailed after pleading guilty to a racially aggravated section 5 public order offence.Emma West, 36, was charged by police after footage posted on YouTube was viewed by millions of people after appearing online in November 2011.With a toddler on her knee, West shouted: "What has this country come to? A load of black people and a load of fucking Polish."Speaking about the latest incident a British Transport police spokesman said:Â "Everyone has the right to travel without fear of abuse or threatening or racist behaviour and we take this type of offence extremely seriously."We believe the incident took place on Sunday 26 May on a train near Brighton. It's important that we build the full picture of events and what led to the incident, including exactly what took place before, during and afterwards. For that reason, we're keen to hear from anyone who was in the carriage concerned and who saw what happened, no matter how insignificant their information might seem."The spokesman added: "Anyone who captures incidents like this on video can let us know by texting 61016 with as many details as possible about where and when it took place. We'll then send details of how to email the video to us and will investigate the matter."
