A man has been charged with wildlife cruelty after police in Edinburgh discovered an alligator in the boot of a car, officers confirmed today.The 3.5ft spectacled cayman was found yesterday afternoon after it had allegedly been offered for sale in a specialist publication.Plain clothes police and officers from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) set up a meeting with the seller and retrieved the reptile from his boot. Owning such animals without a licence is an offence under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. The list of permitted pets was recently extended to porcupines, raccoons and sloths but not caymans.The beast was said to be "probably quite traumatised" by the journey cooped up in the back of the vehicle and is being cared for at a sanctuary.SSPCA spokeswoman Mairi Ball said: "These alligators will attack anyone, they have big teeth and can grow up to three metres long."Presumably this one was imported and unfortunately, there's a trend for keeping these exotic pets by people who have no idea how to care for them."These are killers, not pets, they can be very dangerous. This one was only a third of its full size."A spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders police confirmed that one man has been charged with six offences and another has been released."One man has been charged with five wildlife cruelty offences and one count of culpable and reckless conduct," she said.
