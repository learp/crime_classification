Nine men have been arrested by detectives investigating a suspected second child grooming gang in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.The alleged victim is reported to be one of 47 girls questioned by police in relation to an earlier child sexual exploitation ring in the town.That case concluded on Wednesday when nine Asian men received jail sentences of between four and 19 years from a judge who said they treated their five white victims "as though they were worthless and beyond any respect".It is understood that detectives are exploring possible links between the new suspects – aged between 24 and 38 – but none has yet been established.A Greater Manchester police spokesman said the men were arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with a child and had been bailed pending further inquiries. Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk said on Saturday: "There have been some who've said this is a one-off case but I have consistently said I believe it to be a wider problem and that's why I am pleased to see the police acting."My message for anyone thinking of getting involved in this kind of activity is that you do so at your peril because the full force of the law will come down very hard on you."We've seen inspiring bravery shown by victims in the recent trial. I hope the heavy sentences imposed will encourage other victims to speak out because this crime is being taken very seriously and we need to send out the clearest message that this behaviour will not be tolerated in Rochdale or anywhere else."The recent trial, at Liverpool crown court, heard that five girls – aged between 13 and 15 – were given alcohol, food and money in return for sex, but there were times when violence was used.The offences happened in and around Rochdale in 2008 and 2009.The men were convicted of conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with children under the age of 16 and other sexual offences including rape and trafficking for sexual exploitation.
