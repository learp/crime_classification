A rejected lover killed a Finnish student in "appalling" circumstances and attacked seven other women in the same area in a period of three days, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.Jason Dockrill, 34, of Stratford, east London, was driven by a sexual, anti-female and financial motive, Richard Horwell, prosecuting, suggested. He had lost his job two weeks earlier. His latest girlfriend had given him up three months earlier. On March 20 last year he killed Suvi Aronen on open land by Wanstead Common, east London, by blows to the head, Mr Horwell said. He then removed her lower clothes, interfered with her sexually, stole certain items from her, and hid her body in woodland. Mr Horwell said there was no dispute that Mr Dockrill had killed Miss Aronen. The issue the jury had to decide was whether he was guilty of murder or manslaughter on the grounds that his acknowledged personality disorder diminished his responsibility. The case continues.
