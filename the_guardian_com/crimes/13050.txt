Chief constables are to be given pay rises of up to 16% as part of a drive aimed at making top police jobs more appealing to talented officers.The revised salary structure means that many chief constables running big forces will earn £150,000 a year, which is more than the home secretary, David Blunkett, and other cabinet ministers. Chief constables in England and Wales will be paid at least £110,000 a year, with their Scottish counterparts earning a minimum of £105, 000. The new pay deal follows a Home Office report on police leadership last May, which expressed concerns that too few promising officers wanted to apply for jobs in forces covering large cities. A reward scheme for performance will also be introduced next year, offering successful police chiefs bonuses of up to 15%. It is hoped that the pay package will reflect the stress of top police jobs and make the earn ings of chief constables comparable with those of chief executives in public organisations such as the NHS. A Home Office spokesman said: "This pay increase is to act as an incentive for the best leaders to take up the most challenging jobs. It has been done in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness." The salaries, backdated to last autumn, also reflect the responsibilities for counter-terrorism that the heads of urban forces face in the aftermath of September 11.
