Gay campaigners are demanding a fresh inquiry into why police failed to investigate the murder of Damilola Taylor as a homophobic hate crime as new details emerged about anti-gay bullying the boy suffered at school.The family of 11-year-old Damilola spoke publicly of playground taunts against their son in the days after he was stabbed and left to bleed to death in a stairwell on the North Peckham estate in south London two years ago. The investigation, however, soon focused elsewhere. Staff at his school, Oliver Goldsmith primary in Peckham, now believe Damilola was labelled as gay by other children because they misinterpreted the 'tactile' and 'exuberant' behaviour of his Nigerian background. Peter Tatchell of gay human rights group OutRage! has written to the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir John Stevens, demanding to know why the original investigation failed to consider a possible link between homophobic bullying and Damilola's death. He has also written to John Sentamu, the Bishop of Birmingham, who carried out an inquiry into the case, to ask why he did not mention homophobia in his report, published at the end of last year. Immediately after Damilola's death on 27 November 2000, his parents, Richard and Gloria, claimed that he had been bullied at school the previous week, and called a 'gay boy'. He did not even understand the meaning of the word 'gay'. Tatchell said: 'Damilola's mother said her son had been the victim of an anti-gay assault a few days before the fatal attack. The original police investigation and the bishop's inquiry into the failed prosecution ignored these crucial facts.' The school governors' chair, Bola Ogun, said staff had tackled the problem of anti-gay taunts made against Damilola, and its anti-bullying policy had been praised by Ofsted inspectors.
