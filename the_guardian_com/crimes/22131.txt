About 70 of the 540 Britons whose overseas convictions for serious crimes were left off the police records are believed to have offended again since they returned home, according to probation sources.The scale of their reoffending emerged yesterday after probation areas across England and Wales were sent a checklist on Wednesday of the 540 names of those Britons whose details of convictions for crimes committed abroad in the past eight years had been left in box files at the Home Office instead of being entered on the police national computer.A parallel check carried out by the Criminal Records Bureau showed that none of the serious violent or sex offenders among the 540 had mistakenly been cleared to work with children or vulnerable adults.However, a Home Office spokesman confirmed that four drug offenders and one people trafficker had been given criminal record clearance to work as sports coaches and carers. Their new employers are being informed.The CRB sweep also found a further nine cases where individuals who have been given criminal records checks had details similar to those on the list of 540 serious offenders. Efforts will be made today to confirm whether they are actually the same people.The Home Office yesterday played down the implications of the disclosure by the Observer that the convictions of a British gangster, Dale Miller, in Switzerland and Germany in the early 1990s were among those not logged on the police national computer. Miller was sentenced in 2002 to 16 years in prison for manslaughter in Newcastle. The Home Office said Miller had been known to the police as a serious criminal since 1982 and his presence among the 540 had no practical implications. Home Office sources confirmed Miller's details were placed on the police national computer by Interpol in 1999. Checks have yet to be made on a further 27,000 names of British criminals convicted abroad of less serious offences.Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers, who disclosed the results of the probation service sweep, said he thought the figure of 70 going on to commit further offences after their return to Britain was rather low given average reoffending rates of more than 60%. The figure is based on returns from the 43 probation areas to the Home Office. "It seems very low - but that may be because many of them have disappeared, changed their names or even gone abroad again," said Mr Fletcher.The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives renewed their demand yesterday for an independent inquiry into this latest blunder by the Home Office after it confirmed that an internal inquiry, to be completed within six weeks, will be carried out by the department's head of human resources, Dusty Amroliwala. The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said the affair had turned from "farce to tragedy" since senior police officers had disclosed the problem last Tuesday.The home secretary, John Reid, will confirm this week that plans to introduce "super-Asbos" - violent offender orders - targeted at those who police believe are likely to commit violent crimes, will be added to the criminal justice bill. The detailed plans for the orders were published by Mr Reid in July, when he also outlined plans to enable suspected organised criminals to be banned from travelling or using mobile phones.A Centre for Crime and Justice Studies report today will add to the pressure on Mr Reid when it suggests that government claims of success in tackling crime have been overstated to the point where in some cases they have been misleading. The report's author, Richard Garside, said that despite its apparently strong record on crime, Labour's key claims to success did not stand up to detailed scrutiny.The report says government crime reduction claims ignore many serious offences such as homicide, which has increased significantly. While Labour has met its targets on bringing more offences to justice overall, there were three convictions for every 100 estimated offences and reoffending targets had "all been modified, missed or dropped", researchers found.
