'Muti murder' is practised across a wide swath of Africa, from Nigeria in the west to the Zulu and Swazi regions of South Africa.Muti is the Zulu word for medicine, and a muti murder is a dark manifestation of traditional African healing. Such healing is practised by sangomas, or so called 'witch doctors', who are usually women. Muti cures often take the form of a potion of herbs or roots, or require the sacrifice of an animal. Clues that this was a ritual killing include the dressing of the torso in orange shorts, a colour associated with "bad muti". It is also typical to discard the body in flowing water to get rid of the evil associated with it. If this was a ritual murder Adam's limbs would have been removed in order to 'make medicine' and would have been boiled up into potions. A typical muti murder is performed by a group of people with a common goal. Hendrik Scholtz, a South African professor and authority on muti, performed a second postmortem on Adam. He described the belief behind a muti killing: "The victim may be a blood relative or one of their own children, but is never a stranger and definitely never an enemy. "The child is not killed because they are angry with it. They are thankful to the child. This child is actually being sacrificed so that these people can have something of an advancement. "It is to attain a goal that is unattainable by normal sacrifice [the sacrifice of an animal], whether that goal is prosperity or high political office. "To our western minds, the concept of ritual murder is gruesome. But 2,000 years ago Jesus Christ was sacrificed for the good of the community - and the theory is that this is good for the community.'
