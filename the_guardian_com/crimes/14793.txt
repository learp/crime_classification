New laws preventing people accused of murder from using sexual jealousy, so-called "honour" killing and revenge as partial defences will make little difference in practice, lawyers say.The reforms - which will be debated next week as part of proposals for the first new murder legislation in 50 years - have been hailed by the government as a radical overhaul after years of controversial interpretation by the courts. They will remove the current rules on "provocation", which provides a "partial defence" of murder, reducing convictions to manslaughter where an accused proves they have killed after being "provoked to lose self-control as a result of things said or done"."Provocation" will be replaced under the proposals, part of the coroners and justice bill published last week, with a new system of partial defences that specifically excludes sexual jealousy, something that was previously open for the jury to allow as a basis for the partial defence.Critics of the changes have expressed doubts about singling out situations such as sexual infidelity. "I must confess to being uneasy about a law which so diminishes the significance of sexual infidelity," Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, the senior law lord, said recently in response to the proposals. "We do not believe that sexual infidelity should be singled out," added Peter Lodder QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association.Lawyers said the changes would make little difference in practice. "As a general trend, defendants have not been able to rely on sexual infidelity under the current law," criminal barrister John Cooper said. "Any defence run on that basis would have been unlikely to convince a jury."Despite the proposals' aims to toughen the law on "provocation", victims of domestic violence would be subject to greater understanding under the changes, the government said. Defendants - often women - who killed their partners after suffering from cumulative episodes of abuse would be able to invoke a new partial defence, reducing their conviction to manslaughter where they could show they acted in "fear of serious violence".The government also faces opposition over its refusal to radically change the law on "diminished responsibility", a separate partial defence open to defendants suffering from an "abnormality of mind".The current law will be clarified so that it only applies to those suffering from a "recognised medical condition". The government has rejected proposals to include "developmental immaturity", causing anger among critics.
