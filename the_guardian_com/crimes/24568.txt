Not even the organ pipes are sacred any more. The congregation at Leaveland church near Faversham, Kent, will have to sing a cappella after 47 lead pipes, up to 6ft long, were pinched, presumably to feed the burgeoning global demand for scrap metal.Sgt Dave Smith, Kent police, said: "These pipes are only worth in the region of £50 in scrap metal, but to replace them will cost thousands. Until that money can be found, it will leave the church devoid of music."World scrap metal prices have risen dramatically, particularly triggered by strong demand from the Chinese economy which needs increasingly vast quantities of raw materials in order to make all the goods wanted by largely western consumers. They may seem cheap in the shops but it turns out they are not without their external costs. The police believe illegal metal trading costs the UK economy almost £360m every year. Lead from church roofs, drain covers, railway signaling cable, Henry Moore sculptures, bronze plaques have all been stolen.Between January 1 and April 16 this year, British Transport police recorded 637 metal theft offences and arrested 153 people. A two-day crackdown targeting illegal scrap metal trading and involving 38 police forces is currently under way.Assistant Chief Constable Paul Crowther, of the British Transport police, said:"This is far from being a victimless crime. Thousands of people have seen their community facilities stolen or damaged by thieves looking for a quick gain, or have suffered service disruption to railways and telecoms. The problem ranges from opportunistic to large-scale organised theft."
