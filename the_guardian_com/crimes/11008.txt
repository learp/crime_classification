A judge ordered a teenager to be named yesterday when he jailed him for life for stabbing a man through the heart as he tried to defend his bullied son.Marcus Gabadan, 16, had subjected the 13-year-old boy to a campaign of bullying, ordering that he hand over £20 and a copy of the computer game Grand Theft Auto.He also warned the boy that if he refused to give him the game and the money he would kill his father. The young victim, who cannot be named, told his father about the threats and when Gabadan and another boy arrived outside his house in Brixton, south London, the boy's father went to confront them. It cost him his life.Lifting an order banning the naming of Gabadan as a juvenile, Judge James Stewart at the Old Bailey said it would be at least 10 years before he was considered for release. The judge said: This was a gratuitous and unprovoked attack upon a man trying to stop his son being bullied."The Old Bailey heard how the father tried to phone police before going outside. But when he was put on hold, he ignored his wife's warnings and went out to remonstrate with the two boys.Michael Worsley QC, prosecuting, said threats to the 13-year-old had begun last December 14. "During that period, the 14-year-old defendant made demands of that young boy for the delivery to him of a computer game ... and also of £20."To try to enforce the demands the defendant made threats. One of the threats made was that he would kill his father."The 14-year-old, who was convicted of blackmail, will be sentenced next month.
