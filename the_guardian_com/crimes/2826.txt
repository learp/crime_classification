A man has been charged with the murder of two women at their home over the weekend. Ensar Gol, 21, is alleged to have killed the women aged 29 and 50 in the early hours of Sunday. The Turkish national, of Thame, Oxfordshire, is also charged with the attempted murder of a 19-year-old woman who is in hospital in a stable condition. Gol was due to appear before Oxford magistrates on Tuesday morning. A police spokesman said the names of the two deceased would not be released until a formal identification process had taken place. Postmortem examinations will be conducted later.
