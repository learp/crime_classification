A carpenter accused of mutilating and dumping his girlfriends' bodies in canals is still fascinated with cutting up women, the Old Bailey heard.A drawing of a headless body cut into 13 pieces was found in John Sweeney's cell at Gartree prison, Leicestershire, among other artwork, said Brian Altman QC, prosecuting. He said: "Time had not dimmed his fascination and preoccupation with dismemberment."Sweeney who is serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a third girlfriend denies the murders of two other women, ormer model Melissa Halstead, 33, and Paula Fields, 31.Their heads and hands have never been found and the prosecution alleges Sweeney, 54, from Liverpool, disposed of them to avoid them being identified.Halstead's naked body was sawn at the spine and folded into a bag found in a canal in Rotterdam in 1990. She was not identified for 18 years until DNA matched samples from her family.Fields, a mother of three, was sawn into 15 bits. Ten parts were found in six holdalls in the Regent's canal, north London, in 2001.Altman said that between the two murders, Sweeney attacked Delia Balmer with an axe and knife in Camden, north London, in 1994.He went on the run but after his arrest in 2001, "lurid and demonic" artwork and verse, some depicting the death of Halstead, were found in his home in north London. There were also a machete and a garrotte made from bamboo and wire.The trial continues on Monday.
