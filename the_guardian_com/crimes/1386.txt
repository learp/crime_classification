A policing initiative launched last month by Ken Livingstone and Tony Blair has halved crime in parts of the capital, initial figures show. Under the Safer Neighbourhoods scheme, teams of six officers are being deployed to every ward in London. Forty-five of the 96 teams are in place. Mr Blair said if the scheme works he expected to extend it nationwide.Since its inception, crime in the area of Redbridge, east London, covered by a neighbourhood team has fallen by half. Crime is also down in Kensington and Chelsea, where the council has paid for additional police community support officers.Meanwhile, Mr Livingstone yesterday promised his backing to staff at the Greater London authority who refuse to cooperate with the racist British National party. Amid fears that the BNP could secure 5% of the vote in next month's election and a seat on the London assembly, Mr Livingstone has used his power as mayor to reassure staff that those who refuse to follow instructions they find racist or discriminatory will not face repercussions. A YouGov poll last week suggested support for the BNP is running at the 5% it needs.Staff who voiced concern about what conflicts might arise were told by their bosses at City Hall that they would be required to treat any BNP member in the same way as any other elected member. Some fear they may be asked to draft racist letters or conduct policy work as they do for other parties. In a letter sent to all GLA staff, Mr Livingstone said: "I am writing to assure you that the GLA Act, anti-discrimination legislation and GLA human resources policies fully protect you against all discrimination including racism, sexism, cultural and religious intolerance, homophobia and ageism. "This also ensures that you cannot be required by an elected official to carry out on their behalf work that is unlawful discrimination against any group of Londoners."
