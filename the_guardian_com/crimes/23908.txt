Police carrying out a murder investigation into the death of 11-year-old Rory Blackhall today said he had been suffocated.Officers launched an appeal for more information about the disappearance of the schoolboy, whose body was found under a tent in woodland in West Lothian on Sunday.He had been missing for four days, and there had been no reported sightings of him after he vanished.Following a post-mortem carried out last night, Lothian and Borders police confirmed that they were conducting a murder investigation."As a result of the post-mortem examination ... we have now established that Rory died by asphyxiation by means of an item as yet unknown," Detective Inspector Tom Martin, leading the investigation, said today."Considerable forensic examinations and tests are currently undergoing to try and clarify that fact for us."Rory was last seen when his mother, Michelle, dropped him off in a lay-by 300 yards from Meldrum primary school in Livingston, West Lothian at 8.30am on Thursday.To reach the school, he had to walk through an underpass, and his mother saw him walk away from her into that underpass.When his grandfather went to collect him at 3.30pm, he discovered that he had never made it to class. A huge search involving 300 volunteers, 70 trained mountain search and rescue teams and specialist police officers began.Rory's body was found on Sunday afternoon near a wooded pathway less than half a mile away. He was fully clothed and covered by a small green tent "in a poor state of repair".Locals yesterday spoke of a "lovable, fantastic boy" who had endured a difficult year.His parents had recently separated, his grandmother had died and one of his closest friends had moved away. Rory was said to be unhappy at returning to school after the summer holidays.However, any suggestion that he might have committed suicide was today ruled out by police, who appealed for specific information that could help to find the killer.When Rory's mother last saw him, he was carrying a navy blue Puma rucksack containing his sandwich box, schoolbooks with his name on them, a camouflage pencil case and a clear plastic folder. The rucksack has not yet been found, and could hold clues to his disappearance.DI Martin said a number of male strangers had recently been seen in the Livingston area, and appealed for anyone with information about the men to contact police.He also appealed for more information about the tent that covered Rory's body. Police believe the Outbound Sierra tent might have been found in the woods, and asked anyone who may have seen it to come forward.Officers appealed for any sightings of Rory between the time he disappeared and the time his body was found, and told parents there could be a risk to their children.While urging parents not to "imprison" them, they warned children not to go out alone at night, to always tell their parents where they were going and to stay in contact by mobile phone.Members of the public with any information should contact the incident room on 01506 445650.
