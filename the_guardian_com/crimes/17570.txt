The Parole Board lacks the independence from government it needs to fulfil its role of deciding whether prisoners should be released, the high court held yesterday in a surprise ruling. The decision, unless overturned on appeal, will oblige the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to restructure the board and possibly make it independent from the Ministry of Justice. The ruling was stayed while Mr Straw, who was given permission to appeal, seeks to overturn it in the appeal court.The declaration was won by four prisoners fighting for release from custody who argued that their right to a fair hearing had been violated because of the close link between the board and the government. The four are a burglar, a sex offender, a man who assaulted his wife, and a lifer who is in jail for complicity in murders.Lord Justice Hughes and Mr Justice Treacy, sitting at London's high court, said they had found no sign of any attempt by the former Home Office, and now the Ministry of Justice, to influence individual cases. But they ruled: "The present arrangements for the Parole Board do not sufficiently demonstrate its objective independence of the secretary of state."The judges pointed to two instances in which the Home Office - which oversaw the Parole Board before it was moved to the Ministry of Justice - interfered with the board's independence.The department had refused to fund interviews with prisoners in all but 10% of cases, although the law gave the board discretion to interview inmates as part of the risk assessment. After that, few interviews were held.On the second occasion, John Reid, then home secretary, decided that the board needed members representing victims, in a move "designed to alter, to some extent at least, the outcome of cases before the board".Tim Owen QC, an expert on prison law, said: "This judgment is an inevitable result of the board's gradual transition from mere adviser to the home secretary to a fully judicialised body making vital decisions about the liberty of the subject. As its functions have changed, its structural closeness to and control by a minister have simply become unacceptable."John Reid's May 2006 lecture promising to rebalance the parole system in favour of victims by changing the composition of the Parole Board was obviously incompatible with any objective appearance of independence on the part of the board."One of the solicitors who won the landmark victory, John Dickinson, said: "If it is upheld on appeal, this judgment will affect not only tens of thousands of prison inmates but all those who rely on parole board decisions."This issue was emphasised by the Parole Board's description in a Home Office review as being 'an instrument of government policy'. The court found that the influence and control that the secretary of state has over the board fatally undermines its required perception of independence."The ruling does not affect the outcome of the cases of the four prisoners who brought the challenge. In two cases the judges said they were satisfied that an independent parole board would have reached the same conclusions. In the third, they ordered a fresh hearing by the high court, and in the fourth the life sentence prisoner, whose review is forthcoming, had sought a declaration in advance that the Parole Board was not independent.A Parole Board spokesman said: "Unless the decision is reversed on appeal, this means that the secretary of state will have to take the necessary steps to ensure that the board does become sufficiently independent, or risk being in contempt of the court." He said the sponsorship of the board could be moved to another government department, or it could become part of the courts service.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: "Naturally we are disappointed by today's judgment."This judgment will not result in any prisoner being released earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Neither does it open the way for offenders to seek to apply for compensation."The extraordinary ruling follows recent judgments that the detention of prisoners subject to indefinite sentences for public protection (IPP) was unlawful because prison overcrowding meant they could not gain access to offending behaviour courses, to convince the parole board they were no longer a danger. The unexpectedly high numbers of prisoners given IPP sentences by judges has already led to severe delays in parole board hearings. These will significantly worsen if the board has to be completely restructured.FAQWhat does the judgment mean for the parole board?Unless the minister of justice, Jack Straw, succeeds in overturning it on appeal, the board will have to be restructured to make it independent of the Ministry of Justice, possibly putting it under another department or the court serviceWhy was the ruling a surprise?Prisoners have brought previous cases to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg claiming that the board was not independentWhy did the government lose now?The high court judges had much more evidence than the Strasbourg court had of the closeness between the board and the department. The Home Office had interfered with the board's discretion
