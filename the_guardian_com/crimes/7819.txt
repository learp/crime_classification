"A 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of Section 18 assault – causing grievous bodily harm with intent – remains in police custody for questioning," a spokesman said. "Inquiries are continuing."A witness said the men seemed to be talking, then one put the other in a headlock."The attacker put a knife against the victim's neck and stabbed him a couple of times," the eyewitness said."It looked like he was going to do it again, but another sales assistant, an older guy, intervened and wrestled him to the ground."Someone else called security and they came to calm the situation down. There was a lot of blood gushing from his neck and it was pretty scary to see it unfold."The store, which has been open since 1939, was officially renamed House of Fraser five years ago. It is on Deansgate, one of Manchester's busiest shopping streets.A House of Fraser spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to ensure the wellbeing of our staff and customers."We are treating the situation with the utmost seriousness and are working closely with the police, who are investigating the incident."
