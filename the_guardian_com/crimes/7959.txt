The British arms firm BAE Systems has accepted guilt and agreed to pay penalties in the US and the UK totalling several hundred million pounds to settle all the long-running corruption allegations against it.Under the deal, announced simultaneously in London and Washington, BAE will pay $400m (£255m) in the US and £30m in the UK.In the US, the company will plead guilty to offences of false accounting to settle bribery allegations made over the enormous al-Yamamah arms deals with Saudi Arabia stretching back more than 20 years, as well as corruption allegations over arms deals in central Europe.The deal with the Serious Fraud Office in the UK covers one arms contract only, under which an overpriced military radar was sold to Tanzania. The SFO said some of the cash would become "an ex gratia payment for the benefit of the people of Tanzania".The settlement vindicates a long campaign fought by the Guardian, which began a series of exposures of BAE's criminal conduct more than six years ago. BAE repeatedly denied all wrongdoing."I am very pleased with the global outcome achieved collaboratively with the DoJ (US department of justice)," said the SFO director, Richard Alderman. "This is a first and it brings a pragmatic end to a long-running and wide-ranging investigation."Alderman acknowledged efforts made by BAE to conclude the matter and said he welcomed the company's "declared commitment to high ethical standards".BAE, which expressed regret and accepted "full responsibility for these past shortcomings", said the settlement would allow it to "deal finally with significant legacy issues" that had overshadowed the company.Dick Oliver, who was appointed chairman in 2004, said BAE had failed to honour a commitment made to the US government in 2000 to establish and comply with US regulatory requirements within a certain period. As for Tanzania, BAE had failed to record commission payments to a marketing adviser.The firm said that in the years since the incidents it had "systematically enhanced" its compliance policies and procedures.Analysts said BAE had got off relatively lightly. "While it's a substantial figure, it's less than the worst case scenario," Tina Cook at brokerage Charles Stanley told Reuters, noting that initial media reports had suggested a figure of up to £1bn from the SFO, later revised down to between £200m and £300m. "It also removes an overhang on the share price caused by uncertainty about the investigations."BAE shares were up 2.2% in late trading as the market welcomed news of a fine that was not as high as feared.Anti-corruption campaigners thought BAE was treated too leniently by the authorities. The Campaign Against Arms Trade said: "CAAT is extremely disappointed that the allegations about BAE will not be aired in a criminal court and that the Serious Fraud Office has accepted a plea bargain relating only to the smallest deal."In December 2006 the SFO – amid much consternation – dropped its corruption investigations into BAE's arms sales to Saudi Arabia after direct intervention from Tony Blair, who was prime minister. He defended the decision on the grounds that the Saudis would stop co-operating on security issues. Anti-corruption groups strongly criticised Blair and in 2008 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expressed its disappointment and serious concern at the "UK's continued failure to address deficiencies in its laws on bribery of foreign public officials and on corporate liability for foreign bribery".An independent review of practices at BAE in 2008 urged it to adopt stronger anti-bribery measures and a global ethical code of conduct. The proposals were among 23 recommendations made by an independent committee headed by Lord Woolf, the former lord chief justice, after a year-long study.He said: "BAE either becomes an ethical company, which involves refusing to get involved in some contracts, or it does not become a fully ethical company reaching the gold standard that we have identified."There are contracts that are not worth having and that will do long-term damage to the company, and the company has to accept that."
