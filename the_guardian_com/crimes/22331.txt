A "potentially explosive" dispute between Muslim factions inside Britain's largest prison has been revealed by independent jail watchdogs.The independent monitoring board at Wandsworth prison, south London, also warns today that some Muslim inmates are being pressured to adopt "more militant lifestyles and belief systems".Wandsworth jail, which houses 265 Muslim prisoners among its 1,400 population, is the largest in Britain. The IMB annual report says that a schism developed within Wandsworth prison's Muslim community over an imam, with petitions sent to the governor for and against his dismissal. "We are concerned that unless sensitively managed this issue could become even more emotional and potentially explosive," says the IMB report, sent to the home secretary, John Reid.The IMB chairman, David Jamieson, said the dispute centred on interpretation of the Qur'an: "There is a difference of views between the Asian Muslims and the north African and Afro-Caribbean Muslims." The report, covering July 2005 to June 2006, also warns that "there is some evidence from time to time of some Muslims applying pressure on some of their fellow Muslims to adopt more militant lifestyles and belief systems".Last month the Prison Officers Association warned that the Home Office had no national strategy for tackling the radicalisation and recruitment of young Muslims inside Britain's prisons.The Prison Service acknowledged concerns but insisted there was "little hard evidence that it was happening to date". However, this report from Britain's largest prison suggests that the union's concerns may be well-founded.The surge in numbers of Muslim prisoners in Wandsworth has also put prayer facilities under pressure.It is believed that more than 200 regularly attend Friday prayers, and the Muslims have to walk through the Christian chapel to reach the prayer room, "exacerbating at times inherent tension".The big rise in numbers at Friday prayers led to services being held in the sports hall, but it has now been decided to convert the Anglican chapel for use as a mosque, with the Catholic chapel being used for all Christian worship.A Prison Service spokeswoman said a new imam had been appointed in September, and "any signs of radicalisation at the prison are firmly dealt with by a pro-active chaplaincy team".The recent Eid meal at Wandsworth was attended by 240 prisoners, representing virtually every Muslim prisoner and a number of non-Muslims, during which the new imam was personally praised.Lord Carlile, the anti-terror laws watchdog, has identified the recruitment of radicalised youth in prisons as a problem and raised concerns about the small number of imams in prisons.
