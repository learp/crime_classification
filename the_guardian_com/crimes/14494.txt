The number of teenagers caught carrying knives has fallen in crime "hotspots" targeted by police, according to government figures released later today.Officers from 10 forces in England have searched 105,000 young people in the six months since the launch of the £2m Home Office campaign in June, according to the BBC.During this period, the number of teenagers caught carrying knives fell by more than half.In June, one person in 30 was caught carrying a knife but by October it had fallen to one in 65.The number of serious injuries and deaths in the same period also fell 17%.More than 2,200 knives were seized during the stop and search operations, the BBC reported.The 10 areas involved in the crackdown, known as the Tackling Knives Action Programme, were London, Essex, Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Merseyside, the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire, south Wales and Thames Valley.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said: "The forces that we focused on are those where nearly 80% of knife crime actually happens."We chose the areas where we were going to make the most difference and we have seen that having an impact."But we do want to learn from what's happened in these areas, continue it there and make sure that other forces can benefit from it."But critics and opposition politicians lined up to complain that the government's measures did little to tackle the root causes of knife crime.The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, accused the government of concentrating on "ad-hoc, regionally-focused" operations that provided short-term solutions."Short-term measures will only achieve short-term results. We need concerted and tough action in the short, medium and long term. As well as deploying more police on to every street for good, knife offenders must face an automatic presumption of jail, not a slap on the wrist," said Grieve."We must also address the fundamental causes of crime, like drugs, unemployment and family breakdown, which Labour have simply neglected over the last 11 years."Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner with the Metropolitan police, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The difficulty is that stop and search deals with the symptoms and not the root causes. "There are significant social issues in these inner city estates. You've got young people who believe they have to join gangs to protect themselves and don't have trust and confidence in the police to protect them."Paddick also questioned whether knife crime had decreased because, he said, some hospital accident and emergency departments had seen an increase in the number of people with knife wounds.Actor Femi Oyeniran, who starred in the London crime films Kidulthood and Adulthood, agreed that stop and search was not the solution to reducing knife crime."It may be a quick fix, even if it does work which I doubt it does, but I don't think it's the solution because it does not get to the root cause of the problem," he said.The actor, who grew up in north London and studied law at university, said that as a young black man he had come to accept that he would be stopped and searched by the police."I'm not happy with it. I'm very blasé about it. If the police stop me it does not matter because I'm not a criminal."He said the solution was to install young people with more ambition and drive, providing them with role models from outside the world of crime. The results of the Home Office initiative come a month after the chairman of the home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz, said Britain's fight to beat knife crime was "clearly not working".Vaz said knife crime was "clearly not being dealt with at the moment with the legitimate, appropriate political solutions".The Home Office said the figures would be released later this morning.In the UK this year, 34 teenagers have died from stab wounds, 23 of whom died in London.
