Former chief inspector of prisons Sir David Ramsbotham has delivered a blistering attack on Britain's penal system.In a new book published next week Sir David exposes the prison service as a "bureaucratic nightmare" bogged down in "myriad targets and performance indicators". His book Prisongate, which is being serialised in the Times, said that targets are "all too prevalent in the public sector" but they cannot be taken seriously because of the way they are tested.Sir David, the chief inspector for five and half years, added: "The more I looked at the prison service the more I recognised a bureaucratic nightmare." He claimed that the service produced a pile of correspondence that forms a mile high every four months. "What madness," he wrote. "In 2000 the governor of Holloway told me that 80% of his time was taken up with bureaucracy. No wonder managers in prisons have so little time for prisoners."Sir David's book also claimed that drug taking in Britain's jails is not being honestly tested.He cited Rochester prison in Kent, which had claimed that virtually none of its prisoners had tested positive for drugs. Sir David suggested that asylum seekers with no access to drugs were being illegally tested in an effort to massage the figures. "Mandatory testing is now largely discredited and certainly does not indicate the size of the problem. Intensive treatment is available in only 50 out of the 137 prisons," Sir David said. He added that targets on providing prisoners with a programme of "purposeful activity" cannot be taken seriously because different rules apply in private and public sector prisons. Sir David pointed out that private prisons which fail to provide 30 hours of purposeful activity risk being fined, whereas public prisons have lower targets and are not disciplined if they fail to meet them.
