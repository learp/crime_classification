A man has been arrested over two unsolved double murders dating back more than 20 years.Cold case detectives from Dyfed Powys police said he was arrested on suspicion of murdering siblings Helen and Richard Thomas at Scoveston Manor, Pembrokeshire, in December 1985.The man, 64, is also suspected of murdering campers Peter and Gwenda Dixon on the Pembrokeshire coastal path in 1989.The Thomases' bodies were found at their burnt-out mansion near Milford Haven. They had been shot at close range with a shotgun and police initially thought it was a murder-suicide resulting from a domestic dispute.It later became clear that Miss Thomas was killed first, then her brother, apparently when he returned.The Dixons were middle-aged tourists from Witney, Oxford, exploring Pembrokeshire in the summer of 1989. Their bodies were found hidden close to a cliff path six days after their disappearance. They had been shot at close range in what appeared to be execution-style killings, with Mr Dixon's hands tied behind his back.The manner of their deaths led to suggestions that the couple had stumbled over an IRA arms dump.Andy Edwards, the deputy chief constable of Dyfed Powys police, said today: "Dyfed Powys police have conducted a review of unsolved serious crimes committed in Pembrokeshire dating back to 1985."This investigation has been named Operation Ottawa. The offences include four murders as well as other serious offences."Today a local man has been arrested on suspicion the murders of Helen and Richard Thomas at Scoveston Manor in December 1985, the murders of Peter and Gwenda Dixon on the Pembrokeshire coastal path in 1989 and a serious sexual assault and attempted robbery in Milford Haven in 1996."
