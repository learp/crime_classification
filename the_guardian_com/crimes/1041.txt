Experts will this week begin a detailed excavation of the last two of four underground rooms found during a sex abuse investigation at a former children's home on Jersey, police said today.More than 100 people claim they were abused from the 1960s onwards at Haut de le Garenne, which closed as a children's home in 1986. Some say they were kept in solitary confinement and molested in secret underground chambers known as "punishment rooms".Jersey police said two anthropologists and two archaeologists would on Friday begin the detailed excavation of cellar rooms three and four, where bone fragments and teeth were found.The bones have been delivered to the UK for tests and the teeth will follow this week.Police have found items in the rooms, including shackles and a bath, that are said to corroborate victims' statements.Fragments of a child's skull were found in February buried under a stairwell.Tests on the skull were inconclusive but police have indicated they believe it was put there between 1920 and 1940.That assessment was questioned today by Richard Webster, who wrote a book about the Bryn Estyn child abuse scandal in north Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. He wrote on Spiked that Professor Pieter Grootes, a German carbon dating specialist, had told him the fact that the bone did not contain collagen, according to police, would make him "wonder whether that was a modern piece of bone and had anything to do with child abuse".So far, one man has been charged over the abuse claims.Gordon Claude Wateridge is charged with three offences of indecent assault on girls under 16 between 1969 and 1979, when he was warder at the home.The 76-year-old is on conditional bail and will next appear before St Helier magistrates court on May 12. Wateridge, originally from Croydon, Surrey, has not entered a plea.There are more than 40 suspects in the inquiry as a whole. It is centred on Haute de le Garenne but also involves other care homes on Jersey.
