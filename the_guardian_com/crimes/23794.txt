A Norfolk farmer appeared before magistrates in King's Lynn yesterday after the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old suspected of burglary.Tony Martin, 54, was charged with murdering Fred Barras, of Newark, Nottinghamshire, and with wounding Brendon Fearon with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, during an incident at Martin's Bleak House farm in Emneth Hungate, near Wisbech, on Friday night. Friends and supporters of Mr Martin were in court for the brief hearing. Afterwards, Mr Martin's mother, Hilary, said: "It's very upsetting, he desperately needs a campaign of support. We need help to get him out of this ghastly situation." Forensic scientists were continuing their search of Mr Martin's 350-acre farm yesterday. Officers were expecting to allow access to some of the fields to let neighbours harvest Mr Martin's fruit for him while he is in custody. Norfolk police also responded officially for the first time to accusations from residents that they have failed to protect people from a spate of burglaries and petty crimes. Acting assistant chief constable Peter Fraser said: "Large areas of the county are rural and this brings with it certain policing challenges." Mr Martin was remanded in custody until next Wednesday when he will reappear before magistrates.
