Levi Bellfield, a former wheelclamper and doorman, is to be charged with the murder of 13-year-old Milly Dowler.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that Bellfield would also be charged with kidnapping Milly in 2002 and the attempted kidnapping of Rachel Cowles the previous day.Nigel Pilkington, a CPS solicitor, said there was sufficient evidence to bring the charges after a review of the case.Milly's parents, Bob and Sally Dowler said they were pleased. In a statement, they said they hoped that charges would "go some way towards providing justice for our darling Milly". They also thanked detectives for their "painstaking work" over the past eight years.Pilkington said a summons had been obtained from Staines magistrates court and would be served on Bellfield, 41, who was first interviewed over Milly's death in 2004."Whilst the considerable media interest in this case is known and is understood, I would remind all concerned that Levi Bellfield now stands charged with criminal offences and that he has a right to a fair trial," he said. Detective Superintendent Maria Woodall, who led the inquiry, said the investigation had been "long and complex" and welcomed the announcement. Amanda Dowler, known to her family as Milly, vanished while walking home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, on 21 March 2002. Six months later her remains were found 30 miles away.Officials at the CPS complex casework unit began considering a huge dossier of police evidence last August. Bellfield has always denied the murder. Police continue to search for a red Daewoo Nexia car which is suspected to have been used to transport Milly's body.
