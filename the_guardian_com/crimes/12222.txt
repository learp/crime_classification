New drink-driving figures released today showed a slight rise in drivers failing breath tests over the Christmas period.Almost 9% of drivers who took breath tests during the two-week period failed them, according to police statistics. However, the number of drink-related collisions fell by just over 4%.A total of 8.91% of 11,622 breath tests administered following collisions in England and Wales during the festive period were failed, a slight increase on the 8.71% figure for 2002-03, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) said. However, the actual number of tests administered after collisions between December 18 and January 2 fell, as did the number of collisions causing injury. Data showed that there had been 5,002 injury collisions over the Christmas period, 4.58% fewer than a year earlier.However, police chiefs said that "a worrying proportion" of people were still drinking and driving.Richard Brunstrom, ACPO's head of road policing and the Chief Constable of North Wales Police, said: "The main aim of our campaign is to reduce injury collisions over the Christmas and New Year holiday period."I am pleased to say that we achieved a 4.58% reduction on last year - a 25.94% reduction since we began our records in 1997. "As a result, the number of drink-related collisions was also reduced by a significant 4.17% on last year, 25% less than in 1997. He added: "However, a worrying proportion are still driving having consumed excess alcohol."This is borne out by the fact that the hit rate for those having been involved in a collision and testing positive for alcohol has been increasing slightly, year-on-year, since 1998."The sad fact is that, in 2003, the same percentage of drivers in collisions that police dealt with over the Christmas and New Year period had been drinking to excess as in 1997."Mr Brunstrom praised responsible drivers who did not drink and drive, and said that a total of 1,035 drivers who had would face court proceedings, disqualification, a fine or imprisonment. "This signifies our determination to stamp out the scourge of drink driving and make the roads safer for everyone," he added.
