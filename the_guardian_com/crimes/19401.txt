A prolific art thief who posed as a bumbling academic to steal dozens of rare maps from a national library was jailed for four-and-a-half years yesterday.Peter Bellwood would try to impress staff with his apparent honesty by handing in a £50 note which he pretended he had just found before settling down to extract maps from precious volumes with a craft knife.Bellwood admitted stealing 50 maps worth £70,000 from the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.But he is also wanted by police in Copenhagen over a spate of thefts from Denmark's Royal Library. Several other libraries across Europe believe they may have also lost maps to him.The case has prompted libraries to tighten up their security measures. But there are still concerns that valuable items are being lost because some institutions are reluctant to talk about thefts and do not liaise closely with dealers who may be offered stolen maps.Bellwood, 52, targeted the Aberystwyth library over a six-month period from spring 2000. He would sign in under his own name, cut the maps out and stuff them down the back of his trousers to smuggle them out.Swansea crown court was told that he used a book called Antique Maps, regarded as the "thieves' handbook", to choose which ones to take. He sold the maps from Aberystwyth on to the co-author of the handbook, David Bannister, and another map dealer, Michael Cox.Mr Bannister, from Cheltenham, confirmed to the Guardian last night that he had bought maps from Bellwood and had met him twice. "I had the misfortune to have dealing with him," he said. He said he had not known the maps had been stolen because the library in Aberystwyth had not publicised the thefts.Formerly a landscape gardener and golf course green-keeper, Bellwood first saw the potential of stealing antiquities when he broke into a bookshop in 1988 and stole ancient volumes worth £1,250.In the mid 90s, he travelled around the UK and removed more than 1,000 plates, illustrations and prints from around a dozen libraries, including the British Library.He targeted scenes of sporting life by the Edwardian artist Cecil Aldin, turn of the century portraits of cricketers by AC Tayler and sketches of the holy land by the 19th century artist David Roberts.Bellwood was caught and jailed for four years. After his release in 1999 he said he tried to go straight but got into debt betting on horses.In 2001 he visited the Royal Library in Copenhagen and spent several days in the map and rare book reading rooms. Maps worth £100,000 disappeared at this time.But Bellwood had been caught on security cameras and the library put a description and photograph of him on the internet.When officials at the National Library of Wales saw the image of Bellwood, they realised they might also have been victims. They checked their maps and found pages from atlases dating back to the early 17th century were missing. In all 105 maps had gone.Bellwood, from Essex, later turned himself in after being put on Scotland Yard's most-wanted list.He said that he had only stolen 50 of the maps, saying another thief had taken advantage of, as he saw it, the poor security at the library.After the hearing the National Library of Wales said it had reviewed its security measures and was now part of an "international network of institutions which can rapidly share information about suspicious users".Spokesman Siôn Jobbins said: "Mr Bellwood was a clever, professional and experienced thief who knew exactly what he was looking for."But Peter Barber, the keeper of the four million maps in the British Library, said some institutions were still not admitting the thefts. He said there were rumours that several British institutions were missing maps.Jonathan Potter, the president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association, called for a closer relationship between libraries and dealers.
