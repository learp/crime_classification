The murdered teenager Hannah Foster called 999 on her mobile phone 10 minutes after she disappeared, it emerged yesterday.The emergency call was made at 11pm on Friday, soon after she waved goodbye to a friend at a bus stop in Southampton and began her short walk home. The A-level student's strangled body was found on Sunday in undergrowth five miles from her house. Hampshire police said the call from Hannah's Nokia 3310 had lasted for two minutes but she did not manage to speak. Officers did not respond because they had no idea where the call had come from. Detective Superintendent Alan Betts said a tape revealed faint background sounds which police were attempting to decipher. "I have heard the tape, it is very difficult to determine anything," he said. "They didn't have a conversation." Police are investigating the possibility that Hannah was being stalked by an Asian man who approached her twice this year. She had told a friend that at the end of January an Asian man driving a red or white car had stopped to talk to her near her home, calling her by name. At the end of February, the man was again waiting at the end of her road, using her name. A 36-year-old Asian man who approached Hannah in a car nine months ago, asking for her phone number, has voluntarily come forward and has been eliminated from inquiries. Detective Inspector Tony Adams said: "We are pleased this man has come forward, but still need to hear from the other person or people who approached Hannah earlier this year in order to clarify the circumstances." DNA tests were conducted on items from a recycling container in Portsmouth where Hannah's khaki satchel and phone were found.
