John Reid, the home secretary, held talks with senior officials yesterday amid concern that prisons will be full within days. The Home Office said the prison population for England and Wales had reached 79,806 yesterday, 162 short of the official Prison Service limit of 79,968.Mr Reid was considering the options last night after discussing contingency plans. One was a repeat of Operation Safeguard in 2002, when prisoners were held in police cells. Another option was to transfer some foreign prisoners to detention centres.Officials from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate as well as the National Offenders Management Service were at yesterday's meeting with Mr Reid. Both options would put pressure on other parts of the system. Mr Reid opposes one suggestion put forward by officials, for the early release of some low-risk prisoners.Yesterday the Prison Governors Association said jails had been "squeezed already" and could not force any more prisoners in. Charles Bushell, its general secretary, told Radio 4's The World at One: "We have reached bursting point. Anybody who says we should build more prisons needs to say how many and where the money is going to come from ... nobody can really say why we have decided to lock so many people up."England and Wales has the highest prison population per head of population in western Europe.The Prison Officers' Association said it was "angry that the Prison Service will not sit down and talk to us about how we are going to manage the prison population as we reach uncharted territory".Junior Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe went to Dover yesterday to discuss plans to convert the disused Connaught barracks into an open prison. The local council is opposed to the plan.In July Mr Reid announced plans for 8,000 more prison places, of which around half will be provided by private security companies.
