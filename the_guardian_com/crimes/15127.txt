A father is in line for a posthumous honour after giving his life in a "heroic and spontaneous" attempt to foil two armed robbers.Tasawar Hussain, who was 36, was praised for his selfless action in the public interest yesterday by a crown court judge after his killer was convicted of murder.Mr Hussain and his friend, Azran Hussain, acted immediately and without thought for their own safety after chancing on a violent raid, said Mr Justice Wakerley.Turning to the dead man's family in the public gallery at Leeds, he described the pair as very brave and added that he would have more to say about Mr Hussain's courage at a sentencing hearing next month.A former security guard from Bradford, Barry Elener, was found guilty of shooting Mr Hussain at close range after a car chase from a travel agency in Lumb Lane in the city's Manningham area. A six-week trial had heard that Elener, 42, had plotted a raid on theagency with his father Derek, 65, who admitted murder and robbery on the first day of the trial.Barry Elener stuck to his plea of innocence in the face of a string of witnesses of the brief and carefully timed snatch of Â£140,000.The court heard that the takings and wages were grabbed during a security van collection in January last year, but the two men had upset the robbers' plans.Mr Hussain, whose second daughter was born six months after his killing, kept pace with the getaway car in his BMW, while his friend contacted police. The trial heard that the pair had slowed outside the agency just as its owner rushed out, shouting: "Follow that car."Mr Justice Wakerley told the court: "It would have been easy for them to have driven on in Lumb Lane without a thought but they did not. As a result, that brave man has lost his life."The jury convicted Elener of murder, after acquitting him of 10 previous robberies and three attempted murders of security guards. Witnesses in the trial had included one woman guard who claimed that Elener had fired a pistol straight at her head but slipped and missed.Derek Elener had admitted 11 previous robberies and involvement in related attacks, which also saw a bank security guard shot in the chest in spite of offering no resistance. His son was also convicted of one previous robbery two months before Mr Hussain's murder and of carrying a firearm on that occasion.
