Once the scourge of football hooligans and rioters, the German shepherd dog has been dropped by police as too soft.Officers say breeders trying to rid the breed of epilepsy and hip problems have, over the years, accidently bred out some of the dog's suitability for police work. "Dog shows have meant the dogs have had the suspicion and boldness bred out," PC Phil Tyson, of the dog section of West Yorkshire police, told Police Review magazine. "Shows don't look for aggression but for dogs which look nice and are subdued. Working dogs need to be alert." Graham Armitage, head of West Yorkshire's dog training school, said rottweilers, dobermans and Rhodesian ridgebacks had been considered. Collies had not been ruled out but Japanese akitas had. Officers had visited Belgium to buy malinois dogs, a form of Belgian shepherd, three-quarters the size of German shepherds but with a more "wolfish" appearance and a stronger work ethic. "Twenty years ago if a dog went to a football match and arrested someone by biting them, or found a person in a building and barked, they would probably get the job," Mr Armitage said. "But standards have gone up. We need scent detectors and confident dogs. The German shepherds we have now are fine, but we may have problems finding intelligent ones in the future." A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police officers said some German shepherds were alert enough for the job, but the situation was under review. Phil Buckley of the Kennel Club breeders association said breeders should bear in mind the guidelines for the breed: "Steady of nerve, self-assured, courageous and tractable; never nervous, overly aggressive or shy."
