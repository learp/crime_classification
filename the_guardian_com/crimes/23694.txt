It has become a subject of debate among both satirists and, if you'll forgive the expression, chatterists, that the art of news satire is being hopelessly outclassed by events in real life. Apart from some notable exceptions, writers are flailing around to find the gags, unable to draw a comic distinction between occurrences in the real world and the hyperbole they traditionally use to shine a light in the darker recesses of the news. Indeed, that long-running television series the News is occasionally so bizarre it seems now to have "jumped the shark" and what we regard as current affairs is falling headlong into a kind of live situation comedy, where the pratfalls and slapstick hit real people like a swerving plank in a silent movie.It is a medium that occasionally puts food on my table, so it was a relief when I managed to stifle my yawn for a moment to consider the government's response to the Hargreaves review on intellectual property this week, in which it agreed that parody would become an effective defence against a claim of copyright infringement – good news for a part-time smart arse who runs a parody of a government website, were it not for the fact that the entire political establishment seems on a relentless mission to put me out of a job by satirising itself. It seems that it's time for my P45.So is satire dead, or does it just smell funny?To be fair, you'd smell funny if you'd stopped breathing in 2006, the year when "baby ASBOs" were mooted, when Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Menzies Campbell suddenly developed opinions on popular beat ensemble the Arctic Monkeys and when John Prescott was spotted playing croquet. It was the year when we crossed the "you couldn't make it up" event horizon, beyond which every news broadcast begins to look more and more like an episode of Chris Morris and Armando Ianucci's prescient series, The Day Today. Five years later the stream of pre-parodied news stories continues to cascade from the various institutions that claim to be responsible for the smooth running of our society.Look at the evidence: ministers sunning themselves around the Mediterranean as Britain's cities bask in their own nocturnal heatwave; politicians caught billing the taxpayer for plasma televisions, the upkeep of a moat, unbridled luxury and, preposterously, a trouser press – the consumer durable once immortalised by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band; an entire cabinet that looks like a Gerald Scarfe caricature of the super-rich and privileged, apart from Vince Cable, who sometimes manages to resemble a creature you might find under a bridge.The rest of public life isn't faring much better. The Metropolitan police service, which has mysteriously redeemed itself in the eyes of its political masters by being overwhelmed by three nights or more of criminal looting on a massive scale, has, to paraphrase Douglas Adams, been falling apart so fast we're all in danger of getting hit by the shrapnel. Meanwhile, the Press Complaints Commission has turned from a watchdog with no teeth to a dog with no nose, unable to detect the stench of corruption and widespread criminality in the ranks of tabloid editors and journalists. Something smells awful, all right.And now parliament – an institution sullied by fraud, greed and accusations of corruption, and where a few of the worst trangressors from the expenses scandal stand up on £64,000 incomes and denounce the greed of the poor – is recalled to debate measures to curb wholesale looting by cutting off looters' Twitter timelines and Blackberry messaging service. Now it turns out that some of the poverty-stricken rioters on their late-night bargain hunts had decent jobs and prospects.It's an oft-repeated phrase in satire that "it would be funny if it were not true", but now this parody of reality has turned a corner into black comedy. We should take as a warning last week's Reuters headline "London rioters resent media image of hooded teen thug" – obviously, almost any political reality can be now represented with an Onion headline. Satire may be dead but it will stop smelling funny soon.
