The jailing of terrorists became a party political issue when the Tories said they would change the law so that those involved in atrocities would not automatically qualify for release halfway through their sentences.It follows the revelation that two convicted terrorists had been released 17 days early as part of the government's scheme to relieve pressure on the prison population. Abdul Muneem Patel had been jailed over the possession of an explosives manual. Yassin Nassari was arrested at Luton airport carrying blueprints for a rocket in his luggage.The government has admitted that prisoners convicted of certain terrorist offences 'would be eligible for automatic release at the halfway point of their sentence if sentenced under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003'. Yesterday the Conservatives pledged to end the automatic release. They would have judges handing down minimum and maximum sentences. No offender will be released before serving the minimum, after which they will have to show they are no longer a risk.'The government is trying to give the impression that it has put a stop to the early release of terrorists,' said shadow justice secretary Nick Herbert. 'The public is deceived into believing that people who have threatened our country will serve a certain jail term, when in fact they'll be walking out on to the streets in half that time.'
