A man was found hanged on Wednesday night after he was believed to have caused injuries to his six-month-old baby son that later led to the child's death.The body of Paul McBride, 39, was discovered at his mother's house in Preston, Lancashire, by members of his family. They had been alerted by his estranged partner after he failed to return their son as arranged.Their baby, Ollie, was found in a "very poorly" condition in the same house and taken to Royal Preston hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after.McBride's sister Michelle ran into the street in the Moor Nook area of Ribbleton "screaming incoherently" after she and another relative discovered the pair, according to neighbours.Denise Betts, the baby's grandmother, was believed to be away on holiday in France at the time.Lancashire police said McBride, who had worked as a cab driver, had recently separated from the baby's mother. One potential line of inquiry is that the incident was some kind of revenge attack.A neighbour described McBride as a jokey person who had not lived at his mother's house for some time. Detectives are awaiting postmortem examination results on the baby who had "no obvious signs of injury".The boy's mother raised the alarm when McBride failed to return him home as arranged.Relatives of the couple called at the home of McBride's mother, where they made the discovery.Lancashire police have launched a murder investigation but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.Detective Superintendent Neil Esseen, who is leading the investigation, said: "There is a little bit of domestic history between the parents with some arguments. We are trying to find out what bearing that had on yesterday."Whether it is a revenge attack is too early to say, that would be speculation. We will be looking at all sorts of theories."The mother is obviously very distraught and she is being comforted by trained specialist officers."It is vitally important that we are able to tell the mother what has happened to her baby."Esseen said there had been contact with a number of agencies regarding the family but he did not elaborate further.It is believed McBride and his ex-partner, who is in her mid-30s but who has not been identified, had been living together in the Ribbleton area of Preston until recently.
