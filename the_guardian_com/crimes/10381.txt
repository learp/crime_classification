The appalling state of prison healthcare poses a serious risk to public safety as many offenders have severe physical and mental illnesses when they are released, according to the former chief inspector of prisons.Sir David Ramsbotham has warned that prisoners often suffer far worse health problems when they return to society - including dangerous personality disorders, drug addiction, HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis.Not only does this place the public at greater risk of contracting life-threatening illnesses but where prisoners have committed crimes partly because of mental health problems, it increases the risk of re-offending, he argues.In an article published in the February edition of the Student British Medical Journal, Sir David says prison healthcare is a major public health issue because all but 23 of the 67,5000 prisoners in England and Wales will be released back into the community.More than 70% suffer from a personality disorder, including 1,400 who suffer from dangerous and severe disorders, he writes.At least 60% use class A drugs, such as heroin, leading to high rates of HIV and hepatitis.When Sir David became chief inspector in 1995, inmates had no access to NHS care, only 10% of prison medical officers were qualified GPs and prison health centres were "woefully understaffed".Despite noting that progress has been made since the establishment of NHS prison service taskforce, he believes "it is all painfully slow".In particular, considerable work still needs to be done in the treatment of inmates with personality disorders and other mental health problems."Nothing is worse for these people than to be locked up alone in a cell all day with nothing to do," he writes."I was distressed every time a nurse or practitioner told me that all they could do was watch people's condition deteriorate, meaning that they would be worse when they went out than when they came in."Sir David warns that nothing was more irresponsible than making prisoners' health worse because this went against the aim of the criminal justice system - "to protect the public by preventing crime"."If the mental health condition has contributed to the crime, and the prison has made that worse, prison is an accessory before the resulting further offence," he says.The former chief inspector suggests that there is a need for greater public awareness about prisons, to ensure inmates' healthcare becomes a greater political priority."Their physical and mental health when they return does matter and is something that they should both know and protest about if their future safety is affected," he says.The Home Office launched a five-year strategy to address the prison service's failings in mental health care earlier this month. The strategy, Changing the Outlook, includes a nine-month review of prisoners' mental health needs to identify gaps in service provision.But doctors argue that more effort is needed to overhaul prison medicine. Dr Simon Edwards, a consultant in genitourinary (GU) and HIV medicine at University College hospital, London, says drug-testing policies may partly be to blame for the high rates of hard drug addiction in prison.Prisoners prefer to inject heroin than smoke cannabis, as the later stays in the body weeks longer and is more likely to be spotted in regular urine tests, he explains. Consequentially, inmates are more likely to share needles placing them at greater risk of catching HIV and hepatitis.Although consensual sex and rape were other potential routes of HIV infection in prison, there is no published data on them, says the consultant.Dr Edwards, who used to work in GU/HIV clinics at Brixton and Wandsworth prison, adds that prison overcrowding lies behind rising TB rates. "TB is a disease classically associated with poverty and inner city deprivation - and there are likely to be high numbers of people from areas [which suffer from these problems] going in and out of prison where there is greater risk of infection due to living in close proximity."
