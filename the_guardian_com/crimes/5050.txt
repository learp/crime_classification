The cost to stores of shoplifting has risen from £99m to £137m year on year, according to a group representing British retailers.It's a crime many have perpetrated. Many children, for example, have dipped their hands into the pick'n'mix tray and failed to present their cola bottles at the counter for payment.But higher value items – such as electrical equipment and clothing – are increasingly being taken, according to the British Retail Consortium, making shoplifting losses a greater threat to shop-owners' livelihoods. You may not be in the more serious category of criminal, but can you confess to any past petty thefts? If so, why did you do it?

This should have read "£375,000 a day" and has now been corrected
