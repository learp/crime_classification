There is no evidence the wife of a judge who inherited his £1m estate after he died in an unexplained shed fire was involved in his death, a coroner ruled today.Andrew Chubb, 58, was engulfed in a fireball in the grounds of his country house in Westvale, Somerset, just an hour after telling his wife, Jennifer, he was ending their 34-year marriage.The crown court judge's lover, Kerry Sparrow, has long claimed his death was neither an accident nor suicide. She insists he was trapped in a loveless marriage with a woman he "loathed".Mrs Chubb, who has since emigrated to Australia, was arrested by police on suspicion of murder and perjury a year after her husband's death when she was suspected of changing her initial story that his death had been suicide.Mr Chubb's life insurance policies, worth £100,000, would not pay out if that was found to be the case and police also queried why, as a nurse, she had not come to his aid. But the Crown Prosecution Service later decided there was not enough evidence to press charges.The coroner today concluded the second inquest into the July 2001 mystery by saying the cause of Mr Chubb's death remained "unascertained". After two inquests, it may now never be solved.Sheriff Payne said there was insufficient evidence to prove it had been an accident or suicide, but he was satisfied no third party was involved in the death."It has not been possible to determine whether he was disabled from escaping (from the shed) by the effects of the products of combustion or any other means," he said."Both the means and the cause of his death remain unascertained. Evidence that might indicate that he had expressed thoughts of harming himself fall far below proof beyond doubt that is the standard request for the conclusion that he deliberately took his own life."In recording his narrative verdict, Mr Payne said it was a mystery why Mr Chubb had closed the doors to the shed - where he had retreated to mend a lawnmower - and why he had not tried to escape the fire."It is likely that the fire was caused or accelerated by the ignition of petrol vapour. It has not been possible to establish how the vapour arose nor the source of ignition."There was no electricity or gas supply to the shed. No match or means of fire lighting were found."He said the judge did not smoke or carry matches and no one had heard any attempt by him to start the lawnmower.Mr Payne added it would have been virtually impossible for Mrs Chubb to "disable" him and then set fire to the shed.Ms Sparrow, who had a two-year affair with Mr Chubb, has fought a five-year battle to hold a second inquest. Among her worries were the fact that the remains of the shed were bulldozed within 24 hours of the blaze and that Mr Chubb was cremated before a pathologist could determine whether he was dead when the fire started.The initial inquiry ruled his death was accidental.At the inquest this week, Ms Sparrow denied that she changed her story to fit her theory of how he died.She had told police that Mr Chubb told her in a phone call on the day of his death that he was on the roof of Portsmouth crown court thinking of harming himself. But in a subsequent statement she left this out.She told the hearing her lover would not have killed himself and was more "distressed than depressed" about his marriage. Asked how she felt after learning he was dead, she wept, saying: "I was inconsolable, just devastated. I absolutely loved him."Mrs Chubb has said she was in the house at the time of the accident, and that he had wanted to end his affair with Ms Sparrow, who Mrs Chubb alleges was trying to blackmail him.During the inquest, the coroner heard how Mrs Chubb said she was "appalled" when she heard her husband wanted a divorce and warned of the financial implications.But she also said the cause of the fire remained a "complete mystery" to her."If Andrew committed suicide I don't know how he did it, how he caused that mammoth explosion," she told detectives.
