The Conservatives have dropped their opposition to the government's crime and security bill, including its controversial provisions to allow the police to retain the DNA profiles of innocent people for up to six years.Instead of blocking the bill, the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, made a fresh commitment that the Tories would bring in early legislation to ensure the DNA profiles of innocent people arrested for minor offences would not be retained on the national police DNA database.The police would, however, be allowed to continue to keep the profiles of those arrested for serious violent or sexual offences."We will not seek to block this bill because the indefinite retention of innocent people's DNA is unacceptable and has been ruled illegal," said Grayling."DNA data provides a useful tool for solving crimes. A Conservative government will legislate in the first session in order to make sure that our DNA database will only include permanent records of people who are guilty, instead of those who are innocent, and to go further than the government to help fight crime."He added that on taking office the Conservatives would also change the official guidance to the police, to give people the automatic right to have their DNA withdrawn from the database if have been wrongly accused of a minor crime.Grayling stressed that the Conservatives would also make extra efforts to collect the DNA of all existing prisoners, those on probation, on licence from prison, or under the supervision of the criminal justice system.The decision follows a threat by the home secretary, Alan Johnson, to ditch the DNA provisions of the crime and security bill entirely, unless the Conservatives dropped their opposition to keeping profiles of innocent people on the database for up to six years.Johnson said this morning he would pull all provisions from the amendment bill today if the Tories refuse to assent to the government's plans. The bill is destined for this afternoon's wash-up session to complete the government's legislative programme ahead of the dissolution of parliament for the election.Johnson told Sky News: "This is a basic example of how they [the Tories] talk tough on crime but act soft."Labour intends to put the issue at the heart of the election on Friday when the party has lined up Linda Bowman – the mother of Sally Anne Bowman, who was brutally murdered in a crime solved using crucial DNA evidence – to join the prime minister on the campaign trail to highlight the issue.Bowman, an 18-year-old aspiring model, was murdered and her corpse raped in 2005 outside her home in Croydon, south London. Mark Dixie, 37, was convicted of her murder in 2008 after his DNA was collected following a pub brawl, matching him to the crime.The Conservatives have said they want to follow the Scottish system under which DNA samples are stripped from the register after three years, when people have been acquitted, and are only collected from people accused of the most serious sexual and violent attacks.The government has faced strong criticisms on privacy grounds for its controversial DNA register and is being forced to limit the time that samples are stored for, following a European Court of Human Rights ruling that indefinite retention was illegal.If Johnson's threat had been carried out, the current system would be in breach of the European ruling, and other reforms – to introduce a uniform system of appeal for people to argue to have their profiles removed from the database – would also have been lost.
