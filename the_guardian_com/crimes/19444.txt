A businessman who hired a hitman to kill his estranged wife in a car crash because he did not want to pay a large divorce settlement admitted yesterday soliciting her murder.George Wilson Fallows thought he had offered a man called Mark Â£10,000 to smash a lorry into the car driven by his wife, Karen. But the hitman was an undercover police officer whose conversations with Fallows were recorded as they surveyed the planned crash scene. Fallows, 56, of Abergele, north Wales, was remanded in custody for reports and will be sentenced next month. Judge John Rogers told him at the end of the hearing at Caernarfon crown court to expect a "substantial period of imprisonment". Mrs Fallows said later that she felt "relieved and numb" after her ordeal was over. Details of the case were not outlined at the trial. But at an earlier hearing in Llandudno, magistrates were told that Mrs Fallows had left her husband last July after nine years of marriage and had moved with her two young children to another home in the area. Fallows showed the man he knew as Mark a lonely lane which his wife would use on her way home from a night class at a local college. There he believed the lorry would crash into Mrs Fallows's car. After the hearing Mrs Fallows said: "I was very frightened, shocked, worried for myself and the children. They weren't aware of what exactly was happening but to be taken out of the home, to go away, they knew something was up. "I feel relieved that he is not going to be able to hurt me or the children. I have absolutely no feelings for him at all. I just feel numb." Detective Superintendent Ross Duffield, who led the operation for North Wales police, said Fallows was determined to kill his wife. "This was no idle threat," he said. "We were dealing with a man who in our view was determined to have his wife murdered."
