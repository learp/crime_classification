Police in Yorkshire have launched a murder investigation after the bodies of two women were found in a house.South Yorkshire police said the bodies were found at an address in Hemsworth, Sheffield, at about 7.40am. The women were named locally as Tracy Donnelly, 40, and her daughter Louise, 22.Neighbours said they realised something was wrong when a four-year-old boy wandered out of the three-bedroomed house in the early morning, crying. He was later taken away by police, wrapped in a blanket.According to local residents, Tracy Donnelly had lived at the house for about a year and a half with her son. Her daughter Louise, a barmaid, had been staying at the house for just over a week.A neighbour said: "A man came out of the house last night in a real rush. He had no shoes on, jumped in his car and sped off."A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in custody."Officers believe this is a domestic incident, with the local community and wider public not in any danger," South Yorkshire police said, adding that the investigation was in its early stages and they could not comment further at this time.
