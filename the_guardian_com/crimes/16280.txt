Over two-fifths of all adult women prisoners are serving sentences for drug offences (It's reigning men, March 29). Many of these women prisoners are drug couriers coerced into illegal activity by threats to themselves and their families. The Fawcett Society's commission on criminal justice identifies that two-thirds of women in jail are convicted of "dishonesty" offences, such as shoplifting. These are classic crimes that drug-using women commit to support their habit.It is important that the public and government understand that community support and treatment offer far better options for vulnerable women rather than a spell behind bars.
