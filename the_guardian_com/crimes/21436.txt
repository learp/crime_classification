A police dog called Buster has been discharged from South Yorkshire police after being too friendly and laidback towards criminal suspects, despite a year's training costing Â£25,000.The German shepherd fell asleep on a manhunt, let drunken yobs stroke him, and cocked his leg during the arrest of a burglar found by his handler after Buster had failed to spot his hiding place.The force described Buster as lovely and loyal but not cut out for police work. His new owners, Norton and Jane Arnould, of Sheffield, said his training had made him the perfect pet. He never barks.
