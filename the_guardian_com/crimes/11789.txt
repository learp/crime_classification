Two brothers who are both high-risk child sex offenders have become the first twins to be put on the most-wanted list of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop).Kenneth and Thomas Parker, 56, who have links to the Sussex and Warwickshire areas, are wanted for breaching notification requirements of the sex offenders register.Thomas Parker is wanted for a recall to prison, but the notification breaches mean that both could be jailed.A Ceop spokesman said the brothers were the 23rd and 24th people to have their details published on its "most wanted" website.They are both believed to have been in mainland Europe but their current location is not known. The brothers also have connections to France, the Netherlands and Portugal and are believed to be together, the spokesman said.He added: "It should be noted that they have both demonstrated violent tendencies in the past."Ceop's chief executive, Peter Davies, said: "I want to ask members of the public to once again help us in locating these two dangerous individuals."A Sussex police spokesperson said: "This is the first time we have used the Ceop and Crimestoppers sites and we hope it will help find Kenneth Parker and his brother."Detective Chief Inspector Nigel Jones, from Warwickshire police, said: "We have done everything we can to locate Thomas Anthony Parker, a convicted high-risk child sex offender, and the next step is to work with international agencies like Ceop to appeal to the public throughout Europe to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 if you have information on either twin."Before today, 20 of the 22 most wanted child sex offenders listed on the Ceop website have either been arrested or have handed themselves in.Earlier this month, a man handed himself in to police within 24 hours of his details being placed on the site, which was launched in 2006.
