The introduction of body-worn video cameras for firearms officers can't come soon enough for the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who is struggling to win the trust and confidence of black Londoners after the Mark Duggan inquest verdict of lawful killing.These tiny oblong cameras, the size of a stubby cigar, grabbed the attention of police forces around the world when a 2012 trial in Rialto near Los Angeles suggested that the use of force by officers fell by 60% and complaints against them dropped 88% when they were present."When you know you're being watched you behave a little better. That's just human nature," said the Rialto police chief. "As an officer you act a bit more professional, follow the rules a bit better."For the Met there are still some technical issues to be overcome but a trial is due to begin this year. It will mean that the actions of armed response officers and those with whom they are dealing will be recorded and may be used as evidence.That could prove extremely helpful, as it did in the Lee Rigby case, in resolving some of the most difficult arguments that arise in such cases and in the length of time that it takes to do so.Hogan-Howe is well aware that it is only one step that needs to be taken after the breach of trust between London's black communities and the Met, which he has acknowledged took place after Duggan's death in 2011.The Met commissioner faces an uphill struggle to tackle the strong perception that black and other minority ethnic Londoners are excessively targeted by the police. The toxic legacy of more than 30 years of black Londoners being disproportionately policed and over-represented at nearly every stage of the criminal justice system – from stop and search to prison – will take more than a lapel camera to reverse.The names of those who died are not forgotten. Cynthia Jarrett, whose 1985 death during a police search of her Tottenham home provoked the original Broadwater Farm riot, and Joy Gardner, who died in 1993 after being bound and gagged with 13ft of sticking tape during a Met police deportation attempt, are often remembered. An inquest began this week into the death of Leon Briggs, 39, a black father of two, in police custody in Luton last November, – a case which appears to reinforce the widespread belief that black people are being excessively targeted.But have matters improved over the last 20 years?Independent Police Complaints Commission figures for 2012-13 suggest that 15 people died in or following police custody, of whom 14 were white and one was mixed race. In 2011-12 there were also 15 deaths of which one was a black person and one was mixed race.Inquest, which campaigns on behalf of those who have died in police custody, says 144 black and minority ethnic people have died in police custody or after contact with the police in England and Wales since 1990 out of a total of 1,476 deaths. In 2011 an IPCC report on deaths in police custody concluded the proportion was broadly in line with the ethnic make-up of those detained by the police in the first place.Inquest also records that nine black and minority ethnic people have died in the 55 fatal police shootings in England and Wales since 1990.That is disproportionately high and each death is a tragedy. But nine deaths over 23 years, seven of them involving the Met, do not indicate a trigger-happy gun culture aong police officers.Anger in black communities, however, might be justified by the fact that there have been 10 deaths in police custody for which a verdict of unlawful killing has been returned by an inquest jury or a public inquiry – but none of them has led to the successful prosecution of a police officer.Hogan-Howe knows that stop and search is the experience that has most corroded the trust and confidence of black Londoners in the police.Its use in London has been scaled back in recent years from 500,000 stops in 2009-10 to 250,000 in 2011-12 without jeopardising the fall in the crime rate.The Equality and Human Rights Commission says that conducting fewer, but better targeted, searches on the street has led to a rise in the rate of detections and arrests. It has concluded that this demonstrates there is no evidence that disproportionately targeting black and Asian people reduces crime.The home secretary, Theresa May, has made clear that she believes the improper and unfair use of stop and search has the potential to cause immense resentment and distrust of the police. "Public confidence in the police cannot be maintained … if, on the street, your constables are being rude and disrespectful to the public," she has told police leaders.Body-worn cameras are a start but there will have to be many more steps to dispel the perception that the police excessively target black people.
