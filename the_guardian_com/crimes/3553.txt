Five members of the same family have been found guilty of keeping their own private workforce.William Connors, 52, his wife, Mary, 48, their sons John, 29, and James, 20, and their son-in-law Miles Connors, 24, were all convicted of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between April 2010 and March 2011.A jury at Bristol crown court found the five guilty following a three-month trial.They had also faced a second charge of conspiracy to hold another person in servitude but the trial judge ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty of that offence.The prosecution was brought under section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.During the trial, the court heard that the Connors would pick up the men – often homeless drifters or addicts – to work for them as labourers.The victims lived in squalid caravans on Traveller sites as they moved around the country working on the Connors' paving and patio businesses.Some were also ordered to perform humiliating tasks, such as emptying the buckets used as toilets by their bosses.Their work was monotonous, arduous and unrelenting, and they were controlled by discipline and violence.Some of the men – called "dossers" by the Connors – had worked for the family for nearly two decades.Many were beaten, hit with broom handles, belts, a rake and shovel, and punched and kicked by the Connors.On another occasion one worker had a hosepipe shoved down his throat and the men were often made to strip for a "hosing down session" with freezing water."It caused fear in the men," said the prosecutor Christopher Quinlan QC."Not just themselves being assaulted, but to see the others – if you see one of your colleagues being beaten, you knew what to expect."It was a clear and unequivocal demonstration of control and dominance, of one set, the family, over another."The court heard the men were paid as little as £5 for a day's hard labour on jobs that would earn the family several thousands pounds.They were given so little food they resorted to scavenging from dustbins at supermarkets. The men also salvaged clothing from bins and used a bucket or woodland as a toilet.In contrast, the Connors lived in large and well-appointed caravans fitted with top-of-the-range kitchens and flatscreen televisions.William and Mary Connors, known as Billy and Brida, enjoyed luxurious holidays, including one to Dubai and a 10-day cruise around the Caribbean on the Queen Mary 2, the court heard.As well as holidays, they had a number of vehicles including a silver A-Class Mercedes and a Rolls-Royce, and owned properties now worth millions of pounds. Several houses were registered in the names of other relatives.The family bought two caravan parks in Gloucestershire for £545,000 more than a decade ago and had over £500,000 between them in bank accounts.
