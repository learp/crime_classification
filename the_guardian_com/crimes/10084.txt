A shopkeeper who stabbed a 30-year-old intruder to death has been told he will not be charged with any offence.Cecil Coley stabbed Gary Mullings, 30 – who was attempting to rob his flower shop in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester – in July. The 72-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder after Mullings was pronounced dead in hospital.Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts, of Greater Manchester police, said: "When presented with the circumstances of that evening, the correct decision was to make the arrests. It was crucial that we conducted a thorough and open-minded investigation into the events."I am satisfied that we provided the full facts of the case to the CPS to enable them to make an appropriate decision."Nathan Walters, 26, of Salford, Joseph Mullings, 25, of Liverpool and 19-year-old Kyle Mullings, of no fixed address, have been charged with robbery and will appear at Manchester crown court in October.Coley, who was injured during the incident, was questioned by detectives after his release from hospital. He had been playing cards with a 60-year-old friend, who was also injured, at the time of the incident.Police said a number of men had tried to rob the shop and that a gun had been found at the scene.Cecil Coley's nephew, Glen Simms, 49, said at the time that his uncle had had the shop for 40 years and was there with a friend. "It appears they were attacked and my uncle acted to defend himself," he added.Coley was due to answer police bail later this week, but was told by the Crown Prosecution Service on Wednesday that no further action would be taken against him.Nazir Afzal, the chief crown prosecutor for the north-west area, said he was satisfied that Coley was "acting in reasonable self-defence at the time".He said he had considered all the evidence gathered by Greater Manchester police and decided Coley should not be prosecuted for any offence over the death of Gary Mullings."It is difficult to envisage a more frightening set of circumstances than these," he said. "Four men, armed with guns and a knife, forced their way into the shop as Mr Coley was locking up."Mr Coley received a number of injuries, including a serious facial injury, and his friend was knocked unconscious. At some point in the incident, one of the guns, a blank firing pistol, was fired."Afzal said all the evidence indicated that when Coley took a knife that was on the shop counter and struck out with it, he was acting in a way that he felt instinctively necessary to protect himself while fearing for his life."It is clear from the evidence I have seen that Mr Coley was acting in reasonable self defence, and used the degree of force that he believed was necessary when he fatally stabbed Garry Mullings and injured another of the intruders," he said."I am therefore satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Coley for the stabbings."During a similar incident in Pendlebury, Salford, in June, a burglar was stabbed to death and a homeowner arrested.Peter Flanagan, 59, was told by the Crown Prosecution Service in July that he would not face charges because he had acted in self-defence and with reasonable force.
