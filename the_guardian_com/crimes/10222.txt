A young shop worker obsessed with extreme and violent pornography may spend the rest of his life behind bars after he admitted murdering a 17-year-old girl and taking photographs of her as she died.Jamie Reynolds lured Georgia Williams, the daughter of a police detective, to his home by asking her to pose for innocent photographs but used a ligature to kill her and took pictures of her final moments before dumping her body in woodland.When police raided Reynolds's home in Wellington, Shropshire, they found a collection of the most explicit hardcore pornography including, it is understood, "snuff movies" said to show real people being killed.Police also found Reynolds, 23, had created dozens of explicit composite images by superimposing the faces of innocent girls from pictures posted on social network sites on to hardcore pornographic material. The images of between 30 and 50 women had been corrupted in this way. In addition, officers found deeply disturbing fantasy stories of a sexual and violent nature written by the killer.Reynolds was due to face trial at Stafford crown court on Monday but at the last moment changed his plea and admitted he had murdered Georgia, whose disappearance sparked a nationwide search in May.  Georgia Williams was a 'gorgeous tomboy' who wanted to be an RAF paramedic, her family said.

Only a few prisoners in the UK have been told they will never be released – including Mark Bridger, who was convicted of murdering the schoolgirl April Jones earlier this year.David Crigman QC, prosecuting, has applied for the photographs of Georgia taken by Reynolds, the composite images he created, the extreme pornography he viewed and the stories he wrote to be viewed only by the judge and not shown in open court because they are considered so disturbing and distressing.Though the court has not been told whether or not Georgia was sexually assaulted, police sources said there was no doubt Reynolds's motive was sexual. It is understood that he was reprimanded by police five years ago after becoming obsessed with another girl. Reynolds also came to the attention of the police about three years ago when he crashed into the car of a teenage girl after she rejected his advances.The case is bound to reignite the debate over whether use of hardcore pornography leads to sexual violence, which has been high on the political agenda since it emerged that images of child sexual abuse were found on Bridger's computer. One other parallel between the two cases is that both collected images of girls from social network sites. It is understood that Reynolds did not have pictures of child sexual abuse.A nationwide police hunt was launched after Georgia was reported missing having left her family home in Wellington on Sunday 26 May saying she was going to see friends. Georgia's father, the detective constable Steve Williams, tried to make – or actually did make – contact with Reynolds after his daughter's disappearance to ask him where she was.Three days after she vanished, Reynolds was arrested at a budget hotel in Scotland. On Friday 31 May, Georgia's body was found in woodland near Wrexham, around 50 miles from her home.Georgia's family released a statement following Reynolds's plea saying: "The pain we feel is as raw now as it was when our beautiful daughter was taken from us."We will never ever be able to make any sense of what happened or why it happened to a young woman as caring, kind and generous as our Georgia."Today's guilty plea gives us no satisfaction at all; we do not and will never understand the heartbreaking events of earlier this year that changed our lives forever."At the time of her murder, they had described her as a "gorgeous tomboy" who had been keen to become a paramedic in the RAF. Georgia's father, her mother, Lynette, and sister, Scarlett, sat in the front row of what would have been the jury box had Reynolds faced trial as he pleaded guilty to murder.Police confirmed Georgia was murdered at Reynolds's red-bricked family home in Avondale Road, Wellington, on the day she vanished. They believe her body was dumped across the border in Wales the next day before Reynolds fled to Scotland.Superintendent Adrian McGee, one of the senior investigating officers, said: "The Williams family has been incredibly dignified and understanding and I cannot praise them highly enough."
