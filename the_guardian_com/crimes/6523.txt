The four suicide bombers responsible for the 7 July London bombings unleashed an "unimaginably dreadful wave of horror", the inquests into the deaths of 52 people heard today.Hugo Keith, counsel to the inquests, speaking after a minute's silence for the victims, said: "As all the families know only too well, during the morning of 7 July 2005, four bombs exploded in the heart of London."They detonated amongst the innocent and the unknowing, indiscriminately killing and maiming passengers who were simply going about their daily business."The bombs struck down men and women, the old and young, British nationals as well as foreigners."They had no regard to whether the victim was Christian, Muslim, a follower of any of our other great faiths, an adherent to none."They were just travelling on the London transport system. It is the saddest of duties to open their inquests."Keith said the four bombers intended to attract "worldwide publicity" with their "unimaginably dreadful wave of horror"."They were acts of mindless savagery which could only outline the sheer inhumanity of the perpetrators," he said.He added that Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Jermaine Lindsay and Hasib Hussain were responsible for murder by detonating bombs in public.He said: "The essential nature of these acts was murder, given the act of detonating bombs in a public place is so self-evidently an act of murder."He began proceedings by reading out the names of the 52 victims of the 2005 attacks.The coroner, lawyers, bereaved families and members of the public in the courtroom and a separate annexe then stood for a minute's silent tribute.The inquests, which are being held at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, are expected to last up to five months.Opening the hearing, the coroner, Lady Justice Hallett, said: "We are here today to resume the inquests into the deaths of the 52 innocent people who were killed as a result of the bombs in London on 7 July 2005."I should like to take a moment to remember them individually."Mr Keith shall read out each of their names and then I shall ask all of us who can stand to do so for a minute's silence in their memory."Turning to the families, some of whom were seen walking into court this morning, the coroner said: "Not surprisingly, many are still struggling to come to terms with the terrible events of 7 July."Many will be attending court and reliving the detail of that day out of a sense of public duty."Hallett said that as much material as possible would be released to the public during the hearing."I will balance carefully the needs of national security with relevance and fairness," she said."It is in the interests of everyone that these inquests are conducted in as open a manner as possible."Contrary to some reports in the media today, I did not decide to sit without a jury so as to consider intelligence material in private."I have yet to decide whether it is in my powers, and if so, if it is in the interests of justice to conduct any closed hearings."Hallett said she had received only a handful of applications for witnesses to be granted anonymity.Out of the 484 witnesses approached by the inquests team so far, only five have asked for their identities to be kept secret when they give evidence.The coroner said there could be more anonymity applications in the future, but stressed that she would consider each case on its own merits.
