The convicted killer Kenneth Noye won permission today to bring a legal challenge over the refusal of the Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer his conviction for the murder of Stephen Cameron back to the court of appeal.Noye, 60, fled to Spain after stabbing the 21-year-old on the M25 at Swanley, Kent, in 1996 but was extradited in 1998 and jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2000. His appeal was dismissed in October 2001 and in October 2006 the CCRC declined to refer the case back. Today, at London's high court, Lord Justice Richards and Mrs Justice Swift, granted permission for a one-day judicial review hearing of that decision. They said there were sufficient grounds for a fresh challenge "to warrant further consideration of this case".Throughout his original trial at the Old Bailey, Noye claimed there was an abuse of process and said he could not get a fair trial because of his reputation as a gangster.
