The attorney general is to review the 15-month jail sentence given to veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall for a series of historical sex attacks on girls as young as nine.Hall, 83, described by the Crown Prosecution Service as "an opportunistic predator", abused his victims over a period of two decades from 1968.Within minutes of Hall being led from the dock at Preston crown court on Monday there were calls for the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, to examine whether the sentence was "unduly lenient". Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the 15-month term "surely cannot be strong enough for the seriousness and circumstances of the crime".The court heard how Hall, the one-time co-presenter of It's A Knockout, attacked one of his victims within moments of her being sick at a party to celebrate her 13th birthday.Three girls were molested within minutes of each other as they attended an elocution lesson at his home, while another was set upon as he drove her home from a tennis centre.He attacked another girl after meeting her at a school speech day. He invited her to what she imagined to be a "recording session" at a BBC studio in Manchester.Hall, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, also molested a 10-year-old he had met while he was in Madeira with the It's A Knockout team. She was on holiday with her family. Upon their return to Britain he invited her to his home, where he cooked her a steak dinner and plied her with champagne. He then told her "to cuddle him like she would one of her teddies".When the victim – now an adult – disclosed details of the assault to police, she told them: "I do not want to feel that I have been cowardly when others have been brave enough to come forward."Some of his 13 victims were as young as nine, the eldest 17. The youngest had to endure him putting his hand up her clothing. He forced his tongue into the mouth of a 13-year-old, telling her: "People need to show thanks in other ways."Each of the attacks was a one-off. In some cases the victims' parents were aware at the time but held back from reporting him to police.When charged, Hall made a speech outside Preston crown court in which he claimed to be the victim of false allegations that were both "spurious and pernicious".But he eventually pleaded guilty to 14 indecent assaults at a hearing in April, after further complainants came forward with accounts of his predatory behaviour.In handing down concurrent prison sentences, the judge gave Hall "a 25% discount" for his guilty plea.Passing sentence, Judge Anthony Russell told Hall that over a period of two decades he had taken advantage of his celebrity status in order to satisfy his sexual appetite."Many years have elapsed since these crimes were committed, but that is no mitigation of the crimes themselves. The crimes should, of course, never have been committed because nearly every victim was a child at the time."Unwanted sexual advances, even for an adult, are distressing for the victim, but when they are directed towards a child who is unable to repel the attentions of an adult, an important barrier is crossed."Many of Hall's victims had "lived with the shame and embarrassment" of him assaulting them, the judge said. Some had suffered "significant psychological trauma".Russell rebuked Hall for trying to dismiss the complaints against him as inventions. "You chose to make a public statement to the effect that the allegations were false … Although your guilty pleas have meant that your victims have not had to give evidence and relive their experience in a court hearing, your earlier observations about their complaints will have distressed them all."It is clear … that your brazen attitude when first charged, and the public protests of your innocence, have added to the distress of some if not all of your victims."Hall, who was awarded an OBE in 2012, sat in the dock with his eyes closed for most of the three-hour hearing. As the judge announced his sentence, he clasped his hands in front of him, then stood and buttoned up his jacket.He looked impassive as he went down the steps of the dock to the cells, avoiding the gaze of around 30 victims and relatives in the public gallery.The attorney general's office has the power to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal, and it is likely that the judge's sentencing remarks will come under detailed scrutiny.Russell made it clear that the maximum sentences available to the courts at the time of the offences were considerably lower than today. In some cases they have now increased to 10 years.Thornberry said, in her letter to Grieve: "This sentence surely cannot be strong enough for the seriousness and circumstances of the crime."Sexual assault is in itself a very serious offence and there were many aggravating factors present in this case: the victims were young; there was pattern of behaviour over a long period of time; there was an abuse of trust; and, as the trial judge has said, Hall's initial response to the charges will have compounded the victims' distress."Given all this, 15 months is not just a lenient sentence, it is unduly lenient."She also called for the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, to formally refer the case to the attorney general.
