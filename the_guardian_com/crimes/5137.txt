Flying squad detectives are hunting a prolific bank robber who uses a piece of paper to threaten staff.The red-faced, overweight criminal has made off with more than £11,000 in raids on six banks across central London over the last three weeks.Police said the robber stands in line with other customers before passing the cashier a paper note demanding cash. He threatens to start shooting, but no weapon has been seen.The first robbery was at Lloyds TSB in Southampton Street, WC2, on 22 July. This was followed by three robberies on the same day, 30 July, at Barclays in Great Portland Street; HSBC in Hanover Square; and another branch of Lloyds TSB, this time in The Strand.A fifth robbery took place at Lloyds TSB in Tottenham Court Road last Friday, and a Lloyds TSB in Edgware Road was targeted yesterday.A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "To date around £11,000 has been taken. No weapons have been seen during the offences. The man waits in the queue and then passes a note under the counter demanding money, threatening to start shooting if he does not receive it."The robber was described as white, between 1.78 metres and 1.83 metres (5ft 10 and 6ft) tall, with thin, receding grey and light brown hair.• Barnes flying squad 0208 247 4804; Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.
