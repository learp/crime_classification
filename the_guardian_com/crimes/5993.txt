A 59-year-old man has been charged with 10 offences of common assault on children at a mosque, police said.The charges follow a police investigation into allegations of assaults on children made in a Channel 4 documentary broadcast earlier this year.The Dispatches programme, Lessons in Hate and Violence, secretly filmed a man allegedly hitting and kicking children during Qur'an lessons at the Markazi Jamia mosque school in Keighley, West Yorkshire, in December 2010.West Yorkshire police said the man, who was arrested in February, had been released on bail to appear before Keighley magistrates on 2 June."Police and partner agencies have continued to work together throughout the investigation to ensure that children are protected," the spokesman said.A previous Dispatches documentary investigated the alleged preaching of hate and extremism in mosques and Islamic centres in Birmingham.West Midlands police investigated to see whether criminal offences had been committed but found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.
