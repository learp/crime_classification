A convicted child rapist yesterday won the right to damages estimated at £50,000 for "unlawful detention" in prison while attempts were made to deport him to his home country of Somalia. But the failed asylum-seeker, referred to only as A, was told he now had no right to be released from jail because channels were currently open for his removal from the UK.A high court judge in London ruled that he must stay in prison pending his imminent deportation, but that it was not necessary for him to stay in this country while his damages for more than 19 months' unlawful detention were assessed. Lawyers said he could get up to £50,000.The 31-year-old Somali national completed an eight-year prison sentence for the rape of a 13-year-old girl more than three years ago, but continued to be held under immigration laws as the government tried to arrange for his removal.Mr Justice Calvert Smith held that he was entitled to damages for 18 months of that period, during which, despite statements from the authorities to the contrary, there was no prospect of his being deported because no arrangements could be made for his safe return to Somalia. Since then, arrangements had been made.The man arrived in the UK unlawfully in May 1995, aged 19, and three years later, in February 1998, raped a 13-year-old girl at knifepoint. He was jailed for eight years.The judge said his period of detention should have ended in September 2003, but it was acceptable to keep him in prison after that date because of the fear of him absconding while the home secretary sought to make arrangements to return him to Somalia. But from the December 3 2004 until July 20 this year - a period of 19½ months - he was held unlawfully, because there was no possibility of sending him back to Somalia. Therefore he was entitled to damages for that period.After July 20, arrangements were made with airlines to compulsorily remove people to Somalia, and A's detention from that date to the present was lawful under the 1971 Immigration Act, the judge said.Reports before the court, said A posed a "high risk of reoffending if released".
