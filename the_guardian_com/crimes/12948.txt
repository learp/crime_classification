A British computer administrator accused by US authorities of carrying out "the biggest military computer hack of all time" is facing extradition following his arrest in London last night.Gary McKinnon is wanted in America for allegedly hacking into more than 90 military computers - including one hack that shut down the network of a New Jersey naval base immediately after the September 11 attacks. The US government has put the cost of tracking and correcting the problems caused at $1m (Â£570,000). A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said that Mr McKinnon was arrested by officers from the Metropolitan police's extradition unit at 6.30pm last night. The 39-year-old from Wood Green, in north London, is being held at a police station in the capital. He will face extradition proceedings at Bow Street magistrates court today over claims that he gained illegal access to 92 computer networks oper ated by Nasa, the US army, US navy, department of defence and the US air force in 2001 and 2002. He was indicted in 2002 by a federal grand jury on eight counts of computer-related crimes in 14 different states. The indictment said he hacked into an army computer at Fort Myer, Virginia, obtained administrator privileges and transmitted codes, information and commands before deleting about 1,300 user accounts. The damage allegedly cost the army more than $5,000. Mr McKinnon faces seven charges of computer fraud in Virginia, each carrying a prison term of up to 10 years and a $250,000 fine, and another charge in New Jersey.
