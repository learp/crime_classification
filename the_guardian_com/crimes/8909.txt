For more than a decade from the mid-1980s, it was difficult to turn on the TV on a Saturday night and not find Michael Barrymore in full flow, asking laughing fans if they were "Aw-wight?".He had a rare touch, a combination of poise, charm and a twist of camp that brought in 15m-strong audiences week in week out.Barrymore ripped into the contestants on Strike It Lucky, effortlessly turning their quirks into a laugh, clowning around and  bursting into song. He became Britain's favourite TV personality, winning many awards, and had a salary to match: a £2m-a-year contract with London Weekend Television.Barrymore's routines in Strike It Lucky, later Strike It Rich, My Kind of Music and My Kind of People were honed in his early career working at Butlins holiday camps.Born Michael Parker on May 4 1952, in Bermondsey, south London, Barrymore was largely brought up by his Irish mother.When not entertaining holidaymakers, he worked in London theatres where he met his wife, Cheryl, a dancer. They married in 1976.Barrymore's career took off after he won ITV talent show New Faces in 1979 and became a regular panellist on the popular BBC1 quiz Blankety Blank.His popularity seemed unassailable, surviving increasing bouts of drunkenness and his coming out as gay in 1995.His divorce two years later was acrimonious, with Cheryl claiming in her autobiography that Barrymore had been violent. She claimed their marriage could only take place after he bought off his mother to keep quiet about a gay relationship in his early life.Cheryl died of cancer two years ago, leaving a request that he should not attend her funeral.But it was the events at his Essex home in 2001 and subsequent arrest on suspicion of drug offences that changed the course of his career.The press turned on him: "Barrymore: body in his pool at gay booze orgy," screamed the People the day after Stuart Lubbock's death; "Sex riddle of dead man in star's pool," said the Star; "You are a killer," judged the Sunday Mirror.After the open verdict recorded in Mr Lubbock's inquest, during which Barrymore described himself as an alcoholic, the BBC dropped a reputed £500,000 deal for his memoirs. ITV said it would not renew his contract.With no TV work, Barrymore returned to the stage in an attempt to salvage his career. After an apparently successful run in Australia and New Zealand, Barrymore came to London's Wyndham's theatre in 2003.But  the jokes no longer worked, judged Mark Lawson in the Guardian: "Barrymore looks like a man who no longer knows if performance is the solution or the problem. His stage failure has been reported with glee in some places, but such relish is excusable only in the friends and family of Stuart Lubbock."He quit the show and, in late 2003, headed off to live in New Zealand, where he continued to work on stage, before attempting a second UK comeback on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006.Barrymore's reappearance on British television this time was more successful. He was moved to tears by the reception he received by the audience before entering the house and he emerged as runner up in the Channel 4 show.But despite increasingly regular, if minor, appearances on TV since then, Mr Lubbock's death would not disappear.In April last year, police announced a review of the case which appears to have led to Mr Barrymore being arrested in June and his attendance at Harlow police station today.
