A benefits cheat who claimed she could not walk without crutches but was caught on camera whizzing down a water slide has been jailed for 10 weeks.Tina Attanasio was caught out by her own family holiday videos showing her splashing around in her swimwear on a holiday in the south of France.A former partner sent the authorities footage of her climbing cobbled hills, walking down steep steps and strolling on the beach.Most strikingly, she was captured in a red bikini happily flying down a flume in a water park — and easily climbing out of the pool before going down the slide again.This happened at a time when the 51-year-old claimed she was "too weak" to walk a significant distance without crutches and needed help getting in and out of bed as well as going to the toilet and making food.The mother-of-two admitted wrongly claiming more than £19,000 of disability living allowance. On Monday, Cardiff crown court was shown 14 video clips of Attanasio enjoying her French holiday at the time she was claiming top rate disability benefit.The payment is reserved for those whose disabilities limit their ability to complete everyday tasks and need round-the-clock attention. Attanasio, from Whitchurch, Cardiff, insisted she had "good and bad days".Her barrister, Jennet Treharne, said: "The videos were clearly taken on good days when the hot weather eased the pain in her back."Treharne asked Judge Nicholas Cooke QC not to impose an immediate custodial sentence — bearing in mind her client's age and "difficult" circumstances.She said were Attanasio to be sent straight to prison, she was likely to lose her flat and would face great difficulty in obtaining a similar one which would meet her needs.But Cooke said there needed to be a "deterrent-based sentence" because benefit fraud was "easy to commit but so difficult to detect".The court heard the investigation into Attanasio began in 2009 after her former partner submitted the video footage, of her on holiday, to the authorities.
