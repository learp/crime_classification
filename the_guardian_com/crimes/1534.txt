A Roman Catholic Italian missionary order has paid out £120,000 to 11 former trainee priests following allegations of widespread sexual abuse at St Peter Claver College in Yorkshire during the 1960s and 70s.The men, most of whom have waived their right to anonymity, say they wanted acknowledgment rather than money and that the order, the Verona Fathers, must now be held accountable for the alleged abuse and its subsequent failure to act. Most were teenagers at the time of the abuse, but the youngest was 11.Four main abusers are named in the men’s statements, although others are identified in corroborating statements from other victims.Two, Fr John Pinkman, the seminary’s junior housemaster, and Fr Domenico Valmaggia, its infirmarian, are now dead. One, Fr Romano Nardo, lives in the order’s mother house in Verona.One of the victims, Mark Murray, was recruited into Nardo’s “God Squad”, which was addressed on flagellation and the evils of sex.Murray was encouraged by Nardo to wash or “purify” his naked body, ejaculating into a sink while Murray sponged him. He also showed Murray a cross he had carved on his chest, then used his fingernail to scrape one on Murray’s. “Pain,” Nardo told him, “brings you closer to God.”Many of the boys were abused by Valmaggia as a result of bogus medical examinations and during individual tutorials on the facts of life by Pinkman. Both men would instruct boys to remove their clothes before assaulting them.Most of the men have experienced psychosexual difficulties, while some have fought addictions. West Yorkshire police are investigating, but claims that Nardo is psychologically unfit have prevented him from being questioned.“All legal avenues have been pursued to enforce his return to the UK,” said DI Michael Brown.“But his ill health means we are unable to go through the formal procedures to extradite him.”A spokesperson for the order, now called the Comboni Missionaries, said: “All the claims were made on a purely commercial basis and with no admission of liability.”The order still has several bases in the UK, but no seminaries. Their main activity is fundraising.More cases are pending but, despite expressing “deep sorrow” to anyone hurt, the order’s spokesperson denies that abuse was endemic.“Considering the number of boys who were educated at St Peter’s, the Verona Fathers absolutely do not accept that claims from 12 individuals demonstrate a culture of abuse at the seminary.”
