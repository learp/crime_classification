The governors of two prisons have been told to apologise over their treatment of an innocent man who was jailed at the age of 72 and has since died of a cancer that went undetected while he was in prison.The acting prison ombudsman, David Barnes, yesterday upheld two complaints on behalf of the late John Tero of Northampton and recommended that the governors of Woodhill and Wymott prisons apologise to his family. Mr Tero was sentenced to five years in December 2000. When he complained of stomach pains to medical staff at Woodhill prison, Milton Keynes, he was diagnosed as having indigestion and given anti-acid tablets. His stomach cancer was only diagnosed when he was moved to Wymott prison, near Preston, in October 2001. The next day the court of appeal quashed his conviction and he returned home to Northampton. Sally Keeble, the Labour MP for Northampton North, said she had taken up three complaints with the prison ombudsman. They included his poor treatment by the prison medical service, a month's delay by Woodhill in passing him his appeal papers so that he nearly missed the deadline, and failure by Wymott to help him get home when he was seriously ill - he had to take three trains and a taxi. Mr Barnes yesterday said he had upheld the complaints about the appeal papers and the difficulty Mr Tero had getting home, but that the clinical judgment of prison doctors was outside his remit. He said the two prisons should apologise and the prison service should issue guidance on discharge arrangements for sick prisoners. Lillian Tero, John's widow, said: "I am pleased with the report, although the medical side is still to be sorted out, because they did wrong by him." Ms Keeble said Mr Tero had repeatedly complained about stomach-related problems, and that his health had declined dramatically by the time he was finally examined. A review of Mr Tero's clinical treatment ordered by Home Office has yet to report.
