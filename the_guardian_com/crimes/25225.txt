Motorists are falling foul of a new insurance fraud tactic dubbed "flash for crash", where cars lie in wait for victims to exit from shops, car parks or fuel stations. Fraudsters flash their headlights, offering the victim a right of way to join a main road, but then speed up to ensure their car is hit side-on.The phenomenon has emerged as a worrying trend since the turn of the year, according to the fraud investigation specialist APU."It is yet another example of how criminal gangs are becoming more sophisticated and attempting to stay one step ahead of suspicion," said Neil Thomas, APU's director of investigative services."The adoption of flashing headlights and beckoning the driver results in a 'your word against mine' situation when it comes to apportioning blame. By appearing to offer the right of way, the criminal simply continues his journey into a collision, holding the victim at fault for turning across him which, of course, cannot be denied under law."APU says 380 false insurance claims are made daily, costing the motor industry £1.7m a year and pushing up insurance premiums. It said the Insurance Fraud Bureau was currently investigating 49 fraud rings, responsible for around £66m in false claims.
