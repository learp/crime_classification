A child abuser who raped and strangled his two-year-old niece was sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in jail yesterday by a judge who expressed shock at the "truly horrible" crime.Michael Mullen, 21, showed no emotion as the sentence was backed with a lifelong ban on using computers or consorting with under-16s after release. If freed, he will also have to report regularly to the police.He was described by Mr Justice Simon as extremely dangerous to children, with a record of downloading pornographic images on to his computer. A psychiatrist's report said that he suffered from an untreatable psychopathic condition, which could trigger extreme violence.Mullen, who was also a drug addict, was found to have a photograph of his victim, Casey Leigh Mullen, naked from the waist down on his mobile phone. He sat expressionless throughout the brief proceedings at Leeds crown court after pleading guilty to the child's rape and murder.The court heard that he had gone to his brother's house in Gipton, Leeds, after an afternoon of heavy drinking and drug-taking in pubs and clubs in February. He slipped upstairs to Casey's bedroom, where he was later found by her father lying on the bed where the child was asleep.The court was told that Casey woke and sat up, and her father, David Mullen, asked Mullen whether he wanted to go for another beer and get some cocaine. The defendant replied "fuck off" and lay back down, later coming downstairs and phoning a taxi to take him home to his mother's house.Shortly afterwards another family member went upstairs to check on Casey and found her curled up in a foetal position. The child's mother, Samantha Canham, rushed upstairs and came down screaming with her daughter in her arms.Casey was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after 10pm. Three hours later Mullen was arrested at home, where he was shaking uncontrollably and claiming no memory of the evening's events. The court heard that Mullen had used a thin cord, possibly the flex of his mobile phone charger, to strangle the child after raping her.The judge told Mullen: "You are a very dangerous man who is capable of lethal, violent, sexual crimes against children and you will continue to be so for the foreseeable future."The head of the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Steve Payne, said that the murder was "an act of wickedness beyond belief, beyond the comprehension of a normal society".
