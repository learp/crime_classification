Police have named a murdered man whose body may have been moved through a city centre in a wheelie bin before being set alight.Jamie Dack, 22, was found by firefighters in the early hours of Sunday in an industrial bin on the Empress Road industrial estate in Southampton.Dack's family said they were "devastated by his untimely death".A statement said: "Jamie was a loving son and brother, well liked by everyone, and he will be sadly missed. He was a good-natured young man who liked to chat and made friends easily and had a trusting nature."His whole family are devastated. He was a young man who should have had his whole life ahead of him. This has been cut abruptly short by whoever committed this horrendous crime."Officers are working on the theory that Dack was killed at a house in Southampton and his body was then pushed along roads in the wheelie bin before being dumped in the larger bin.Police are questioning three men aged 31, 28 and 25 and a 20-year-old woman.Detective Inspector Simon Baker, who is leading the investigation, said: "We are still questioning those we have arrested. We were able to make these arrests swiftly and I'd like to reassure people that we do not believe this was a random attack and that Jamie knew his attackers."I believe Jamie's body was probably moved to the site where he was found in a domestic wheelie bin. The exact route is not known at this stage but we think people will have noticed if they saw some people pushing a wheelie bin for some distance in the area of Bevois Mews and Earls Road through to the Empress Road industrial estate late on Saturday night or early on Sunday morning."We are still carrying out forensic work at a second scene at Bevois Mews and this may take some time. We are also carrying out house-to-house inquiries in the area. We still very much need the public's help in piecing together exactly what happened to Jamie."
