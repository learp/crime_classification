Police in Barcelona have interviewed at least one person in connection with Lianne Smith, the mother who has allegedly admitted murdering her two children in a hotel room in Lloret de Mar, according to sources close the investigation.The interview comes as police try to piece together the movements of Lianne Smith and her husband Martin Smith, who was extradited to Britain earlier this week after two and half years on the run.Smith appeared in a magistrates court in Carlisle yesterday accused of13 counts of sexual assault and child rape allegedly committed between 1995 and 2005.In a further bizarre twist to the story, a Spanish journalist has handed over to police what is thought to be a letter from Martin Smith to his wife – apparently written while he was being held in Barcelona before being extradited.The unopened letter was found in the post box of the family's apartment block near Barcelona's Sagrada Familia temple.Martin Smith was arrested on 7 May and extradited on Tuesday, the day that Lianne Smith called police to her room at the Hotel Miramar on Lloret's seafront.The bodies of five-year-old Rebecca and 11-month-old Daniel were found in the room. Lianne Smith has reportedly told investigators that she was scared police would take away her children. Spanish media outlets reported that she had two other children who were not living with her.It emerged today that the family spent most of their time on the run in Barcelona. They had spent only six months at the flat near the Sagrada Familia, but had previously lived in the city's old quarter.Colleagues from a language academy where Lianne Smith had worked when she was pregnant in 2008, recognised her photograph in the newspapers."She was a sweet woman who was very professional, though extremely discreet," a colleague, who did not want her school to be named, told El Peridico. "When we spoke we just spoke about work. She did once tell me that members of her family were looking for her and she did not want them to find her."She added: "Her pupils were very satisfied with the way she gave her classes."Postmortems on the two children are due to be carried out later today by a forensic scientist, Dr Narcìs Berdalet, at a morgue in Girona, near Lloret de Mar.An investigating magistrate, who has placed a secrecy order on inquiries, is expected to formally remand Lianne Smith in custody tomorrow.Martin Smith is due in court in Carlisle on 7 June.
