Shopkeepers have said they are being violently attacked more frequently, often for relatively small amounts of money.On Saturday the 10-year-old son of a shop assistant had a gun pointed at his head during a raid in Manchester. The gunman escaped with a small amount of cash from the Edge Lane post office in Droylsden.Detective Sergeant Jed Stubbs of Ashton CID said: "It is difficult to comprehend how anyone could hold a gun to the head of an innocent child."According to the Association of Convenience Stores' 2009 crime survey robberies have increased by 30%, up from 234 in 2008 to 397 last year, while burglaries are up 19%. The average cost of burglary is over £2,000 for each shop, the survey reports.The association said the survey "reflects further need for crimes against local shops to be addressed".It is demanding that sentencing for attacks on shop workers be brought into line with that for attacks on police officers and nurses.One shopkeeper interviewed, in West Gorton, Manchester, described being targeted three times. Once, he said, he was threatened with a gun as he stood behind the counter with his 11-year-old son. The shopkeeper handed over £600 but the gunman repeatedly punched him, breaking his jaw in two places, and he lost three teeth.In February a 63-year-old shopkeeper, Gurmail Singh, was murdered at his shop in Cowcliffe, outside Huddersfield. A 20-year-old man and three teenagers were committed to a crown court charged with murder.
