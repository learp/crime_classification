A former mayor of Derry city has condemned republican paramilitaries believed to have been responsible for leaving a bomb outside a home in the Creggan area overnight.Pat Ramsey claimed that the car bomb, which exploded outside a house in Carrickreagh Gardens, was the work of ex-members of the vigilante group Republican Action Against Drugs.No one was injured in the blast around 10.45pm on Wednesday, but Ramsey said those responsible were once again trying to act as an alternative policing unit in the city.Ramsey said: "This car was parked adjacent to the front door in a hugely built-up area and could have killed. While there may have been a target last night, the victims were the neighbours whose lives were disrupted when they were forced out of their homes."People in the area are telling me that because of continuing difficulties in the Creggan area they are actually considering moving on. There is no place for these paramilitary-style attacks in society, and such attacks by dissident republicans are not done in the name of anyone."The SDLP Assembly member added: "The ballot box has clearly shown people want politics to be on the road to peace, but this attack last night could have seriously injured someone or worse, left someone dead."Sinn Fein councillor Kevin Campbell also criticised those who left the bomb in the area. "I would call upon anyone involved in this type of activity to desist; they are going against the will of the vast majority of the people of Creggan who have indicated time and time again that they want to move forward without these types of incidents happening in their community."
