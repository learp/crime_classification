Three people were jailed today for "sadistically" murdering a teenager in a re-enactment of a scene from a spoof horror film.Simon Everitt of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was tied to a tree, doused in petrol and set alight, Norwich crown court was told.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith said Jonathan Clarke, 20, of Telford, Shropshire, would remain in prison for at least 27 years before being considered for parole. Jimi-Lee Stewart, 25, of Great Yarmouth, will serve a minimum term of 22 years, and Maria Chandler, 40, also of Great Yarmouth, will stay in jail for at least 17 years.  Simon Everitt.

Jurors were told Simon was targeted after going out with a woman who had been in a relationship with Clarke.The teenager, who had previously been "given a good kicking" by Clarke, was lured to his death and subjected to a "mock trial" before being set on fire. Prosecutors said the murder replicated a scene from the film Severance.The court heard that the three killers tried to cover their tracks and throw police off the trail. Calvert-Smith said their attempts to commit a "perfect murder" unravelled partly because Clarke, the instigator of the plot, whom the judge described as "sadistic", could not stop boasting about what he had done. Jurors heard that Stewart confessed to his mother and she called police.Clarke and Stewart smirked and whispered in the dock as the judge passed sentence. Stewart shouted something towards the public gallery as he left and made a V sign.
