A report into the BBC culture that allowed Jimmy Savile to abuse children as young as nine while working there is finally to be published on Thursday, nearly three-and-a-half years after an inquiry was launched.The review, led by Dame Janet Smith, a former court of appeal judge, is expected to offer a searing indictment of the BBC and its culture, which did nothing to stop the abuse “in virtually every corner” of the corporation.A draft of the report, leaked in January, criticised the corporation’s “deferential culture”, with “untouchable stars” and “above the law” managers.The report also found that while new safeguards had made sexism and abuse far less frequent than they were in the 1970s, the culture of fear which stopped employees speaking out had actually got worse. Short-term and freelance contracts meant a workforce “with little or no job security”, which was even less likely to speak out about the behaviour of colleagues. But the BBC cannot be criticised for failing to uncover Savile’s “sexual deviancy”, it said, given the failure of law enforcement agencies to do the same thing.The inquiry took evidence from more than 475 witnesses into whether BBC bosses were, or ought to have been, aware of inappropriate sexual conduct on its premises, and will look to identify any lessons to be learned and consider whether the BBC’s current child protection and whistleblowing policies are fit for purpose. Launched by the BBC at the height of the Jimmy Savile scandal in October 2012, the inquiry was linked to a separate inquiry by Dame Linda Dobbs into the activities of Stuart Hall, the former It’s a Knockout presenter who was jailed in 2013 after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls, one as young as nine, between 1967 and 1985. Now 85, he was released in December 2015 after serving half his sentence.Savile died in October 2011 aged 84 without having faced trial for any of his crimes. Indeed, he was awarded the OBE in 1971 and was knighted in 1990.Following the leak, published by the Exaro website, Smith released a statement describing the version of the report as “out of date” and said significant changes had been made to the final report.The report had already been delayed several times, most recently in May 2015 after the police said it could prejudice ongoing investigations. At the time, the inquiry said the report had already been completed after contacting more than 775 people and interviewing 375 witnesses in the Jimmy Savile investigation and more than 100 in the inquiry into Stuart Hall.In the draft conclusion to her report, Smith suggested that there was no evidence that any report of abuse “reached the ears or the desk” of senior staff – despite so many individuals, including BBC workers, coming forward with tales of Savile’s abuse.Liz Dux, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon who represents 168 of Savile’s victims, slammed this conclusion as “not credible”, telling the Guardian: “With so many witnesses giving evidence to her of their suspicions and knowledge – 107 in total – that for her to conclude a lack of knowledge on the part of management and an acceptance of their inability to stop him I don’t find is credible. I can’t accept that on behalf of my clients.”But Smith said senior management were not made aware of Savile’s abuse. “In the testosterone-laden atmosphere, where everyone was, in theory at least, over the age of 16, child protection was simply not a live issue,” she wrote in the draft report. “No one noticed what Savile was doing – he was able to hide in plain sight.”Following on from this, it was Smith’s view that it is possible that a “predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even today”.Tony Hall, director general of the BBC, who was appointed after the scandal led to the departure of his predecessor, has already promised to learn the lessons of the scandal.
