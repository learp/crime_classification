In the last four years Scotland Yard has been dragged into the affairs of the Palace of Westminster three times and each time senior officers have done so with private misgivings and a heavy heart.From cash for honours, through the Damian Green leaks inquiry, and now the investigation into MPs' expenses, senior police officers have intensely disliked being involved in inquiries into the activities of parliamentarians.Every time detectives are called in to investigate potential criminality by members of the House of Commons or Lords they know they are entering a political minefield. During the cash for honours investigation it was the Met who were accused by Peter Mandelson and other Labour figures of regularly leaking information."Those who undertook this investigation used the media to create a false impression of the then prime minister and to undermine public trust in government," Mandelson said.Met officers worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service during the investigation, which went to the heart of Tony Blair's administration, and as they dodged the flak flying their way, became increasingly confident there would be charges.But after 16 months, more than £1m and 10,000 pages of evidence, the CPS surprised the police by announcing that none of those arrested during the investigation – Lord Levy, Ruth Turner and Sir Christopher Evans, the biotech tycoon and Labour donor – would face any charges.At that time the officers involved were only told of the CPS decision 20 minutes beforehand, leaving them infuriated.The lessons learned should have come into play when Scotland Yard was called in to investigate leaks from the Home Office that may have involved national security. But while the Damian Green inquiry itself was found to be entirely legal, the decision to arrest Green made by the then assistant commissioner, Bob Quick, was eventually condemned as "ill advised and disproportionate" in a review by Sir Ian Johnston, chief constable of British Transport Police.In his evaluation of the Green case, Denis O'Connor, Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary, summed up the sensitive position the Met has found itself in whenever it is called in to investigate the affairs of parliament."Police feared they were damned if they did and damned if they didn't because of the politics around them and they worried about how things might play out," he said.Compared with the controversy over these two previous investigations, the Met has come out of the inquiry into MPs' expenses with its reputation so far intact. When Keir Starmer made his announcement today he did so in the knowledge that there had been no damaging leaks about its content, and no allegations to date that police officers had overstepped the mark, acted in a heavy handed manner or operated in any way except by the book.And the nagging question of just how much parliamentary privilege protects parliamentarians from the actions of the law was deftly kicked into the arena of the forthcoming crown court trials – leaving it for lawyers, a judge and a jury to decide.
