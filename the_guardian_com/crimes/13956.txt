The brother of Gerry Adams has turned himself in to Irish police after going on the run following allegations he sexually abused his daughter.Liam Adams presented himself to officials at a police station in Sligo Monday afternoon.Adams – the younger brother of the Sinn Féin president – is believed to have been questioned for a number of hours by senior detectives over the alleged crimes which took place over the border in Northern Ireland.Police officers in the Irish Republic were unable to detain Adams because they did not have the necessary European arrest warrant.A Garda source admitted: "We'll act upon any legal request we get, but we haven't got one yet."Adams left the station later that evening revealing his name, temporary address and an admission that he was willing to be questioned further by the authorities at a later date.The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has confirmed that it has issued a warrant for his arrest but it only covers Northern Ireland.But despite officers working to prepare the necessary European arrest warrant it could still take some time before it is available.Liam Adams, who is in his 50s, is wanted by police north of the border to face 23 charges of abusing his daughter Aine Tyrell in the 1970s and 1980s.The alleged crimes came to light on Friday when Tyrell, now 36, waived her right to anonymity and spoke during a documentary on Ulster Television.In a follow-up TV interview for RTÉ on Sunday, Gerry Adams then disclosed his father's dark past for the first time, claiming Gerry senior "emotionally, physically and sexually abused" a number of his siblings over many years.However, he has come under pressure after it emerged that he first knew about the allegation against his brother in the late 1980s, and since then, Liam Adams has worked with young people in a number of different capacities.Adams, who is west Belfast MP, admitted he could have done more to stop his brother working with children in the years after he found out about his niece's allegations.But the Sinn Féin leader said the police and social services also had questions to answer on how Liam Adams was able to get a job as a youth worker, despite both agencies being aware that Tyrell had made claims that he raped and molested her.Liam Adams worked in the Clonard Youth Centre in Belfast from 1998 to 2003.During this period he also worked in the Muirhevnamor Community Youth Project in Dundalk, Co Louth, in the Irish Republic. He was also involved with a youth project in west Belfast from 2004 to 2006.All three organisations said they were not aware of the claims against him.He obtained the positions before vetting checks for people working with children in Northern Ireland became compulsory in 2005 and it is understood he was not subjected to any such procedure.
