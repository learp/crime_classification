Children too young to be prosecuted were the main suspects in almost 3,000 crimes last year including sexual offences, burglary, harassment and wounding, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act.The figures, which show there were about 1,300 incidents of criminal damage and arson committed by children under 10 in England and Wales, have reopened the debate about whether the age of criminal responsibility should be lowered.Statistics from 32 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, obtained by the BBC, also showed that children under 10 were thought to be responsible for 66 sex offences, including indecent assaults on other children aged under 13.There were 2,840 crimes recorded where the suspect was under 10 years old, and nearly half were incidents of criminal damage and arson. However, when compared with the overall crime figures, the proportion of offences where a child was the suspect are small.Home Office figures over the same period show that there were 5.5m incidents reported to police.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said every piece of new evidence showed the age of criminality was becoming younger and younger."This demonstrates only too clearly that some of the fundamental answers to Britain's broken society start in the home and the school - areas highlighted by David Cameron this week," he said.But Ed Balls, the schools minister, denied there was a crisis of gun and knife crime among Britain's youth and disputed the Conservative leader's comments about anarchy in the UK.He said the government would crack down on areas where there were pockets of violence. "In most parts of our country there isn't a problem with gun or knife crime, but it's right that where there is we tackle it in a very hard way and tackle it as a criminal justice problem first and foremost," he told GMTV.A report by academics and campaigners for the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies in May recommended that the age of criminal responsibility be raised from 10 to as high as 18. It also suggested that Asbos be abolished.Bob Reitemeier, of the Children's Society, said the age of criminal responsibility should be raised to 14. "You have to be 18 to be able to vote, 16 to have sex and yet 10 to be held accountable for committing a crime," he told the BBC.
