Police today arrested a 22-year-old man in connection with the murder of Marsha McDonnell, the student who was bludgeoned to death as she walked home from a bus stop earlier this month.The man is also being questioned over attacks on a 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man, which police believed may be linked to Ms McDonnell's murder. The suspect was arrested by armed officers outside New Malden rail station in south-west London at about 5pm today. Police said they were acting on a tip-off.The arrested man is from Hampton, where the three attacks took place.A police source said: "We acted on information we received. He was arrested in connection with the murder of Marsha McDonnell and the other attacks and is being questioned about all three."Ms McDonnell, 19, was attacked from behind on February 4 as she returned from a night out at the cinema with friends. Her killer struck as she walked the short distance home from a bus stop in Hampton. She was hit over the head three times and died the following day from multiple skull fractures and extensive internal bleeding. Police feared Ms McDonnell's killer may also have struck a 17-year-old girl who was discovered unconscious and bleeding in the nearby Strawberry Hill area on January 8. Her family initially believed she had slipped and fallen in the snow, and the girl could not remember what happened to her. She spent 10 days in hospital being treated for her injuries.However, after hearing about Ms McDonnell's death, her family contacted police. The pathologist who examined her felt her head injuries were consistent with a blow to the head. Earlier this week, an 18-year-old man told police that a man had attempted to attack him with a blunt instrument after he got off a night bus in Hampton Hill. He said the attacker swung at him, hitting him once in the waist, but he managed to escape.
