Former IRA prisoner Colin Duffy has been re-arrested shortly after police were forced to free him and five other murder suspects because of a high court ruling.Duffy's solicitor, Pat Vernon, said his client was taken back into custody under anti-terrorism legislation an hour after a judge in Belfast upheld the legal challenge by six men over their detention.In a ruling that may have implications for UK anti-terror laws which provide for 28-day detention, the judge overturned a court order granting the police ­further time to question the suspects over the murder of two British soldiers and a policeman this month.Outside Antrim police station, Vernon said: "We understand he has been re-arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act again, but we don't know any further details."The lawyer said his client's continuing detention was unlawful.The suspects were being held over the killings of two soldiers and a police officer shot dead in separate attacks earlier this month by dissident republicans opposed to the peace process.All six had been in custody since 14 March, and at the weekend a judge granted the Police Service of Northern Ireland a seven-day extension as detectives waited for the results of forensic tests.The suspects' lawyers challenged this extension and today Northern Ireland's lord chief justice, Sir Brian Kerr, quashed the original ruling on a legal technicality.He ruled that the judge, while making her deliberations, had not taken into account whether the suspects' original arrest had been lawful.Kerr did not himself question the lawfulness of those arrests but said the judge who granted the extension should have examined the issue. On that basis he upheld the defence team's claim that the decision should be reversed.Four of the six were being held in connection with the shooting of Sappers Mark Quinsey, 23, from Birmingham and Patrick Azimkar, 21, from London, outside an army barracks in Antrim on 7 March.Two other soldiers and two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded in the shooting, which was claimed by the Real IRA.Speaking outside Belfast high court after the ruling, the PSNI detective heading the hunt for the soldiers' killers, Derek Williamson, said: "We will now have to go and look at our options."SDLP European candidate and lawyer Alban Maginness said today's judgment would have "far-reaching implications" for the 28-day detention policy across the UK."This is not just confined to the Northern Ireland judiciary and will have an impact elsewhere."The longer you detain people the more legal problems arise. Because the courts guard very seriously the freedom of anybody who is detained. The courts take a more exhaustive approach to extended detention."We already have the longest period of detentions in the western world so it is no wonder that the judiciary scrutinised the case with great care."
