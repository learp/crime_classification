A father and son were today convicted of trafficking women into Britain from Romania and forcing them to work as prostitutes.If the women did not comply with the demands of their clients, they were beaten and raped by 23-year-old Marius Nejloveanu, who was found guilty of a series of offences following a trial at Manchester crown court.His father, Bogdan Nejloveanu, 51, was convicted of six trafficking charges for sexual exploitation and one of controlling prostitution for gain. He was extradited from Spain in July 2009.Marius Nejloveanu was also convicted of charges including trafficking women into the UK for sexual exploitation, five rapes and five assaults, witness intimidation and controlling prostitution for gain. He was extradited from Romania under a European arrest warrant in August 2009.Greater Manchester police said it was one of the biggest human trafficking investigations the force had ever carried out.The sexual crime unit received a tip-off in October 2008 that a victim of trafficking was being held at Shangri La's massage parlour, in the Openshaw district. When police arrived, they found a 25-year-old woman, whom they rescued.The inquiry led them to a house in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, where a 20-year-old woman was rescued. Both women had been trafficked from Romania.One of the victims, who was 17 when she arrived in England, was raped and beaten by Marius Nejloveanu after being promised a job in a restaurant, as was another young woman whom he took to Holland in an attempt to force her into prostitution. But she was unable to find work and returned to the UK with him.The women were kept at addresses in Birmingham but were frequently brought to Manchester to work in brothels for days at a time.Two other victims were told they could earn €1,000 (£837) a month working in a restaurant or bar. They eventually arrived in the UK, and the younger Nejloveanu told them they owed him £2,000 and forced them to work as prostitutes.One of the victims said he beat her every day and "did to us what the clients were doing to us".A fifth woman was "sold" to a man in London in February 2008 where she was forced to work as a prostitute before she managed to escape and contact police. The victims were forced to work six or seven days a week, with up to eight or 10 clients a night.Juanita Huntington, a receptionist at the brothels, admitted five counts of controlling prostitution for gain. She would give money the women earned to Marius Nejloveanu and report back to him if they did not do as the clients demanded. They would then be beaten and raped by him.All three will be sentenced on 26 January at Manchester crown court.Another defendant, Costel Maruntelu, 24, admitted two charges of people trafficking at an earlier hearing, and was jailed for five and a half years in November 2009.Two other women, both Romanian, who initially refused to co-operate with the police investigation were charged with, and admitted, controlling prostitution for gain.Following their conviction, they gave statements outlining how they too were victims in the trafficking operation run by the two Nejloveanus.Detective Constable Colin Ward, of Greater Manchster police's Sexual Crime Unit, said it was difficult to find the words to describe the physical and sexual abuse endured by the women."Marius, in particular, spun a web of lies to encourage women to come to the UK, whether by declaring his love for them or promising a better life," he said. "Instead, they became prisoners forced into prostitution."If they complained in any way, they would be beaten and raped. He is a very dangerous man who sees women as a commodity."He said it had been a very difficult investigation, but that women would be safer as a result of the convictions.
