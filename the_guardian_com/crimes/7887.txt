Criminal gangs are infiltrating schools and sometimes using very young children to run messages between members, MPs were warned today.Officials have identified three cities where the problem of gangs in schools must be addressed - Birmingham, Manchester and London.Schools minister Jim Knight told the Commons education committee: "There are problems of criminal gangs infiltrating schools."Speaking to reporters later, he added: "It is an emerging issue that we want to nip in the bud now before it becomes something that is a genuine worry for parents and pupils." A particular concern was that very young children in primary schools were being used to "run" messages between gang members, he said."The relationship with criminal gangs would be that in secondary school settings you may have some of the dealing not necessarily in school but the communication would take place in school," he said."There is also a tiny amount of evidence, but some evidence, of some siblings of those older children in primary school just being used to pass messages, effectively to act as runners."Obviously, that is particularly worrying if you get infiltration into primary schools and that is one of the reasons why we want to do something about it," said Mr Knight. Mr Knight said police were using intelligence on street gangs to help schools tackle the problem. The issue was being dealt with effectively in Southwark, south London, and Haringey, in the north of the capital."We are talking about street gangs where people might join them because they feel they want that sense of belonging and being part of a particular peer group," he said."Obviously there may be cultures attached to that in respect of drugs but I'm not aware, I've not been told about pupils being forced to take drugs or people being forced to sell drugs."It's a relationship with criminal gangs outside school that is starting to come in school just in those four places that we want to be able to help schools to do something about."In September last year, two inner-city schools in south London were closed on police advice after "specific intelligence" that pupils could be targeted by armed gangs lying in wait outside the schools at the end of the day, police sources said.The threat came amid worsening violence between two south London gangs, the Ghetto Boys from Lewisham, and the Peckham Boys.
