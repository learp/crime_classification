A man was convicted today of murdering his partner less than a fortnight after she changed her status to single on Facebook. Brian Lewis stabbed and strangled Hayley Jones at the home they shared with their four children. Lewis, 31, from Pritchard Terrace, Phillipstown, New Tredegar, south Wales, thenfled the scene during the early hours of 12 March of this year and drove to a police station, leaving his children to find their mother's body. Cardiff crown court heard that Lewis's redundancy and the amount of time Ms Jones was spending on Facebook put strains on their relationship.Lewis had claimed he had been trimming his finger nails with a kitchen knife when he tried to "touch" his 26-year-old partner's sleeping bag with the tip of the blade out of frustration following a row.The knife pierced two sleeping bags and went through three layers of clothing Ms Jones had been wearing while trying to sleep on a settee before her ribcage prevented it from penetrating any further.He said he later found himself with his hands around Ms Jones's throat and only came to and released his grip when he heard one of his sons calling out from upstairs.After just three hours of deliberation, the jury of eight women and four men rejected this explanation and returned a unanimous guilty verdict.Lewis showed no emotion as the verdict was read out although there were shouts of "Yes!" and "Get in there!" from the public gallery.After calling for quiet, Judge Roderick Evans sentenced Lewis to life imprisonment and ordered that he serve a minimum tariff of 14 years, less the time spent in custody on remand. Lewis was sentenced to life and the judge ordered that he serve at least 14 years.
