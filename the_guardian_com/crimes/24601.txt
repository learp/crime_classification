Police in the Scottish university town where Prince William will study for his degree have asked for more money to help meet the cost of his protection, it emerged yesterday.Fife police asked the Scottish executive for Â£114,000 to meet the costs of providing 12 to 14 extra officers to provide round-the-clock security for the young royal after he starts his four-year history of art course at St Andrews, in October. The application has been submitted to the Scottish executive and was discussed yesterday at Fife council's public protection and regulation committee. The money would be extra to the force's budget. This week students and staff at the university were warned they faced disciplinary action if they leaked stories about Prince William to the press. In an interview with the student newspaper the Saint, Brian Lang, principal of the university, said he was determined to protect the 19-year-old's privacy. Dr Lang said he would take a "very dim view" of any member of the university passing on information of "an inappropriate nature".But it is feared some impoverished students may find it hard to resist the prospect of earning cash from the tabloids for photographs or gossip about the prince. Last night Andrew Keddie, chairman of Fife council's public protection committee, said: "We don't want to deprive other parts of Fife of police officers, that's why additional funds are needed. Prince William will be treated as one of the local residents, just the way the rest of the students are." Marcus Booth, student union president at St Andrews, said: "I want Prince William to live as normal a life as possible, but of course we're concerned about intrusive media. The prospect of his university life being dissected, or his academic grades leaked, would be awful."
