The suicide of a violinist days after she testified in court against a former director of music could and should have been prevented, a report has said.Frances Andrade, 48, killed herself at her home in Guildford, Surrey, a week after giving evidence against Michael Brewer, formerly of the prestigious Chetham's school of music in Manchester.Brewer was jailed for six years at Manchester crown court last year after being convicted on five counts of indecently assaulting Andrade when she was 14 and 15. He was later stripped of the OBE awarded to him for services to music in 1994.A serious case review has found that Andrade was let down by mental health services which failed to realise how vulnerable she was as she fought to bring Brewer to justice. Proper care measures and adequate risk assessments were not put in place as she made increasingly serious suicide attempts, the report notes.Jackie Shave, a close friend of Andrade since college, welcomed the review, which she described as "shocking and disturbing". She spoke to Andrade during the trial and received a series of distraught text messages from her, including one which said she felt as though she had been "raped again" after giving evidence.Shave said Andrade believed she could not share details of the abuse she suffered while the trial was pending. "I remember her calling me during the trial and we both felt like we shouldn't be discussing it as we weren't sure if we were allowed to," said Shave.She noted that the report said Andrade's behaviour "flashed up red lights" to mental health experts. "How appalling that it didn't flash up red lights enough for the team to realise she needed some real support during the trial process even if she said she didn't want it," she said."She made seven attendances to hospital with overdose in the 10 months leading up to her death. Surely this should have meant that some neutral, caring social worker should have been with her during the whole process? I think that in cases such as this it should be standard procedure."According to the review, Andrade made a serious attempt at overdosing less than two weeks before the trial was due to start, resulting in her staying in hospital for three days.The review panel deemed as "unfit for purpose" the risk assessments completed after her seven suicide attempts. "These were not teenage cries for help … nor could her overdoses be framed as accidental," according to the review's author, Professor Hilary Brown. The report calls for criminal justice professionals to improve support for survivors of sex abuse and to recognise their vulnerability when facing their abusers in court.Mental health services should become more alert to the fallout from sexual exploitation and the risks of suicide and self-harm, the report adds.Professional services responsible for the care of Andrade, referred to in the report as Mrs A, were "found wanting" in a number of ways. The report says: "The panel considered this was a suicide that could and should have been prevented. Mrs A had reasons to live and she continued to ask for help throughout this period. We therefore invite all the agencies concerned to take real and concrete steps towards improving their practice."When historic cases of sexual abuse come to court, we ask former victims to stand up and lay bare details about their lives that are painful and intimate."Criminal justice and mental-health services should be able to provide a comprehensive and seamless support service to them throughout this process because, as this case demonstrates, historic abuse is always a present source of difficulty and distress to those who have been victimised."Ms Andrade exhibited different mental states, appearing competent and assured at times, and vulnerable and in despair at other moments.The report went on: "Mrs A deserved support as a troubled teenager, and she most certainly deserved support again when, as a mature woman concerned for the safety of others, she stood up and faced her abusers in court.The trial was told the abuse took place in Brewer's office and camper van. He was cleared of raping Andrade when she was 18 at his home in Chorlton, Manchester.Sentencing him, Judge Martin Rudland labelled Brewer "a predatory sex offender" and said he used his powerful position to select and groom his victims.Brewer also targeted a 17-year-old student at Chetham's who he fondled in his office – admitting in court he fell in love with her at the age of 49. Another 17-year-old girl was said to have been pinned up against a wall during a school trip and sexually propositioned.He resigned as music director at Chetham's after the affair with the girl he fondled in his office was uncovered.But the affair was hushed up, his trial heard, and Brewer went on to become the artistic director of the national youth choirs of Britain, to direct the world youth choir, serve as an adjudicator in international competitions and lead BBC workshops for the programme Last Choir Standing in 2008.Brewer's ex-wife, Kay, was jailed for 21 months after she was convicted at the same trial of indecently assaulting Andrade when she was 18.
