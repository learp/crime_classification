Alan Bennett has become the latest victim of a distinctive scam after pickpockets smeared the playwright with ice-cream to distract him while they helped themselves to his wallet and Â£1,500.The 76-year-old writer, whose works include his Talking Head monologues, The Madness Of George III and The History Boys, had just withdrawn the cash from a branch of Lloyds Bank near his home in Camden, north London.He then headed to a nearby Marks & Spencer store, where he was targeted by two women and a man at lunchtime last Friday.The thieves are said to have spattered the back of his raincoat with ice-cream then taken his wallet from a pocket while purporting to clean the ice-cream off. Police said the scam is a favourite in London's West End.Bennett was described by onlookers as "red-faced and flustered" when he returned to the bank, where he was later interviewed by police.A Lloyds clerk, who did not wish to be named, told the Daily Mail: "I served him. He came back into the bank after being in Marks & Spencer, and said there had been two women who told him he had ice-cream on his back."They started patting him down to try and get it off. That's when it must have happened. It's really awful. Poor man. The police brought him in here afterwards, where he gave details of the incident."Bennett told the paper the incident was "most upsetting", adding: "But I shall be writing about it in my diaries."A Metropolitan police spokesman said no one had been arrested over the robbery and the inquiry continues.He said: "We can confirm detectives from Camden robbery squad are investigating an allegation of robbery. "The incident occurred on Friday at about 12.15pm in a shop on Camden High Street, NW1."The victim, a man aged in his 70s, was robbed of an amount of money by three suspects."
