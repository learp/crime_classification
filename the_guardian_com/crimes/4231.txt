A teenage boy who murdered a man by severely beating and then throwing him on a bonfire will tonight begin 13 years' detention.Jamie Smith, 13, who had a history of violence and was on the run from a care home, punched and kicked Stephen Croft, 35, in Birkenhead, Merseyside in the early hours of November 6 last year. He then threw Croft on to the embers of a bonfire on waste ground.Smith can now be named after the Recorder of Liverpool, Henry Globe QC, lifted a ban.The apparently unprovoked attack came after Smith absconded from his care home in Haslingden, Lancashire, Liverpool crown court heard today. When staff and his relatives "tricked" him into a car to take him back, he punched the windows, threatened to light a firework in his pocket and ran off.Smith, described as large for his age, had been drinking vodka and cider before he killed Croft, a local man, in the unprovoked attack, the court heard.Croft was described by the prosecuting QC, David Turner, as an extremely vulnerable target. He became an alcoholic after an industrial accident, and had spent the day of his death drinking until he was almost five times the legal bdriving limit."It was therefore a sustained attack on a helpless man," Turner said.Croft's cigarette papers, lighter and tobacco were found on Smith when he was arrested.The judge said he was "satisfied that the attack was motivated in part" by Smith's "desire to steal".Smith said he killed Croft because he was angry about the attempt to return him to care.Turner said Smith might have suffocated Croft. "The pathologist found considerable damage to the face of the deceased."There was bruising over the right eyelid. The nose appeared very swollen and the nasal septum and the right side of the nasal bone were both fractured."When the pathologist turned the body in the course of his examination, extensive blood escaped from the nose and mouth."When Smith was arrested his clothes were splashed with Croft's blood.Smith maintained his innocence until the end of February when he pleaded guilty to murder.Defending the teenager, David Steer QC said his client was a suicide risk and regretted the pain he had caused Croft's family.But the judge said Smith was a public danger and posed a very high risk of reoffending. He sentenced him to 13 years in custody before parole.A family statement issued by Sarah Croft, the victim's sister said: "Due to the nature and severity of the injuries inflicted upon Stephen, our family and his friends were unable to see him for one last time to say our final goodbyes; this is something we will never get over."Steve Maddox, the chief executive of Wirral council, said a review was under way of all agencies that were involved with Smith's care.
