The Old Bailey jury trying two brothers for the murder of ten-year-old Damilola Taylor was told today to put aside sympathy for his family.Damilola's parents, Richard and Gloria Taylor, listened at the back of the court as Mr Justice Hooper told jurors: "Sympathy cannot help you." The 16-year-old brothers deny murder, manslaughter and assault with intent to rob Damilola on November 27 2000. The schoolboy bled to death on a stairwell on the North Peckham estate, south London, from a thigh injury caused by a broken bottle. Mr Justice Hooper told the four women and seven men: "We all have huge sympathy for the Damilola Taylor family who have lost a much loved 10-year-old son."Sympathy for the family and sympathy for all those caught up in this must be put aside when you consider your verdicts." The jury must also ignore the possibility that its verdicts would attract a great deal of public interest and analysis, he said, adding: "You must try the case on the evidence before you. What you must not do is speculate."The trial continues.
