The police watchdog has found there was a "failure of systems" in Essex police's handling of a man who murdered his former partner and their two-year-old daughter, criticising a lack of adequate training, insufficient resources for domestic violence cases and "poor oversight", in a report released on Wednesday.The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said a "catalogue of incidents over a two-year period" had been treated largely in isolation by police dealing with Christine Chambers, who was shot dead, along with her daughter Shania, by her ex-partner David Oakes in June last year. Oakes, from Steeple near Maldon, was jailed for life in May after being convicted of their murders.During the trial at Chelmsford crown court questions were raised about the police force's handling of the family, as it emerged that officers had visited either Oakes' or Chambers' address at least six times in the two years leading up to the tragedy.In its report, the IPCC said: "There was a failure by police to recognise any pattern or connection between the events being reported, and, in particular, there was a failure to identify or act upon the evident escalation in the number of Ms Chambers' calls to the police during the two months prior to the murders â€“ at a time when officers had been told her relationship with David Oakes had ended."Against a backdrop of 16 incidents and ongoing child custody proceedings, the report added, there was "little focus" on Oakes and "inadequate action" taken to arrest him when reports were made of him breaching a non-molestation order.The IPCC, which looked at communication between officers and the family from March 2009 to June 2011, added: "Important information about David Oakes' violence towards Christine was known to agencies involved in the child custody proceedings, but either not known by police or not taken sufficiently into account in their risk assessments. Despite consistent warnings to Essex police, specialist domestic abuse investigation teams were poorly resourced, and there remained a substantial backlog in inputting domestic violence forms on the force intelligence system."IPCC commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: "The deaths of Christine and Shania Chambers are shocking to us all. It is impossible to say with any certainty whether, if individual officers or the force had done things differently, Ms Chambers and Shania would still be alive today. While individual police officers could and should have done things better, this is not essentially a failure of individuals, but a failure of systems. The investigation identified a lack of adequate training, insufficient resources allocated to domestic violence cases and poor oversight."This is a tragic and disturbing case and the investigation has identified several key issues which apply to many other cases where domestic homicide is the outcome. Many women are reluctant to pursue criminal proceedings against abusive partners, sometimes even to seek help at all. There are many reasons for this, and often it is fear that they will exacerbate the situation and increase the danger they face."Undoubtedly this poses significant challenges for the police and other agencies, but it is essential in these situations that all possible is done to protect the victims and their children. Unwillingness to seek help or give evidence against the perpetrator is often due to fear and can be a sign of vulnerability, not culpability, and this must be recognised when a risk assessment is completed. I am very grateful to the members of a community reference group I established in July 2011 for their domestic violence expertise in relation to this and other Essex domestic homicide cases."In a statement posted on the Essex police website, assistant chief constable Maurice Mason apologised on behalf of the force for the failures identified by the IPCC and said "a meticulous review" of how domestic abuse cases are managed had been carried out, which led to 76 new posts in the public protection team and a dedicated domestic abuse intelligence team."Essex police accepts the report of the IPCC and welcomes the recommendation that processes should be developed for better information sharing between police forces and agencies such as social services, courts and solicitors," said Mason."This is particularly important in cases involving child custody proceedings, where allegations of domestic violence have not been reported to officers."It should be stressed that the IPCC investigation found that it is impossible to say with any certainty that, if the force had done things differently, Christine and Shania would be alive today. It also found no evidence of misconduct by any of our officers."Following the release of the report, Chambers's father Ken praised Essex police for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths.He said: "We have received marvellous support from the police murder investigation team led by Detective Chief Inspector O'Toole, from police family liaison officers and the victim support service, and we are grateful to all of them for helping us through such a traumatic time."We have been kept informed by the IPCC of their investigation and findings and have had opportunity to read through and discuss their report."We realise one evil man is responsible for taking Christine and Shania away from us and not having them in our lives any more remains extremely difficult to bear."While we understand at times Christine could have been more co-operative with the police, we do feel that Essex police could have done more to prevent the deaths; they should have taken greater steps to protect Christine. For instance we are still of the view she should have had a panic alarm installed at her home which may have allowed her to summon assistance at a crucial time after her phones had been smashed. And we think that officers dealing with ongoing incidents should have been more aware of the history and should have better identified the risks."
