Police have launched a double murder inquiry after the bodies of two Chinese students were found in a flat in Newcastle upon Tyne.Northumbria police have not yet named the victims, but said that a man was found lying on a bed in the back bedroom of the ground floor flat and a woman in the front bedroom.Their head injuries were so severe that detectives have not yet worked out the nature of the murder weapon.The bodies were found at about 4.30pm on Saturday afternoon in Croydon Road, an area popular with students and families from the local Asian community. A spokesman for Northumbria police said the victims were thought to be students and efforts were being made to contact their next of kin.Steve Wade, a senior murder investigator appointed to head the inquiry, led a fingertip search of the flat. A silver hatchback was taken away on a police truck, while forensics continued the house search.Officers cordoned off Croydon Road, where neighbours said the victims had not lived for long, and had kept themselves to themselves. A local Chinese student, Shao Peng Wu, said that he had been attacked by gangs of youths in the past and was thinking of moving away from the area."I am very shocked, " said Wu, a mobile communications student. "Sometimes local children attack us. I don't know whether it is because we come from another country."Another student living nearby, Sheik Asadujjaman, 23, said that the murdered man was aged about 30. He had only seen him once, he said, driving a red sports car about a month ago. Police said that talks were being held with community groups and patrols had been stepped up locally. Postmortems were carried out at Newcastle's Royal Victoria infirmary.
