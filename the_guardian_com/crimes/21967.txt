When it comes to law and order a Gordon Brown government was always going to be a bit of an unknown quantity, as this was a policy area that he had always left to Tony Blair.In the end the PM used up a lot of political capital to secure something that Blair had singularly failed to do: get the House of Commons to back an extension of the pre-charge detention limit for terror suspects beyond 28 days.To the frustration of some ministers the parliamentary battle over counter-terrorism, eclipsed most of the government's other work in home affairs. A year which began with the failed terror attacks in London and Glasgow ended with the Commons drama over 42 days – a marginal issue in strict policing and security terms.Gordon Brown's arrival in Downing Street failed to signal any major change of direction on any of the big policy Home Office or justice policy projects. The timetable for the national identity cards scheme, which Brown was known to be sceptical about, was allowed to slip and was scaled back, but the project basically remains on track. His ministers adopted a more gentle tone towards judges they disagreed with and, under the influence of Ed Balls, the children's secretary, punitive asbos were allowed to go out of fashion. Some might cite the reclassification of cannabis, but it could hardly be described as a major change in direction.The Home Office split, which had been planned by Blair and John Reid, was implemented by Jacqui Smith and Jack Straw, with prisons and probation moving to the new Ministry of Justice. The Home Office, its reputation still recovering from foreign-prisoner scandals, has gone through 12 months of stability with its top officials breathing a sigh of relief each time a data-loss scandal was revealed somewhere else in Whitehall. Its development into a continental-style interior ministry began in earnest with its new propaganda department to counter Islamist extremism.The government did draw some of the poison out of the immigration debate by recognising that some local authorities have struggled to cope with sudden influxes of migrants and by introducing the points-based immigration system and citizenship reforms.But in other areas the last year has been a wasted opportunity. Police reform was delayed until this autumn and public-sector pay policy triggered an acrimonious row with the police and calls for the home secretary's resignation. Policy disputes between cabinet ministers over the best way to tackle youth crime delayed a new approach. New legislation on prostitution was dropped. The sustained reduction in crime – one of Labour's "hidden" achievements – has started to accelerate, but without any apparent political dividend for ministers. Brown instead found himself battered by recurrent scares over gun and knife crime and resorted to Blair-style Downing Street summits and emergency announcements. The prison population continued to soar, breaking all previous records, despite the efforts of the justice secretary, Jack Straw, to persuade courts to make more use of community punishments. Downing Street and Straw dismayed liberal penal reformers by announcing a network of huge "titan jails" in a futile attempt to build their way out of the prisons crisis. Verdict: Needless battle over 42 days delayed further progress over crime and justice. This week the Guardian's specialist correspondents are delivering their verdict on Gordon Brown's first year. Yesterday they looked at leadership, the economy, foreign affairs and defence. Today they will tackle home affairs and justice, health and education, while tomorrow they will cover the environment, welfare, and the constitution
