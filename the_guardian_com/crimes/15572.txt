Some lifers are spending more than 20 hours a day locked up inside Wakefield high security prison, the chief inspector of prisons, Anne Owers, said today.She said a new governor has made progress in tackling bullying and intimidation in the last 18 months, but there were still very few activities for prisoners. Ms Owers also voiced concerns about emergency night procedures at the prison after a recent death in custody. The Prison Service said the prison's new management had identified many of the issues raised by inspectors and were tackling them, including time out of cell.
