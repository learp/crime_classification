A policeman is to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving when a schoolgirl was hit by his patrol car.Hayley Adamson, 16, from Newcastle, was crossing a road with friends in the Scotswood area of the city on May 19 when the marked Northumbria police car hit her. PC John Dougal, who was driving, has been suspended from work pending the outcome of the court case.Chris Emzor, the chief prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Durham, said: "Following a thorough investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, I confirm my decision to charge PC John James Dougal of Northumbria police with causing death by dangerous driving."Brian Hegarty, a solicitor representing the teenager's mother, Yvonne Adamson, and older sister, Sarah Ridley, said of his clients: "As part of their ongoing quest for justice for Hayley, they are pleased that the officer will have to answer for his actions in a criminal court."Tempers flared after the collision, which happened on a 30mph stretch of road. A stun gun was used to subdue and arrest a witness. Police said afterwards that the patrol car's number plate recognition system had alerted the driver to a suspicious vehicle in the area. An officer driving another marked patrol car behind Dougal's would not be charged, the CPS said.
