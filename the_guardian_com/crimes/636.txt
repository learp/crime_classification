Neighbours who suffer from anti-social behaviour including loud parties, graffiti and vandalism are being urged to "take a stand" by the government.John Reid, the home secretary, is looking for ways to promote Tony Blair's "Respect" agenda and "wants people to actively moan", one official said.Louise Casey, the prime minister's "Respect tsar", told BBC News 24 yesterday: "We are on the side of the law-abiding majority, we are going to make sure we come behind that law-abiding majority and one of the ways we are going to do that - among many - is back the public when they make a stand."An official denied newspaper reports that Mr Reid had endorsed a publicity drive under the slogan "Don't moan, take action, it's your street too". The ideas had been proposed by the Home Office but Mr Reid would not use that language, he said.Anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) and more community police are among measures Mr Reid says have given police and local authorities the power to crack down.Next year all local authorities will sign a "local area agreement" that shows progress in tackling problems such as noisy neighbours, graffiti and vandalism.David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said the government was rehashing an old initiative rather than making sure criminals are caught and do their time.
