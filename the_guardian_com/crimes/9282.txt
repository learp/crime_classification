Two teenagers facing manslaughter charges over the killing of the south London schoolboy Damilola Taylor were publicly named for the first time today.Danny and Rickie Preddie, who were acquitted last month of murdering the 10-year-old, will be tried separately for manslaughter in June.At a preliminary hearing today, Mr Justice Goldring said that the pair could be named in court proceedings because they were both now 18.Damilola, who was born in Nigeria, had been in Britain for only three months when he was found bleeding to death in a stairway on a council estate in Peckham, south London, in November 2002.He had been stabbed in the leg with a broken beer bottle, and prosecutors allege that he was targeted after refusing to hand his padded jacket to his attackers.However, attempts to convict his killers have repeatedly foundered, with a trial in 2002 resulting in charges against two unnamed teenagers being dropped, and two other people being cleared.Last month, the nine-week trial of three other suspects ended similarly, with 20-year-old Hassan Jihad found not guilty on all counts.Danny and Rickie Preddie were cleared of all charges except manslaughter, on which the jury failed to reach a verdict.
