A review into a police force's contacts with Jimmy Savile has concluded that there is no evidence its officers protected him from arrest or prosecution.The West Yorkshire police (WYP) report examined the history of Savile's relationship with the force, including reports that officers attended his well-known Friday Morning Club at his Leeds flat. The report concluded: "There is no evidence that he was protected from arrest or prosecution for any offences as a result of his relationship with WYP, or individual friendships with officers." The report said 68 of Savile's victims had come forward in the force area.The report said: "No evidence has been found to conclude that there was any impropriety or misconduct in relation to the Friday Morning Club. "All of those people spoken to who had knowledge of the Friday Morning Club described it as a 'coffee morning'. "Non-police attendees commented on how professionally the police officers who had attended Savile's home conducted themselves. "Savile had friends who were police officers, but he also had friends that were solicitors, doctors and many other professions. "All inquiries have shown that Savile was able to hide his offending from those he came into contact with and who probably thought that they knew him well." The report also examined the way in which WYP used Savile's celebrity status to front a range of campaigns and appeals. It stressed that at the time he was "seen by most of the public as a man who did good work". But it concluded: "The review team have concerns regarding the absence of a process to secure Savile's services for some of these events and also the over reliance on personal friendships that developed between Savile and some officers over a number of years to secure that support."
