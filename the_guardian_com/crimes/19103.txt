Some police forces are so slow at answering routine phone calls that frustrated callers are clogging 999 lines with non-urgent requests, according to the chief inspector of constabulary. Call handling was one of 16 areas of activity graded in the baseline assessments of all 43 English and Welsh forces published by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary today.Their performance in areas including tackling crime, roads policing, forensic handling and leadership, were graded excellent, good, fair or poor.The five forces to come out worst were Cleveland, Humberside, Cambridgeshire, Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire. Humberside and Cleveland shared the poorest ratings - six each out of 16. Cambridgeshire scored four poors and nine fairs.Kent, Lancashire, Northumbria, Staffordshire and Suffolk were best, with two large urban forces, Merseyside and West Midlands, also singled out for praise.Avon and Somerset, one of six forces which has been receiving Home Office assistance to raise its standards, rated excellent in three categories and good in 11, but must do better to combat "volume crime", such as car theft and burglary.The country's largest force, London's 30,000-strong Met ropolitan police was the "envy of the policing world" in combating terrorism, with an excellent rating in critical incident response, and good in 11 other categories.But Sir Keith Povey, the chief inspector of HMIC, said phone handling was causing concern in several forces. "A number of forces are struggling in dealing with that aspect of activity, both 999 and non-urgent calls."The response on 999 calls tends to be better, but my feeling is that the frustration of not getting through on less urgent calls is leading to people phoning 999."Jan Berry, who chairs the Police Federation, said: "The public should be able to contact their local police about non-urgent matters without waiting all day for their phone call to be answered."Chief officers need to act now to ensure that there is proper investment in professional and efficient call handling staff who are suitably trained and resourced to gather appropriate information quickly and effectively."Sir Keith admitted there were also worries about some forces' ability to deal with serious crime.No forces were ranked poor on leadership, and Sir Keith said there was no suggestion at present that the home secretary might use new powers to sack any chief constable.
