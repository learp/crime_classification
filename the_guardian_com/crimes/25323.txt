A conman who posed as an MI5 spy during a £1m "odyssey of deceit" was jailed for life today.Robert Hendy-Freegard, a 34-year old semi-literate former car salesman nicknamed "The Puppetmaster", seduced and ruthlessly exploited his victims during a 10-year period, Blackfriars crown court heard.The court, in London, was told he convinced some to go on the run from terrorists and swindled others out of huge sums of money.Using a blend of "devious charm", claims that he was an MI5 agent and James Bond-type tales of shadowy IRA killers, he systematically shredded his victims' self-respect and turned most into virtual slaves.At least seven of his victims were women, and he got engaged to many of them, the court was told.They included a solicitor, a psychologist, a company director and a recently married PA, who left her husband for the swindler and ended up sleeping on park benches, living on a slice of Mars Bar a day and foraging for fresh water in public lavatories.A student, one of two men to fall prey to Hendy-Freegard's Svengali-like powers of persuasion, handed over £300,000. Because he thought he was being recruited to the fight against terrorism, he allowed himself to be beaten to toughen him up before abandoning his university finals for a three-year life on the run, fleeing from imaginary Republican gangs.The court heard he and some of the other victims endured what seemed like a lifetime of poverty, carried out bizarre "missions" for Hendy-Freegard across Britain, and were left terrified by his explosive temper and claims that assassins were stalking their every move.While they suffered, their tormentor - whose motto was "lies have to be big to be convincing" - used the cash he ordered them to beg and borrow to fund a luxury life of top of the range cars, designer suits, expensive meals and five-star holidays in Brazil and elsewhere.Hendy-Freegard, of High Street, Blyth, Nottinghamshire, was convicted in June of 20 offences of theft, deception and "kidnapping by fraud" between 1993 and 2003.Today, at least six of his victims, including lawyer Caroline Cowper - who once rated his bedroom techniques at "11 out of 10" - watched from the public gallery as Hendy-Freegard was jailed for life.Judge Deva Pillay said the conman's victims had fallen prey to his "devious charm".Hendy-Freegard lounged in one of the dock chairs and looked impassive as the judge told him: "In my judgment, the several verdicts of the jury in this case represent a vindication of your victims and a telling testament to their courage, tenacity and spirit to survive and overcome adversity, despite the depths of despair to which they were driven by you."The judge said that after "considering very carefully" all the circumstances, he had no choice but to impose life sentences for the two kidnapping offences."It was plain to me as I listened to the evidence for many months that you are an egotistical and opinionated confidence trickster who has shown not a shred of remorse nor compassion for the degradation and suffering to which your victims were subjected," he added.The jury heard that not only was he extremely successful at selling cars to well-heeled female customers, but he also secured quite a few dates.At first, he seemed the perfect boyfriend - handsome, attentive and generous. However, the situation would then become strange. He would disappear for weeks and then start to drop hints that he was not just a car salesman and his real job was much more exciting. He would eventually confide that he was, in fact, an MI5 spy being hunted by IRA killers.His fantasies had serious and traumatic consequences. Over a 10-year period, he managed to convince his victims of his story in order to con them, and in some cases their parents, out of huge sums of money totalling £1m.In 1993, when a part-time barman in a pub near Harper Adams agricultural college in Newport, Shropshire, he persuaded three students, Sarah Smith, Maria Hendy and John Atkinson, to go on the run with him, insisting they were also in danger from the IRA because of their association with him.Ms Hendy spent eight years with him, giving birth to their two daughters as he forced her to live in a cramped flat in Sheffield.He controlled her every move as he treated himself to expensive cars, a Rolex watch and handmade suits and shoes.None of the women knew about his relationships with the others, and he would often use one woman's money to woo another with gifts and expensive dinners.He juggled up to five of them at the same time, once keeping two women in a house together for a month but ensuring they didn't communicate by telling them they didn't speak the same language.His rages were violent and unpredictable - he would stop on the motorway and threaten to throw a woman out of the car. He promised his lovers he would marry them, but in the end all he left was huge holes in their bank accounts. Many of the women he targeted were intelligent professionals. Caroline Cowper, a successful solicitor, sued him and reported him to police, but it was his involvement with American child psychologist Kim Adams that eventually led to his arrest.Hendy-Freegard thought he had struck gold when he met Ms Adams in August 2002 and discovered her stepfather had won thousands of dollars on the lottery. He told her parents he had recruited her as a spy and that they had to send thousands of dollars to pay for her training. Ms Adams' mother flew to London, promising to hand over $10,000 (£5,400) to Hendy-Freegard on the condition that she could see her daughter. Police were waiting for him at Heathrow, and Ms Adams was found in a nearby car park."At first she just cried and refused to accept we were police officers," said PC Cathy Harrison, who interviewed all Hendy-Freegard's victims at length."Hendy-Freegard had told her that, because of his M15 role, people pretending to be police officers could swoop on the couple but they would be imposters and she should not cooperate with them.When arrested, Hendy-Freegard had a Polish passport and had taken a recent holiday with Ms Adams in the French Alps. Police found letters and papers at a hotel there mentioning other victims. After his conviction, police described him as "evil", and said he was in a class of his own.
