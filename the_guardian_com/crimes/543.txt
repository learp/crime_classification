Police forces should issue comical caricatures of the criminals they are hunting instead of standard photofits, according to a team of scientists who found that cartoon-like faces are better at jolting people's memories.A study at the University of Central Lancashire found that over-emphasising prominent features on people's faces made them twice as easy to identify than before.The researchers used computer software to alter the faces of 18 celebrities which had been created using three standard photofit techniques. The faces were then turned into caricatures by exaggerating certain features, such as the size of a person's ears, forehead or nose, by as much as 50%.In tests, volunteers were asked to identify people from the standard photofit of their face and from their caricature.On average, a photofit face was correctly identified 20% of the time, compared with 40% for the caricature, according to a report in this month's Visual Cognition journal.In a second test, the team led by Charlie Frowd asked volunteers to make photofits of international footballers two days after being shown a picture of them. The delay was introduced to reflect the typical amount of time that passes from a crime being committed and a witness being asked to create a photofit.When the images were shown to volunteers, only 3.4% of them were correctly identified, a similar success rate as that reported for police photofits. After animation, the composites were correctly named 26.0% of the time. The researchers are in discussions with police over the possibility of trying out the technology after future crimes.Â· This article was amended on Thursday November 29 2007.
