A man arrested in connection with the murder of his wife and mother-in-law had been reported to police over a succession of domestic incidents, including an attempt last year to gain access to the former marital home, detectives said today.Sergei Zolotovsky, a 42-year-old self-employed engineer from Latvia, is suspected of ambushing his estranged wife, Svetlana Zolotovska, 40, as she made her way to work yesterday morning in Beckton, east London.Her mother, Antonia Belska, 70, was found stabbed to death nearby at the home the couple used to share.Her body was discovered by firefighters called when a neighbour spotted flames coming from the semi-detached property.Zolotovsky is believed to have started the fire, and was found hiding in the loft of the house, having apparently slit his own throat. He was taken to hospital and underwent extensive surgery. Police were today waiting to question him about the attacks.It emerged that the couple had contacted police four times since 2008 regarding domestic rows.The most recent occasion was in April last year, when the wife, who worked as a pharmacy technician at the private Wellington hospital in north London, had called to report that her former partner was attempting to get into the property they once shared. She decided not to bring charges, police said."Police attended and both parties were spoken to, while neither party wanted to pursue the matter further," said a Metropolitan police spokesman."The Newham community safety unit contacted the victim at a later date to offer reassurance and advice on how to keep her property secure."The spokesman added: "We can confirm we have had previous contact with the parties involved. We are aware of historic domestic disputes between the victim and her estranged husband."Work colleagues have said that Zolotovska had brought her mother to the UK from Latvia to live with her while the divorce went through, and today a family friend said the final settlement proceedings had been stalled by a dispute over the Â£300,000 property."He did not want to give her half. He didn't want to sell it," the friend said, adding that Zolotovsky had sent his former partner text messages stating: "You'll never have this house".
