There was an unexpected 8% drop in crime recorded by the police in the 12 months to September with falls in burglary, robbery and violence despite the recession, according to the quarterly crime figures (pdf) published this morning.The Home Office data also confirms that the murder rate in England and Wales has fallen (pdf) to a 20-year low, with 651 homicides in 2008/09 – 102 fewer than the previous year.The latest British Crime Survey, based on people's experience of crime, also published today, shows that crime was broadly stable over the 12 months to September 2009 in England and Wales. However, it reports that the risk of becoming a victim of crime has fallen to a new historical low of 22%.The quarterly crime figures are the last set to be published before the start of the general election campaign.Police recorded crime shows a fall in nearly all offence groups for the quarter July to September 2009 compared with a year earlier, including a substantial 20% fall in car crime (a drop of more than 30,000 offences), 11% drop in criminal damage, 9% fall in robberies and an 8% drop in burglary.However, increases were recorded in sexual offences, up 5% from 13,300 to 14,000; personal theft up 7% to 23,200 and a similar rise in bicycle thefts to 34,600.The fall in robberies includes a welcome 16% drop in the number in which a knife was used, but gun crime rose by 3% to 2,100 incidents – the first increase for nine months. The fall in the murder rate reflects a fall in homicides involving a sharp instrument from 271 to 255 during 2008/09, while fatal shootings were also down, from 53 to 39. The police said that the figures showed some encouraging trends over a period when some criminologists had expected an upward pressure on the overall crime rate from the impact of the economic recession.The Association of Chief Police Officers' head of crime, chief constable Keith Bristow, said: "Recorded crime statistics published today are good news overall showing significant reductions which reflect the hard work of the police service and our partners to keep people safe from harm in every community."Following an increase in the last quarter, the detail shows domestic burglary down by 8%, with other reductions recorded in robbery, drug offences and criminal damage. Vehicle crime also dropped by 20%, which may be attributable to a combination of factors including improved crime prevention and better vehicle security design, allied to a focus on tackling prolific offenders."He said the increase in sexual offences had followed a period of encouraging victims to come forward and report these crimes.Home Office minister David Hanson also welcomed the figures saying he was particularly pleased that the number of people worried about antisocial behaviour had fallen to 15% – the lowest on record."Improving public confidence in the police and local councils is one of government's top priorities. That is why we slashed all national targets for the police, except one on public confidence, freeing them up to deliver on the crime and antisocial behaviour issues that matter locally," he said.Crime in England and Wales: Quarterly Update to September 2009 (pdf)Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence 2008/09: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales 2008/09 (pdf)
