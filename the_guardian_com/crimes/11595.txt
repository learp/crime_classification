A Muslim student accused of being a "wannabe suicide bomber" was released early from prison today after he was cleared of plotting terror attacks by the court of appeal, and claimed he had been persecuted for "thought crimes".Mohammed Atif Siddique, 24, from Alva, near Stirling, was released part-way through an eight-year prison sentence after the Crown Office said it would not oppose an appeal court ruling that he had been wrongly convicted of preparing to commit or instigate Islamist terror attacks.The shopkeeper's son was jailed for eight years in October 2007 for a string of terrorism offences after he was found guilty of downloading Islamist documents on weaponry, explosives and beheadings and then circulating them again on the internet.He was also convicted of causing a breach of the peace at Glasgow Metropolitan college by threatening to become a suicide bomber and claiming to be an al-Qaida member, and showing images of suicide bombers and beheadings.But last month, the appeal court judge Lord Osborne said he had been wrongly convicted of the most serious charge that there was a "reasonable suspicion" these documents were being held for the "commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism".The appeal judges said the trial judge, Lord Carloway, had "materially misdirected" the jury about the terms of the Terrorism Act 2000 on that charge because he had failed to link the documents with a specific act of terrorism.Today, the appeal court formally quashed that conviction after prosecutors said they would not contest the wrongful conviction ruling. Members of Siddique's family hugged each other and wept outside the court.In a statement read outside the court by his lawyer, Aamer Anwar, Siddique said he had been convicted of simply possessing Islamist documents. "Our laws should bring to account those who plan acts of terror and not criminalise young Muslims for thought crime and possession of propaganda," he said."I have always maintained my innocence but they took my liberty, destroyed my family's reputation and labelled me a terrorist, but I never had any bombs or plans to hurt anyone," he added. "In court it was said I was a wannabe suicide bomber, but I have always said I was simply looking for answers on the internet. I am grateful to those who supported me. I just want to go home now and live my life in peace."The Crown Office said earlier that after four years in jail, Siddique had effectively served his sentence. He also remained convicted of several other terrorism charges linked to his publication of terrorism-related documents online, it said.It claimed the interpretation of the law on commissioning or instigating terrorist attacks had changed since Siddique was convicted, after the House of Lords issued guidance following subsequent trials in England."After careful consideration of the appeal court's judgment, the crown has decided not to seek authority for a retrial," it said. "The fact that Mr Siddique has already served the majority of his sentence for charge one, and has de facto served his sentence in full for the other terrorist offences, of which he remains convicted, means that a retrial would have little practical effect. Accordingly, the crown has concluded that a retrial would not be in the public interest. Mohammed Siddique remains convicted of serious terrorist offences."His conviction later led to a dispute between Carloway and Anwar after the lawyer claimed, on behalf of Siddique's family, that the case was politically motivated since Siddique was arrested soon after the bomb attack on Glasgow airport. Anwar was charged with contempt of court but was cleared after a short trial.
