Police investigating the death of Damilola Taylor were more worried about protecting their own reputations than discovering the truth about what happened, the Old Bailey was told today.Courtenay Griffiths QC, defending one of the two 16-year-old brothers accused of killing the ten-year-old, claimed that officers "had their own agenda" while they were dealing with the witnesses.He argued that police had "manufactured evidence" to support a murder theory, ignoring evidence that Damilola had died by accident after falling on jagged glass.Mr Griffiths said: "We say that the truth is that the police were more concerned with trying to save their own soiled reputation than telling them the truth."He added that officers had cynically used a young girl witness whose evidence was thrown out by the judge.Damilola's mother Gloria shook her head as Mr Griffiths told the jury that she and her husband Richard had to "day after day listen to a litany of lies and fairy tales".When the boy was found bleeding to death from a wound on his leg on the North Peckham Estate in south London in November 2000, police treated the incident as a crime.Mr Griffiths said: "It occurred in the dark heart of Peckham, that melting pot of poverty and pain. This is Peckham after all. If something like this occurs, it cannot be an accident."The trial continues.
