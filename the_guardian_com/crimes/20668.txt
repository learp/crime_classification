The gangmaster Lin Liang Ren has taken most of the blame for the Morecambe Bay cockling disaster, but the British government and other official bodies have also attracted criticism.Lin was found guilty today of the unlawful killing of the 21 cockle pickers who died on Warton Sands in the Lancashire bay in February 2004.The trial teetered on the brink of collapse more than once. And the case only came to court after a huge, complex police investigation which was stymied by the cultural and linguistic difficulties of investigating the community of Chinese illegal immigrants in the UK.At a pre-trial hearing last September the government was accused of not doing enough to stop the "shadow industry" of cockle picking by illegal Chinese immigrants.Ministers from the UK Immigration Service (UKIS) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) acted as "agents provocateurs" and created a situation in which cockling was an accepted part of British industry, it was claimed.The court heard that instead of detaining the Chinese cocklers, UKIS and the DWP allowed them to carry on working, happy in the knowledge that they were self-sufficient and not a drain on the state.These damning claims, which could not be published before today for legal reasons, were presented to judge Mr Justice Henriques by Lord Carlile QC.Lord Carlile was representing father and son businessmen David Anthony Eden Snr, 63, and David Anthony Eden Jnr, 35, who were accused of buying the cockles harvested by the illegal immigrants.The two men were today cleared of breaching immigration law by employing illegal immigrants by a jury at Preston crown court.Lord Carlile argued that no effective steps were taken to warn merchants, or anyone else in the fishing trade, that the employment of Chinese cockling gangs involved illegality.The QC said: "The state, through the agency of UKIS and its responsible ministers, created the situation in which it was an everyday and accepted part of British industry and exports that Chinese illegals would gather cockles, and ... would be self-sufficient."Responding to Lord Carlile's claims, the Home Office and DWP released a short statement.It said: "UKIS was aware of issues relating to illegal working in the Morecambe Bay area prior to February 2004 and took robust and appropriate action by mounting intelligence-led operations, with the involvement of the DWP, to tackle illegal working in the area and taking steps to remove those individuals with no legal right to be here."Despite this activity, it was not possible to predict what happened on February 5 2004."Lord Carlile also accused the home secretary, Charles Clarke, of potentially jeopardising a fair trial for the defendants in remarks he made during a BBC radio interview.On January 5, four months into the trial, Mr Clarke told the Today programme that the cockler deaths were an example of the "very serious" problem of international crime gangs trafficking people across borders, the sex trade in women and drug dealing.Lord Carlile said jurors hearing Mr Clarke's remarks may have assumed evidence linking the case to international crime gangs and people trafficking was available but had simply not been presented to them.Trial judge Mr Justice Henriques told the jurors: "Please accept my assurance I have not excluded any such evidence. There simply is none."The Â£3m inquiry, named Operation Lund, was the biggest ever to be conducted by Lancashire police, involving more than 200 police officers.There were great practical difficulties in handling a 120-mile beach crime scene. And many witnesses and suspects spoke different varieties of Mandarin, forcing officers to hire dozens of interpreters from across Britain to help compile statements.The language barrier caused severe problems for police and sent them on numerous wild goose chases.The Mandarin word "agin" means "my friend". But in the early stages of the inquiry, police thought it referred to one specific individual, and launched a manhunt for the elusive "Agin" who appeared to be involved in all aspects of the investigation.Police collected more than 1.5 million pages of evidence during the course of the inquiry and trawled through 20,000 telephone calls.Some of the core team of 30 detectives, who worked on the inquiry for two years, were slowed down by diplomatic red tape before they were allowed to make two trips to China's south-east Fujian province.The police's inquiry was also hampered by the number of departments involved: the Inland Revenue, Department for Work and Pensions, National Crime Squad, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Home Office, the Health and Safety Executive, the Coastguard and also Interpol.It was also claimed today that the North West and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee had been warned about a potential tragedy on Warton Sands four months before the cockling disaster occurred.Alan Sledmore, who guides walks across the bay, said he told the committee in meetings in late 2003 about the "imminent dangers" of poor visibility, rising tides, bad weather and thick fog.He suggested a clocking-in system be put in place, evacuation procedures drawn up and a risk assessment of the area carried out. But he said his warnings - and the welfare of the cockle pickers - were ignored and the "entirely foreseeable" events of February 2004 allowed to happen.
