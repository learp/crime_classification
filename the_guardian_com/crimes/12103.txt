Police monitoring paedophiles who use the internet to abuse children are adopting counter-terrorist techniques to gather evidence, the Guardian has learned.Exploiting freedoms unavailable to police in other countries, British detectives are infiltrating sex offender networks on the internet. Masquerading as online paedophiles in search of explicit photos and videos of child sex abuse - or real-time access to children - they have managed to "get inside the world" of online sex offenders.Jim Gamble, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), said undercover officers were penetrating groups that colleagues in the US were unable to due to legislative restraints, using investigative methods more typically used to crack Islamist terrorist networks or drug trafficking gangs."Some jurisdictions won't have the intrusive powers to take over a [virtual] room to masquerade [as a paedophile]. We do have those powers, so ... we will use that to the benefit of the collective good."In a separate development, Ceop is creating a "walk-in" headquarters in Second Life, a virtual world where some 7 million members adopt online personas. Detectives are concerned that offenders will gain access to the teen version of the virtual networking site, for 13 to 17-year-olds.The move - believed to be the first case of a UK law enforcement agency operating in the virtual sphere - comes after detectives observed sex offenders mirroring the online behaviour of young people and moving into new domains, including virtual worlds and gaming websites such as RuneScape which enable "chat" between users.Ceop consults with a panel of 60 children to keep up to date with user habits.A BBC Radio Five Live investigation will reveal how teenagers, some under 16, are performing live sex shows on webcams in exchange for money and gifts.The investigation, to be broadcast tomorrow, will feature cases of "camboys" and "camgirls" who started offering illegal shows after they had seen others doing the same on social networking sites.A girl who, aged 16, began broadcasting sex shows advertised on the website Faceparty tells the programme she quit college because the money - up to Â£150 a day - was so good. The investigation also finds teenagers, possibly as young as 13, advertising webcam sex show services on another teen chatroom, Teenspot."We're absolutely convinced that paedophiles will go where young people go," said Mr Gamble.Working with forces in the US, Canada and Australia, and with Interpol, detectives have detained paedophiles about to commit "live" offences in foreign countries in just two hours. Ceop said that in 12 months the agency rescued 10 children from paedophile environments by piecing together clues in photographs of abuse. A further 83 alleged sex offenders were arrested as a result of online detection.
