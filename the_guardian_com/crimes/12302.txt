Police searching for a 12-year-old boy who had been missing since Sunday night said last night they had found a body near to where he was last seen.Sam Fewster was playing on scrubland near a caravan park in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire before he went missing. Police said the body was found in an industrial unit near to where he was last seen and where a jacket - thought to be his - was discovered. A spokeswoman for Humberside police said: "We are working on the assumption that this is Sam who we have been looking for throughout the day." Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the youngster's death. Police officers, dog handlers and a helicopter had been deployed in the search which was launched after the boy failed to return to his parents' home in Scunthorpe. The focus of the search shifted after the jacket was found on premises at an industrial site yesterday afternoon. Officers searching scrubland off Ferry Road West in Scunthorpe moved to search the industrial area in Hebden Road where they later discovered the body.
