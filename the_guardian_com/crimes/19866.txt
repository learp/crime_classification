The son of former England striker Trevor Francis has been unanimously cleared of stealing designer goods from the home of ex-Aston Villa player Lee Hendrie.Jurors at Warwick crown court took little more than an hour to find Francis not guilty of a single count of burglary following a four-day trial.In a statement issued after the verdict, the 26-year-old and his family said he had been through two years of hell because the Crown Prosecution Service had withheld vital information on the case.Francis, a cleaning company supervisor from Solihull, West Midlands, told the court he visited Hendrie's Â£1.6m home in Rowington, Warwickshire, in May 2011 to assess the cost of cleaning the property. Francis was initially questioned about the alleged break-in in August 2011 after his fingerprints were found in a one-bedroom cottage attached to Hendrie's mansion.Hendrie and his wife, Emma, had alleged that six souvenir football shirts, a Vertu mobile phone, sunglasses, ladies' footwear, a set of golf clubs, an earring and a designer bag were taken from the cottage between 1 July and 2 August 2011.The trial was told that Hendrie's wife submitted an insurance claim form following the burglary which Francis's counsel described as containing "bare-faced" lies.The form, in which it was falsely stated that Hendrie had no previous convictions, was not given to defence lawyers until part-way through this week's trial.In a statement read out by defence solicitor Jim Crocker after the not guilty verdict, the Francis family questioned why the case had been brought before a jury.Addressing the media on the steps of the court, Crocker said: "James Francis, his father Trevor, mother Helen and brother Matthew are obviously delighted and relieved at the jury's unanimous verdict."They all thank their legal team, their witnesses and the jury."Accusing the CPS of withholding information about the insurance claim from the defence, Crocker added: "That documentation showed incontrovertibly that false information had been submitted to the Halifax in support of an insurance claim."The defence team had specifically requested these documents from the Crown Prosecution Service, but they had declined to produce them by asserting that they were not relevant."These documents were only produced on the second day of the trial."This resulted in two years of hell and worry for James and his family, not to speak of the incredible waste of public and private money and resources."In our view this case should never have been brought against James Francis, a man of good character."
