Jon Venables, one of the young killers of James Bulger, has been jailed for downloading and distributing child pornography, as it emerged he had been arrested twice for fighting and drug possession before he was recalled to prison earlier this year.The Ministry of Justice admitted that Jack Straw, then justice secretary, knew Venables had been arrested on both occasions in 2008 for cocaine possession and affray, but agreed with probation and police officials that he should not be recalled to prison.The revelation enraged Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus. "We are surprised and concerned that he was not recalled under the terms of his parole licence" when he was accused of offences in 2008, she said through her solicitor after Venables, now 27, was handed a two-year sentence.She was at the Old Bailey to hear Venables plead guilty to three charges of downloading and distributing indecent images and videos showing children as young as two being raped by adults. Ninety-nine pieces of child pornography were found on his computer, though there was evidence he had deleted at least 1,200 more, the court heard.He also admitted posing on the internet as a 35-year-old woman called Dawn Smith, pretending to have an eight-year-old daughter whom she was prepared to rent out to paedophiles for a fee.Venables appeared in court via videolink from prison, but in a unique decision, the judge decided that only he could be trusted to see the accused's face.Mr Justice Bean ruled that allowing anyone else in the room – including Bulger's mother – to see him would pose a "considerable risk to Mr Venables's life". Instead, Venables's disembodied voice rang through the courtroom as he said just four words – "guilty" three times, when the charges were read to him, and a "yes" to confirm his name.The last time he was in court was 17 years ago, in 1993. He was charged, along with his primary school friend Robert Thompson with murdering Bulger, who was two, after abducting him in Bootle shopping centre.The pair were remanded to secure children's homes in the north-west, and were released on licence in 2001 under new identities after being deemed suitably rehabilitated.Last night, the Ministry of Justice defended the decision not to recall Venables after the incidents in 2008. A spokeswoman for the ministry said that following the affray, "an additional licence condition of a curfew was added as a precaution". She said that after being caught with cocaine, he was randomly tested for class A drugs. The tests produced negative results.She added: "At one point there were some concerns about JV's level of drinking. This was addressed through focused sessions."Children's rights campaigners suggested the authorities must shoulder some responsibility for Venables being back behind bars.Carolyne Willow, national co-ordinator at the Children's Rights Alliance for England, said: "Clearly, today's sentencing also brings into doubt the effectiveness of any therapeutic interventions that were tried whilst Jon Venables was locked up as a young and growing child."But the ministry was defiant, saying that while a thorough independent review was being carried out into the supervision of Venables from 2001 to 2010, only one person was to blame. "The direct responsibility for these offences must lie with Jon Venables," said a spokeswoman.It was in February this year that Venables was arrested and recalled over child pornography allegations after images were found on his computer in bizarre circumstances. Venables had called his probation officer in a panic after believing someone had discovered his real identity and was told to start packing and be prepared to leave his Cheshire home.Half an hour later, the probation officer found his 27-year-old charge sitting at a desktop computer frantically hacking away at the hard drive with a knife, and then a tin opener. "I'm trying to reformat the hard drive," Venables said, explaining that he wanted to delete personal details.The following day, a police officer from the e-forensics crime unit took away the computer for analysis. If police and probation were already in a quandary over the potential identity breach of one of their most sensitive ex-prisoners, what was found on the hard drive took the situation to a new level.Venables was not a star alumnus of England's juvenile rehabilitation system, having been arrested twice, but there had been nothing to prepare them for discovering the haul of child pornography he had amassed on his computer.Today, when the scale of those offences were laid out in Court 14, it was worse than most people dared imagine. Most troubling of all was the third charge on the indictment, which related to three conversations Venables had with a paedophile over the internet in February 2008.It was during these chats that Venables invented another identity for himself: that of 35-year-old Dawn "Dawnie" Smith, a married woman from Liverpool who boasted about abusing her eight-year-old daughter, together with her husband. Posing as Dawn, Venables struck up a conversation with Leslie Blanchard, a 52-year-old kitchen fitter from Chelmsford, Essex, who had a large stash of child pornography and was keen to star in some of his own.During one discussion on 27 February 2008, Dawn/Venables suggested that for the right price, Blanchard could travel to Liverpool and abuse her daughter. Blanchard, who last October was convicted of possessing child pornography and trying to meet a girl to abuse her, was keen, and handed over his phone number to take negotiations further.Just how did Jon Venables end up behaving in such a manner? Had not Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, said 10 years ago that Venables had "made exceptional progress as a child adolescent serving HMP [detention during her majesty's pleasure] with personal development, acknowledgement of the enormity of his offence, understanding of his actions as a child, and in his 'normal' adolescent development in 'abnormal circumstances'"?In court yesterday, his counsel, Edward Fitzerald, QC, said Venables's highly unusual past had played a part in the nature of his reoffending.Venables was forced into a "wholly abnormal situation" of living under an assumed name amid "constant fear of reprisals," said Fitzgerald. His isolation had led him into a "downward spiral of drink and drugs" and he had become addicted to cocaine and mephedrone, said the barrister.The 27-year-old had managed to work continuously since his release, being paid at around the minimum wage, and working unsocial hours throughout. But he had always been unable to form a close relationship with a woman, as he would have to disclose his true identity as a condition of his licence, said Fitzgerald.All the experts who encountered Venables agreed he was also deeply damaged by his experience in court back in November 1993. Both he and Thompson were just over the age of criminal responsibility, and so could be tried for murder.The authorities took the decision to try the boys in an adult court, calling in the carpenters to Preston crown court to raise the dock so the boys (both under five foot, as their police mug shots, snapped by a height chart, so memorably proved) could see the courtroom. And the judge released their identities, allowing the public to know that Child A was Thompson and Child B Venables.The decision to do so "continues to shame us as a country internationally," said Willow. "Internationally there is real incredulity as to how could the UK, with its advanced legislation dealing with children and families, its advance welfare services, its aggressive rhetoric on children, how could you have responded in this way? It comes up all the time."She added: "[The] sentencing also brings into doubt the effectiveness of any therapeutic interventions that were tried whilst Jon Venables was locked up as a young and growing child."Even the man responsible for designing Venables's reform programme admits now that he always thought the odds were stacked against successful rehabilitation.In 1993, when the boys were arrested, Malcolm Stevens was the home secretary's special adviser on the care and detention of all young people convicted of grave crimes and detained at her majesty's pleasure – the equivalent of a life sentence for juveniles.When they were found guilty, it was his job to strike the delicate balance between punishment and rehabilitation. "I had to put a programme together which had all the elements of education and healthcare and leisure that would normalise – as far as you possibly could – their way of life when they were locked inside a secure institution," Stevens said this week.Though Stevens maintains that Venables did "very well" in the Red Bank secure unit, at Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, he says he never believed the boys could be truly rehabilitated. "I wasn't confident at all. There was no precedent to take children that young, in those sorts of circumstances."The only reference point, he said, was that of Mary Bell, who in 1968 killed two young boys – one the day before her 11th birthday; one two months later. "But whatever was put in place for her was irrelevant by 1993," said Stevens. "I was not optimistic, simply because we know that people who have been brought up in institutions for years and years have a devil's own job to adjust, to resettle … That is very, very difficult. Irrespective of who they were, if you had spent your entire adolescence in an institution, you haven't got the best chance of being able to live on your own in whatever circumstances in the big wide world,."A statement from his solicitor suggested Venables never realised just how hard it would be."It is no excuse at all, but Jon Venables does say now, on reflection, that, not knowing quite what the world he was released into was like, or how it worked, he perhaps didn't fully appreciate the extent to which the passage of time by itself would not blunt his frustrations and unhappiness," said the statement."He says that he appreciates there was no blueprint available to him, or those offering him support – he felt like a canary down a mine. The return to prison was something of a relief when it came. He intends to learn lessons to help him face this challenge again."
