The British double murder suspect Neil Entwistle has been put on suicide watch in a United States jail as he awaits a hearing on allegations that he killed his wife and baby, according to reports.News channel CBS4 said although he was being monitored at the Cambridge courthouse jail in Massachusetts, it was 'not clear' what had prompted the move.Entwistle has pleaded not guilty to two counts of first degree murder, after his wife Rachel and nine-month-old daughter Lillian were found shot dead at the family home in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, in January. He will appear again in court on 15 March.The 27-year-old left the US for his parents' house in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the day after the double killing and shortly before the bodies were discovered in a bed. His father, Clifford, said the family were still deciding whether or not to attend their son's trial.Entwistle's lawyer, Elliot Weinstein, pledged to defend his client 'vigorously, aggressively and successfully', despite raising concern at the possibility of a fair trial, given the publicity that was surrounding the case.
