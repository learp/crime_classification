A man was arrested on Monday in connection with an explosion which caused minor damage in the early hours of the morning at the constituency office of the Conservative MP and planning minister, Nick Boles.The politician, who was not in the office at the time, said he understood that a home-made device had been thrown through a window of the Conservative Hall in Bourne, Lincolnshire.Police said a 24-year-old local man was helping with inquiries and that early indications suggested it is not linked to any wider issues or recent events in the county.Boles, who represents the Grantham and Stamford constituency in Lincolnshire and serves as a planning minister, issued a statement condemning the "act of violence".He said: "The incident is being investigated by the police and I know that everyone will do whatever they can to support the investigation. In the meantime, we should all carry on doing our jobs as normal."Lincolnshire police said officers were called out after 1am to reports of an explosion at the Conservative Association office, where Boles holds constituency surgeries.A police spokesman said: "Officers attended the scene and minor damage had been caused to the building. No one had been hurt."Initial inquiries were carried out and a 24-year-old local man was arrested in connection with the incident."A woman who lives near the scene told the BBC she heard two explosions about 45 minutes apart.She added: "I heard two very loud bangs and on the second one I went to see what it was and found a lot of debris and a window broken."
