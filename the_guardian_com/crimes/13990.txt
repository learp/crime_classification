Detectives investigating the murder of a young bride who was shot dead seven weeks after her wedding yesterday arrested her father in connection with the killing.Terry Rodgers was in custody last night after hundreds of officers spent four days scouring the woods in Nottinghamshire. The body of his daughter, Chanel Taylor, 23, was found with gunshot wounds at her house in Huthwaite in Nottinghamshire, on July 30. "Following today's search, I can confirm that 55-year-old Terence Rodgers, the man wanted for questioning in connection with Chanel Taylor's murder, was arrested at just after 5.30pm this evening," said Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cottee, of Nottinghamshire police. "During a major search operation in the defined area, he was arrested by armed police officers and has been taken to an undisclosed police station in the county where he will be examined by a police surgeon." The arrest comes after a huge search of woodland north of Nottingham, involving some 400 officers yester day and more than 600 over the weekend. It was the largest manhunt in the force's history, involving seven other forces, armed officers, police dogs and horses, and helicopters with heat sensors. Yesterday officers had been focusing on a 3.5-mile area of forest north of Nottingham, near Hucknell, where Mr Rodgers was last sighted more than two weeks ago. Another murder suspect, Robert Boyer, 42, continued to be questioned by police yesterday in connection with the death of Keith Frogson, 62, on July 19. Mr Boyer was arrested after being found in Annesley Woods, also in Nottinghamshire, early on Sunday in a hideout. Last night, Nottinghamshire police thanked the public and fellow officers for their help during the search. "My special thanks go to the police officers and police staff of this force and others," said Superintendent Stuart Wright. "Without their commitment and dedication this operation and in particular the achievement of its objective would not have been possible."
