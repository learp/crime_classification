The main body representing Britain's nurses is to call for the decriminalisation of prostitution, arguing that this would allow healthcare workers to prevent the spread of diseases such as HIV.One of the most controversial resolutions to be discussed next week at the Royal College of Nursing's conference is that prostitutes should work, as they do in the Netherlands, in 'managed zones' rather than in shady red-light areas. An increasing number of women are being brought in by eastern European traffickers to work in virtual slavery. Proponents of legalisation say that by setting up the zones which could be controlled, it would be far easier to clamp down on the traffickers and prevent children being abused. Many nurses are worried about the link between drug abuse and street prostitution. Some 90 per cent of sex workers have a drugs problem. Under British law, it is not illegal to receive money for sex, but a raft of laws make the acts surrounding prostitution illegal, including soliciting, kerb-crawling, and the keeping of a brothel. Cathy Walker, a nurse from the Liverpool branch of the RCN which has put forward the resolution, said: 'We are concerned about the way that prostitution currently operates. We cannot give them safe healthcare or support them. They are left vulnerable to crime, and to infections which of course can affect the entire community.' Several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany have decriminalised prostitution and set up health and safety checks that have reduced the harm, including violence against prostitutes.
