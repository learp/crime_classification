Police have arrested and bailed three teenagers in connection with the murder of a gay barman on Clapham common. The three youths, two aged 17 and one aged 13, were arrested early on Monday in the Battersea area of south London on suspicion of motor offences. They were taken to a police station where they were subsequently questioned in connection with the murder of Jody Dubrowski, 24, who was beaten to death in a homophobic attack last Saturday. Yesterday the police confirmed the three had been released on bail, to return to a police station in November.Riazat Butt
