A new research programme was launched yesterday to study how people become criminals.The Economic and Social Research Council's network for the study of social contexts of pathways in crime, will be based at Cambridge University's institute of criminology, which will receive Â£2.3m over the next five years for the project.Both social and individual characteristics will be assessed.Project leader Professor Per-Oloff Wikstrom said the study would investigate the "holes" in a well-researched area."Too often different approaches - the study of social factors and individual characteristics, for instance - have been dealt with separately in research, and this problem has been reflected in crime prevention initiatives with similar limitations. We need a more joined-up approach, understanding how different factors interact and how these interactions vary in different times and places."Although co-ordinated from Cambridge, the project will involve researchers from Kings College London, Sheffield University, Chicago, Pittsburg and Montreal.While UK researchers will investigate different stages in people's lives, from childhood through adolescents to adulthood, the overseas partners will allow for the research to be compared with factors such as welfare state provision.
