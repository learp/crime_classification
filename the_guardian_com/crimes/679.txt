A plaque honouring the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has been targeted by vandals for a fourth time, police said.A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that officers were alerted shortly after 8am by members of the public. No arrests have been made.In previous years vandals have chipped the memorial and poured paint and flammable liquids on the pavement tribute at the spot where the black 18-year-old was killed in Eltham, south London in April 1993. At the time of his death Stephen was studying English, design and technology, craft and physics and was hoping to become an architect.There was no immediate reaction to the vandalism from either of Stephen's parents, who were at the Old Bailey last week for the pre-trial hearing of two men accused of his murder.Later, police confirmed that the vandal was caught on CCTV smashing a bottle over the memorial plaque while walking alongside a woman with a pushchair.Police released the footage in an effort to trace the man and woman.Images released by Scotland Yard showed a man in white shorts, white trainers and a blue sleeveless shirt accompanied by a blonde woman pushing a stroller with a child in it.Detective Sergeant James Bray said: "Anyone with information concerning the incident or who recognises this man and woman are asked to come forward and assist us with their inquiries."Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, deny murdering Stephen in a racist attack in April 1993. Dobson and Norris, both from south London, go on trial on 14 November. Witnesses are asked to call Plumstead CID on 020 8284 9554 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.Six years after Stephen Lawrence's murder, an inquiry headed by Sir William Macpherson examined the original police investigation and concluded that the force was "institutionally racist". The Macpherson report has been called "one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain".
