We remain convinced that there are people who have yet to contact us, who know what happened and are protecting those responsible. It is those people we would appeal to to come forward."Five people from Colchester are on police bail after they were also arrested in connection with the murder in Marlowe Way, Lexden.Since her son's death, Jay's mother, Caroline Shearer, has launched a campaign to fight knife crime.She has opened a charity shop in Colchester to raise funds for her campaign Only Cowards Carry, and has called for "weapons awareness" to be taught in schools."It's no good teaching them these lessons once these children have found out what path they want to take in life," she said."The younger the child you can get to, the more chance you've got of changing the mindset of why our children are carrying knives."
