A man who murdered his wife in an unprovoked attack in front of their children was jailed for life today.Nabeel Khan strangled Dr Iffat Kamal, 39, during an argument on 10 December last year in Dundee. The pathologist died 10 days later in the city's Ninewells hospital, where she had worked.At the high court in Edinburgh, Khan, 45, was ordered to spend at least 15 years in prison.Khan, who had admitted the lesser charge of culpable homicide, was convicted at the high court in Perth on 4 August of murdering his wife by seizing her throat, compressing it and restricting her breathing until she was unconscious.The court heard the couple's two children were in the house at the time.Khan told police officers that he slapped his wife and had his arm around her neck during a fight. He said he had little recollection of what followed but that his "senses came back" when he realised she was not moving and called an ambulance.The court heard he had a gambling habit and had lost Â£17,000 in spread betting.Sentencing, judge Lord Hardie said allegations Khan had made about his wife's drinking were "no more than an attempt to discredit her". He added: "In my view, this was an unprovoked, persistent attack upon your wife, who was smaller, lighter and weaker physically than you."The judge said he would recommend Khan be deported upon his release.
