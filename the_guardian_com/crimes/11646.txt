The murder rate in England and Wales fell by 14% to 550 homicides in 2011-12 – the lowest level since 1983.Recorded crime also fell by 4%, continuing the long downward trend in crime since 1995, and dropping below 4m offences for the first time in 23 years.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said violent crime had fallen by 7%, including a 2% fall in robberies.However, the annual crime figures show a 2% rise in some types of property crime, especially in unattended personal property, such as garden sheds, pickpocketing and thefts of commercial materials, particularly metal. But the widespread crimes of burglary, car break-ins and thefts have continued to fall.The crime survey for England and Wales (CSEW) – the name of which was changed from the British Crime Survey in recognition that it no longer includes Scotland – showed no change in overall crime levels against adults, continuing the same stable picture for the past three years.The 14% fall in the murder rate last year reflects a sustained fall since it peaked in 2002-03, when 1,047 killings were recorded, including the 172 attributed to Dr Harold Shipman.The policing minister, Nick Herbert, said the police should be congratulated for continuing to drive down crime: "Today's figures show that despite the challenge of reducing police budgets, crime has continued to fall. They give the lie to the spurious claim that there is a simple link between overall police numbers and the crime rate."The continued fall in the crime rate appears to defy widespread predictions that the economic recession, combined with a 20% cut to police budgets, would lead to increases in crime and antisocial behaviour.The long, sustained fall in the level of domestic violence as measured by the crime survey since 1995, from more than 1m incidents a year to fewer than 400,000, is the most likely explanation of what is driving the fall in the murder rate.John Flatley, the ONS head of crime statistics, said two-thirds of murders involved partners or former partners or other kinds of family killing. He said he was sceptical of the alternative explanation that advances in medical science, including more effective treatment by surgeons of victims of stab wounds, was the main factor behind the fall, pointing to the fact that attempted murders were falling at a similar rate and were down 8% over the past year.The official statisticians say the number of murders rose from around 300 a year in the early 1960s to an annual death toll of more than 800 a year in the early years of this century. They say the remarkable fall in the murder rate – which has almost halved in the past nine years – reflects the overall decline in levels of violence and are mirrored by similar falls across Europe and North America.The fall in the murder rate is echoed in knife and gun crime. There were 30,999 offences recorded by the police involving a knife or sharp instrument in 2012-13 – a fall of 5%, and firearm offences fell 16% to 5,911, of which 39 resulted in a death.Flatley said the sharp rise in crime which followed the 1980s recession led many commentators to expect that the current economic downturn would lead to similar increases in some types of crime, particularly domestic burglary and car thefts.But he said such "acquisitive" crimes continued to show a flat or downward trend. Police figures show domestic burglaries fell by 5% last year and car crime went down 7%, helped by further improvements in home and car security. It is now far more difficult to remove a CD player or radio from a car, and resale values have plummeted.However, the picture was slightly mixed, with significant rises recorded in the last two years in metal thefts triggered by soaring commodity prices; pickpocketing and thefts of mobile phones and wallets left unattended; and thefts from garages and sheds, including tools and garden furniture.The last category rose by 10% to 1,371,000 incidents last year, suggesting that home security has improved to the point where opportunistic thieves are no longer attempting to break into homes.The downward trend in police recorded crime has been matched by a fall in the volume of incidents of antisocial behaviour, according to the crime survey, with half a million fewer incidents reported last year. The official figures show that 15% of respondents believe they live in an area with a high level of antisocial behaviour.
