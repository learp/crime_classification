Two burglars shot by a homeowner who was later arrested have both been jailed for four years.Joshua O'Gorman and Daniel Mansell, who have a string of previous convictions between them, pleaded guilty to the break-in at the home of Andy Ferrie in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, in the early hours of 2 September.Mansell, 33, and O'Gorman, 27, both from Leicester, were injured during the confrontation in the remote cottage after being caught red-handed.Ferrie, 35, and his wife Tracey, 43, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after he called police to tell them he had fired his shotgun at the intruders.The couple were later bailed and told they would not face criminal charges.The burglars were jailed at Leicester crown court on Wednesday.Sentencing the pair, Judge Michael Pert QC told them the injuries they suffered when Ferrie opened fire – O'Gorman was shot in the face and Mansell was hit in his right hand – were not included, in his opinion, as part of their sentence or defence.He said: "I make it plain that, in my judgment, being shot is not mitigation."If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take."You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it."Mansell and O'Gorman, both of whom have no fixed address, appeared in the dock wearing grey sweatshirts and showed little emotion as the judge spoke.The scar from the gunshot wound was clearly visible on the right side of O'Gorman's face and Mansell had his arm in a sling.Prosecutor Alan Murphy told the court that Mansell was released from prison in May last year after serving part of a six-year sentence for wounding with intent. In total, his criminal record consisted of eight previous convictions involving 19 offences.O'Gorman had 16 previous convictions involving 27 offences, many for dishonesty and driving offences.
