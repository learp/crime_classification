Sean Mercer has committed the most brutal and wicked act in killing Rhys Jones and it's right he should be punished. His photograph on your front page (17 December) is headlined "Face of a killer". Violent and aggressive though Mercer is, he is a boy who killed, not part of a criminal caste of killers, different from the rest of us. Young people, ensnared in the violence of gang culture, together with their victims and the communities in which they live, are part of the same tragedy. Understanding the causes, then acting to remedy them, is the only way to solve the problem. We know that popular but often ill-considered methods do not work. Shallow, red-top-style headlines only reinforce shallower responses to a profoundly tragic set of circumstances. The Guardian usually knows better.Douglas StewartLittlehampton, West SussexYour headline both glamorises this damaged young man who committed an awful crime and also dismisses him as nothing other than a murderer. The truth, of course, is that he is a dangerous, vulnerable, complicated, broken teenager who is a product of our society. We have allowed gang culture to develop and the end result is the death and destruction of our children by our children. We must not turn away from the work we must do to save children like Rhys Jones and Sean Mercer - and so many others.Carolyn ReidLondonI was born and brought up in Norris Green, my parents lived there all their married life and I saw the way the estate was allowed to deteriorate. I have the deepest sympathy for Rhys Jones's family and cannot begin to imagine what they have suffered. But your picture and headline seems to me a trite and sensationalist response to a human tragedy.Jeff DeanWest Rainton, Durham
