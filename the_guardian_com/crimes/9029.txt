Computer software which monitors sex offenders while they surf the internet is being tested by the Government to see if it can be used to reduce levels of reoffending.The program was developed to help parents prevent children from gaining access to sexually explicit material online, but has been adapted amid increasing concerns over safety in cyberspace. The software monitors the computer screen and compares its contents with a database of 'trigger' words and banned websites. It also checks for phrases commonly used by paedophiles trying to approach children online - such as 'do your parents use this computer?' and 'I won't hurt you' - and peruses emails and instant messages. In the event of a match, the program sends an email alerting the offender's probation officer. The system can also be tailored to spot specific names or addresses if an offender is believed to be targeting a particular child. Details of suspicious activity are stored on a computer's hard drive and can be used to provide evidence. The program also contains features which prevent paedophiles communicating online or swapping sexually explicit words and images. A Home Office spokesman said that the project to assess the software was one of several aimed at closer monitoring of sex offenders in the community. The trials follow the Government's refusal to introduce new legislation allowing people to find out if convicted paedophiles are living in their area. A pilot scheme using the software in the US has been so successful that all convicted offenders with computers are now required to have it installed as a condition of parole. The program is designed to run 'behind' other software, giving no sign to the offender that he is being monitored. 'The idea is to stop the problem at its source,' says Dan Jude of Security Software, which makes the Cyber Sentinel program. 'The software can be customised to detect any level of prohibited activity.'
