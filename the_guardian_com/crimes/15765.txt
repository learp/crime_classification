The home secretary, John Reid, was tonight forced to admit he knew nothing about a Home Office blunder which may have allowed criminals who committed serious crimes abroad to escape vetting procedures in the UK.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) disclosed that information on convictions was left "sitting in desk files" in the Home Office rather than being properly examined.The cases included 25 Britons convicted of rape in other European countries whose details were not entered into the police national computer (PNC).More than 500 serious offenders are being checked by the Criminal Records Bureau - which vets people who want to work with children - to see if any have applied for jobs in Britain, it emerged.A Home Office spokeswoman said Mr Reid and other ministers were unaware of the "backlog" until today.She described it as a "revelation".Permanent secretary Sir David Normington has ordered a "full and immediate inquiry" into the circumstances and Mr Reid had "summoned" senior police officers, she added. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, pledged to raise the issue urgently in parliament, while the shadow home secretary, David Davis, described the oversight as "disgraceful".Acpo spokesman and Hampshire Chief Constable Paul Kernaghan told MPs the Home Office's processing system had been "totally unacceptable".The Commons all-party home affairs select committee heard a new system was set up last May to rectify the situation, which involved more than 27,500 case files.Mr Kernaghan said: "Until the Acpo criminal records office was created, someone could go to Germany, commit a sexual offence and serve a sentence - and this would not be known to any police officer when they came back to the UK."It would not be known to the courts in the UK if they re-offended."That is a totally unacceptable position professionally and in terms of public protection."He added: "The information was sitting in desk files and not entered on the PNC."That is now being addressed and they are working their way through, putting serious offenders on a risk-assessed basis on the PNC." A pool of 27,529 documents were found to contain details of British nationals convicted abroad, including:· 25 rapists and three people convicted of attempted rape;  · 29 paedophiles, plus another 17 other sex offenders;  · Five murderers; · Nine convicted of attempted murder and 13 of manslaughter; · 29 robbers.An Acpo document said: "The majority of these serious foreign convictions of UK nationals were not on the PNC and we have no DNA, fingerprints or photographs."None of the 25 UK nationals convicted of rape had been made subject of the sex offenders register."It went on: "If these particular offenders had been subject of checks for employment through the CRB, the search would have returned a 'no trace'."Arrangements have been made to have a list of 525 serious offenders checked against the CRB system to establish if any have applied for employment within the UK." The Home Office spokeswoman said: "This fact was not made public earlier because to the best of our knowledge this matter was not brought to the attention of the home secretary or his ministers until today, otherwise it would have been highlighted when he listed the reasons why the department's systems and procedures were not fit for purpose.""This is a serious issue that is now being remedied. It concerns a backlog of notifications of crimes committed by UK citizens abroad that relate to the period up to early 2006."As the police made clear, the case files of all serious offenders in the backlog have been entered onto the PNC."She added: "The permanent secretary has instigated a full and immediate inquiry."The home secretary has summoned Acpo and the Criminal Records Bureau so he can satisfy himself that the public protection issues raised by this revelation are being properly addressed."Mr Clegg said: "This blunder not only exposes this government's administrative incompetence, it puts the British public at greater risk from these offenders."Once again, Home Office ineptitude has left the police and the public in the lurch." He added: "I dread to think what other scandals are lurking in the Home Office filing cabinets if 27,000 documents detailing such vital information can be simply left sitting on someone's desk."We need to know from the home secretary what progress is being made on checking the files for these 525 serious offenders."I will be raising this issue urgently in parliament."Mr Davis said: "Of itself this is disgraceful but it is by no means the first of the government's systems which have had major failures in the past few years."And this from a government that wants ID cards to be a solution to terrorism, illegal immigration and identity theft."The Home Office has got to learn to walk before it can run, to get the basics right."The information from 15 countries, mainly states in the EU, had previously been received by the Home Office's UK central authority for mutual legal assistance, said Acpo.Its responsibilities were transferred to Acpo on May 21 last year, when it set up the new UK central authority for the exchange of criminal records.
