A pub doorman who spiked a young woman's drink with a "date rape" drug was sentenced to five years in prison yesterday, in the country's first custodial sentence for the offence.Michael Wright was told by a judge that a "substantial deterrent" was needed to warn others against attempting the same unpleasant and dangerous action.The sentence was welcomed by campaigners, who are concerned that cases of spiking which do not lead to assault are difficult to prosecute.Graham Rhodes, of the Roofie Foundation, Britain's only specialised agency dealing with spiking, said: "Northumbria police have done incredibly well to get such a case through the courts and secure a conviction."This sends out a wonderfully welcome message that this sort of activity is not fun. It is a serious issue and is being treated as such by the judiciary."Wright denied spiking the woman's drink but was convicted by a jury at Newcastle crown court this week after a three-day trial.The court heard that he had tipped the chemical GHB from a water bottle into his victim's drink, saying it was vodka.The woman, who is in her 20s, was out with friends at The Gate centre in Newcastle when she met Wright, who is not a registered doorman but worked on a freelance basis at local pubs.She knew him slightly and accepted two vodka and Cokes from him, before he added the drug.Soon afterwards she collapsed and was taken to hospital unconscious. She was kept in overnight but has since recovered.Wright was convicted of administering the drug "with the intention of stupefying or overpowering her to enable himself or another to engage in sexual activity with her".The recorder of Newcastle, Ben Nolan, told him yesterday: "There must be a substantial prison sentence which must contain a deterrent element to demonstrate to those who are also minded to use this substance to pursue sexual advantage."Wright was also banned from working as a doorman for 10 years and required to register as a sex offender for life.Mr Rhodes said the Roofie Foundation received about 10,000 calls in the last year, but only six have led to prosecutions. The group's data suggests that about a third of incidents have sexual motives, with the others related to theft or attempts to humiliate or poke fun at victims.Date-rape attacks are of increasing concern to police, particularly in cities such as Newcastle which have large student populations.Universities now organise annual campaigns to encourage young people to buy their drinks in bottles and to keep their thumbs over the top to prevent spiking.A spokesman for the Home Office said Wright, of Newbiggin Hall near Newcastle, was the first person to be convicted of spiking which did not lead to rape or other crimes.Police are concerned at a relaxed attitude, especially among young drinkers, which encourages the view that spiking is harmless fun rather than a serious offence which can have long-lasting health consequences.Even in cases where victims are taken to hospital and avoid sexual abuse or theft there can be medical after-effects. Wright's victim is still being monitored by doctors.
