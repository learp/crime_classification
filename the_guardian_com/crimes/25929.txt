The historic Crumlin Road courthouse in Belfast has been extensively damaged in a suspected arson attack. The court, which closed for business in 1998, has been targeted before, the last time in March this year.The fire and rescue service said that a large amount of damage had been caused throughout the listed building by the blaze, which they fought for seven hours. Michael Graham, of the fire and rescue service, said: "We believe the fire was started deliberately. There is a large amount of damage right through the property. The vast majority of the centre section of the roof is completely burned away."The police service said they too suspected the fire was started deliberately, but because of concerns over the safety of the building engineers had been called in to carry out an examination before anyone searched to confirmÂ arson.
