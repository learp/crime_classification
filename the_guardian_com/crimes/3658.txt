A former police authority chairman who defied David Blunkett over sacking a chief constable after the Soham murders has been charged with 14 counts of indecent assault on children.Colin Inglis, 48, who was also leader of Hull city council until May, will appear at the city's magistrates' court today.He has always denied allegations of child abuse dating back to the 1980s when he was a care worker at a children's home in Hull. Mr Inglis is gay and has described the allegations as part of the price he has had to pay for being open about his sexuality while taking part in public life.Mr Inglis refused an order from Mr Blunkett, then home secretary, to sack the chief constable of Humberside, David Westwood, after severe criticism of the force by the Bichard inquiry into the mishandling of the Soham investigation. Humberside failed to keep records which might have prevented the appointment of double child killer Ian Huntley as a school caretaker.Mr Westwood denied blame but eventually retired early.
