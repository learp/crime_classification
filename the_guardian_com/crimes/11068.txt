The mother of missing nine-year-old schoolgirl Shannon Matthews today said she believes her daughter was abducted by someone she knows.With tears welling in her eyes, Karen Matthews said: "I think it is someone who knows Shannon and knows me too. The family don't feel safe any more - it has broken the family apart. It makes me think I cannot trust anyone close to me."Ms Matthews was speaking at a press conference where it was revealed that detectives are now carrying out criminal record checks on all of Shannon's close and extended family.Hundreds of people including police officers, friends and local residents have joined together in the hunt for the missing girl, but there have been no sightings of her since she left school half a mile from her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire, on February 19.At today's press conference, Matthews praised police for the thoroughness of their investigation even though it involved trawling through the personal records of her own family."Whatever the police need to do to find Shannon, they can go ahead and do it," she said before revealing that she has cried herself to sleep every night since her daughter's disappearance.It is thought that Shannon may have been trying to make her way to her father's home, 10 miles away.Speaking at the same press conference, her father, Leon Rose, who lives near Huddersfield with Shannon's 10-year-old brother, Ian, said that going home empty-handed after days of fruitless searching "beats me up"."Every time I come home he [Ian] sees it in my face that I haven't been successful and he picks up on that. It beats me up. I can only reassure him that we will find her."I don't want my last memory of Shannon to be a photo. That's the worst thing that could happen," Mr Rose said.
