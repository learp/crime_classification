Thieves stole a 77-year-old man's bicycle after he fell off it while suffering a heart attack on a busy road.Leonard Smart's life was saved when an off-duty nurse intervened to give him CPR after he suffered the attack. He was taken to hospital but later his family went to recover his bicycle only to find it had been stolen.Smart's son, Dave, 52, said: "It is unbelievable. I had a good look around for it and it was gone – somebody must have taken it, that's the only explanation."Whether they knew what had happened to my father or not – I don't know. But they stole it nonetheless. He used to cycle everywhere – going into town most days. The bike was of no particular value, but that is not really the point."Smart is now stable at Gloucestershire Royal hospital. His family are appealing for the bicycle to be returned and asking for the woman who helped save Smart to come forward so she can be thanked.Last week it emerged that another cyclist, Sam Swain, had travelled 10,000 miles across Europe and Asia only to have his bicycle stolen after he locked it to a rack outside a restaurant in Bristol.
