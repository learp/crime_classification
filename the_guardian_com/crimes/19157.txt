A man is his 50s was arrested yesterday for attempted murder and criminal damage after he went on a rampage with a mechanical digger, destroying a house, a police car and two luxury vehicles, writes Jacqueline Maley. The man was a resident at the Eastlands Meadows caravan park at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex, where he was reportedly involved in a dispute over rent. Janice Gledhill, 52, who runs the caravan park with her partner of 30 years, James Harvard, 47, awoke at about 7am yesterday to find the man charging into their house with the bright orange digger.She fled and called the police as the man went on to destroy two cars - one of them a new Bentley - parked outside the house, which is situated on the grounds of the caravan site. When a police car arrived, he ploughed into that too. Mr Harvard said his partner was lucky to be alive: "He started wrecking the place with her inside it."Ms Gledhill said the man had bought a caravan from them last year for Â£36,000. He had been renting a pitch at Eastlands Meadows but had fallen behind with his payments. They had written to him asking him to pay up and he had cleared out the caravan. "He told the police he'd come for his money but we really don't know what he means because he owes us money," she said.The arrested man, who suffers from a number of physical health problems, was taken to Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford.
