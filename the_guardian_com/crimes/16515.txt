Jurors trying two police officers with the rape and indecent assault of a young mother were today discharged after they failed to reach verdicts.The jury of three women and nine men had spent 16 hours and 56 minutes deliberating the case against Surrey police officers Mark Witcher and Andrew Lang at Winchester crown court.Mr Justice Gray asked the jury foreman if there was a chance that at least 10 of them could reach a verdict. She replied: "It would appear not, my Lord. We have been trying this all morning." The judge then thanked them for their time and discharged them.Richard Onslow, prosecuting, told the court a retrial would be "almost certain".Mr Witcher, 30, of Portsmouth, Hants, and Mr Lang, also 30, of Whitehill, Hants, were convicted yesterday of three charges each of misconduct in public office.The jury also found them guilty of failing to report an offence and falsely stating they were involved in a police search.They had denied all the charges, which related to an alleged incident with a 23-year-old at her home in Godalming, Surrey. The men were charged following the alleged incident while they were on duty on September 20 last year.The policemen had taken the woman home after she'd been a victim of an assault outside a nightclub in Godalming.Mr Justice Gray told the court the men would be sentenced after the next trial. Surrey police said appropriate disciplinary procedures would be taken against the officers.
