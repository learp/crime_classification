A gunman chased a man into a crowded restaurant in north-west London last night, shooting him in the leg in front of frightened diners. Customers at Harry Morgan in St John's Wood threw themselves to the floor as the gunman opened fire on his victim. Police said the injured man was not thought to be in a life-threatening condition. One eyewitness, Billy Osbourne, told the BBC: "This man ran through. Then all of a sudden a guy in a motorbike helmet came in. He had two automatic pistols and he starts firing at the guy. Everyone was screaming and hitting the deck."
