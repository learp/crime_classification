Detectives investigating the murder of a teenager who was shot as he walked to his grandmother's house have released a picture of a man they want to question.Khadar Hussein, 19, died after he was shot in the head in Penge, south-east London, on 8 May.He was taken to King's College hospital but was pronounced dead the following morning.Police are now looking for Trai Williamson, 19, who was last seen on the day of the murder and is known to spend time in south-east London, particularly in Penge and Anerley, but could be elsewhere. He is black, around 5ft 9in, and is slim with short hair.Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor said: "We are taking the unusual step of publicising Trai Williamson's name and image as it is critical he is found as soon as possible."The likelihood that he is being sheltered by someone in the hope that he remains out of sight is one line of inquiry that we are pursuing. I would appeal to anyone who may have accommodated Williamson or is helping him at present, to look to their conscience and do the right thing and inform the police of his whereabouts."Any information that is provided will be treated in the strictest of confidence and I urge anyone with any information, no matter how small, to let us know."Hussein's sister Hannah told the Evening Standard that the family could not understand why he had been targeted.She said: "He was not a violent person, so everyone is confused why someone would do this and take a life at such a young age."He was at home most of the time looking after the family, or at my nan's. He used to go over there because she would get lonely on her own. He was always checking on her."We're all just upset and heartbroken."Members of the public are being advised not to approach Williamson and instead to call 999. Anyone with information can call the incident room on 020 8721 4868 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.Police are offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of Hussein's killers.
