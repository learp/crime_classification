The high court today overturned an inquest jury's finding of unlawful killing after a black man with mental health problems died in police custody.Eight Metropolitan police officers had asked the high court judges to overturn the unanimous verdict of a jury at an inquest into Roger Sylvester's death.Mr Justice Collins found that inner London north coroner, Dr Andrew Reid's, summing up was inadequate and the jury's reasoning at last year's inquest was flawed.Mr Sylvester, was 30 when he died nearly six years ago, after being handcuffed and restrained for 20 minutes by officers who arrested him at his Tottenham home under the Mental Health Act.The jury found that Mr Sylvester had died from brain damage and cardiac arrest triggered and exacerbated by breathing problems that occurred while he was being restrained, and by cannabis-induced delirium.Seven of the police officers, who had been suspended, were reinstated earlier this month when it became clear the high court would overturn the inquest verdict.After the high court ruling, Mr Sylvester's brother Bernard Renwick said the family was withdrawing from the legal process "with a bitter taste in our mouth". He said: "We have followed the due legal process in this criminal justice system for almost six years, and feel it is now time to opt out of this procedure. "From day one we were told to expect openness, accountability and transparency. We merely wanted truth and where necessary, justice. "Instead we have had obstacles, delays, anguish, smoke and mirrors and 'just-ice'. Where is the justice?" But he added the Crown Prosecution Service was now to reconsider the case, and could still decide to prosecute the officers. Mr Sylvester's 70-year-old mother, Sheila Sylvester, said: "God is the ultimate judge." Speaking of the officers she said: "I don't know how they sleep. I am sure they cannot sleep properly for the wicked things done to Roger."
