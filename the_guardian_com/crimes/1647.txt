There have been many worthy suggestions on how to fix our supposedly broken society. May I offer another that is cheap, available to all and unlikely to do harm? A campaign to promote and reinforce the levels of common courtesy and kindness with which we treat others. To do this, people will need to engage with others and think about the effects of their behaviour on others. We can all do this! Every act of courtesy and kindness intended to make other people's lives easier and nicer (not formulaic "manners"), however small, will increase the fund of positivity around us. Little things, like opening a door for others if you get there first or saying "please" and "thank you" (I always like to thank bus drivers as I alight), make me and others feel better. Who knows, having felt better for my act, the other person may replicate it. Win, win! This could be particularly valuable when driving, such as letting other drivers pull out, or not using up more than your allotted space when you park.It would not have to be legislated for or imposed, merely encouraged. The best way of promoting courtesy and kindness is to lead by example. No one should be exempt – we will all be responsible for promoting this. It would, of course, be vital that we promote this behaviour in children by treating them with courtesy and kindness. And I'm sorry, but behaviour that is, often in a derogatory fashion, called "politically correct" is about common courtesy, about not knowingly giving offence to others. To kick this off, I propose we all attempt a "five-a-day" campaign – to try each day to do at least five acts of courtesy and kindness, however small, that we might not otherwise have done. I will start today.Sally PlumbSmethwick, West Midlands
