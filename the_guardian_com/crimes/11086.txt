A Briton who spent more than 20 years on death row in the US has been cleared of violently assaulting and robbing an elderly man over a £200 debt to a pub landlord.Kenny Richey, from Edinburgh, was cleared of two attacks on Robert McCall, 64, today, when the prosecution dropped all the charges after a witness changed his story.Richey, who spent two decades campaigning against his death sentence for a fatal arson attack in Ohio, had been accused of twice assaulting McCall ‑ once with a baton ‑ stealing money and then inducing someone else to wash his bloodstained clothing.But the case against him fell apart after Brian Mataszcztk, a friend of Richey's, told the high court in Paisley on Wednesday that Richey had only been joking when he originally claimed to have carried out the attack.Derek Ogg QC, prosecuting, said this meant Mataszcztk's evidence could not be seen as "credible or reliable", leaving him just with McCall's uncorroborated testimony. It is a Scottish legal tradition that someone cannot be convicted on uncorroborated evidence from a single source, Ogg said.McCall admitted to the jury that he owed the pub's manager £200, which he had been given to buy cigarettes in Spain. He had missed his flight, and instead squandered the money at a bookmakers.The pub manager then told McCall he had "taken a contract out" on him and McCall alleged that Richey, a former US marine, visited him twice last July, demanding money for the unpaid debt. Initially, Richey allegedly stole money and a mobile phone with another man.When he was attacked the second time, McCall admitted he could not identify his attacker's face because it was covered in a black scarf, but insisted he knew it was Richey because of his voice and eyes. The two men drank in the same pub."The door went knock. I opened the door and there was Richey," he told the court. "It all happened so quickly. He just started hitting me with this baton."I was hit over the head, shoulder, wrist. I tried to protect myself and put my arms up and I managed to get up and run to the top of the stairs."Richey is due to be sentenced tomorrow for another offence after he admitted a breach of the peace at Edinburgh sheriff court last August, where he had shouted, swore and threatened the prosecutor during a pre-trial hearing.Richey, who has four previous convictions for minor offences in Scotland more than 26 years ago, was convicted of killing a two-year-old girl after starting a fire in her house in Ohio in 1986.He walked free in 2007 after striking a deal with prosecutors and returned back to his native Edinburgh.
