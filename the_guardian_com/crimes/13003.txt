Two men who spent more than 12 years in jail for a murder they did not commit must pay the "living expenses" they incurred in prison from their compensation, the court of appeal ruled yesterday.By a four-one majority, five law lords upheld the deduction from the Home Office compensation awarded to cousins Vincent and Michael Hickey for their wrongful conviction in 1979 for the murder of newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater.In the first case of its kind to go to court, the pair argued that it was wrong in principle to charge what was, in effect, board and lodging during their unjustified incarceration. But the ruling against them by the House of Lords enshrines in law the practice by Home Office-appointed independent assessors of deducting living expenses from the part of the award covering lost earnings. The Hickeys' solicitor, Susie Labinjoh of Hodge, Jones & Allen, said they were "devastated". "To deduct saved living expenses from their compensation offends against justice. We had all hoped their lordships would right this wrong."There is no appeal against the country's highest court, and no obvious case for the European court of human rights.The dissenting judge, Lord Rodger, likened the men's incarceration to a "prolonged kidnapping". But the majority ruled that they would have had to pay for accommodation and food had they been outside in the working world. They said the 25% deduction from lost earnings - amounting to a cut of £51,036 for Vincent Hickey and £46,215 for his cousin - should not be seen as board and lodging, but as expenses they would have had to pay from their earnings if they had been able to work.
