Ministers are to give the police and local authorities powers to create "alcohol-free zones" through the wholesale withdrawal of licences from pubs and clubs in city-centre problem areas.The tougher enforcement regime to tackle the worst hotspots of binge drinking was disclosed as police pressed for a compulsory levy on pubs and clubs in order to pay for the extra costs of dealing with disorder.Home Office research published yesterday showed that concerns about "24-hour drinking" voiced two years ago when the change in the licensing laws was introduced have not materialised. But the change in opening hours has not led to a significant reduction in crime and disorder. The overall disorder level remains the same but with a small proportion of violent crime displaced to the early hours of the morning."The main conclusion to be drawn from the evaluation is that licensing regimes may be one factor in effecting change to the country's drinking culture, and its impact on crime, but they do not appear to be the critical factor. The key issue is how they interact with other factors," said the Home Office report.The research also shows that "24-hour drinking" may be a misnomer, with the average pub closing time being pushed back by just 21 minutes from 11pm. Only 470 pubs, clubs and nightclubs out of 200,000 across the country have applied for 24-hour licences, and only a handful operate on that basis.There has only been a small increase in opening hours, with half of all pubs only applying to stay open to midnight. Most do not even do that, with the Home Office research showing that 56% still close at 11pm on a typical Saturday night, and most of the rest only open half an hour longer. The extra hours are not routinely being used, with 87% of pubs using them only at the weekend.Most pubs reported no great increase in trade or profits as a result of later opening, and said that although customers stayed out later, they did not necessarily buy more drinks over the period. Many said that people were going out later, with the busy drinking period starting at 10pm rather than 8pm, and drinking later into the night. Drinkers surveyed said that rapid drinking close to last orders had fallen since the licensing changes.A Home Office survey of 30 police forces shows that over a 24-hour period there had been a slight fall (down 1%) in drink-related crime, but a slight rise (up 1%) between 6pm and 6am as a result of the change in opening hours. But there was a 22% increase in the volume of crime - equal to 10,235 offences - in the early hours between 3am and 6am, mostly displaced from earlier in the night.The lack of impact on crime and disorder levels was also reflected in people's perceptions about how safe it is to visit town centres at night, with the proportion of those saying they felt a bit or very unsafe remaining at the same level before and after the changes, at 16%.Home Office case studies looking at five cities and towns confirmed the shift forward in the timing of most violent crime but wide variations in the overall crime and disorder picture. "Croydon and Blackpool saw falls of 13% and 10% respectively, Guildford, Birmingham and Nottingham saw increases of 12%, 7% and 3%," the research reported.The "spike" of incidents immediately after closing time flattened out in Birmingham and Blackpool but there was no change in Croydon and Nottingham. In Guildford, the peak moved to the early hours.The Home Office research team said that there was considerable evidence to support the idea that extended opening hours have produced only limited changes to drinking patterns. "Many licences were extended on the basis that it was better to be safe than sorry, and, in practice, they were not exploited to the full. In areas serving as focal points for late-night economies, saturation policies dampened down the extent of the change."The culture secretary, Andy Burnham, described the results as a "mixed picture" and promised new legislation if necessary to tackle the "small but unacceptable" amount of violence in the small hours.But he also promised immediate action using existing powers to identify problem premises and impose tougher sanctions on those who breach their licence conditions, including use of instant closure powers.Ministers will also support the police and local authorities in identifying hotspots for drink-fuelled crime by ranking them geographically, and by concentrating on the risks premises pose to crime and disorder and public nuisance. "This will allow licensing authorities the ability to exercise ... the wholesale withdrawal of licenses in these areas," said Burnham.He confirmed that a new "yellow card, red card" alert system is to be used against rowdy pubs, with maximum fines for drinking in the street in areas where it is banned increased from £500 to £2,500.The Association of Chief Police Officers called for a compulsory levy on pubs and clubs to pay the extra costs of policing the streets in the early hours of the morning. "As more violence and disorder is now taking place late at night, police forces have had to move officers from day and evening shifts to night shifts, which clearly has an impact on our ability to maintain our service to the public," said Chris Ellison of the Metropolitan police.A Home Office spokesman said that the introduction of "alcohol disorder zones" this summer, in areas where pubs and clubs required extra policing, will include the power to impose a compulsory levy.Political reaction to the government's package was sceptical with the Conservatives claiming Gordon Brown was "in denial" about the problems caused by "24-hour drinking", and the Liberal Democrats pointing out that the licensing legislation had failed to reduce binge drinking or sales of alcohol to minors.
