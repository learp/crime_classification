A new generation of 10,000 magistrates should be recruited to dispense summary justice inside police stations to speed up the criminal justice system, a leading centre-right thinktank has urged.A Policy Exchange report, Future Courts, says a new volunteer army of magistrates should be put in charge of "out-of-court" disposals, such as simple police cautions, at peak times including evenings and weekends as part of a radical drive to deliver swifter justice.The thinktank, which championed policy initiatives such as police and crime commissioners, says there is a two-month delay from the time an offender is charged to when they are sentenced in a magistrates court.The rapid growth in police powers to hand out punishments in the form of cautions and on-the-spot fines means that they now account for 20% of all criminal cases.Policy Exchange says that public concern over this development should be met by an expansion in the number of magistrates from 23,000 to 33,000.But it says that with the 230 magistrates' courts in England and Wales outnumbering the 160 NHS accident and emergency departments and facing a 37% budget cut by 2016, other ways must be found to expand their role.The Policy Exchange paper suggests that the new generation of magistrates would sit in police stations and other community buildings to oversee out-of-court disposals, review offenders' sentences on an ongoing basis, and they could spend a third of their time involved in voluntary community engagement work.Ensuring these new summary justice courts sit at weekends and in the evenings would encourage younger, more ethnically diverse and professional people to become magistrates.A specialist group of 500 "problem solving" magistrates could also be trained to deal with people with drugs and alcohol addiction.Max Chambers, author of the report and head of crime and justice at Policy Exchange, said: "There is no good reason for our criminal justice system to operate in such a leisurely fashion. Police courts would mean much swifter justice for low-level crime, reflecting the fact that if a punishment is to be meaningful and actually change behaviour, it has to be delivered very quickly. Putting magistrates in police stations will also bring much greater oversight to the use of cautions, about which there has been legitimate public concern.""As budgets are reduced dramatically, the courts system will inevitably have to change. Fewer buildings will be part of the solution, but government must take care to protect the local justice landscape, underpinned by volunteer magistrates, that has served us so well for hundreds of years," he added.The justice minister, Damian Green, said magistrates were the cornerstone of the justice system: "Their local knowledge and unique skills make them an extremely valuable part of our judicial process.We are already looking at the role of magistrates and starting to explore ways to maximise their role within the criminal justice system, there are a number of interesting ideas in this report that we will consider as part of our ongoing work."
