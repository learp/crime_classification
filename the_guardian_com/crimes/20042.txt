The army and the police could be sent in to run Britain's jails as relations between the Home Office and the Prison Officers' Association (POA) reach crisis point. POA sources say the union's 35,000 members are getting their 'ducks lined up' in preparation for strike action later in the year - an unprecedented move that is outlawed under the terms of the association's agreement with the government.Colin Moses, the association's chairman, declined to comment on whether the union's members were considering going on strike. By law the union must give a year's notice if members are to strike. But Moses admitted tensions between both sides were close to spilling over.'I've been national chairman for four years,' Moses said. 'This is the lowest point it's been in terms of relations between us and the government. We wanted to work with the Labour government but it's using draconian Thatcherite laws against us. We can envisage there will be a breakdown in the system if this continues.'The Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, warned the union that the government would freeze its funds unless it withdrew instructions to members not to co-operate with a job evaluation exercise.Clarke said the union's instructions breached a voluntary 'no industrial action' deal.However, a POA circular seen by The Observer states: 'If the Prison Service or Home Office are successful in taking any monies from POA funds... the executive will immediately ballot its membership to take industrial action up to and including strike.'
