Police are investigating allegations of financial irregularities that led to a senior figure being sacked from one of the country's leading animal welfare charities.Surrey police are looking into claims of financial impropriety involving Steve Taylor, former head of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports. Taylor, 35, was fired last week for "gross misconduct" following an internal disciplinary investigation into expenses claims. The Charity Commission has also been contacted in relation to "concerns in relation to financial matters within the charity".Taylor, whose uncle is the former cabinet minister Lord Clark of Windermere, was the league's main spokesman. Previous positions held by Taylor include director of the Forum on Prisoner Education, a charity which campaigned for better education for offenders.Yesterday the league, founded in 1924 and with supporters including Sir Paul McCartney, said: "The potential loss will not have a material effect upon the ability of the league to fulfil its objectives, but we do take a 'zero tolerance' approach to any wrongdoing and for this reason we are co-operating fully with the police in their investigations. We are pleased that our systems worked well in picking this matter up, and we will do everything in our power to recover the sum concerned."Last month it unveiled plans to invest Â£1m over the next four years on hiring investigations staff and equipment to catch people illegally hunting. The work is thought to include hidden cameras in hunting areas.A police spokesman said inquiries were ongoing" in relation to "concerns regarding financial irregularities" and would not comment further.
