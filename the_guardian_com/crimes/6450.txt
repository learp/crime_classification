The public has been asked for help in recovering images of medieval saints that were hacked from a 15th-century oak screen in a remote country church in Devon.Holy Trinity church, at Torbryan in Devon, is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust charity, which described the theft as "devastating".Two of the most perfectly preserved panels, depicting St Victor of Marseille and St Margaret of Antioch, were hacked out of the screen and a third image, of a female saint, was damaged before the thieves abandoned the attempt to remove it.The 15th-century church, an architectural gem set deep in a tangle of narrow lanes in rural Devon, has no CCTV or modern security systems and is looked after by volunteers who regularly open it to the public.Crispin Truman, chief executive of the trust, said the paintings were worth far more in the church for which they were made than they could ever be to a collector."I was shocked to learn of the theft of these panels and the damage done to this significant art work," he said. "Holy Trinity is a beautiful public building much admired around the country and beyond. This crime will deprive all visitors and researchers of an important part of Devon heritage and is essentially a theft of public property. We hope that by publicising the loss we might be able to recover the panels."The church is among hundreds in the care of the trust, and though it remains consecrated is no longer in regular use for worship. The paintings were taken at some time between 22 July and 8 August. Although the church was opened to the public by volunteers between those dates, the loss was noticed only when a maintenance contractor visited and immediately contacted the trust. It is not clear whether the thieves broke in overnight, or attacked them during opening hours.The painted saints, once part of a procession of 40 panels stretching the whole width of the church, are exceptionally rare because so little figurative painting, either on panels or stained glass, survived the flurry of image-smashing during the Reformation.Most rood screens – which originally divided the nave from the altar area of the church and supported carved crosses – were dismantled and either burned or recycled for their wood. Those with representations of saints were particularly targeted.The Torbryan panels were restored in the 19th century from beneath layers of whitewash that may have been deliberately applied to protect them from the iconoclasts. They had been regarded as among the best preserved in Britain.The church itself is unusual because it was built in one phase, between 1450 and 1470, with a spectacular fan-vaulted ceiling, instead of the usual pattern of gradual extension over centuries. Both the carving and the painting of the screen were of very high quality, and the piece is believed to have been a contemporary commission from an anonymous master craftsman for the church.A spokeswoman for the trust said that since news of the theft was released they have already had many calls from members of the public and the art trade, who may be able to help trace the the lost saints.
