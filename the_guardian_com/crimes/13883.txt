The amount of cocaine seized in London has quadrupled in a year, Scotland Yard revealed yesterday.Police say this is due to rising demand for the drug, as well as an increase in action against crack houses and dealers. The amount of heroin seized has halved, apparently because dealers are switching to the more profitable cocaine. The source said: "Some resources of international policing have been moved from drugs to terrorism. That makes it easier for the big distributors." Most of the cocaine entering Britain comes from South America. The Met said officers recovered 360kg of the class A drug in the 2003-04 financial year, compared with 96kg the year before. Heroin seizures fell from 105kg to 43kg. According to the National Criminal Intelligence Service's latest threat assessment, 35 to 45 tonnes of cocaine were smuggled into the UK in 2003. The NCIS said dealers were selling it to heroin addicts because it softened their withdrawal symptoms. A Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur, said: "The demand side of cocaine is increasing significantly so high-level distributors are moving into that area to exploit the market."
