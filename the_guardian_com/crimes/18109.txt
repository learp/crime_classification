Thousands of counterfeit goods purporting to be officially linked to the Olympics have been seized at British ports and airports in the runup to next month's Games in London, the Home Office has said.The biggest haul included more than 700 fake Olympics-branded sports bags and 540 cigarette lighters seized at Felixstowe.Other goods include 432 Olympics-themed vests intercepted by UK Border Agency staff at Dover and 15 fake football shirts and 90 fake Ralph Lauren polo shirts in parcels at Coventry's international postal hub.Home Office minister Damian Green said: "Counterfeiting is not a harmless crime but a criminal enterprise posing a serious economic threat estimated to be worth around £1.3bn in the UK each year. In this Olympic summer our officers have utilised intelligence sources, scanner technology and search techniques to successfully thwart those seeking to illegally profit from the Games."Local authorities have also reported seizures of counterfeit goods in recent weeks. Trading standards officers in Camden, north London, last month seized items such as T-shirts, bags and cigarette lighters, with a street value of about £250,000. They were subsequently incinerated.The Olympics brand is tightly protected and it is illegal to use the Olympics symbol, the London 2012 logo or the words "London 2012" or "Olympics" without the permission of the London Organising Committee of the Olympics and Paralympics (Locog). A special group, including the Metropolitan police and government agencies, has devised a special hologram for official London 2012 merchandise that flickers between the logos for the two events.Councils across Britain are warning people not to be ripped off by being sold items in pubs or on the streets. Sandwell in the West Midlands is telling prospective customers to be "suspicious of prices that are too cheap for famous named goods which have the Olympic brand attached to them."However there have also been fears that the determination of Olympics organisers to protect the value to official sponsors of being linked to the Games risks undermining public support for events such as the torch relay, where they have been cracking down on local pubs and businesses proclaiming items such as "Olympic breakfast" or "flaming torch breakfast baguettes".
