The rising number of women who allege they are raped while drunk is forcing Scotland Yard to reassess the way it investigates sexual offences in an effort to tackle the plummeting conviction rate in rape cases.Increasing numbers of young women are coming forward to the police to say they believe they have been raped but cannot remember what happened as a result of being intoxicated, according to senior officers who have carried out a review of rape allegations made over two months in London.A recent survey by Amnesty International suggested that many people view women who were raped while drunk as complicit in the crime - with 29% of people questioned stating that women who were sexually assaulted while intoxicated were partially or totally responsible. But Brian Paddick, the head of Operation Sapphire, the Met's sexual offences team, said these women were "the most vulnerable victims" and called for a change in attitude among the public and in the criminal justice system.His review of 697 rape allegations across London over two months this year revealed that one in three of all rape claims involved victims who had been drinking and where drink contributed to the offence. The study showed that these were the cases most likely to be dropped contributing to a decline in the number of successful prosecutions for rape over the past 17 years that culminated this year in an all-time low conviction rate of 5.6%."We have to examine the way in which we investigate cases involving vulnerable victims - those who are intoxicated and those victims who are suffering from mental illness," said Mr Paddick."The overwhelming drug involved in intoxication is alcohol ... People who are intoxicated represent the most vulnerable in terms of being victims but are some of the most difficult cases to investigate; for example where the victim has no recollection of what happened."His comments came after the row over the dropping of a rape prosecution in Swansea last month because the 21-year-old alleged victim confessed she was so drunk she could not recall having had sex. Last week, in what police said was a "last resort", officers in Croydon, south London, said they would arrest women who had been binge drinking in an attempt to protect them from being raped after 103 reports of rape in the borough in the past eight months.The review of rape allegations across London was ordered by Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, after big discrepancies were discovered in conviction rates across the capital. Among the review's findings were that 13% of women who alleged rape were "unsure" whether a rape or sexual intercourse had taken place, largely because of drink. But senior officers say alleged rape victims should contact police even if they were too drunk to remember what had taken place.Detective Chief Inspector Dave Osborn, operational head of Sapphire, said interrogation techniques with defendants needed to be re-examined to make the alleged offender explain whether he sought informed consent to sex, as required by law. The review comes in advance of a report next month by HM Inspectorate of Constabularies into rape convictions.FAQ Sex offencesWhy is there so much concern about rape convictions?Since 1985 reporting of rape has increased but conviction rates have fallen.
