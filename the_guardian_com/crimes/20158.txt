A senior police officer in Britain's "Asbo capital" will raise doubts today about the effectiveness of the orders which are the centrepiece of the government's Respect programme against antisocial behaviour.Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Wain, head of the Stockport division of Greater Manchester police, will call for a pause in the relentless increase of the often draconian orders, while researchers test growing evidence that they may be more of a political stunt than an effective tool.In the first survey of offenders with Asbos, carried out for a criminology degree at Cambridge University, Mr Wain finds contempt for the orders, virtually universal breaches and strong suggestions that stigma and lack of support may drive young troublemakers into a career of crime.In a book out today - The Asbo: Wrong Turning, Dead End - he says government promises to base crimefighting on research and evidence have been broken, along with claims that Asbos would see "enforcement and support work hand in hand."I am getting myself ready for accusations of being weak-kneed and liberal and not representing the police force," said Mr Wain. "But this is not so much about theories as about what works."As a serving police officer I have had considerable experience of the use of Asbos and what struck me was not only did they get breached on a regular basis, they also did not appear to be controlling the behaviour of those subject to them."Mr Wain's study, jointly carried out with a senior research fellow at Cambridge's Institute of Criminology, Elizabeth Burney, suggests that previous but less detailed warnings about Asbos have been right in questioning their "get tough" image. In interviews with court staff, Asbo supervisors and fellow police officers, he finds that there is "nowhere near enough" support for offenders, probably because the cost of individual support orders."This was strikingly born out when we interviewed people with Asbos," he said. "There were cases where they were excluded from areas where at the same time they were expected to work as part of sorting out a normal, useful life. One of them had an exclusion zone which prevented him visiting his mother and was imprisoned when he went to see her. As he said to us, understandably: 'If it was your mother, what would you have done?' "In the period studied, only six youth offending teams had applied for money to resource individual support orders - the support side of a balanced Asbo package.The report, published by the Howard League for Penal Reform, questioned 21 Asbo offenders in depth, on two estates and at a youth custody centre.It also reveals the greatest growth in the orders is in post-conviction Asbos whose breach tends to see offenders jailed.
