The actor Chris Langham tonight left prison after winning a four-month cut in his jail sentence at the court of appeal.Three senior judges found that the original 10-month sentence imposed for downloading child abuse images was overly harsh, ordering his immediate release from Elmley prison, in Kent.As Langham - who had been due for release at the end of December - left prison, he said: "My life has been ruined but my conscience is clear."Newspaper reports said he feared for his life in prison. His wife, Christine Cartwright, was reported as saying he had been verbally abused and and had had missiles thrown at him by other prisoners.Following a three-week trial, the 58-year-old was convicted of 15 counts of making an indecent photograph of a child.Sentencing him, Judge Philip Statman said the children in the images had been subjected to "horrifying sexual abuse". One of the victims was around eight years old, while others were between 11 and 13.During the trial, the court heard how police raided Langham's home in November 2005 as part of Operation Ore, seizing three computers with files called 'Lolita', 'incest', 'rape', 'whore' and 'hussy'.Langham broke down in court when he admitted downloading child abuse images, but said he pleaded not guilty because he was not a paedophile.His defence was that he was conducting research for the BBC television series Help, and was trying to make sense of sexual abuse he suffered as a child. The jury cleared him of having sex with an under-age girl.
