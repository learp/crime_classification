It is sometimes too easy to mock the quest of successive Holyrood administrations to make Scotland one of the most socially enlightened countries in the world. Surely, though, there can't be much wrong with a culture whose pronouncements and legislation are all underpinned by an innate belief that we are all created equal.Thus, despite some profound differences between conservative and liberal, spiritual and secular, by and large we get it right and our politicians do try to balance as best they can the special interests of opposing groups.Thus Holyrood has consistently supported the desire of Catholics to have their children educated, at the state's expense, in schools that bear the imprint of their faith. In so doing, they have taken the view that faith schools make an important contribution to our socially diverse nation.At the same time, the government has also resisted fierce opposition by Christian groups, led by the Catholic church, to same-sex marriage. No matter how sincere is the Christian position on this, it is surely right that the church cannot be seen to influence unduly the state legislature.The wandering and displaced peoples of the world know that Scotland will give them solace, protection and renewal to the best of our ability while we also strive to provide free or affordable care to those who are elderly, sick, poor and infirm.The means to pay for high-quality care must never be a significant factor in our compassionate society and nor ought it to be in our provision of a first-class education. To my mind, these are the non-negotiable tenets of life in modern Scotland and the real pillars on which our society is built. In these areas also, it seems, the gap between what Scotland believes is important in life and what England believes to be so is becoming wider each day.Yet while my country continues to view women as second-class citizens and as the object merely of men's sexual gratification we can never properly describe ourselves as enlightened at all.In this area, civic Scotland talks a very good game but, in reality, we still have a medieval approach to how we view women. And on those occasions when another shocking set of statistics is released that proves the point the response by local and national government is predictable and complacent.Last week, it was revealed that 1,372 rapes were committed in Scotland in the last 12 months, a figure that equates to almost four each day. Overall, there were almost 8,000 sex offences in the same period, a rise of 5% on the previous year. Yet the reaction of our Justice Department was lamentable.The Scottish government report in which the numbers were revealed also insisted on claiming that overall crime was at its lowest level for 39 years. Astonishingly, the justice minister, Kenny MacAskill, said that the figures demonstrated Scotland was becoming a safer place to live.The reduction in crime rates, though, was largely due to the fact that there had been a drastic fall in minor crime, while Mr MacAskill must be the only person in Scotland who takes the police's own figures regarding crime reduction at face value.An indication of how sick Scottish society remains in the way women are viewed came in a recent horror story from a Glasgow nightclub run by Stefan King, one of Scotland's biggest operators in this sector.The club, the Shimmy, is in the middle of Glasgow's clubbing district and thought it was a good idea to charge high-end customers £800 for a special location on the premises that afforded its patrons the use of a specially constructed two-way mirror that looked directly into the wash-basin area of the women's bathrooms. The initial response of this establishment was to suggest that it was merely a "bit of fun".Furthermore, it claimed that the vast majority of its customers were relaxed about this before making a delinquent joke about vibrators under the dancefloor. Effectively, any woman using this club was being denied even the merest expectation of privacy.A friend of mine who is close to Glasgow's licensing board said that its members were visibly shocked at this revelation, but more so by the attitude of the owner's representatives, which he described as "contemptuous". One year before the Commonwealth Games begin in Glasgow, this tale was reported with incredulity around the world.The harshest sanction the licensing board could impose on this club was a suspension of its licence for one week. Yet there were no demonstrations by women's groups outside this club and, inexplicably, no criminal prosecutions.That any group of adult men think that this is a normal way to spend a night in Glasgow is very disturbing. That it is also now an accepted form of weekday and weekend gentlemen's entertainment in each of Scotland's major cities to pay for women to take their clothes off in lap-dancing clubs is simply sick.Meanwhile, though, the considered response by the clowns on Holyrood's health and sport committee to Scotland's alarming teenage pregnancy rate is to provide contraception to 13-year-olds and sex education to infants.Guess what happens when you encourage children to have sex on demand without educating girls about the option of saying "no" or telling boys that delay and anticipation are much more rewarding than instant gratification? We have created a culture in which boys view instant sex as a must-have accoutrement of modern life. A few years later, it's women who suffer the consequences.Rape Crisis Scotland's description of what women experience following any type of sexual attack is stark and unequivocal: "The most common after-effects of sexual attacks were anxiety, flashbacks and panic attacks, with many survivors suffering insomnia in the months that followed." It hardly needs to be said that these women are our partners, daughters, sisters and mothers.It's the rest of us who ought to be encountering sleepless nights while this poison – and our complacency – persists.
