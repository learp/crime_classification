The government's proposal to criminalise men who pay for sex with trafficked women will be "very difficult to enforce", the head of the Metropolitan police's specialist human trafficking unit told MPs yesterday.But Harriet Harman, the Commons leader and minister for women, defended the proposal, saying it was needed because the sex industry has been taken over by serious and organised crime.Commander Allan Gibson, the head of the Met's anti-trafficking unit, said the 211 cases his unit had dealt with in two years were only the "top of the iceberg".But he told the Commons home affairs committee that it was difficult to say whether the majority of women working in massage parlours and brothels had been trafficked. "That is not something that we can answer. A high percentage but I cannot be more precise than that ... We need to commission research to find that," he said .The proposal to criminalise men who pay for sex with women who have been exploited by being pimped or trafficked is likely to be one of the most controversial parts of the policing and crime bill.When Gibson's personal view was later put to Harman, also giving evidence to the committee, she said anecdotal evidence suggested that 85% of women in London brothels had been brought in from abroad and the government had to address the "demand side".She said as solicitor general she had seen cases of women being bought and sold as capital assets who were expected to have sex with 20 different men a day."The proposal will deal with that situation," she said. "The man who pays for sex takes the risk that if it turns out that she has been trafficked into the country or is under the control of a pimp, he is guilty of a criminal offence."
