Congratulations for a detailed, balanced and fair account of recent crime figures (Report, 17 July). These more than suggest that much of the rhetoric about "Broken Britain" is overstated. But what is of concern is how other newspapers reported this story. In the Times, it is barely mentioned, while in the Telegraph it is spun in such a way that only the most careful reader would note that the evidence was not in fact indicating an overall rise in crime. We live in probably the only country in Europe in which good news on crime is routinely suppressed by large sections of the media. Why?Dr Charles WattersCanterbury, KentThose protesting at the Edinburgh festival featuring Handel's music celebrating the Battle of Culloden (Outrage as Butcher Cumberland sets sights on Edinburgh, 15 July) are playing a historical blame game, where the carnage of the Jacobite rebellions is ascribed to the English, when they were substantially conflicts between Scots. The English like to foist the blame on the Duke of Cumberland, because he was German. The lowlanders of Edinburgh back in 1746 would have been delighted to hail that particular conquering hero.Bryn HughesWrexham, North WalesI'm disappointed that the people on the fourth plinth are not doing anything ('Oyez! Oyez! – the plinth has come', 7 July). If I had been chosen I would have worn a blonde wig and a crown.
