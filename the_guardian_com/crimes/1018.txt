Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Defence Association is once again facing a potentially dangerous split, it has been confirmed .The UDA's so-called "brigades" in east and south Belfast issued a statement on Wednesday in solidarity with colleagues in the north of the city who have recently come under attack.They said they gave their colleagues in north Belfast "full and unequivocal support" in the face of attempts to depose its leadership in the area.The UDA units accused those of being behind the attacks of drug dealing and criminality."These threats and attacks have come from a loose collection of individuals, containing amongst them a core group of expelled members, bolstered by criminal and drug-dealing elements and young men that had never been a part of our organisation," the UDA statement said.The accusation is pointed at a group of former UDA members from its west Belfast "brigade" who were also claimed to be behind an arson attack on the house of an anti-drugs campaigner on the Shankill Road. Tracey Coulter's house was set ablaze at the start of this week in what she claimed was a revenge attack for her giving evidence against convicted UDA man William "Mo" Courtney.Confirming the split with its former west Belfast comrades, the UDA in the east and south of the city said: "All areas state very clearly that we will not stand with those that have been expelled from the organisation for criminality, drug dealing or other antisocial activity against unionist/loyalist communities and who are now trying to undermine the leadership of north Belfast and the wider organisation."Under the leadership of Jackie McDonald the UDA in most areas has tried to transform from an active paramilitary organisation into a community group with roots in working-class loyalism. However, a number of UDA units have used its muscle and manpower to enrich themselves through drug dealing and other criminal activities such as extortion and blackmail.In the first decade of this century the UDA was beset by feuding between rival factions as well as with the other loyalist terror group, the Ulster Volunteer Force.The south, east and north Belfast "brigades" of the UDA were instrumental in deposing UDA Shankill chief Johnny "Mad Dog" Adair and his supporters during the last internal war within the organisation.
