A former Home Office pathologist, criticised for his postmortem examination into the death of newspaper seller Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest in 2009, has had his earlier work on a murder victim condemned by a General Medical Council disciplinary panel.The panel found that Dr Freddy Patel's reports on the death of Sally White - the first victim of Anthony Hardy, "the Camden Ripper" - in 2002 were "irresponsible, not of the standard expected of a competent forensic pathologist and liable to bring the medical profession into disrepute".Patel decided White, a 31-year-old sex worker, had died of natural causes despite blood staining on her clothing, her bedding and on a wall in a locked room in Hardy's north London flat. Patel concluded she had died from a heart attack during consensual sex.His reports on Hardy's first victim discouraged a police investigation that might have saved two other women, the GMC panel was told. Because he had ruled out murder, there was effectively "no crime to investigate".Hardy was given three life sentences in November 2003 for the murders of three women, including White. A judge said he had committed the crimes to "satisfy his depraved and perverted needs".White's naked body was discovered in Hardy's flat in January 2002. The dismembered remains of the two other victims were found in December that year in bin bags near his home in north London.The GMC ruled that Patel made a string of errors and failed to fully consider the circumstances of White's death.The decision follows his suspension in September last year for misconduct relating to two other postmortems. He is currently banned from working until the end of this month and the GMC will now consider whether he should be struck off, suspended or given a warning.Panel chairman Vickie Isaac said: "The panel determined that it was clear from your first report that you had not adequately considered other possible modes of death, including asphyxia."Your conclusions in the postmortem reports ... were made without any adequate consideration of other possible modes of death, including asphyxia, and that this was irresponsible; not of the standard expected of a competent forensic pathologist when undertaking and reporting on special or forensic postmortem examination; and liable to bring the medical profession into disrepute."Patel accepted that he did not adequately report on other possible causes of the marks of injury or their possible significance. He failed to comment on whether a blunt force injury which caused a large gash to White's head might have knocked her unconscious.After the police specifically asked Patel to assess the possibility of asphyxia, the doctor admitted he did not adequately comment on the circumstances when the "classic signs of asphyxia" are not present.He accepted that these could include cases where the victim was unconscious and did not resist. In a third report, after he was again asked to expand on asphyxia, Patel concluded: "There were no signs of asphyxia and death was due to natural causes."Simon Jackson, for the GMC, had told the hearing: "The upshot of that, the panel may feel ... is that once Dr Patel had concluded that she died of natural causes, one reality was that there was no crime to investigate."The panel found Patel failed to consider key evidence including the blood staining on her clothing and bedding or fully to consider that her body had been found in a locked room in the flat of a recently-arrested man, or another sex worker's statement that Hardy had nearly suffocated her.The pathologist has also been found guilty of dishonesty by providing the GMC with a false CV in 2009. He stated then that his current job was as a "Home Office South Eastern Group Practice ... 2004â€“2009" when the dates should have stated 2004-2006.Isaac added that his "actions would be considered dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people, and that you must have realised that your actions would be regarded as dishonest".Patel has been criticised for his finding that Tomlinson died of coronary heart disease after being struck by police during the G20 protests on 1 April 2009.Two other pathologists later concluded that the 47-year-old newspaper seller died of internal bleeding as a result of blunt force trauma, in combination with cirrhosis of the liver.The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, has said failures by Patel undermined the chances of successfully prosecuting the officer responsible.Patel was suspended for three months in September last year after a panel found he had carried out three "irresponsible" postmortems, two of which amounted to misconduct. He is still banned from working in the UK under an extension of the suspension lasting until 31 March, so that the current misconduct proceedings can complete before his case is reviewed.If he is found guilty of misconduct as a result of the current proceedings, he faces being struck off.
