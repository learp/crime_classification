Britain's courts took another step yesterday towards ditching the law's reputation for delay, when a judge agreed to hear a case by mobile phone. The unexpected illness of a woman charged with money-laundering led to the pioneering step, which avoided a costly adjournment of the brief proceedings.The move depended on barrister Wayne Jackson keying in the correct number for the defendant, 30-year-old Catherine Denny, and confirming on oath that he recognised her voice and was convinced that it was genuinely her.The mobile was then switched to speaker mode at Teesside crown court, Middlesbrough, before being handed to the clerk, Sharon Crinson, who read Denny the charge of being concerned in the proceeds of crime two years ago.The ground-breaking hearing did not last much longer, because Denny, who lives 300 miles south of Middlesbrough, replied "not guilty", the prosecution offered no evidence, and Judge Geoffrey Moorhouse directed an acquittal. But the national office for the judiciary gave the nearest it could to a pat back, without breaking a bar on commenting on individual proceedings. "Judges make the decisions in their courts, and they are always minded that efficiency and speed should be sought as much as possible," a spokesman said. "If all the parties are agreed, this is sensible, as with video link evidence or hearings in a defendant's absence."Judge Moorhouse, who ruled the short-cut was legal after Jackson suggested it, did not speak to Denny. Crinson said: "I have not heard of any other case being heard over a mobile phone but I suppose it is the way of the world now. It made sense to deal with the case that way when she was too ill to face a 600-mile trip."The courts have previously seen one sentence passed by landline to a mobile phone, when Aftab Ahmed of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, got stuck in a traffic jam.After consulting law books, Judge Caroline Ludlow told Ipswich crown court she could see no reason why she should not ring 44-year-old Aftab with her decision on a bankruptcy offence, provided he agreed and was not driving.After hearing mitigation pleas, she phoned him with a 140- hour community service order and Â£750 costs. The court clerk, Rachel Bonner, said: "The judge said that to save wasting public money by adjourning the case she was considering passing sentence over the phone. She also asked the prosecution counsel if he could think of any reason in law why she couldn't, and when no reason was offered she went ahead."Other initiatives have included phone evidence to save a 96-year-old witness having to attend court in Liverpool, and the relatively frequent use of video links in high-security remands and for child witnesses.
