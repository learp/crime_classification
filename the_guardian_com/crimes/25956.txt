The killer of a would-be police cadet pleaded guilty to manslaughter yesterday after suddenly confessing to his lawyers a day before the start of a murder trial.The case against Guy Beckett, who admitted killing Laura Torn, 18, in the the Lincolnshire village of Owston Ferry a year ago, was adjourned for the judge to consider psychiatric reports. Beckett, a 31-year-old relief pub manager, was arrested after a 10-day hunt for Laura who disappeared after a pub celebration last April. The strangled body of the young woman, a well-known and popular figure in the small community, was found in a haystack eight miles away. Beckett's barrister Simon Myerson QC told Hull Crown court that he cannot elaborate at the moment to explain how the killing came about. The case was adjourned for reports until next month.
