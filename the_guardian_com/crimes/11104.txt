A gambling priest who gave his paedophile friend more than £20,000 to fund the grooming of a young girl for sex was jailed for five years yesterday.The money from Father Jeremiah McGrath, 64, enabled his friend and former lover, convicted child rapist Billy Adams, to shower a 12-year-old with gifts. Treats included haircuts, a mobile phone and a three-week holiday in Blackpool.Having bought the girl's silence and trust, Adams, 38, originally from Belfast but latterly of Bootle, Merseyside, raped her repeatedly over a six-month period in 2005. He was sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum term of seven and a half years.During the trial at Liverpool crown court, McGrath, from Rosslea, Co Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, revealed his wealth came from shares and heavy gambling - he won £60,000 on one race alone in 1989 - and from property he had inherited.He insisted he had no idea Adams was abusing the girl and claimed he gave Adams access to a joint bank account because the pair enjoyed gambling together. He had visited Adams in prison in Ireland while he served a 12-year sentence for raping an eight-year-old girl and said he believed his protestations of innocence.He said of their relationship: "I suppose you could say [it] was like putting blinkers on a racehorse. I accepted an awful lot from him which I now realise were lies."McGrath went on one holiday to Blackpool with Adams, the girl, her mother and her brother. During this trip, Adams posed as the girl's father, shared a bedroom with her and repeatedly raped her.Trevor Parry-Jones, defending McGrath, said: "The conviction means effectively, in one way, he closed his eyes, he would not interfere, he was obsessed with Adams and wanted to be with him."Judge Brian Lewis said McGrath's standing in the community had made him a useful ally for Adams.McGrath was found guilty by a majority verdict three weeks ago of one count of facilitating the abuse from August to November 2005 but the jury failed to reach a verdict on whether he did so from May to August of that year. He was cleared of facilitating the abuse on another specified occasion, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on an indecent assault charge.After the guilty verdict was announced, the Bishop of Clogher in Northern Ireland, Joseph Duffy, said: "As soon as the allegations came to light, Father McGrath was suspended from ministry. Father McGrath's future will be considered. This is a complex process under canon law."
