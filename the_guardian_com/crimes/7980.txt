A teenager who killed a 17-year-old girl while racing his car at up to 100mph was jailed for eight years yesterday. Luke Grimes, 19, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, was racing with friends when his car "cartwheeled" over an embankment and into a tree, killing passenger Kelly Bennett.Grimes was the last in a convoy of four cars travelling along the A658 Harrogate to Knaresborough bypass on March 12. He had three passengers in his Citroen Saxo, including Kelly, who was sitting behind the driver's seat.As all four cars overtook other vehicles on the road Grimes was forced to brake when he did not have time to pull back in behind his friends. He lost control of the car, which fishtailed and swerved across the road on to an embankment before crashing through a fence and into a tree.David Garnet, prosecuting, told York crown court: "Kelly's unfortunate positioning meant she struck the tree with her head, suffering fatal injuries."Police officers calculated Grimes's speed as between 68mph and 71mph, but witnesses described the car as travelling at up to 100mph. The speed limit on the road is 60mph.Sentencing Grimes, who admitted causing death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing, the Recorder of York, Paul Hoffman, said he was satisfied the teenager was travelling at "a grossly excessive speed". He disqualified Grimes from driving for seven years.Earlier the court heard how Kelly's mother, Helen, had warned Grimes to drive carefully when he came to pick her daughter up.In a statement Kelly's family said: "No sentence given out to Luke Grimes will ever bring Kelly back. We have to serve a life sentence - living without Kelly. Dangerous driving kills, Luke Grimes still has a life. Kelly does not. His family still have their son. We do not have our daughter and sister."
