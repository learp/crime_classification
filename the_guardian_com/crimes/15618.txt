England's most senior judge has renewed his call for shorter prison sentences and warned that Britain's jails risk filling up with "geriatric lifers".The lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, suggested in a speech at the University of Birmingham yesterday that mandatory life sentences for murderers were compounding the prisons overcrowding crisis.He echoed comments he made last year when he compared the 30-year jail terms meted out to murderers now to the "utterly barbaric" practices of flogging, branding and using the stocks by which criminals were punished in the 18th century.He broke with the government's official line on mandatory sentences during his speech at the university, questioning the need for a mandatory life sentence for murder and suggesting that murder law reforms would not succeed unless changes were made in the sentencing regime."I'm not in favour of mandatory sentences full stop," he said. In many cases, the minimum term was double what it had been before current guidelines were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act, he said.A 15-year minimum term is the lowest starting point for murder, though this is increased to 30 years for a murder in the course of a burglary, or if a firearm is used. Premeditation and other aggravating factors will increase the sentence, while mitigating factors, such as provocation, will reduce it."If sentences are to be just, then the effect of mitigating and aggravating factors should be very significant, so that sentences fill the spectrum between these two starting points," Lord Phillips said."I am not sure that in practice they do, and I believe that the starting points are having the effect of ratcheting up sentences in a manner that will be regretted many years hence."The lord chief justice called for a "thorough rethink about the extent to which statutory guidelines are desirable", the Telegraph reported.He added: "It may be that a just and uniform approach to sentencing in this field is one better achieved with the help of guidance provided by the court of appeal and the Sentencing Guidelines Council." The lord chief justice heads both these bodies. The government is committed to keeping mandatory sentences.Lord Phillips said the effect of the sentencing guidelines in the Criminal Justice Act had been "in many cases almost to double the length of time that those convicted of murder will stay in prison. In 30 years' time, the prisons will be full of geriatric lifers".Since Lord Phillips last publicly condemned sentencing policy, in a lecture in Oxford last October, the prison population in England has reached a new peak. Prison numbers have risen from 60,000 in 1997 to 80,000 now, with reconviction rates running at record levels.He also said some elements of the media were inclined to treat imprisonment lightly."That is not to say that I do not recognise that there are certain crimes which require a sentence of that length or longer to protect the public, but I detect on the part of such publications an incitement to the public to exact vengeance from offenders that is not dissimilar from the emotions of those who thronged to witness public executions in the 18th century."He referred to "utterly barbaric" practices such as flogging, adding: "I sometimes wonder whether, in 100 years' time, people will be as shocked by the length of the sentences we are imposing as we are by some of the punishments of the 18th century."
