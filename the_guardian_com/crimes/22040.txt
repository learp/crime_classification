Kate McCann arrived at the small beach-side church in Praia da Luz shortly before 10am this morning, her face crumpled with emotion, clasping tightly to the hand of a female friend.In her other hand she held the pink cuddly toy that, for a week, she has not been seen without.Seven days after Madeleine McCann vanished from her family's holiday apartment in the Algarve resort, locals and holidaymakers were anxious to show their support, cramming into the town's small chapel for a service which the Anglican priest, Haynes Hubbard, described as "unprecedented"."We are simply going to ask God's power and protection for Madeleine and her parents and her siblings, and for everyone who has been shocked and stunned and devastated by what has happened," Fr Hubbard said.The Anglican Bishop of Europe, he added, had asked all chaplaincies across the continent to pray for the McCann family today.At one point during the highly emotional service, Mrs McCann stood and touched a large candle burning at the front of the church while she prayed silently.Others in the congregation stood in tears, including a number of reps from Mark Warner, the firm which operates the holiday resort where the couple were staying.Mr and Mrs McCann are devout Catholics and have attended a number of services in the chapel since their daughter's disappearance at about 10pm last Thursday.Last night, the couple released a statement saying that they remained positive and thanking the Portuguese police and others who have been involved in the search for Madeleine, who will be four on Saturday.But as the days go on, hard facts about what happened to the little girl remain tantalisingly few.Two Portuguese newspapers today reported that police are hunting for two men and a woman who were captured on CCTV at a petrol station close to the town. They were reportedly driving a British car whose registration has been passed to European police forces and Interpol.According to the Correio da Manha, one of the men and the woman were identified by a German holidaymaker who had chased away a "British seeming" couple after he found them taking photographs of his daughter in the nearby town of Sagres on the Monday before Madeleine's disappearance.Another Portuguese paper, 24 Horas, said a blonde woman in her 40s had been seen near the girl's bedroom window on the night of her disappearance.However, a number of other seemingly positive leads that have emerged in the past few days have proved to be red herrings.
