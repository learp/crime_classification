The children's commissioner for Wales has said a new inquiry should be held into allegations that a senior Tory was involved in a paedophile ring three decades ago in order to avoid suggestions of a cover-up.Keith Towler's intervention came after a victim of the north Wales care home scandal in the 1970s said he and others had been "swept under the carpet" despite a three-year inquiry in the late 1990s. Steven Messham, one of hundreds of children who were abused over two decades, told BBC Newsnight that the terms of reference of the Waterhouse inquiry meant he was unable to raise abuse that took place outside the care system. He claimed that an unnamed then senior Conservative politician was involved in abuse.Towler said the only way to resolve the issue was for a full investigation to take place."I would support a full inquiry," Towler told BBC Radio 5. "The fact that we have someone on camera now who was clearly a victim of appalling abuse in Bryn Estyn children's home back in the 1970s and 80s, saying that what he wanted to say was outside of the terms of reference, and people told him that he could not say these things and he couldn't talk about people who had abused him, is clearly wrong."Messham said he was called a liar when he tried to report the abuse to the police in the late 1970s. Towler said: "The only way that we can clearly put that to bed is to say, at the top of the tree, we will conduct that inquiry and we will allow that inquiry to go as far as it needs to go to make sure that the evidence that witnesses want to give and that victims want to give is fully heard.""Unless you do that, that level of suspicion will always be around that there is a cover-up … No one should be protected. Society needs to know that it is clean in this sense."A £13m investigation by Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC heard from 240 people abused as children in 40 homes in north Wales. The inquiry's report mentioned 200 people who were abusers, alleged abusers or had failed to protect children in the homes, although not all of them have been named.Messham said: "In the home it was the standard abuse which was violent and sexual. Outside it was like you were sold, we were taken to the Crest hotel in Wrexham, mainly on Sunday nights, where they would rent rooms."One particular night that I always recall is when I was basically raped, tied down and abused by nine different men."
