A man hanged for murder 53 years ago was the victim of a miscarriage of justice which must be "deeply regretted", the court of appeal ruled yesterday.The conviction of George Kelly, executed in March 1950 for the murder of a cinema manager, was ruled unsafe because police concealed a key witness statement that cast doubt on his guilt. Lord Justice Rix, Mr Justice Douglas Brown and Mr Justice Davis, who quashed Kelly's conviction earlier this year, gave their reasons in a written judgment yesterday. Kelly, a 27-year-old labourer, was convicted following a double murder at the Cameo cinema in Wavertree, Liverpool, in which the manager, Leonard Thomas, and assistant manager, John Catterall, were shot dead during a bungled burglary on March 19 1949. Tried only for the murder of Thomas, Kelly was convicted in February 1950 at Liverpool assize court and sentenced to death. During the appeal court hearing, the judges were told a statement given to police by a prosecution witness, claiming another man had confessed to the crime, was not disclosed to the defence. The judges also quashed the conviction of the late Charles Connolly, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for robbery and conspiracy to rob relating to the incident. Kelly's daughter, Kathleen Hughes, and Connolly's widow, Eileen, had taken the cases to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which refers possible miscarriages of justice to the court of appeal. Connolly died in 1997, still protesting his innocence.
