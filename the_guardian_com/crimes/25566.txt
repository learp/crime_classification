Eighty-five foreign prisoners released after committing serious offences without being considered for deportation remain at large, the home secretary, John Reid, disclosed today.Mr Reid said in a Commons written statement ahead of his appearance before the home affairs select committee that the total number of cases had now fallen to 1,019 - four fewer than previously thought - but they had now identified 186 serious offenders among them, a rise of seven.Just last week, Mr Reid had said that 179 of the 1,023 foreigners released without being considered for deportation were classified as having committed serious offences, with 35 of them convicted for the "most serious offences" such as murder, manslaughter, rape or child sex offences.Under the revised figures, the total number of the "most serious" offenders - including murders and rapists - has risen by two to 37.Of those, 27 are now in prison - including all four murderers - and two were thought to be dead, leaving eight at large.Of the other 149 serious offenders, Mr Reid said that 66 were now "under our control" while six had been deported.Twenty-one serious offenders - including eight of the most serious offenders - had re-offended since their release. Eleven of the cases involved violence or a sexual element.The fall in the total number of cases was a result of some duplicate files being included in the original figure.Giving evidence this morning to the select committee, Mr Reid explained that at this point in time there was no "unique identifier" for prisoners, which often led to duplication.Mr Reid proposed creating a new "unique personal number" to keep track of anyone who came into contact with the criminal justice, immigration or asylum systems.He also said officials had been asked to devise a way to stop prisoners failing to declare their nationality.
