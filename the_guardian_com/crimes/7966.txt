A convicted killer has claimed he is better off in prison than living as a pensioner on the outside.Michael Sams, who was handed four life sentences in 1993 for the murder of Leeds teenager Julie Dart and the kidnap of estate agent Stephanie Slater, bragged that his life in HMP Whitemoor, Cambridgeshire, is better than he could expect if he was surviving on a state pension.Sams wrote to Inside Time, a national newspaper for prisoners, in response to a campaign for convicts to receive their state pension once they reach retirement age.In the letter, the tool repairer, who is now of state pension age, wrote: "How many pensioners in the community, who are totally dependent on the basic state pension and live in rented accommodation, are able to spend around £20 per week on luxuries?"Most struggle to keep warm in winter, afraid to put the heating on, barely eating, let alone getting three square (ready-made) meals per day. And three or four choices per course at that! Free access to the gym each day to keep those joints supple, and no bills except for £1 per week TV rental."Have you ever seen an OAP inmate in tatty clothes or scruffy trainers? Not a hope! Materially, we OAPs in prison are far better off than those in the community."Sams dismissed the campaign to give inmates a pension but spoke out in favour of allowing retired prisoners who are unable to work the same weekly amount as those who can.He also advised younger criminals to invest their "gains" in a private pension so that when they retire in prison they will have a steady income.He wrote: "There may be a moral here for younger inmates who are destined to spend most of their life in and out of prison. Every time they go out, I would recommend they invest a little of their 'gains' in a private pension scheme. Then when they finally retire in prison, they too can look forward to receiving private pensions each month!"Sams, from Sutton-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, admitted kidnapping Miss Slater in January 1992, falsely imprisoning her and demanding a £175,000 ransom for her safe return. He was caught after his wife recognised a recording of his voice played on BBC's Crimewatch programme.He was found guilty of the 1991 murder of Miss Dart, a teenage prostitute, following a trial at Nottingham crown court.Norman Brennan, founder of the Victims of Crime Trust, said he was appalled by Sams' claims about life behind bars."My opinion is that I think the whole country is sick to death of listening to the bleeding hearts and hearing about the human rights and civil liberties of those who have committed the most appalling crimes."These are horrific crimes that have devastated families and sent fear across communities throughout the UK. Prisoners are entitled to the basic human rights of three meals a day and not to be tortured, but they should not have a voice in the media or anywhere else where the public can hear them until they have completed the sentence imposed by the courts of this land."
