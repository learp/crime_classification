The two sons of the "back-from-the-dead" canoeist are the innocent victims of an alleged scam, police said yesterday. Mark Darwin, 32, and his 29-year-old brother, Anthony, were questioned over the weekend by detectives investigating the disappearance of their father, John, who went missing after taking to sea in a canoe off Hartlepool five years ago."Both sons of John and Anne Darwin ... were interviewed on Saturday," said a Cleveland police spokeswoman. "The result of these lengthy interviews was that there was nothing to suggest they are anything other than witnesses and, of course, victims in the case."The men have insisted that they knew nothing of their parents' alleged deception.In an earlier statement Mark, from Finchley, north London, and Anthony, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said that they had disowned their parents: "We have gone from the height of elation at finding him to be alive to the depths of despair. We have not spoken to either of our parents since our dad's arrest and at this present time we want no further contact with them."John Darwin, a prison officer when he vanished, was thought to have drowned on March 21 2002 while canoeing near his home in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool. The alarm was raised after he failed to arrive for work at Holme House prison.A 16-hour coastal search, involving police, coastguards, aircraft, nine lifeboats and a Royal Navy ship, found no trace of him. Weeks later a paddle was discovered and the wreckage of his canoe.His sons had given up hope of seeing Darwin alive until he walked into a central London police station on December 1 and said: "I think I am a missing person."All he could give the officers was his name, address and age.His wife, Anne, who moved to Panama a few weeks before he resurfaced, said her sons had believed their father was dead.The police are also said to have spoken to Kelly Steele, from Kansas, who was reported to have been asked by Darwin to buy him land. The two were said to have met through the internet.Darwin, 57, and his wife were remanded in custody last week and will appear before Hartlepool magistrates again on January 11. He is charged with dishonestly obtaining £25,000 and making an untrue statement to procure a passport, while his wife is accused of dishonestly obtaining a £25,000 life insurance payment and a policy worth £137,000.
