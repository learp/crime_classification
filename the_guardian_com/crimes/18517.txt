A builders' merchant who today admitted killing and burying thousands of former racing greyhounds on land near his home is to be sentenced at a crown court after magistrates said they could not impose a sufficiently severe penalty.David Smith, 57, admitted to one charge under the Pollution, Prevention and Control Regulations for burying the greyhounds without a permit.Durham magistrates court could have imposed a fine of up to £20,000 or jailed Mr Smith for six months. However, after 45 minutes of deliberation the magistrates told him he would be sent to Durham crown court for sentence at a date yet to be set."We are of the view this was a commercial operation and it was going on for a considerable length of time and was escalating in recent years," the head of the magistrates bench, Vivian Lowe, told him."We feel our powers of punishment are insufficient and we are committing you to the crown court for sentence," she said. The prosecution was brought by the Environment Agency after it was revealed in July last year that Mr Smith could have killed and buried up to 10,000 greyhounds at £10 a time on land near his home in Seaham, County Durham.He received death threats when he was accused of slaughtering the animals using a bolt gun and disposing of the carcasses behind his home.Mr Smith was questioned by police, but it was confirmed the bolt gun used to kill the retired greyhounds was held legitimately. After its own enquiries, the RSPCA concluded there was no indication animal cruelty laws had been broken because the dogs had been killed humanely.However, after a six-month investigation, the Environment Agency said it was taking out a private prosecution against Mr Smith under regulations usually used to restrict the dumping of waste.The regulations, introduced in 2000 following an EU directive, were designed to reduce or prevent emissions to air, land or water.The court heard today that no figure could be put on the number of animals Mr Smith had killed, which he maintained was "nowhere near" 10,000.When the initial allegations against Mr Smith surfaced they led to a storm of national protest. The greyhound racing industry was forced to defend itself amid claims that up to 12,000 retired racing dogs were being put down every year across the country.
