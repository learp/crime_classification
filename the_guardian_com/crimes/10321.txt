The prolific armed robber Michael Wheatley, nicknamed the Skullcracker, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years for offences including armed robbery carried out while on the run from an open prison.Wheatley, 55, was already serving 13 life sentences at Category D Standford Hill prison, on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, for a string of violent robberies when he was granted day release and failed to return on 3 May this year.Before being recaptured he carried out an armed raid on the Chelsea Building Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, on 7 May, pointing a handgun at staff and taking Â£18,350.Wheatley, who was recaptured in Tower Hamlets, east London, after the raid, was sentenced at Guildford crown court on Thursday after pleading guilty to robbery, possession of a firearm or imitation firearm while committing an offence, and being unlawfully at large.The court heard that he had previously robbed the same building society branch 13 years ago, and staff had been told to be on their guard following his break-out. Appearing via video-link from HMP Belmarsh in south-east London, he showed no emotion and sat with his arms folded as the judge, Christopher Critchlow, passed sentence.Critchlow said the case was "special" because of Wheatley's prolific record of violent armed robberies and because of his committing offences after being released.Passing sentence, the judge told him: "You went to the same branch which you robbed in about 2001. You therefore deliberately targeted this branch and planned this raid. You knew exactly what you were doing, having committed such crimes so many times. It is clear the public must be protected from you for a long time."The court heard that Wheatley had 23 previous convictions for robbery, two for attempted robbery and 18 for related firearms offences.He was given his nickname after pistol-whipping innocent bystanders during previous robberies, including a 73-year-old woman.
