The murder conviction of Michael Stone is being reviewed along with several other homicide cases, because of concerns about evidence provided by a Home Office pathologist, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said today.Michael Heath resigned as a pathologist last month after he was criticised by a disciplinary panel for bungling postmortem examinations in August. In his 14-year career he carried out thousands of postmortem examinations in criminal cases.From those cases, five convictions are understood to have given officials cause for concern and are being investigated in more detail. Another four - including that of Stone who is serving life for the murders of Lin and Megan Russell - are being considered for referral to the Court of Appeal.Stone was convicted in 1998 for killing the mother and daughter and received three life sentences. His convictions were quashed in 2001, but he was found guilty again in a retrial later that year. Judges at the court of appeal threw out a second appeal last year.The CCRC commissioner, David Jessel, said Stone's case was one of four involving Dr Heath which were already being considered at the time of his resignation. After doubts were raised about the pathologist's work, Mr Jessel looked through a further 54 cases linked to the pathologist and judged that five would "bear some review".In all of the cases involved, the person convicted had already applied to the CCRC for a review. Mr Jessel said the commission would now be ready to consider any new cases where individuals felt they were wrongfully found guilty because of Dr Heath's evidence.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that in many cases the pathologist was "marginal" to the conviction. But in cases where issues such as the time of death or the nature of the fatal injury were contentious, his evidence could have been decisive."I think I have identified some cases where that sort of issue is at the heart of the application and where, if there is a doubt about the pathologist, that sort of case should be looked at again," he said.
