A minimum price of 45p for a unit will reduce the £42bn a year spent on alcoholic drinks in England and Wales by just over 3% but could curb crime and prevent 714 alcohol-related deaths each year, the Home Office has said.The home secretary, Theresa May, has confirmed in a written statement to the Commons that she also wants to ban supermarket "buy one, get one free" offers and other multi-buy offers that have boosted drink sales by 20-25% in recent years.The ban on cheap multi-buy deals will not apply to pubs, clubs and restaurants and is aimed at curbing binge drinking, especially by teenagers "pre-loading" on very cheap alcohol before they go for an evening out.The introduction of a 45p minimum price for alcohol is likely to be challenged in the courts by the drinks industry under EU competition law. It will disappoint many health and medical campaigners who have been pressing for a 50p minimum.The proposals in the 10-week consultation could mean a four-pack of Tesco strong cider, which was on sale for £2.09 or 22.4p a unit earlier this year would cost at least £4.19; a four-pack of Tesco lager priced at £2.39 or 39p a unit would go up to £3.60, and an £8.72 bottle of Tesco Value vodka would cost £11.79 – an extra £3.07. A bottle of Silver Rock chardonnay wine which was on sale at £3.19 in May would go up to £4.23.The ban on multi-buy promotions in shops and supermarkets would cover two for one deals; three for the price of two; buy one get one free, and buy six 20% off.It would not affect drink discounts that are not linked to buying multiple bottles, so half price or "a third off" offers or cut-price individual items will not be affected as long as they are above the minimum unit price."We are consulting on these measures because too many of our high streets and town centres have become no-go areas on a Friday and Saturday night. Just under half of all violent crimes involve alcohol and a great deal of antisocial behaviour is alcohol-fuelled," May said in her Commons statement.She said the new approach could turn the tide against irresponsible drinking, which costs the taxpayer £21bn a year. "It will help reverse a culture that led to almost 1m alcohol-related violent crimes and 1.2m alcohol-related hospital admissions last year alone," she said.The home secretary stressed that the move was not about stopping sensible, responsible drinking or penalising responsible shops, pubs and off-licences but about explicitly targeting harmful drinkers, problem pubs and irresponsible shops.The new consultation follows the launch of the government's alcohol strategy in March when May floated a 40p minimum unit price and announced pilot schemes for the introduction of US-style sobriety bracelets for those convicted of alcohol-related offences. The results are expected next May.A Home Office impact assessment published alongside the consultation paper says a 45p minimum unit price would cut alcohol consumption by 3.3%, lead to 5,240 fewer crimes each year, reduce hospital admissions by 24,600 and lead to 714 fewer alcohol-related deaths. It would also cost the taxpayer about £200m a year in lost duty revenues.The Home Office estimate is well below the estimate originally drawn up Sheffield University that a 45p minimum would cut consumption by 4.3% and lead to 2,000 fewer deaths.The 45p figure is below the 50p proposed by the Scottish government and the Home Office says it would have to also assess the impact of cross-border shopping if it were to go ahead.The Home Office says that £42bn was spent on alcohol in 2010 in England and Wales and drink prices have been so discounted it is now possible to buy a can of lager for as little as 20p or a two-litre bottle of cider for £1.69. This has led to a 45% rise in home consumption over the last 20 years.Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Alliance UK, said the minimum price should be 50p rather than 45p. He said: "The evidence shows us that heavy drinkers and young drinkers are more affected by higher alcohol prices than moderate drinkers."According to the University of Sheffield, a minimum unit price of 50p would reduce total alcohol consumption by 6.7%, saving around 20,000 hospital admissions in the first year," he said.Alcohol Concern's chief executive, Eric Appleby, added: "We're paying a heavy price for alcohol misuse and setting a minimum unit price will help us on the road to changing this."Evidence shows us that setting the unit price at 50p will have most impact on those vulnerable groups we must protect: the young and heavy drinkers."But we cannot cut the misery caused by excessive drinking, whether it's crime or hospitalisation, through price alone; we need tighter controls around licensing, giving local authorities and police forces all the tools they need to get a firm grip on the way alcohol is being sold in their area."
