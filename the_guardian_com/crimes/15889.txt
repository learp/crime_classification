The two Venezuelans who kidnapped and killed Britons Anthony and Linda O'Malley could have got away with murder, but greed got the better of them.Jorge Real Sierra and his brother-in-law Juan Antonio Velazquez Gonzalez buried the couple beneath a Spanish villa.They had taken thousands of pounds from the couple's bank account and gone on a spending spree with their credit cards. In all, the men took 28,000 euros (£19,000), but it was not enough for Real, who decided to try to swindle more money out of the O'Malleys' anxious relatives. He attempted to contact them to claim the pair had been held hostage, and offered to act as a negotiator for an initial fee of £8,000.It was this inept attempt to cash in, five months after the deaths, that caught the attention of police. Before too long, detectives had tracked down Real as the source of the communication, and he and Velazquez were arrested. At the time, both men were living in a cramped Valencia apartment with their wives and children. Detectives discovered a chaotic scene, described by one as a "fraud factory", with papers belonging to the O'Malleys scattered alongside fake police identification and equipment for making false passports.It was Real who led police to the couple's bodies, and initially pinned the blame on Velazquez, although in court he denied doing either of these.Tonight, languishing in a jail cell, Real may reflect that were it not for his email to the national missing persons helpline claiming to have information about the O'Malleys, he and his brother-in-law would still be at large.At the end of their murder trial, Real, 56, tried to convince three judges hearing the case that he was a small-time crook who had never harmed anyone.But it cannot have helped that, just days earlier, at the start of the trial, he had told a different story.Hunched in a chair before the judges, in an ill-fitting grey pinstriped suit, the bulky, balding Real made an unlikely claim to have been a respectable marketing consultant with a string of major international companies as clients.During the case both he and Velazquez sat facing the judges and with their backs to the public gallery so it was impossible to see their reaction as the evidence piled up against them and their defence fell to pieces.At first, both men tried to distance themselves from a plan to con the O'Malleys by posing as vendors of a property that they were renting, with Velazquez trying to pin the blame on a mystery Briton.Real even enlisted his 17-year-old daughter, Estephanie, to tell the court that he had rowed with her mother and left for Valencia, 80 miles away, the day before the attempted con took place in Alcoy, near Benidorm.But, by the end of the trial, the defendants had both admitted to the plot, while continuing to maintain they did not kidnap and murder the O'Malleys. While Real took the opportunity to stand up and protest that he came from a time when criminals were "more decent" and he was not a violent type, Velazquez stayed silent when asked if he had anything to say at the hearing's end.The slighter, quieter younger man was characterised as stupid by his older relative, who claimed he did not have the capacity to carry out the killings.Meanwhile, Real told the trial: "It's impossible I could have had anything to do with this." The judges disagreed on both counts.
