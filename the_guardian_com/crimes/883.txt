He had suffered a gunshot wound to the head.The jury heard how Gray's partner, Keeley Jones, and the boy were not woken by the shot.Prosecutors said it was a case of mistaken identity as Fieldhouse thought it was his brother in bed with Jones.The judge jailed Fieldhouse for life. He ordered him to serve a minimum of 30 years before he is considered for release.Gray's mother, Jane Gray, said: "The trial has taken over our lives since Lee was killed nearly two years ago."Our lives have been put on hold. Not only does Lee leave behind four children, there is a void left in the hearts of all his family and close friends."Lee was a popular, loving dad and put a smile on everyone's face. These are the memories we will cherish."Detective inspector Kevin Brown of South Yorkshire police, said: "Martin Fieldhouse cold-bloodedly executed Lee Gray while he slept in his bed with his partner and three-year-old son."Throughout the last 18 months Fieldhouse has shown no regret. In fact, he's concocted conspiracy theories that the majority of the witnesses had lied to get him into trouble."Thankfully the jury saw through these lies and found him guilty today."Throughout this time Lee's family and friends have acted with dignity, supporting the police to reach today's conclusion."
