A charity which protects trafficked women yesterday criticised the "lenient" sentences handed out to a gang who lured scores of Malaysian girls to Britain to work as sex slaves in upmarket brothels as part of a Â£2m business.Natalia Dawkins, manager of the Poppy Project, the first organisation in England and Wales to provide shelter for trafficked women, said the five-year term given to Thanh Hue Thi, the mastermind, did not reflect the abuse suffered by the many victims. She also questioned the words of the judge, Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, who described the activities of Thi and his accomplices as creating "mischief". Thi was one of six Malaysian and Vietnamese men sentenced to a total of 17 years at Southwark crown court for conspiracy to traffic for sexual exploitation. Thi worked with his wife, Mee Yoke Pang, 23, to bring hundreds of women from Malaysia over a two-year period, police believe. Some were coerced into travelling to the UK, others were lured on the false promise of being taken on holiday. They were placed in London brothels, and forced to have sex with up to 50 men a week.Thi's accomplice Kenny Lowe was sentenced to three and a half years for conspiracy to traffic. Other members of the gang were given between 15 and 12 months. Thi's wife Pang, whom the court heard was "gravely ill" in hospital, was considered unfit to be sentenced.
