Two young brothers who beat, tortured and abused a pair of younger children on waste ground near Edlington, South Yorkshire, have been refused permission to appeal against their indeterminate sentences.The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice David Clarke and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones at the court of appeal, rejected the applications after a brief hearing and said it had been a "highly exceptional case".Judge said the boys, now aged 11 and 12, had committed "dreadful" crimes and there were no possible grounds for criticising the detention terms.The brothers – who cannot be named for legal reasons and were not in court – were in January given indeterminate sentences with minimum terms of five years for what the trial judge, Mr Justice Keith, described as an "appalling and terrible" attack.The crime, which happened in April last year, was the most notorious committed by British children since James Bulger was murdered in Liverpool in 1993.The attackers, then aged 10 and 11, targeted two local boys aged nine and 11 apparently at random as they rode their BMX bikes in Edlington, near Doncaster, on a Saturday morning.They took their victims to waste ground and subjected them to a 90-minute ordeal during which they were robbed, beaten, stamped on, hit with bricks and other objects and choked and burned. The older boy almost died after part of a ceramic sink was dashed against his head.The victims endured a series of humiliations, many of them sexual.Keith told the brothers they had carried out "prolonged, sadistic violence for no reason other than that you got a real kick out of hurting and humiliating [the victims]".He said: "The bottom line for the two of you is that you both pose a serious risk of harm to others. Your crimes are truly exceptional."Today, Judge said that despite brothers' ages "the level of their culpability was very high".The crime was considered so exceptional that the brothers were tried in an adult hearing at Sheffield crown court.They admitted causing their victims grievous bodily harm with intent, and also pleaded guilty to robbing one of the boys of a mobile phone and the other of cash as well as admitting two counts of intentionally causing a child to engage in sexual activity.The pair admitted causing actual bodily harm to another 11-year-old a week before the attack.The court hearing was told the brothers had been placed in a foster home in Edlington less than three weeks before the attacks.They had grown up in nearby Doncaster with a violent, chaotic family life described by one defence barrister as "toxic".After the case it emerged that a serious case review by Doncaster council found social services and other agencies had missed 31 opportunities to intervene with the boys' family.Last month ministers used emergency measures to take direct control of Doncaster council after it was condemned by auditors as failing, dysfunctional and paralysed by political infighting.
