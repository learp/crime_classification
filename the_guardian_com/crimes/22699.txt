The former Labour MP David Chaytor behind bars tonight beginning an 18-month jail sentence after admitting claiming false parliamentary expenses.Chaytor, who as MP for Bury North tried to cheat taxpayers out of more than £22,000, looked gaunt but impassive as Mr Justice Saunders at Southwark crown court told him the expenses scandal had "shaken public confidence in our legislature" and had "angered the public".The first MP to be convicted and sentenced over the debacle, he was led from a reinforced glass-panelled dock and taken to Wandsworth prison, where he will be held until transferred to an open prison.The 61-year-old may serve just four-and-a-half months if risk-assessed as eligible for the home detention curfew scheme, which could see him released with a tag as early as the end of May.Passing sentence, the judge said a custodial sentence was one of the first steps in restoring public faith in the parliamentary system. He said Chaytor had breached "the high degree of trust" placed in MPs who hold an "important and powerful place in society".He added: "These offences have wider and more important consequences than is to be found in other breach of trust cases. That is the effect they have had and will have on the confidence the public has in politicians."Chaytor pleaded guilty to forging tenancy documents and invoices to claim false expenses for rent and IT work, and received £18,350 of the amount he claimed.An appropriate sentence would be two years, said the judge, and normally a guilty plea at the first opportunity would see a one-third reduction in sentence.But he would only allow a 25% reduction because Chaytor, who had unsuccessfully argued ancient parliamentary rights should see parliament and not the courts hear his case, had also tried to argue that he could not receive a fair trial in the courts because of damaging press coverage. He had pursued that argument after the supreme court ruled his case was not covered by privilege."I do not accept that Mr Chaytor is entitled to maximum discount because, after the decision of the supreme court, he went on to argue that the prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of process as he could not get a fair trial," said Saunders. "Having pursued that argument in the knowledge that he was guilty, Mr Chaytor cannot then argue he has pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity."The former college lecturer now faces a potential six-figure legal bill for his defence and part of the prosecution costs, including several hearings at the high court and supreme court. He has been expelled from the Labour party.Chaytor, of Lumbutts, Todmorden, West Yorkshire, who owns a portfolio of five properties in London and Lancashire, pleaded guilty last month to three counts of false accounting between November 2005 and January 2008. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said he submitted bogus documents to claim £15,275 for renting a flat in Hyde Tower, Regency Street, Westminster, when in fact he and his wife, Sheena, owned it and had paid off the mortgage. Just £12,925 of that claim was paid out.He also falsely claimed £5,425 between September 2007 and January 2008 for renting a cottage in Summerseat, near Bury, Greater Manchester, owned by his elderly mother, Olive Trickett, who had moved to a care home suffering from dementia four months before. She died, aged 81, in May 2009, just as her son's expenses were making headlines. Chaytor had power of attorney for his mother from July 2005.Two invoices totalling £1,950 were submitted for IT support from freelance computer programmer Paul France, a Labour party member and volunteer worker. Dated February and March 2006 and signed "with thanks" by France, they "came as something of a surprise" to France when he learned of the claim, as he had not billed Chaytor for any work."We say Mr Chaytor knew the rules, and we say why else would he produce false documents in support of his claims otherwise," said Wright.James Sturman QC, mitigating, said Chaytor had repaid £19,237, which was more than the money he claimed, and had paid a "quite devastating price" for his errors. The fact he would have been entitled to claim for a second home "has been somewhat lost in the clamour and hysteria surrounding the case".He had displayed "inexplicable stupidly", and forever lost his "hard-earned reputation for integrity", and was almost certainly suffering depression as a result of the "gleeful, gloating, mocking" media coverage, which he had found "debilitating, demoralising and crushing".He was now a broken man. "He accepts he has bought shame on himself, he has brought shame on his family and he has brought shame on parliament."The judge said "humiliation" was an "inevitable consequence" for people with influence who then "defraud the public who elected them"."The public understandably feel cheated by what has happened," he said.Former Barnsley Central Labour MP Eric Illsley is due to go on trial at the same court next week accused of dishonestly claiming £20,000 in council tax and other bills on his second home.Others facing trial over their expenses are former Scunthorpe Labour MP Elliot Morley and former Labour MP for Livingston Jim Devine, as well as Lord Hanningfield and former Tory peer Lord Taylor.
