A grandfather died after confronting a gang of 'hoodies' who were vandalising a neighbour's car outside his home. James Barrett, 62, collapsed after giving chase to a group of teenagers in his bare feet.Witnesses described the father of two running after a five-strong gang who had smashed up a Renault Scenic parked outside his house in the Anfield district of Liverpool.The retired docker was babysitting his two grandchildren at 10.50pm on Friday when he heard a commotion close to his home on Bingley Road. His wife, son and neighbours found him slumped on nearby Priory Road. Barrett died at the Royal Liverpool Hospital within an hour of giving chase to the youths. Police described him as a popular figure in the local community who was being 'a good neighbour'.His wife, Mary, who works in a card shop, said her husband was always helping neighbours and was a fan of Liverpool football club, whose stadium is just two minutes' walk from where he collapsed. 'We are completely shocked and devastated by this,' she said. 'Jim was a wonderful man who would do anything for anyone. He will be greatly missed by all his family and many friends, who will remember him for his kindness, generosity and warmth.'Chief Superintendent Peter Currie from Merseyside Police said the death had led to a major investigation that could still become a murder inquiry. Officers dismissed earlier reports that Barrett had been struck on the back of the head, although he said that they were examining a 'suggestion that one of the youths ran past the victim from behind'.Police were still hunting the youths, who were believed to be aged between 13 and 15 years old, last night. Witnesses said they were wearing tracksuits, some with hooded tops.
