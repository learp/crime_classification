A family has secretly taken photographs of a woman apparently stealing flowers from the grave of a boy who died more than 30 years ago.Steve Rose set up a motion camera in a tree at a cemetery in Barking, east London, so they could monitor the graves of his cousin Robert, who died in car crash at the age of 11 in 1980, and Robert's parents who died later.The pictures appear to show a woman kneeling to pick up flowers and walking off with them in a bag.Rose, 37, told the Barking and Dagenham Post: "I was only six years old when he died."My aunt, who died two years ago, never got over it. That's why it's such a terrible thing for us."He believed the apparent thefts might be random rather than aimed at them specifically, but the family had noticed ornaments regularly went missing."We have left signs asking they stop stealing but that didn't deter them. It's callous."Police are investigating the alleged theft. "Police do understand that thefts of this type are hugely distressing for relatives," said Scotland Yard.A spokesman at Barking and Dagenham council said it was unaware of the incident until it was reported in the local paper. He believed it was a one-off. "It is an issue for the police and we will work with the police."
