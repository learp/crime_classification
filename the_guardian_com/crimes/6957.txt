A mother who was murdered with a bolt gun in front of her children had called the police less than 24 hours before to express fears for her safety.Mary Griffiths, 38, told Suffolk police in the phone call that John McFarlane, a former friend, was stalking her and she was concerned. A few hours later McFarlane smashed through the back door of her home in Bury St Edmunds with an axe as she and her three daughters slept.He shut down the house lights before charging up the stairs and dragged Griffiths from the bedroom where she was sleeping with her 10-year-old daughter.Her 13-year-old girl shouted: "Don't do it, stop it," as McFarlane shot her mother twice in the chest and once in the left shoulder with a bolt gun normally used for stunning livestock.As McFarlane, a slaughterman, was jailed for life today with a recommendation that he serve 20 years, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said an inquiry was examining how Suffolk police reacted to the call from Griffiths on the evening before her murder.After her call arrangements had been made for an officer to visit that evening but the appointment was postponed until the next day.An IPCC spokeswoman said: "The investigation is concentrating on the very questions Mary's family are understandably seeking answers to: how Suffolk police reacted following her non-emergency call the day before her murder reporting harassment, and what information was already known to police about Mary Griffiths and John McFarlane. We are also looking at the police response to calls reporting a disturbance at Mary's home at around 3am the following morning."Outside the Old Bailey in London where McFarlane was sentenced, Griffiths's sister, Louise Scannell, spoke of the family's loss describing her as a "beloved angel" and McFarlane as the "devil incarnate"."The punishment bestowed upon him was not enough to compensate for the loss of Mary's life," she said.
