The public's fragile confidence in the way dangerous offenders are monitored after being released is set to be further undermined by a damning report revealing serious failures in the supervision of a sex attacker who murdered a stranger while out on probation.The report into the murder of Naomi Bryant by Anthony Rice, which was commissioned by the Chief Inspector of Probation, Andrew Bridges, is due to be published this month. It will say the system for co-ordinating those responsible for monitoring Rice did not work properly.It is the first time an official report has identified specific failures within the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa) and is likely to make disturbing reading for the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke. He is under pressure to reassure the public after a recent spate of high-profile murders committed by offenders on probation.Rice killed Bryant, 40, last year, nine months after serving a 16-year sentence for attempted rape, indecent assault and actual bodily harm. He strangled his victim with a pair of tights and then stabbed her in the back and chest 15 times.The report will reveal that Rice was classed as 'low risk' when he should have been given the highest risk rating. It finds serious errors in Rice's monitoring, observing that he was able to abscond from his hostel apparently without anyone noticing, a failure that allowed him to assault a woman in a separate attack.The report will also identify serious communication failures between the different groups responsible for monitoring Rice. These include staff at the Winchester hostel where he was staying, his probation officers and the local police force. It will criticise several individuals involved in Rice's supervisionThe report's findings bear disturbing similarities with another published earlier this year into the murder of London banker John Monckton. The report into Monckton's murder identified a series of failures by the probation officers charged with monitoring his killer, Damien Hanson, who had been released on probation after serving seven years of a 12-year sentence for attempted murder.Last month there was further public consternation when it emerged that several members of the gang who tortured, raped and shot teenager Mary-Ann Leneghan were on probation for minor offences. An inquiry into the murder of Robert Symons by Yusuf Bouhaddaou five weeks after being let out of prison under the supervision of the London Probation Service has yet to publish its findings.There is likely to be further criticism of the public protection system this week when a known paedophile, who raped a nine-year-old girl despite being the subject of a Mappa supervision order, is sentenced. Kevin Hazelwood, 40, will be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court after admitting six counts of rape, two counts of attempted rape and two counts of indecent assault on the young victim who came from Brighton.In response to the public's concerns over the supervision of dangerous offenders, Clarke will unveil a shake-up of probation services on Thursday which could see hundreds of criminals freed on probation returned to prison.The Home Secretary will set out plans to tighten up the 'recall' powers under which those released early can be incarcerated if their behaviour caused concern.Currently, offenders are usually allowed three minor breaches of probation conditions - such as missing a supervisory appointment or breaking a curfew - before action is taken. Even then, the Home Office estimates in one case in 10 rules are not correctly applied.Clarke will also order a tightening up of assessments, with up to 1,000 probation managers summoned to a conference next week to discuss ways of judging risks posed by released offenders. Last year nearly 11,000 prisoners were recalled. With overcrowded jails, campaigners are warning that recalling more could prove counter-productive.Juliet Lyons, of the Prison Reform Trust, said the famous New York 'zero tolerance' experiment, which drastically reduced crime, had reduced recalls.'The prison population went down, and that's because they invested in drug treatment in the community,' Lyons said.
