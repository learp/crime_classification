A man has been convicted of carrying out a campaign of throwing balloons full of excrement at a club used by ex-servicemen and women.Charles McGeary, 49, repeated his foul activities on a number of occasions after reportedly being barred from drinking at the Royal British Legion, in South Shields, South Tyneside.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he “carried out a campaign of filling jars and balloons with excrement, urine and rotten food”.They said from November to January he threw the missiles through the shutters, which exploded on impact and covered the carpet, walls and curtains.Bob Wilson, secretary at the social club, said former servicemen and women would regularly come to the premises.He told the Shields Gazette: “It beggars belief that someone could act in such a disgusting manner against an honourable organisation such as ours which looks after ex-servicemen.“I don’t even want to think about how he got this excrement into the balloons.”McGeary, from South Shields, was given a 12-month probation order and electronically tagged with an attached curfew at South Tyneside magistrates court.He also had to pay the club £1,000 in compensation.
