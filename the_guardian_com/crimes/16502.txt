Harold Shipman, the GP charged with murdering 15 of his patients, pleaded not guilty to five murder charges at Manchester crown court yesterday. Shipman, aged 53, spoke only to confirm his name and answer not guilty in a clear voice to charges of murdering Marie Quinn, aged 67, Ivy Lomas, 63, Irene Turner, 67, Jean Lilley, 58, and Muriel Grimshaw, 76, between July 1996 and November 1997. The trial is to be heard before Mr Justice Forbes and is expected to begin on October 4. A venue has not yet been decided. Shipman has already pleaded not guilty to the murders of Kathleen Grundy, aged 81, Joan Melia, 73, Winifred Mellor, 73, and Bianka Pomfret, 49. During the 63-minute hearing yesterday, the time limit on his being held in custody was extended to October 8. He will appear before Tameside magistrates on March 11 for committal proceedings on charges of murdering six women patients, whose bodies were cremated: Marie West, aged 81. Lizzie Adams, 77, Laura Wagstaff, 81, Norah Nuttall, 65, Pamela Hillier, 68, and Maureen Ward, 57. He will then appear before Manchester crown court on March 26 for a plea and directions hearing. Shipman, of Mottram, Greater Manchester, was first arrested last August after the death of Kathleen Grundy, a former mayoress of Hyde, where he ran a one-man practice. He has also been charged with forging her Â£300,000 will. Police have exhumed 12 bodies from cemeteries in the Tameside area in their investigation.
