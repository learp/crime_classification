A former adviser to the Bishop of Oxford was told by a judge that he faces a jail sentence after pleading guilty to making and possessing indecent images of children.The Rev Richard Thomas, 56, admitted that he downloaded 119 images, most of which were considered less severe. However, a handful of the pictures were classed as level 5, the most severe category. He maintained he had done it inadvertently.The pictures were found by detectives from the Hi-Tech Crime Unit, who raided his home in June last year. Most had been downloaded on the same day in June.The unit had been tipped off by the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation, which discovered Thomas's IP address - the unique address allocated to every machine connected to the internet - among a list of those using a chat page to download pornography.Thomas, the former director of communication for the Oxford diocese, has previously pleaded not guilty to 17 charges of making indecent photographs and three of possession but yesterday at Oxford crown court he changed his plea to guilty to 10 counts of making child pornography and two of possessing it.The remaining seven charges of making the indecent photographs and one of possessing them will lie on the file.Thomas said afterwards that he had developed an addiction to adult pornography and the child images had been downloaded "inadvertently".He said that since experts had been unable to prove either way whether the images had been deliberately downloaded, it was the "responsible" thing to do to plead guilty.Thomas, of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, was bailed until his sentencing on October 20. He was warned by Judge Julian Hall that he could face jail.The acting Bishop of Oxford, the Rt Rev Colin Fletcher, released a statement afterwards, saying that decision about Thomas's future in the diocese would be made after his sentencing.Thomas, a married father who was a senior adviser to the former Bishop of Oxford, Richard Harries, was suspended from his job when he was charged last year. Bishop Fletcher said: "We are saddened that Richard Thomas has been convicted of downloading indecent material from the internet on his home computer. The Church of England and the Diocese of Oxford expects high standards of personal conduct in its staff, and takes issues such as these extremely seriously."After yesterday's hearing Thomas said: "I admit I am addicted to adult pornography but I have never deliberately downloaded images of children."He claimed that he had left his computer switched on and the machine had downloaded the pictures without his knowledge.He said that he was receiving psychiatric treatment for his addiction and added that he was "not a paedophile and will defend myself vigorously against any suggestion that I am".
