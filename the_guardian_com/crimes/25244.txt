A mentally ill man who stabbed a police constable and two worshippers at a mosque was insane at the time of the offences, a jury has ruled.Jurors deliberated over two days before returning verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity on Mohamoud Elmi, who now faces a potentially indefinite period of detention in a secure hospital.In reaching its verdicts the jury, sitting at Birmingham crown court, decided Elmi committed acts that amounted to attempted murder and wounding.During the three-day trial jurors were told the 32-year-old had previously been treated for mental health problems but was discharged into the community before the stabbings in Ward End, Birmingham, in June last year.The trial heard how Elmi calmly walked away from a frenzied late-night attack on two fellow worshippers at the mosque to pay a visit to a wash room.Elmi then returned to a prayer area at the mosque before repeatedly stabbing a police constable, who attempted to subdue him with a taser.
