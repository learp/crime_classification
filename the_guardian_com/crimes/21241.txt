A 24-year-old man and a 15-year-old youth were arrested yesterday by police investigating the murder of a woman jogger in February and the attempted murder of another female runner earlier this month.The arrests were made by officers investigating the fatal stabbing of Margaret Muller, a 27-year-old American artist, who was killed while jogging in Victoria Park, Hackney, east London on February 3. Another woman, 39, survived a stabbing two miles away in Clissold Park, Stoke Newington, on December 5, which officers had linked to Muller's murder. Scotland Yard said a 24-year-old man had been arrested at his home in Stoke Newington in connection with the murder of Muller and attempted murder of the other woman. A 15-year-old male was also arrested at his home in Stoke Newington in connection with the two incidents. Both were being questioned at different, north London police stations. Police had said the attacker looked for slightly built females in surroundings which allowed him to blend in. Muller was 4ft 11in (130cm) and the Clissold Park victim is 5ft 4in (162cm). Neither was sexually assaulted or robbed. The 39-year-old victim who survived was stabbed several times in the torso during the attack on a Friday afternoon and suffered a severed artery and serious wounds. She ran about 100 metres before collapsing beside a doctor out walking in the park, who saved her by stemming the bleeding. Officers had been anxious that the attacker could strike again and had stepped up patrols in the area and warned female joggers not to run alone. Two men arrested in connection with the murder in March were released without charges. A third, detained in June, was also freed.
