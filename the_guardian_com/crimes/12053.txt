Police have quashed fears of a fresh letter bombing campaign against Celtic fans and Catholics after the discovery of a fifth parcel bomb by police in Northern Ireland.Strathclyde police said the latest device, which came to light on Tuesday in a police station in Belfast, had been posted in late March at the same time as other incendiary bombs were sent to the Celtic football club manager Neil Lennon and the former Labour MSP Trish Godman.They said the device – described as "certainly viable" – had been posted in Scotland. It is believed to be very similar to the four parcel bombs sent to Lennon, Godman and Lennon's lawyer, Paul McBride, over a seven-week period in March and April."Naturally, the public are going to be concerned about the latest discovery. However, we would like to emphasise that this device is not a new one – it entered the postal system at the end of March, around the same time as two of the other packages," said Superintendent Ruaraidh Nicolson, Strathclyde's head of community safety.There was a two-week delay before police in Belfast discovered the device was a threat and it was linked to the investigation in Glasgow into the letter bombing campaign.The parcel was sent to an Irish republican group, Cairde Na hÉireann (Friends of Ireland), which organises and promotes republican parades in Scotland from offices in the east end of Glasgow.The parcel was wrongly addressed and diverted to the Royal Mail's UK-wide national return letter centre in Belfast, where staff raised concerns and alerted the Police Service of Northern Ireland on 12 April.The PSNI took the package to Musgrave Street police station, where they declared it safe. However, after Strathclyde issued a nationwide alert to all UK police forces, the device was re-examined by army technical officers and found to be viable, leading to a major security alert.Strathclyde police confirmed there was "nothing to suggest any link to Belfast or indeed Northern Ireland", but added: "Early investigation of the package indicates it is similar to the ones already being investigated and has been designed to cause fear, alarm and furthermore real harm. Strathclyde police would like to stress, however, that there is no danger to the general public, but would urge people to be vigilant."Nicolson stepped up his appeal for witnesses to come forward and appealed directly to anyone who knew the bombers to contact the police. "The support and co-operation from the public has also been extremely positive," he said. "However, I would like to stress that the answers lie out there and we need as much information from the wider public as possible. Someone out there knows who is behind this irresponsible and appalling crime and we will continue to work round the clock until the individual or individuals are brought to justice."The investigators are urging a couple in the early 20s who boarded a bus near the post box used by the bomber in Kilwinning in north Ayrshire on 15 April to come forward. The couple have been tracked using CCTV footage to Glasgow central station, but have yet to volunteer for interview."It is imperative that this couple come forward," Nicolson said. "I would like to stress that they are merely witnesses; however, any information they have could be helpful to the investigation. They may think that they didn't see anything of relevance; however, I would say let us be the judge of that."
