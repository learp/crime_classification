A parent has been stabbed outside the gates of a primary school after a row reportedly erupted over parking.He was seen arguing with a man and a woman as parents waited to collect their children from North Walkden primary school in Walkden, Greater Manchester, before he was repeatedly stabbed, police said.He staggered inside the school to ask for help and was taken by ambulance to Manchester Royal Infirmary with serious stab wounds.Police said young children were among those who witnessed the stabbing at 3.30pm on Friday.A search has been launched for the couple after they left the scene in a silver Vauxhall Corsa.DI Ben Hart said: “This incident has only just happened so we are not going to speculate on exactly what led to the man receiving stab wounds.“We can say that this happened outside a busy primary school as parents were gathered to pick up their children so it would have been a distressing and disturbing thing for people to see.“I want to reassure them that we are in the early stages of a thorough investigation and we are actively looking for the offenders now. If anyone saw the incident or saw a silver Corsa driving away from the scene then I want to hear from you.“We have spoken to the school and to the local authority and we are all working to support the school, its children and their parents.”Local residents told the Manchester Evening News that the argument had broken out over parking outside the busy school.A man, who asked not to be named, told the newspaper: “There was two men wrestling over a car and the dad said: ‘Help me’.“I dragged the other guy off and he drove away in a silver Corsa.“The guy had been stabbed once in the chest and once in each side. I don’t think he realised he’d been stabbed as he started walking home and I said: ‘What are you doing?’ It was a lock knife with holes in the side. The injuries were bad.”Police said the man is in a stable condition.
