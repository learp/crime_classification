The crisis engulfing broadcasters including ITV, Channel 4 and now Channel Five over premium-rate interactive services deepened yesterday as regulators warned that police could become involved and MPs said the affair had destroyed the credibility of the industry.Five yesterday followed the lead of ITV in hurriedly pulling all viewer quizzes, votes and competitions from the air after concerns that viewers had been conned.It emerged last night that the three broadcasters' chiefs - ITV executive chairman Michael Grade, Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan and Five chief executive Jane Lighting - will appear before the Commons media select committee to tell MPs what they knew and when.The move came as chairman John Whittingdale, whose committee scrutinised the quiz TV sector this year, said that viewers' confidence in the industry was being eroded. He said: "We lifted up a stone and since then every day has brought fresh revelations. It's got to the stage where it's beginning to bring the entire industry into disrepute. Their credibility has been completely destroyed. Nobody in their right mind would enter one of these things at the moment."His remarks came as it emerged that Big Brother producer Endemol was responsible for perhaps the most serious case yet with a programme made for Five which faked phone-in winners to encourage more callers.Even as the premium phone line regulator Icstis unveiled measures designed to restore viewer confidence, Ms Lighting said she was "shocked and disappointed" after Brainteaser, a lunchtime show made by Endemol subsidiary Cheetah Television, admitted the names of some winners were faked. On one occasion a member of the production team went on air to pose as a winning contestant.It will now join a list of programmes under investigation that already includes Channel 4's Richard and Judy, BBC1's Saturday Kitchen and ITV's Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, Soapstar Superstar and I'm a Celebrity.They face a variety of charges, some more serious than others, of misleading viewers in order to maximise call volumes. In the additional case of X-Factor, human error was blamed for a data inputting mistake that led to viewers voting via the red button being overcharged by £200,000.Broadcasters routinely charge up to £1 a time to vote in programmes such as X-Factor and Dancing on Ice or enter quizzes during live programmes. The burgeoning sub-genre of quiz TV, in which viewers are encouraged to call in with the answers to superficially easy quizzes but only a fraction get through, is also under suspicion.Following an urgently convened meeting with more than 20 broadcasters, producers and telecom service providers, the chairman of Icstis, Sir Alistair Graham, said yesterday they had got themselves into "a pretty grim mess" and promised to involve the police if there was any evidence of fraud."If we find any evidence that a criminal offence has occurred, we have very close links with the City of London police force and I can assure you that we will refer any such evidence to the police," he said.Mr Whittingdale said: "If someone has been encouraged to call in and take part in a competition that there is no possi bility of them winning then that, in my view, is fraud and the police should be brought in."Industry insiders insist that the mistakes are "cock up rather than conspiracy" and remain confident any transgressions will be dealt with by the regulator rather than the police. But they conceded that, at the least, large fines were inevitable if the allegations were proved. They are also resigned to further problems emerging as broadcasters go back through their records.Sir Alistair promised to take swift and strict action to restore public trust in so-called participation TV formats and rejected suggestions that Icstis had been too slow to spot the problems. He pointed to the review of quiz channels that was already under way when the latest scandal broke and the prompt action since.He ordered all broadcasters and their partners to review their current and forthcoming shows to ensure there was "no risk of consumer harm" within the next fortnight.He also unveiled measures including a system of "systematic monitoring" by the regulator and the introduction of a new licensing regime that will pinpoint where responsibility for compliance with the Icstis code lies.Compliance has emerged as a grey area with producers such as Cactus, which makes Richard and Judy and Saturday Kitchen, and telecom services providers such as Eckoh, which provides services to both programmes, blaming each other.The introduction of a new kite mark is also likely to show viewers that phone-ins comply with the new licensing body.Under the quiz channel review, broadcasters are likely to be told to give viewers the odds of getting through when they call, a measure recommended by a Commons select committee report this year.Sir Alistair denied that the regulator should have been more proactive in keeping tabs on the burgeoning trend in recent years. "I don't get the feeling that we have a situation where the industry is running around trying to hide things. I have no evidence to suggest...a massive cover-up."Five, like ITV, has appointed an external auditor to look into all its premium-rate viewer participation after Endemol uncovered the problem with Brainteaser. The problem arose when the daily show asked viewers to solve a word puzzle within five minutes."When the five minute window and the phone lines had closed, Cheetah Television, working through a list of callers supplied by the phone service provider, were unable to find a caller with the correct answer before the winner was due to be announced on air," said Five."Instead of informing viewers that no winning caller had been found in the time period available, the production company put fictional names on screen as winners. On one occasion a member of the production team went on air as a 'winning' contestant."Endemol UK said it "apologised unreservedly" for the fiasco and supported the decision to take the show off air. ITV temporarily withdrew all interactivity and hauled ITV Play off air earlier this week and Channel 4 has removed Richard and Judy quiz You Say We Pay from the programme pending its own internal inquiry.
