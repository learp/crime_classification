People in long-term relationships who live apart are almost three times as likely to be burgled as couples who share a home, according to one insurer.A survey of 2,000 people commissioned by Halifax Home Insurance and carried out between July and August found that 23% of people in relationships longer than two years and living separately have suffered a break-in. But just 8% of couples who live together said they had been burgled.On a national scale, this would mean 980,000 couples with separate homes were victims of a burglary, costing them a combined £2.6bn over the past five years. According to insurance claims data from Halifax, the average claim for a break-in is £2,687.A spokesman for Halifax Home Insurance said: "Couples adopting this lifestyle are putting themselves at significant risk of burglary, as they leave their respective homes unoccupied for 40 evening hours per week while staying at their partner's house."In light of the findings we would urge these couples to ensure they have adequate home insurance cover in place for both homes, and advise that they take all of the necessary security precautions to protect their properties."But he added that insurance premiums would not be affected because the number of occupants at a property was already factored into assessments.Of the 2,000 people surveyed, 1,640 (82%) said they were in a relationship. Of these, 91 (5.6%) said they had been together for more than two years but did not live with their partner, up from 3.9% 10 years ago.The research also uncovered reasons why people delay the seminal moving in moment: nearly two-thirds of couples aged under 25 did not want to rush into sharing a home, while half of people aged over 35 said they shared too many possessions to fit under one roof.People in the countryside also appear more reluctant to move in with their partners than city dwellers. People in relationships living in rural areas are together 22 months before they live with one another, compared to 19.5 months for urban residents.Couples in the West Midlands and Birmingham average just 18 months before living together, while the Welsh keep their partners waiting 26 months.Martyn Foulds, senior claims manager at Halifax Home Insurance, said: "A valued sense of independence appears to be the main reason that couples are now taking longer to move in together. However, we would advise people to make sure their own properties are fully secure if regularly staying away from home."Graeme Trudgill of the British Insurance Brokers' Association recommended people install security measures, such as a burglar alarm or lights, to keep their homes safe. He also said they should contact their insurer if their properties are unoccupied for a long period of time as some home contents insurance policies only allow up to 30 days of vacancy.
