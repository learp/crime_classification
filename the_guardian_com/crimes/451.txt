Three men involved in dumping the body of a man in a canal and emptying his bank account have been jailed.The body of Sebastiano Magnanini was found tied to a submerged shopping trolley in Regent’s canal in north London last year.The 46-year-old, originally from Venice, had travelled to London in August in the hope of pursuing a career in journalism. He had previously been jailed in his 20s for stealing a £1m painting, worked as a tour guide in Cambodia, a carpenter in south London and a roadie for Prince.Michael Walsh, 41, and Paul Williams, 64, appeared at Blackfriars crown court for sentencing on Tuesday after pleading guilty to preventing the lawful burial of a body.

The court heard that Williams has bone marrow cancer and a heart condition.James Elvidge, defending Hastie, told the court the 22-year-old, who has autism, knew the dead man because he was “friendly” and “generous”.He said his client helped the homeless people around Euston and King’s Cross, but was motivated by greed and the promise of new trainers and a tracksuit.“If he had known it was his [Magnanini’s] card and what happened he would never have included himself in the fraud,” said Elvidge.Sentencing the trio, Judge John Hillen called the act of preventing the lawful burial of a body a serious and distasteful offence that had caused great distress to Magnanini’s family.He sentenced Walsh to four years in jail, Williams to two years and Hastie to 12 months.
