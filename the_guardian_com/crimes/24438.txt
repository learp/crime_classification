Police yesterday released an e-fit image of a man seen running from the scene of the murder of two French students who were bound, stabbed to death and set alight in a bedsit, as they again appealed for witnesses.Tests are being carried out on a piece of clothing discovered during painstaking searches near the flat in New Cross where Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, died in the brutal attack last Sunday. Detectives have also contacted the men's banks to see if their credit and debit cards have been used since their deaths as they investigate whether the pair were tortured for their pin numbers. They had been gagged and stabbed more than 200 times over several hours and the detective in charge of the inquiry said their injuries were the worst he had ever seen.A 21-year-old man arrested on Saturday over the deaths was freed without charge yesterday afternoon. The e-fit image of an individual seen by several people fleeing the scene shows a white man aged 30 to 40, wearing a pale baseball cap. He was dressed in a dark top, blue jeans and white trainers.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "One item of clothing has been recovered and has been submitted for examination."Yesterday Ferez's parents, Francoise and Olivier Ferez, appealed to the British public to help catch the killer, saying: "You will not be able to live in hiding for ever."They added: "As parents, we need the police to find the guilty parties for us to have some kind of explanation." Ferez and Bonomo were living in London while they worked on biochemistry research projects at Imperial College. They were in the second year of studying for a three-year master's degree at the Polytech' Clermont-Ferrand in central France, where a silent procession in their memory will be held today.
