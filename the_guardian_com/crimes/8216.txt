The government was today accused of issuing contradictory welfare polices after one cabinet minister pledged new shelters for homeless young people, while another threatened to evict them if they commit antisocial behaviour.The communities secretary, Ruth Kelly, urged charities and councils to set up new lodging schemes for young people who have been thrown out of the family home.As she was speaking, the home secretary, John Reid, said he wanted new powers to evict people within 48 hours for persistent antisocial behaviour.The charity Shelter said Mr Reid's proposals will create more homelessness.Its chief executive, Adam Sampson, said: "The government seems to be giving with one hand and taking with the other. Throwing people out of their homes only exacerbates the problem and does nothing to really tackle the root causes of antisocial behaviour.""John Reid's proposal will only create homelessness and move the problem from one neighbourhood to another.Speaking two days before the 40th anniversary of the influential television drama Cathy Come Home, Ms Kelly claimed that the government had "turned the tide" on homelessness."Cathy has come in, off the street," Ms Kelly said. "But now we must meet new challenges and deal with the changing nature of homelessness.""I have no doubt that Cathy's chances today would be significantly better, with support, advice and the likelihood of a settled home.""But we have serious challenges to face, and we must not lose momentum. These are the issues on which our society should be judged."Shelter, which was set up in response to the documentary, welcomed the pledge on teenagers but took issue with Ms Kelly's assessment of the progress on tackling homelessness.Mr Sampson said: "Cathy Come Home highlighted the tragic effect on young families of having nowhere to call home - yet today there are still more than one million children trapped by bad housing or homelessness."Ms Kelly promised to end the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless teenagers, describing the practice as "unacceptable for a civilised society".She said the problem often arose when parents refused to have their teenage children at home.Measures to combat this will include councils and local partners setting up supported lodging schemes to provide advice and mediation, as well as accommodation, for young people."Mediation in particular might help many young people return to their family home, or make a successful transition to the next stage of their life," Ms Kelly said.Shelter is calling on the government to almost double the amount of affordable rented homes built each year.Mr Sampson said: "To lift today's Cathys and their children out of the nightmare of bad housing, the Treasury must commit to funding 20,000 extra social homes each year."
