Charles Clarke has launched a twin-pronged fightback to rehabilitate his record as home secretary following his sacking by the prime minister last month.In his first intervention in frontline politics since returning to the backbenches, Mr Clarke has written to the home affairs select committee, defending his role in the foreign prisoners affair.And he has given an interview to tonight's BBC's flagship Newsnight programme, in which he is believed to have both defended his 16-month tenure at the Home Office and put the case for Labour "renewal".Although Mr Clarke and Tony Blair have been friends since their time as neighbours in Hackney in the early 1980s, his decision to refuse other jobs when he was demoted from the Home Office, and to now defend his handling of the foreign prisoners brief, will cause alarm in Downing Street.In his written submission to the home affairs select committee Mr Clarke denies that he was personally aware of the situation on foreign prisoners not considered for deportation in July 2005.He also blames "confusion" in the media for exacerbating the row.His successor, John Reid, immediately dubbed his department as "not fit for purpose" after becoming home secretary and said his "head was on the block" to reform it.In his evidence to the committee, Mr Clarke sets out the measures he took once he had learned foreign prisoners were being freed without being considered for deportation. He claims the media confused two issues: "the number of foreign national prisoners [FNPs] currently held within the prison system and how best to deal with them". The second was "the fact that a number of foreign national prisoners were released from prison at the end of their term but not considered for deportation as they should have been". He adds: "Some of the allegations, particularly in the media, which appeared as matters unfolded arose from confusion between the two issues. "I was probably responsible, at least in part, for some of this confusion because I was mindful of my duties as home secretary and thought that it was important and proper that I should take overall responsibility. "However, the suggestion that from July 2005 I had personally known about the failure to consider deportation and done nothing about it was wrong. "As others have already made clear to the committee, it was only in late March 2006 that ministers, including myself, were made aware of the failure to consider for deportation some foreign national prisoners at the end of their sentence, and when we were aware of this action was then taken." Mr Clarke insists he was well aware of the issue of FNPs immediately from taking over the home affairs post in December 2004, but that "I have to say this was only one of the many pressing issues and concerns within the prison and probation system". But he blames a "key Home Office fault-line" - the relationship between prisons and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) - for disguising the extent of the problem. In a seeming dig at the PM, Mr Clarke writes that he met Mr Blair to discuss the "broad issue" of foreign prisoners in November 2005 and that "as I am sure the record of that meeting would show, I explained to him that I was urgently exploring options for reducing the number of foreign nationals in prisons and said I would come back to this when firm proposals had been developed ...." The PM had to deny reports at the time of the May reshuffle that he had been in tears when sacking Mr Clarke. The Norwich MP then told his local paper that it was "not the best of reshuffles".He is believed to have been offered a series of "consolation" jobs, such as defence secretary, but turned them down.According to some weekend reports, Mr Clarke is allegedly "seething" that he was appointed to restore medium-long term thinking to the Home Office, then sacked as Downing Street panicked over a short term tabloid-led agenda.
