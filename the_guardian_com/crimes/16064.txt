A government campaign is to be launched today to recruit 84 members of the public to help oversee supervision arrangements for paedophiles and other sexual and violent offenders.The unpaid lay advisers are being introduced as a result of the success of eight pilot schemes started iafter the murder of Sarah Payne in July 2000. Paul Goggins, a Home Office minister, said the advisers would sit on local management boards which monitor the supervision arranged by panels of professionals including police and probation officers. "Managing high-risk sexual and violent offenders in the community will always need professional and sensitive handling," said Mr Goggins. "Multi-agency public protection arrangements have already proved to be a success and we believe this is another important step in ensuring the best possible management of these offenders." He said there was a commitment to giving the advisers not only an insight into the supervision of sex offenders but also an opportunity to question what was being done. The advisers will be recruited by media advertisements and will be expected to attend at least four meetings of one of the 42 strategic management boards each year.
