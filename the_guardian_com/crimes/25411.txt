The City of London police have reopened their investigation into the death of the Italian banker Roberto Calvi, who was found hanging under Blackfriars bridge in 1982.Calvi was first thought to have killed himself, but Italian prosecutors now plan to prosecute four people for his murder. In the light of that, the City police said yesterday that the case was being "actively investigated" using scientific techniques that were not available in 1982. Calvi died after being implicated in an Italian banking scandal. His body was found within days of the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, of which he was president and in which the Vatican's bank held a significant stake. The banker's family has long contended that he was murdered, but a London coroner's jury could not decide whether the death was suicide or murder. Last year a panel of forensic experts appointed by a Rome tribunal to examine new evidence, concluded that he was killed. The panel could not find any injuries to Calvi's neck associated with death by hanging.
