Local people are to be given the power to decide what work community punishment offenders should do in their neighbourhood, under plans to be announced tomorrow by David Blunkett, the home secretary.The scheme will feature in a campaign across England in February and March in which convicted offenders on community punishment orders will be ordered to clear rubbish off derelict sites, clean off graffiti and carry out other unpaid community work. It is part of Mr Blunkett's wider "civil renewal" agenda which will see an action plan next year detailing how local people are to be given a say over wider aspects of the criminal justice system, and on how to regenerate their neighbourhoods, and to make the best use of local schools. A new "community justice court" based in Liverpool to deal with lower-level crime and anti-social behaviour will hear its first case tomorrow. Residents are to be consulted to ensure that the court's punishments are tailored to improving their quality of life. The Â£3m community justice centre, which is modelled on the Red Hook centre in Brooklyn, New York, provides on the spot drug treatment, restora tive justice and debt counselling for offenders. The initiative follows the announcement by Mr Blunkett yesterday that he is to introduce powers to make the parents of young vandals under 10 pay compensation for damage their children do. He told MPs during the Commons debate on the second reading of the serious and organised crime and police bill that he will include the compensation measure in the legislation. "It will encourage young thugs and their parents to learn that actions have consequences and appreciate the impact on victims," he said.
