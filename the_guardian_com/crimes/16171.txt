An 18-year-old man will appear in court today charged with the murder of a nurse who was stabbed to death while on a cigarette break outside the hospital where she worked. Stuart Harling, from Rainham, Essex, was arrested on Friday after the discovery of a blue sports bag near the scene of the murder. He was charged with murder last night.Cheryl Moss, 33, died from multiple stab wounds in a woodland popular with dog walkers behind St George's hospital in Hornchurch, Essex, where she worked as a nurse. Her body was found by a passerby just after 11am on Thursday.Detectives yesterday asked for two youths seen talking to a wigged man at about 10.45am on Thursday, just 20 minutes before police were called to the scene of the murder, to come forward.They were riding on a motorised scooter through the park and were believed to have stopped to chat with him.Police said the man had been hanging around the park for several days before the killing. After the attack staff at St George's were reportedly warned by bosses to watch out for a man in a wig and tracksuit trousers. The suspect is not believed to be related to Mrs Moss and police have said the attack was probably random.Mrs Moss, who had been an auxiliary nurse for 17 years and had worked at the hospital for 10, lived with her husband in Dagenham. Her brother, Chris Ewart, 39, said his sister had been "having the time of her life" before the killing. "She was easygoing, she got on with people, she didn't deserve this, no one deserves what happened to her," he said.Mr Harling, a trainee accountant, is due to appear at Enfield magistrates court today.
