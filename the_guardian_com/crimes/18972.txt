Two teenagers were today sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in jail for the murder of a 16-year-old schoolboy.Kodjo Yenga was left dying in his girlfriend's arms after he was stabbed in the heart in a quiet London street.His mother said today she was "broken" by the "overwhelming pain" of her son's murder.Kodjo had been ambushed by about a dozen youngsters armed with knives and bats. Members of the gang gave chase, shouting "kill him, kill him" before attacking him in front of horrified onlookers in March 2007 in Hammersmith. The gang then ran away laughing.Today at the Old Bailey Judge Christopher Moss ordered that Tirrell Davis, 17, and Brandon Richmond, 14, should be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure. Three other teenagers — Yemoh Kurtis, 17, Jamel Bridgeman, 15, and Michel Williams, 15 — were sentenced to 10 years' detention. Judge Moss told them: "You were all part of the gang culture which casts its dreadful influence and leads to the sort of tragedy we have seen here. "All of you come from decent and caring backgrounds which makes the situation all the more worrying."The five defendants, who were part of the local MDP gang, all denied killing Kodjo.In a statement read out in court Kodjo's mother, Ladjua Lesele, said her son's killers were "cold-blooded children" who had "tormented" him before stabbing him.She said: "I only have one thing to say to those who murdered Kodjo — as you spilled and touched his blood, no matter how many times you wash your hands, his blood will stay on them for as long as you live."I stand before you as a broken mother whose prayers, dreams and hopes for the bright future of her beloved son were cruelly and needlessly crushed when he was brutally murdered." She also appealed to young people to stop carrying guns and knives.Youngsters should "think about the ripples of pain you leave eternally with the family whose loved one you thoughtlessly killed in a moment of madness that will also change your life forever", she said.
