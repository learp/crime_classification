A 19-month-old child was killed yesterday when a stolen Jeep hit his pushchair while being walked by his mother in south-east London. Three teenagers ran off after the Jeep Wrangler they were in collided with a tree in Southwark before hitting the child. He died in hospital.His mother was also carrying a baby boy, thought to be a few weeks old, who was treated for minor injuries in hospital. Two 14-year-olds were arrested soon after the incident and were last night being questioned by police.Zoe Walsh, a teenager who lives close to Rolls Road in Southwark where the collision happened, said that passers-by had tried to resuscitate the child. "I was in my living room with my friends and I heard a big scream from a woman," she said. "I came out and found a car had gone into a little kid's body."About 15 men came out and tried to pull the car away. It took about five minutes for them to pull it away. The mum was hysterical. She was nearly on the floor. She kept crying. She kept falling over and she was really upset."A woman who said she was a friend of the dead child's relatives said that his family were devastated. "They were just coming home from school and her little boy has been killed." Angel Jappie, a neighbour of the family, said that gangs of youths often raced stolen cars on estates surrounding Rolls Road, and she was surprised there had not been an accident before.Police said two of the teenagers sought over the incident were aged 14 to 18, white, and 5ft 5in to 5ft 8in tall; one wore navy tracksuit bottoms and a hooded top, the other a light coloured tracksuit. The third youth sought was Asian.
