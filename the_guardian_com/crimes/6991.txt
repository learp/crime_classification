A congregation gathered yesterday to remember the murdered black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, was told that politicians who used "loaded" words in the debate about asylum seekers ought to be ashamed of themselves.In his sermon at Trinity Methodist church, in Plumstead, south-east London, the Rev David Cruise praised the tireless work of Stephen's parents, Neville and Doreen in keeping his death in the public eye. He said it had reaped benefits for society as a whole. The Rev Cruise told the 200-strong congregation: "We are thankful that there has been some progress, and more people are becoming equal in front of the law and the law is becoming less colour-blind." But in a warning to politicians he said: "It is sad that in the last few weeks we have heard the use of loaded words, words such as bogus. Politicians who use those words ought to be ashamed of themselves. They do no credit to a just society. Those words will stir up a bad feeling. If the local government elections are tarnished by racism they will have themselves to blame." Mr Cruise, a minister at the Marylebone Methodist church, central London, also criticised the police for failing to keep the Lawrences informed of developments in the search for their son's killers. Last week a knife and metal bar were discovered in the garden of a former address of two of the suspects in the murder inquiry. The congregation was told that the Lawrences had learned of this latest development from the newspapers. The memorial service has been private since Stephen was murdered in April 1993 in Eltham, south-east London. The decision to allow in the public, Mr Cruise said, was to strike a positive note and allow more people to celebrate his life.
