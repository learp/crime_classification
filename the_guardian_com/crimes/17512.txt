A former mayor who had an "active interest in pyrotechnics" was jailed for 18 years today after he was found guilty of setting off dangerous explosions in his own neighbourhood.John Larsen got a "thrill" from setting off the blasts, some of which sent ball bearings and metal shrapnel flying up to 90ft (27 metres) away, a court heard.Larsen, 46, of Lenten Pool, Denbigh, was convicted of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life, and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life, by a jury of six men and six women at Caernarfon crown court.Judge Merfyn Hughes QC sentenced him to a total of 18 years in prison.The trial heard that Larsen made an improvised explosive device which he used to blow up a car near his home. He was behind a string of explosions which had been causing fear in the community.In his opening address, Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, said that after Larsen's arrest on 19 April this year, police found computer files of his holding research on making explosives; he had been actively "experimenting". One file was named "gunpowder mix", another "experimentation" - that file had notes on charges, fuses, flash powder, "rockets and shells," and notes about various chemicals.
