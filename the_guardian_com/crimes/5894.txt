The ruthless vicious murder of our children and young people as signified by the recent murders of Steven Bigby and 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen, can never simply be defined as two polarised opposites, there are processes in between, where the needs of children and young people have been neglected and thus society needs to take responsibility for what has happened.The police have applied their kneejerk response, deploying their historically failed power of "stop and search", without the need for "reasonable suspicion", which is more likely to lead to alienation than arrest, probably at best temporarily burying the problem underground. Meanwhile, we will all have to wake up out of our gormless sleep that we are all guilty of the current phenomenon that young people are more likely to be victims than the perpetrators of violent crime.Paul Gilroy has appropriately summed up the phenomenon of violent gun and knife crime:"Is anybody brave enough to accept that those murderous boys with their guns (and for that matter knifes) are an entirely home-grown phenomenon and need to be approached as such? They learned their selfishness from Mrs Thatcher, their ruthlessness on the games console, their studied ignorance from the media, and their love of the bling-bling life from the celebrity culture that has debased our civil society."Thus, as a result of media focus, we are now constantly faced with the vexed question of "why are our young people carrying knives, guns and other dangerous weapons and why are they using them?" there are no easy answers and sadly more young people will be brutally murdered before we find out.What is clear is that we have to address the societal problems that leave the mindset of some young people more vulnerable to the scourge of knife and gun violence.Young people are living in urban environments where, after three decades of urban regeneration, the physical fabric has changed, but the life chances of those within its confines have not. Instead the contractors have benefited, while too many of its young people are, as Gilroy says, "struggling creatively to make something of themselves in the most difficult and restrictive of circumstances".Research commissioned by the London Child Poverty Commission highlights the links between intergenerational poverty, access to crime and the lack of achievement through missed educational opportunities. It is sadly the case that one in three children are still living in poverty in the UK with many people struggling to make ends meet.IPPR research findings state that children from wealthier families were more likely to spend time in organised or educational activities that are associated with greater personal and social development. Thus, while better-off parents are able to buy activities that are likely to increase their children's life chances, too many poorer children are excluded from these developmental opportunities.When compared with the greater influence they have with their family and friends, young people do not feel listened to when it comes to changes at schools, their local neighbourhood or community, whom have simply not engaged them or asked them for their views. This is a significant gap and more needs to be done to instil a sense of community, unity and sense of belonging, which are the basic building blocks to a more inclusive society. There should be no room in society for young people to feel a lack of power and alienation.As part of the collective challenge and responsibility, schools have a particular contribution to ensure that all young people are equipped as citizens to succeed in the global competitive labour market. Significant more progress needs to be made to "narrow the gap" in attainment - including for children on free school meals, for working-class boys and for children of African-Caribbean heritage.In London, there are a number of things that the new mayor, Boris Johnson, will inherit that can tackle the problem head on. For example, the mayor has responsibility for London's 2007-13 European structural fund programmes, managed through the London Development Agency. It is important that as well as supporting skills and employment related funding for 14- to 19-year-olds "not in education, employment and training" that support is directed to end the disproportionate effects of generational unemployment and discrimination. Giving the most vulnerable and their families' access to worthwhile quality jobs will also help.In terms of policing, I agree with Brian Paddick that individuals and communities know who the perpetrators are, even before they have committed a deadly act; thus we have to create a situation where the communities themselves are prepared to shun those carrying dangerous weapons. We might then perhaps get a more intelligence-led, proactive and targeted response from the police, who after all are only as effective as the trust and confidence they build with communities. The results will inevitably be lasting and longer term and lead to the true meaning of "policing by consent".As a board member of London Crimestoppers, the voluntary organisation established to enable individuals to report anonymously, we are looking at more innovative ways to dismantle the historical barriers, including charges of elitism, so as to enable communities to take the most dangerous off our streets and hand them in. In my view, this will inevitably mean finding ways to open up such services to children and young people.Voluntary and community organisations who are doing so much with so little are seeking to redress the balance, through their innovative programmes that provide much-needed leadership, direction and positive role modelling. Young people are emerging from these programmes with greater self-worth, esteem and pride and against all the odds, a sense of opportunity, hope and aspiration. There is a wealth of innovation and talent within this sector, who have historically provided the safety net of provision to families and parents, and it is a national disgrace that they are not provided with greater support and funding.We all have a duty to protect our children from crime and the fear of crime: they are our future and we are accountable.
