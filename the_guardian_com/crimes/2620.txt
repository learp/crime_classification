The Fulham full-back Carlos Salcido could leave the club after a robbery at his house resulted in his family leaving England, Mark Hughes has revealed.The Mexico international joined the Cottagers last summer from PSV Eindhoven and has impressed during his first season in the Premier League.However, Hughes has warned that Salcido could leave Craven Cottage in the coming weeks after becoming unhappy with life in London following the incident at his house."His family came over initially but he had a robbery at his house," he said. "That was a bit upsetting for his family. They couldn't settle after that point [and moved back to Mexico]."Carlos's situation is that his family has not been able to settle as of yet and he obviously has that to deal with."We are hopeful that the situation can be resolved and there can be a positive conclusion from our point of view in terms of Carlos being able to stay. If the situation is still prevalent, it may be that Carlos feels he needs to look at his options back home because he needs to be with his family."We understand that situation, it is difficult but obviously we have to protect our own position and he fully understands that. There is a lot of dialogue going on in terms of how we can resolve this but at the moment it is a little bit up in the air."
