A care home owner who stole from residents with learning difficulties has been jailed for 12 months.Caroline Jane Rice, 54, was entrusted with looking after the financial affairs of people living at Dove House, in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire, but she "looted" more than £1,200 of "pocket money", Leicester crown court was told.Rice was previously convicted by a jury on three counts of theft and eight counts of false accounting to conceal thefts.Judge Philip Head told her: "The public must have unqualified confidence when they entrust vulnerable people to the proprietor of a care home. I conclude that your offences were such dreadful breaches of trust that no sentence other than immediate custody is possible."Rice was also ordered to pay £1,245 in compensation to her victims and £2,500 in legal costs.The former nurse was arrested last August when a colleague raised the alarm after discovering money was going missing from residents' bank accounts.Rice had withdrawn sums but entered lesser amounts into the accounts books, the jury was told; on some occasions, she simply stole the cash without even bothering to cover up what she had done.The judge said: "Those whom you had in your care were highly vulnerable people. That very high degree of trust you grossly abused. Over a period of 15 months, you set about looting your residents' funds. What you did was driven by greed, pure and simple."Rice had tried to blame the thefts on a mystery employee, the court heard. Judge Head added: "I am driven to conclude that you saw the residents' accounts as a source of pocket money for yourself."
