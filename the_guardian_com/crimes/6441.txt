Famous Celtic fans have been warned to watch out for suspect packages after four incendiary bombs capable of causing "real harm" were sent to the club's manager, Neil Lennon, and two other senior figures.Sources said the four crude but viable devices – sent to Lennon, his lawyer and a former Labour MSP over a six-week period from early March – used a potentially explosive liquid in a small bottle packaged up with nails.The terror campaign has led police to warn "many" famous Celtic fans, including – it is believed – a BBC presenter. Staff at the Glasgow club and postal workers have also been told to be vigilant.Police stressed that this was a precautionary measure and there was no evidence or intelligence that any other individuals were being targeted."The advice is to make sure that they keep themselves safe," said Chief Superintendent Ruaraidh Nicolson, head of community safety at Strathclyde police.The force is now putting in place much tighter security for the Old Firm match between Celtic and Rangers at Ibrox on Sunday 24 April – recent games between the bitter rivals have seen dozens of fans arrested and a violent confrontation between Lennon and the Rangers assistant manager, Ally McCoist.The police believe these incidents, which led to an emergency summit hosted by first minister Alex Salmond, have sparked off the letter-bombing campaign.The parcels were posted when reporting of Old Firm and sectarian tensions was at a height.Detective Chief Superintendent John Mitchell, head of Strathclyde CID, told a press conference the devices were very unusual but were "very definitely capable of causing considerable harm or injury to people."Salmond said the attempted attacks were "despicable and cowardly" and added that the "lunatic element responsible for this outrage" would be prosecuted vigorously."They will be dealt with using the full force of the law. We're not going to tolerate this sort of criminality in Scottish society," he said.Iain Gray, the Labour leader in Scotland, also condemned the attacks. "The people behind these sinister and potentially life-threatening acts need to be caught and brought to justice," he said."I am absolutely appalled at this development and hope that progress can be made on finding those responsible. Individuals who engage in this type of terrorism do not have the support of the public and are rightly seen as pariahs."He added: "However, now is the time for calm heads. I hope that the whole community shows that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated in our country."The chief executive of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), Stewart Regan, said the news was "depressing and deplorable".He said the SFA was "horrified and saddened" by the attacks, and that sectarian hatred was an "unwanted poison" in footballPolice said a suspicious package sent to the former Labour minister and Celtic director, Brian Wilson, at industrial premises at Shawbost, on the Isle of Lewis, had proved to be a false alarm.The first device was sent to Lennon, a Northern Irish Catholic, on 4 March and was intercepted by Royal Mail staff.Police originally believed it was hoax – the package was said to be cruder than a second device addressed to Lennon which was found at Kirkintilloch sorting office on 26 March.Two days later a device addressed to Trish Godman, the former deputy presiding officer of the Scottish parliament who has just retired as a Labour MSP, was delivered to her constituency office.A fourth package was sent to Paul McBride QC, Lennon's lawyer, last week having been posted in Kilwinning, Ayrshire.The police only realised the devices were viable and dangerous last week after forensic investigation; it is thought the liquid involved could explode after contact with air or sunlight.Mitchell said the police had not failed by initially downplaying the significance of the packages."These devices were unusual. We'd never seen anything like them before," he said. "The initial assessment was that they might have been a hoax."That being said, we sent the devices for specialist forensic examination and because of that we're now aware that they are viable devices."Mitchell appealed for witnesses. He said: "Sending these types of packages through the post is a despicable and cowardly act – whoever has done this has put not only the person to whom they were addressed in danger but they've also put postroom staff in harm's way."We're acutely aware of the alarm these incidents can cause, which is why we've got a full plan in place to give guidance to Royal Mail workers and postroom staff."Mitchell said the "wide-ranging investigation" was focusing on a number of lines of inquiry, but the police had no clear evidence about who was responsible. "We're keeping an open mind," he said.Detectives were studying online Rangers fan forums where abuse and death threats against Lennon have previously been posted.Although the devices all appeared to have been posted in Scotland and there was no immediate evidence of paramilitary involvement, officers were talking to other forces including the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Mitchell said."We've no information or intelligence to suggest that anyone else would be targeted. However, at this particular time, it would be sensible to take precautions."
