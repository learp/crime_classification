A soldier has described how a bullet skimmed the side of his head during a Real IRA gun attack in which two of his comrades died.Giving evidence on the second day of the trial of two republicans accused of killing the army sappers, the soldier said that despite being wounded in the lung and the shoulder he was able to escape the Real IRA gang.Mark Fitzpatrick, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, said one gunman outside Massereene barracks in Antrim Town went in to "finish off" his friend Patrick Azimkar, who died along with fellow sapper Mark Quinsey in the shooting in March 2009."There was no remorse. He knew what he was doing. He just seemed to do it all quick," Fitzpatrick told Antrim crown court on Tuesday.Earlier the court was told that 63 bullets were fired during the attack in which the two soldiers died. Colin Duffy, from Lurgan, and Brian Shivers, from Co Derry, are accused of murdering the two sappers.Duffy and Shivers also each face seven other charges â€“ six of attempted murder and one of possession of guns and explosives.On Monday the trial was shown CCTV images of the shooting, which took place just before the soldiers were to fly to Afghanistan on a tour of duty. The dissident republican group the Real IRA has admitted responsibility for the murders.The trial continues.
