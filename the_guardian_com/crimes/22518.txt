A senior adviser on rape to the government criticised the sentence given to the serial sex attacker John Worboys as "absolutely bizarre" yesterday, warning it could undermine work to improve the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences.Black-cab driver Worboys, who police say could have sexually assaulted or raped more than 200 women, was jailed indeterminately but could be considered for parole in eight years' time.Dave Gee, a former head of Criminal Investigations Department who works with the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers and is behind a new assessment regime to monitor individual forces' performance on rape, said the tariff did not reflect the severity of Worboys's crimes."We know it's the minimum but it's the presentational message it gives," he said. "People will think he's only going to get eight years. It's absolutely bizarre what message that sends ... that there are cases where the judiciary don't take rape seriously."It has the potential to discourage victims to come forward and also to undermine the confidence of people investigating and prosecuting rape."Gee said that the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) who had been working to try to improve detection and conviction rates, as well as victims, could end up thinking "what's the point?".He added that the tariff had "not gone down well" with professionals in the field. "The CPS are not happy. Eight years appears to be on the low side when you consider that rape can carry a sentence of life imprisonment."How do you qualify it against the level of offending? I'm not sure it matches at all - this man was a predator. We probably don't know a fraction of his victims."Court reports said Worboys, who was found guilty last month of assaulting 12 women over 18 months and has been linked to 85 other attacks, was a sexual deviant who had not accepted his crimes and continued to pose a serious risk.Police failings meant he continued attacking women because a number of officers did not believe his victims' claims that they had been sexually assaulted by a London cabby. Several officers face disciplinary action.
