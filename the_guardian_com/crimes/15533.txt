Detectives involved in a desperate search to arrest a serial rapist and murderer are carrying out a DNA sweep of men in 9,000 homes amid fears the killer will soon strike again.The rapist has attacked three women in the last three months, all in the early hours of morning, strangling his last victim, Michelle Samaraweera, and leaving her body in a children's park in east London.DNA from the scene of the attack matched that from two earlier rapes. Officers are trawling through other unsolved sexual assault and indecency cases in Waltham Forest, east London, and neighbouring boroughs.Detective Superintendent Vic Rae, from the homicide and serious crime command, said: "He has attacked three women in three months and we have got to do everything within our powers to apprehend him before he strikes again. Our concern is that he will strike again before the end of the month."Murder squad detectives have been brought in from all over London to help complete the door to door inquiries of around 9,000 houses within a perimeter of 3.4 miles in Walthamstow, east London.Men who match the description of the attacker will be asked to provide their DNA in what amounts to one of the biggest DNA sweeps undertaken by the Met.With time against the police, the sister of Samaraweera, Ann Chanradasa, appealed today for the killer to hand himself in."He should definitely bring himself forward before he does this to anybody else. He's a sick sick man who obviously needs help."She appealed for men who matched the description of the killer – between 30 and 45 and of Asian or Middle Eastern appearance – to cooperate with the DNA sweep.
