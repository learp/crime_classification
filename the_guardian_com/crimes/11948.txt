Former Conservative Home Office minister, Ann Widdecombe, today called for a review of jail capacity after a major drugs smuggler absconded from an open prison.Ms Widdecombe said she was concerned that, because of overcrowding, prisoners were having their security classifications downgraded too readily.She was commenting after Roddy McLean absconded from from Leyhill open prison, Gloucestershire, after serving six years of a 21-year sentence for his part in a Â£10m cannabis smuggling ring. Police believe he has fled to South Africa. Ms Widdecombe told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "A few months ago I was actually looked in the eye by a prison governor who told me that because of the overcrowding situation, they were actually being given a quota for recategorising people from Category C to open prison."In other words, instead of doing what has always been done under successive governments up to now, which is only ever transferring into open prisons on the merits of the case, they are being told 'you have got to transfer more people to open prisons because that is the only way we can find space in the other prisons'. "If that is true, then that I consider poses a threat to the public. "The government has to supply the places for those who the courts deem to be in need of custody." Earlier this week, Home Office figures revealed that 111,600 people were sentenced to immediate custody last year - the highest figure for at least 75 years.That has brought the prison population to a record high and led to a succession of warnings from high-ranking prison officials and campaigners that jails are at bursting point.In August, the new director general of the prison service, Phil Wheatley, warned the government against encouraging long sentences and blamed a spate of suicides among inmates partly on overcrowding.Ms Widdecombe said: "What you need is a review of prison capacity, which is very severely overcrowded at the moment. And I have to say that when I have questioned ministers on this I have found a remarkable complacency."
