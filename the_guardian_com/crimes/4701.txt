Detectives were given an extra 24 hours yesterday to question a man about the murder of skydiver Stephen Hilder during a student parachuting contest.The man was taken from his flat in Leeds early on Monday to Scunthorpe police station, 10 miles from the makeshift airstrip at Hibaldstow where 20-year-old Mr Hilder fell 4,000 metres (13,000ft) to his death in July. Humberside police were given until 5pm today to continue questioning the unnamed man, held on suspicion of murdering Hilder and of criminal damage to his main and reserve parachutes. Mr Hilder plunged into a field at the end of a complex set of skydiving manoeuvres which would have won his team the main award in the national Collegiate Week competition at Hibaldstow. Safety straps on his parachutes had been expertly cut. Police have questioned all 78 skydivers who were at the event, and followed up leads about alleged rivalries over young women cadets at the Royal Military College of Science in Shrivenham, where Mr Hilder was studying after graduating from Bristol university. Last month detectives returned for a second series of interviews with members of Leeds University skydiving club, which uses Hibaldstow.
