Michael Charleton took a swig of tea and drew deeply on his cigarette as he sat in the kitchen of his farmhouse today in the hills outside Rothbury and pondered the latest developments in the hunt for the fugitive Raoul Moat.On his mind was the report from the police that the wanted man had declared an intention to threaten the public as well as police officers."I have been out on the hills all morning getting in the sheep because they are getting clipped tomorrow, and it didn't bother me," said the 74-year-old. "But I suppose that may change a bit now with what he has said."Charleton's 340-acre farm has been at the centre of the police hunt since the suspect's makeshift camp was discovered a few miles away this week. On Tuesday officers carried out a two-hour search of the farm; the following night Charleton saw about 20 armed officers escorting a person police described as an associate of Moat along the hedgerows and paths that criss-cross his land.But despite the knowledge that the alleged gunman could be hiding in the hills beyond his window, Charleton remains calm."It's not exactly what we're used to but we're just getting on with it. We've had police here at all times of day and night but they have a job to do and we always offer the lads a cup of tea or sandwich."Charleton said the landscape was fugitive friendly. "I can tell you there are so many nooks … up there he can stay as long as he wants, especially if he has people helping him." Even so, there was no intention of letting these things interfere. "The countryside can't stop working just for one man, can it?"His wife, June Gibson, said: "We are a pretty hardy lot … I think most people will just get on with it and try and look out for each other."But Charleton voiced a nagging doubt for many in the community. "How are they going to catch him? That's what I'd would like to know. If he is getting help and he knows his way around the hills I don't see how they are going to do it."
