David Norris, one of the five suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence, was described yesterday as 'one of the most hated men in England' during the trial of his younger brother, Clifford, who is accused of wounding an Asian motorist in a road rage attack.The remark was made by David Nathan in his closing speech for Norris, 20, at Woolwich crown court, south London. Norris denies unlawfully wounding Gatri Hassan, 26, and possessing an offensive weapon.Mr Nathan said the reputation of the Norris family had a bearing on the case. The jury had been told that Norris's father, also called Clifford, was serving a prison sentence, and that David was facing a criminal charge. He said: 'The fact is that this man's brother is one of the most hated men in England. The general public has a deep revulsion for the Stephen Lawrence case.'He added: 'It must be very difficult for the rest of the family to have to live in the spotlight of press attention.'Norris at first lied to the police, the jury was told, saying he and his girlfriend had driven the car on the day of the alleged attack in south-east London last November. But on Thursday he told the court he had loaned the car to David, 22, that night. He said he wanted to 'protect' his older brother.Summing up, Judge Brian Pryor told the jury to 'approach with caution the criminal activity or otherwise' of Norris's brother and father.The judge said: 'Part of the explanation for what the defendant said and did in this case are his feelings about what has happened to his brother and the family generally at the hands of the press and of the police.'
