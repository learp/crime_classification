Seven members of a gang of fraudsters whose plans to steal Â£1.2m from banks were wrecked when detectives cracked their code using a Scouting handbook were jailed yesterday. Five others received lesser sentences at Nottingham crown court. A member of the gang who worked at Cater Allen Private Bank in Sheffield wrote down customers' personal information in a code substituting letters for symbols and numbers. Detective Constable Chris Stephens, a former district commissioner in the Scouts, used the Scoutmaster's A to Z, which was first published in 1958, to decipher the code.
