 A tipper truck driver has been jailed for five-and-half years after the lorry he was driving rolled, killing his son. Luke Bayes Aitken was celebrating his 12th birthday when he was killed at the Langar Industrial Unit, Nottinghamshire, on 4 May. His father, Tony Aitken, was driving the Ford Transit tipper truck off-road with three children in the front seat just after 3pm, despite the truck only being meant to hold two passengers. Aitken, 33, formerly of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, lost control of the truck and Luke was thrown from the vehicle. He later died from injuries sustained when the truck fell on top of him. The other children in the vehicle, aged 12 and five, were treated in hospital for minor injuries. Aitken pleaded guilty to driving while unfit and causing death by dangerous driving and was jailed on Friday at Nottingham crown court, Nottinghamshire police said. He was also disqualified from driving for seven years. The senior investigating officer, DS Ged Hazelwood, said: “Luke’s death was the tragic consequence of a very irresponsible decision by his father to drive a truck that he was not qualified to drive, and to drive it dangerously without any apparent thought for the dangers it presented. “It is fortunate that the other children were not more seriously injured. “It also illustrates that driving a vehicle off the road, if driven dangerously or carelessly, is no less potentially dangerous than it is on the road network, and often more so because the surface will not be designed to be driven on.”
