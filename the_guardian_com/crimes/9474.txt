The new justice secretary, Lord Falconer, is under pressure to find a solution to the prison overcrowding crisis without threatening judicial independence by leaning on judges to pass lighter sentences.The judges, who are withholding support for his new ministry of justice pending agreements on safeguards for their independence and court budgets, will hold a special meeting of their representative body, the judges' council, tomorrow evening.Despite two months of negotiations, they have yet to reach an acceptable compromise over their concerns.A main stumbling block is Lord Falconer's insistence that any safeguards must not involve legislation.Last week, with more than 80,670 offenders in custody, Lord Falconer announced that he was asking the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) to look at whether sentences are "too long" at the moment.But, as Lord Justice Thomas, the senior judge negotiating for the judiciary, told the House of Lords constitution committee this month, the SGC has no remit to take resources into account. Its object is to ensure that judges pass consistent sentences.Judges' sentencing decisions, he said, are governed by legislation, appellate court rulings, and guidance from the SGC. Ministers must provide the prison places but the Treasury determines their resources. "Without new legislation, there is simply no parliamentary mandate for the judiciary or the SGC to take resources into account in their decisions or in formulating their guidelines," he told the peers. "It is for parliament to decide whether it is appropriate to do so."He and other senior judges have been looking at the experience in some US states, where independent sentencing commissions with a remit to match sentences to prison places have achieved marked success in averting prison overcrowding without endangering public safety. Their records are in sharp contrast to that of California, which has no sentencing commission, and where inmates have had to sleep in prison classrooms, gyms and hallways.The states with sentencing commissions use computer simulations to work out the impact of sentencing law changes on prison resources and the budget.As a result of the data obtained, "most states with sentencing commissions have reduced overall crime rates by increasing penalties for the most dangerous offenders and expanded options for community-based sanctions for certain low-level, non-violent offenders", according to a study last January by the bipartisan Little Hoover Commission.With a beefed-up remit, the SGC could fulfil the function of a sentencing commission, Lord Woolf, the former lord chief justice, told the home affairs select committee last month.
