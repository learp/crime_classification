February 1988  Iorworth Hoare, originally from Seacroft, Leeds, attacks a woman, known as Mrs A, in the city's Roundhay Park. May 1989  Hoare is jailed for life for the attempted rape of Mrs A. He had previously been convicted of a string of sex attacks, including rape, during the 1970s and 1980s. Mrs A, a retired teacher, receives £5,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. August 2004  Hoare wins £7m on Lotto Extra while on day release from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire. December 2004  Once Mrs A finds out about Hoare's win, she realises it is worthwhile suing him for psychiatric damage. Previously he had no financial assets. She issues proceedings and obtains medical reports on her condition. March 2005  Months after his win, Hoare is released on parole. He moves into a £700,000 mansion near Newcastle. June 2005  A senior high court official, Master Eyre, decides Mrs A's damages action should be struck out. Eyre concludes Hoare is bound to win if the case goes to trial because the claim was brought more than six years after the assault.October 2005  Mr Justice Jack at London's high court upholds the decision. He says the case is covered by a section of the 1980 Limitation Act which sets out a non-extendable six-year period. Mrs A is ordered to pay an estimated £100,000 towards Hoare's legal costs.April 2006  Mrs A loses another appeal, heard by the master of the rolls, Sir Anthony Clarke, Lord Justice Brooke and Lady Justice Arden. They decide the court is bound by the existing decision of the House of Lords that claims for damages arising out of an intentional sexual assault have a non-extendable six-year limitation period from the date of the assault (or the claimant's 18th birthday, if later). Because the six-year limitation period had expired before the Human Rights Act came into force, claimants could not rely on the provisions of that act for assistance.November 2007  Mrs A asks five law lords to modify the law which bars her from taking action because she is outside the six-year time limit. January 30 2008  Mrs A, now 79, istold she can claim compensation.
