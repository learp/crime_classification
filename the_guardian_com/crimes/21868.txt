Just as TV star Matthew Kelly was being exonerated weeks after his high-profile arrest over child sex allegations, police were declaring to all who would listen that Stephen Downing, freed after 27 years in prison, remains 'the only suspect' for the 1973 murder of Wendy Sewell.Both cases demonstrate how innuendo and leaks can only damage the pursuit of justice. There has been no satisfactory explanation for Kelly's very public arrest. The police blame media interest in the case, but that raises the question of who tipped off the media in the first place. How does this, anyway, explain why two officers needed to sit through a performance of Peter Pan in order dramatically to arrest Kelly as the curtain fell? As a result, an innocent man will find his name forever linked to unfounded allegations even though, unusually for such cases - and this is a very small consolation - his exoneration has also been widely reported. For Downing, the mud will also stick. He served almost three decades in prison because he continued doggedly to protest his innocence. He has no way to clear his name against stories based on police briefings. The rehabilitation of criminals such as Jeffrey Archer and Winston Silcott is regularly prejudiced by leaks about their whereabouts. Britain's police, under pressure for poor clear-up rates, appear to think that playing judge and jury at press conferences will help shift the blame elsewhere. It is part of a broader corrosive culture where information and tip-offs are routinely sold to journalists in stitch-ups which damage the prospects of justice. The Home Secretary should make clear that such practices will not be tolerated and ensure that those responsible are properly disciplined.
