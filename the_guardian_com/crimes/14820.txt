An uninsured drink-driver who killed two young women was jailed yesterday for five-and-a-half years.Graham Travers was one-and-a-half times over the legal limit when he offered to give 19-year-old Victoria Browne and her friend Natalie McCabe, 20, a lift home after a night out. Travers, from Portslade, East Sussex, crashed the borrowed car at speed into a barrier on the seafront in Hove last October. The 21-year-old barman had not passed his driving test. Both women died from their injuries, and a third passenger, Becky Fish, 20, had part of her leg amputated. Travers admitted two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and having no insurance or licence at Lewes crown court last month. Sentencing him yesterday, Mrs Justice Rafferty also disqualified him from driving for five years and ordered him to take an extended driving test. Mrs Justice Rafferty said Travers' crime had been aggravated by the fact that he had crawled out of the overturned car and left the scene. However, she had taken into account Travers's youth, his immediate guilty plea and the one-off nature of the incident.
