Surrey police are likely to submit new evidence next week against Levi Bellfield, the prime suspect in the murder of schoolgirl Amanda Dowler, it emerged tonight.Bellfield, a 39-year-old wheelclamper and bouncer, was identified as the main suspect in the 13-year-old's murder in March 2002 after being convicted last year of killing two women and brutally attacking a third.Detectives investigating the murder of Amanda, known as Milly, arrested a man earlier this month in connection with a car they believe was used to abduct her.The 40-year-old from west London, who was released without charge, was questioned over a red Daewoo Nexia captured on CCTV in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, close to where Milly disappeared on her way home from school. Her body was found six months later in woods at Yateley Heath near Fleet, Hampshire.Detectives discovered that Bellfield's former partner, Emma Mills, owned a red Daewoo Nexia which she reported stolen four days after Milly's disappearance. She was renting a flat in Collingwood Place yards from where Milly was last seen. Despite repeated requests for information, police have so far been unable to trace the vehicle.Bellfield has since admitted driving the car. He was linked to Milly's killing after his conviction for bludgeoning to death Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, after they got off buses in south-west London, and for the attempted murder of another woman. He was given a "whole life" sentence last February.It emerged during the trial that Bellfield also faced eight charges of rape and four of assault on three women, which will lie on file.On the day of her disappearance Milly left a cafe where she had been spending time with friends and began walking to her home a mile away. When she failed to return a hunt was launched, and police concluded she had been taken by an opportunist abductor.Surrey police have been building a case against Bellfield since he was arrested by the Metropolitan police in November 2004 in connection with a series of murders and other attacks around west London. Bellfield could not be publicly linked to the Milly investigation while he faced other charges, but officers believe they have compelling circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime.Detectives cannot account for Bellfield's movements on the day Milly disappeared. His mobile phone was switched off, but they know he was familiar with both Walton-on-Thames and Yateley Heath.
