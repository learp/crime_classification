Three men and a woman have been charged with bribery offences connected to alleged corruption in the Ministry of Defence.The four, including two MoD staff members, will go on trial at Belfast Crown Court after an investigation into £25m worth of contracts in Northern Ireland.The charges were laid on Friday by the Serious Fraud Office in London as part of a joint operation involving the MoD's police. They follow claims by a whistleblower that civil servants working in the MoD's Contracts Office inside the army's Thiepval HQ in Lisburn were allegedly taking "backhander" payments from contractors for the awarding of work in military bases.Those facing charges are James McGeown, 61, from Belfast; William Marks, 43, from Lisburn; John Symington, 53, from Lisburn; and Carol Mary Kealey, 41, of Coleraine, Co Derry. All have been remanded on bail pending their next court appearance.In a statement, the Serious Fraud Office said: "The charges related to an inquiry started in 2003 by the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) into the conduct of a number of MoD employees and independent contractors involved in the provision and maintenance of MoD buildings and equipment in Northern Ireland."This investigation, codenamed Operation Ramaria, was prompted by concerns that MoD employees were favouring certain electrical and security systems companies and ensuring that these companies were consistently being awarded lucrative provision and maintenance contracts."The contracts amounted to around £25m.
