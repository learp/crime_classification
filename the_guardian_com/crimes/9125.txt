Two teenage boys were arrested, three knives confiscated and a quantity of cannabis seized after police were called to a house in east London packed with hundreds of people having a party.Transport for London had to divert buses away from Oxlow Lane, a quiet residential street in Dagenham, after police were called to reports of a “large fight” when as many as 300 people turned up to the party on Saturday night after an invitation was posted on Facebook and began circulating on social media. One witness, a neighbour who preferred not to be named, said a bus was stopped in front of the three-bedroom semi-detached house as 10 to 12 police officers with dogs formed a line across the road. The officers confronted dozens of young people, mostly in their late teens, who had been drinking.“For an hour the youths were still on the street shouting and drinking,” the neighbour said. “They were provoking the police, shouting at them. A few of them were quite aggressive, trying to go towards the police to pick a fight, but nothing came of it.”TfL Bus Alerts (@TfLBusAlerts)Oxlow Lane, Dagenham has now been cleared and route 174 is back to its timetabled route.June 21, 2015Teenagers swarmed the house on Saturday after a girl living there, Benedicte Mbeka, advertised her 16th birthday party on Facebook.

Another neighbour, Karen Lloyd, said she had been frightened by the number of young people in the street in front of her home. “There were hundreds of teenagers just swarming into the street,” Lloyd said. “I saw one girl – she couldn’t have been more than 13 – she was just screaming for help.”The Metropolitan police said officers were called just after 11pm. A neighbour said she had heard the commotion begin from about 10.30pm. Although she only later looked out of the window, she said she had heard screaming and shouting.
