Two brothers who beat and tortured another pair of boys when they were aged 10 and 11 will remain anonymous for the rest of their lives, a court ruled on Friday.A judge sentenced the brothers to a minimum detention period of five years in 2010 for causing grievous bodily harm and ruled that they could not be named until they reached the age of 18. But the brothers, now in their late teens, have been told that their new identities will remain a secret.A senior judge at the high court on Friday granted indefinite anonymity to the brothers, who are no longer in detention. Sir Geoffrey Vos said he was satisfied that the anonymity order was in the public interest and ruled that neither the brothers’ original names nor their new identities could be revealed.The brothers carried out “appalling and terrible” assaults on their younger victims after leading them from a playground to wasteland in Edlington, South Yorkshire, in April 2009, Sheffield crown court heard. Following their trial the head of child protection services in their home town apologised for the way staff had failed the public.Phillippa Kaufmann QC – instructed by the official solicitor’s office, which helps vulnerable people involved in court cases – said there was a “real possibility” that the brothers would be attacked by vigilantes if their names became known.The application was made as the younger brother approached his 18th birthday. It was not contested formally by any media organisation, though a reporter covering the hearing argued that journalists should be able to reveal the brothers’ original names.In the most notorious crime committed by British children since the murder of James Bulger in 1993, the brothers targeted their victims seemingly at random as they rode their BMX bikes in Edlington in April 2009.After leading their victims, then nine and 11, to waste ground they subjected them to a 90-minute ordeal that included a series of sexual humiliations. The victims were robbed, beaten, stamped on, struck with bricks and other objects, choked and burned to an extent that left the older child close to death. Parts of the attack were recorded on a mobile phone.The brothers had experienced a “toxic” and violent family life, and had been placed with foster parents in Edlington less than three weeks before the attack.Following the trial the acting head of children’s services in Doncaster gave an unqualified apology for the “admitted failings which led to this terrible incident”.A serious case review found that various agencies missed 31 opportunities to intervene with the boys’ family.
