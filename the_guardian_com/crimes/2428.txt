The Metropolitan police has said that the man chairing an inquiry into a fatal shooting acted irrationally by ordering the force to hand over secret footage of the incident to the lawyers of the dead man's family.The footage was taken by a helicopter tracking a car containing Azelle Rodney, who was shot six times by a police marksman and died in April 2005 in north London.An inquiry into the shooting began in September, chaired by Sir Christopher Holland. He ruled that the aerial footage should be given to lawyers representing Rodney's family, but that decision is opposed by the Met which went to London's high court on Thursday to block the order.Papers lodged with the court show the Met originally claimed there was no aerial footage of the incident, but later said this statement was wrong.Anne Studd QC, appearing for the Met, said Holland had reached a conclusion that was so irrational it should be quashed.Holland's decision under rule 12(4) of the 2006 Inquiry Rules was "insufficiently reasoned" and there was no basis for concluding that such disclosure was necessary within the meaning of the rules, Studd argued.Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the inquiry, said disclosure to the family's lawyers was necessary to achieve a fair and well-informed public interest immunity process that respected the family's right to as open an inquiry as possible.Lord Justice Pitchford, Mr Justice Foskett and Judge Peter Thornton QC reserved their judgment, which they are expected to give next week.A police helicopter filmed Rodney and two other men in a car for several hours in the Harlesden and Edgware areas before police forced the car to stop and opened fire in Hale Lane, Mill Hill.Rodney was suspected of being part of a plot to rip off a Colombian drugs gang at gunpoint when he was killed by an armed police officer who, the inquiry has heard, shot him six times without issuing an oral warning.The officer, known only as E7, opened fire less than one second after pulling alongside the car carrying Rodney, who was in a rear seat.Rodney's family have fought a seven-year battle for a public and full inquiry into his death. The authorities previously said this would not be possible because the intelligence used by law enforcement came from intercepts and argued that the disclosure to lawyers and the family would be unlawful.The sensitive intelligence in this case was one of the reasons that the last Labour government and the coalition considered introducing so-called "secret inquests".
