Police are testing a unique 'DNA for property' scheme aimed at tackling burglars. A thousand homes in Watford are being given enigmaTag - a system that uses encrypted microparticles to mark valuable possessions such as jewellery, antiques, cameras, watches and computers.Each small 5ml bottle - similar to one containing nail varnish - has a unique coded solution, registered specifically to each home. Only a tiny amount of solution is applied to each valuable item. This can be identified only by special hand-held readers. When officers seize suspected stolen goods they then scan the solution mark and the owner can be identified.Each bottle, which is being handed out free to the households, contains enough fluid to mark 100 items.
