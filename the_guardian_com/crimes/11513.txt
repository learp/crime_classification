A teenager brutally stabbed his 15-year-old girlfriend 60 times in her head, neck and upper chest with two different knives, following arguments over his jealousy.Andrew Hall, 18, who attended Stoke City academy, the youth development part of Stoke City Football Club, pleaded guilty to murder on Friday at Luton crown court. Judge Richard Foster jailed him for life, with a minimum of 10 years.Megan-Leigh Peat, was described by her family as a caring, loving and bright girl. She was stabbed repeatedly by her boyfriend at around 1.30am on 9 June. The attack took place in the kitchen of a mutual friend's house where the pair were alone.Peat died of severe blood loss and her injuries included defensive wounds to her hands and arms.During sentencing, Judge Foster told Hall: "Megan Peat will never experience the thrill and success of exam results, going on to higher education, or perhaps being a bridesmaid at a best friend's wedding or an 18th birthday party. Her life ended in your hands at 15 years old."Only you know why you did what you did that night and what the catalyst was for such a ferocious attack. It is clear you were jealous of her innocent friendships with others."Iain Wicks, prosecuting, told the court that on the night Hall murdered the teenager they had been drinking with friends at the Bumble Bee pub in Flitwick, Bedford, watching a Euro 2012 match.The couple began arguing about Hall's jealousy, an issue that had regularly caused problems throughout their nine-month relationship, he said.Megan, who attended Harlington upper school, in Bedfordshire, left the pub to return home to her mother and stepfather, telling friends she "couldn't do it any more" and that she was scared following the arguments.But when the argument continued by text message, Megan determined to rejoin Hall at the White Hart in Ampthill to reconcile their differences, despite his insistence that they leave any discussion until the following Monday.The court heard how her mother, who believed her daughter to be in her bedroom at the time, had concerns over the relationship.After spending some time at the pub, the pair were last seen leaving hand in hand with the keys to their friend's empty house in Ailesbury Road, Ampthill.Hall was next seen about an hour later when he rushed to the White Hart, where his friends were still drinking, covered in blood, saying to bouncers: "I think I just killed my girlfriend, oh my god, I love her so much, what have I done?"He later added: "I've ruined my life and my career, as well as her life."Megan was found in a pool of blood with 60 stab wounds to her head, neck and upper chest.Wicks said Hall had been named Stoke academy's player of the season and was on the brink of becoming a professional with the club.In a statement read outside court on behalf of Megan's family, Detective Inspector Richard Wall, of the Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire major crime unit, said: "Today we are satisfied that Andrew Hall has pleaded guilty to this offence. The day Megan died will be forever etched in our memories, it was the day our lives were torn apart."Megan was a healthy, vibrant, loving and caring person who was very much loved by all her family and all her many friends. She had her whole life ahead of her. "The pain of losing our beautiful daughter and the tragic and awful way she died will stay with us for the rest of our lives. Megan was loved so much and will be missed forever. We would like to thank all police forces involved for their support, especially our family liaison team."
