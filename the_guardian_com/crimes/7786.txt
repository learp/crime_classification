A teenager has been given a five-year Asbo after he and a gang of 20 attacked a group of Somali women in Manchester.Carl Boardman, 17, formerly of Miles Platting, threw bottles at the women and used a three-foot-long stick to beat one of them. He also took the woman's mobile phone and one of the women had her hijab ripped off. Boardman was said to be one of the ringleaders in a group of adults, youths and children who assaulted the six women in June. The incident happened after one of the women asked Boardman's friends to stop hassling them. Under the terms of the Asbo, which is in force until January 2010, he is not allowed to associate with any of the people involved in the attack. In a statement read out at Manchester magistrates court, one of the women said: "It was absolutely terrifying - it was like a riot." Councillor Eddy Newman said: "We will not countenance violence and racism on the streets of this city."
