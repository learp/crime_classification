The former England cricketer Chris Lewis appeared in court today charged with attempting to smuggle cocaine with an estimated street value of Â£200,000 through Gatwick airport.Lewis, 40, who played in 32 Tests and 53 one-day internationals for England from 1990 to 1998, was arrested yesterday when UK Border Agency staff allegedly found four kilos of the drug hidden in his luggage.Lewis arrived on the flight from St Lucia at 6am with Chad Kirnon, a 26-year-old basketball player.The two men made a brief appearance today at Crawley magistrates court in West Sussex, where Lewis's application for bail was refused. Lewis, of Brent, and Kirnon, of Islington, both in north London, were remanded to appear by video link at Haywards Heath magistrates court next Wednesday. Lewis, who was born in the Caribbean state of Guyana, was a fast bowler for Nottinghamshire, Surrey and Leicestershire. He left professional cricket at the age of 32 shortly after making allegations that three of his England teammates had taken money to fix matches - a charge that was never substantiated. He went on to play in the Derbyshire Premier League and in 2006 captained Clifton cricket club in the Central Lancashire cricket league. Earlier this year he re-signed for Surrey and played in one Friends Provident Trophy game, conceding 51 runs in six overs, and one Twenty20 match.
