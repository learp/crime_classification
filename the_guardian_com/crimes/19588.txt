The government plans to ditch the automatic right to trial by jury for complex fraud cases as part of a comprehensive overhaul of the criminal justice system, it emerged today.Judges would be given the option of hearing such cases with two expert assessors, rather than a jury, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, told the Financial Times.Calls for such a move have been made for years by the serious fraud office (SFO), which has been frustrated by its lack of success in winning convictions. In a recent high-profile case involving a £300m unit trust scam at Morgan Grenfell, the prosecution failed to secure one conviction in a trial estimated to have cost £10m.The expected removal of juries from serious fraud trials would form part of government proposals to implement the radical Auld review of the criminal justice system, due this summer.Other measures to tackle serious fraud include the establishment of a national fraud office that would combine the fraud squads of English and Welsh police forces with the SFO.The SFO argues that having a judge instead of jury, helped by expert assessors, would make trials faster, cheaper, as well as increase the conviction rate. But the argument has always been checkmated by those who contend that the problem lies more with the prosecution's failure to mount a cogent case rather than the jury's inability to understand complex arguments. Lord Irvine rejected this argument, telling the FT: "That is very often a pious hope in relation to the staggering complexity of some of these trials."But civil liberties groups argue that anyone accused of financial crimes should have the same right to have their honesty judged by their peers as anyone else accused of theft.
