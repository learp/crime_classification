Barry George, the man acquitted at a retrial of killing Jill Dando, has won substantial damages and an apology from the publisher of the Sun and News of the World over a series of articles suggesting that he was responsible for the killing and was a stalker.George was in the high court today to hear his barrister read a statement outlining how the News of the World had made up a quote from him in which he suggested he could not have killed Dando because he was stalking another woman at the time.Nick Baird, for George, said a confidentiality agreement prevented his client commenting further. Damages are believed to be a six-figure sum.News Group Newspapers, the News International subsidiary that publishes the Sun and News of the World, further apologised for a series of articles in the two tabloids in which various allegations were made that he had become obsessed with the Sky News presenter Kay Burley, had pestered a woman after answering an advertisement she placed about a dog and had become obsessed with Pam Wright, the fiancee of the Ipswich strangler Steve Wright.George, speaking after the short hearing before Mr Justice Eady, said: "I am pleased that the matter between me and News Group Newspapers has been amicably settled following successful mediation and without the need for litigation."He appeared in court with his sister Michelle Diskin, who has supported him since his release from prison last year. He was released after being acquitted at the court of appeal and following a retrial.George, who has a personality disorder, is now attempting to stop the authorities monitoring his movements since his release.Gordon Bishop, representing George at the hearing, said the articles were published between 1 August and 20 November 2008.He added that George had agreed to give an interview to the News of the World and Sky after his release in June last year. "He knew there would be a clamour from the press for his story and he wanted to satisfy the demands of the press ... and be left in peace."He said an article in the Sun described a number of matters which had been kept from the jury. News Group has now admitted that the articles "would have been understood to mean that there were grounds to suspect Mr George of the murder despite his acquittal. (They) accept that the verdict of the second jury in acquitting Mr George was correct and it apologises to Mr George for any suggestion otherwise."In his interview with the News of the World, the paper stated that George had told them: "I didn't kill Jill Dando – I was stalking someone else at the time."News Group now accepts that George never made that statement to them. News Group also admitted that any suggestion George stalked Kay Burley was incorrect."The defendant now accepts that, although on one occasion Mr George did cycle to Sky TV studios to try to collect a tape of his interview with Kay Burley, Mr George did not pose a threat and was not obsessed with her nor did he pester any woman who had a dog for sale nor did he become obsessed with Pam Wright," said Bishop.Benjamin Beabey, solicitor for News Group, said in court today: "The defendant takes this opportunity to correct matters and to apologise to Mr George for any hurt and distress he has felt."• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
