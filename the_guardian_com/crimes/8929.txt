A 16-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a father was stabbed in the head with a screwdriver.The Birmingham teenager was detained last night by officers investigating the death of Sarfraz Khan, West Midlands police said.The 24-year-old, from Hodge Hill, Birmingham, died in hospital earlier this week, four days after being stabbed during an argument near a children's play area in the Sparkbrook area.Detectives believe Khan, who has two daughters aged two and four, became involved in an argument after a group of up to eight teenagers, including at least two girls, objected to him urinating at the play area.Officers were still appealing for witnesses and were keen to speak to two female teenagers who they believe were at the scene.

It's an argument that escalated."We don't think there was any historical connection between Sarfraz and any of these individuals."Khan's relatives have paid tribute to him as a considerate and caring man.In a statement issued by West Midlands police, the victim's family said: "He had two daughters who are still waiting for their daddy to come back."The family is devastated and are suffering because of his death, which has caused a lot of grief and sorrow."
