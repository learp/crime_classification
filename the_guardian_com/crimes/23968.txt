Road-rage killer Kenneth Noye has instructed his solicitors to launch a new appeal based on forensic evidence, it was announced yesterday. Noye, convicted of the M25 murder of Stephen Cameron in 1996, has asked the crown prosecution service to give him access to exhibits from the case.His solicitors, Studio Legale Internazionale and Paul Martin & Co, have been told to file an application to the criminal cases review commission once the forensic evidence has been analysed. Noye's crime was on Monday the focus of an ITV drama telling the story of Cameron's girlfriend, Danielle Cable, who has remained in hiding since the Old Bailey trial. Noye, 55, is currently held at the high security unit at Whitemoor jail in Cambridgeshire. His solicitors added that they hoped the CCRC would refer the case back if research confirmed the "factual and physical causes" of Cameron's death being "somewhat different" to those heard at Noye's trial. Noye was convicted of stabbing Cameron on a motorway slip road in Swanley, Kent. Ms Cable, who was driving her boyfriend's van, inadvertently "cut up" Noye's Land Rover. Cameron got out and began arguing with Noye, who then stabbed him. Noye fled to Spain but was extradited in 1998 and jailed for life in 2000. His appeal in 2001 was unsuccessful. Since his conviction, detectives have been searching for a "nest egg" of stolen gold bullion from the Â£26m Brink's-Mat raid at Heathrow in 1983. Noye served time for handling the bullion.
