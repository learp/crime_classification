They have appealed for witnesses.Supt Ed McLean, Thames Valley police's local area commander, said: "This is not believed to be a random shooting and the offenders may have been known to the victims. Three people from the Wycombe area have been arrested and are now in custody. They are aged 19, 18 and 16 years respectively. They have all been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder."Uniformed officers and forensic teams continue to be deployed at a number of scenes."Police did not give details of any alleged weapon, saying that searches were continuing. People in the area told Sky News they heard loud bangs and aggressive shouting at around 8.30pm in woodland behind their homes.One resident said: "I was in last night and heard groups of men shouting then two loud gunshots and people running around. I saw one young man covered in blood."
