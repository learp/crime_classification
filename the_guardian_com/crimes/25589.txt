Anti-terror police today arrested six men on suspicion of inciting others to commit terrorist acts overseas and raising funds for terrorism.One of the men, Abu Izzadeen, heckled the home secretary, John Reid, when Mr Reid visited east London last year.Officers from the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, working with local police, arrested the men - aged between 21 and 35 - at five addresses in London and one in Luton early this morning.Officers stressed that the dawn raids had involved unarmed police, and said the men were being detained at an unnamed police station in central London."The arrests form part of a long-term proactive and complex investigation into alleged incitement and radicalisation for the purposes of terrorism, as well as alleged provision of financial support for international terrorism," a police spokesman said. Scotland Yard said a number of searches were continuing in connection with the investigation. Its specialist terrorist financing unit has found that most of the alleged terrorist money raised in the UK goes towards supporting and financing insurgents in Iraq.The six arrested men are believed to be associated with the radical Islamist group al-Ghuraaba, which includes supporters of the alleged extremist Omar Bakri Mohammed, who has now left Britain for Lebanon.A former spokesman for Mr Bakri, Anjem Choudary, said the arrested men were known to him and were "very decent, practising Muslims who have raised their voices against the government".Mr Choudary said he thought those detained had been arrested for raising funds during Ramadan in 2004 for what he said were charities supporting people affected by conflicts in Kashmir and Palestine."Innocent Muslims are being raided and arrested in high profile raids this morning in Blair's crusade against anyone who speaks up," he said. "This is oppression and pure act of aggression."
