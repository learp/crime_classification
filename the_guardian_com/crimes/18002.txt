A 46-year-old divorcee who disappeared with a schoolgirl has been arrested, police said today.David Milner, from Gillingham in Kent, was being held in connection with allegations of abduction and other possible offences. Police had been questioning Mr Milner about the disappearance of the 14-year-old girl after the pair were discovered asleep in a car yesterday in the far north of Scotland by a police officer. They went missing last Thursday and a big appeal to trace their whereabouts sparked a nationwide search over the weekend. The schoolgirl was finally reunited with her mother Angela, 33, last night at a secret location. Speaking about the moment she heard her daughter had been found, Mrs Champ said: "That telephone call was the most relieving telephone call I have ever had. The last four or five days have been a nightmare, a complete nightmare." The girl and Mr Milner, who worked with Stacey's mother and was a regular visitor to her house, live in the same area of Gillingham in Kent. The pair had last been spotted at the weekend posing as a couple at a hotel in Blackpool. But yesterday they were discovered in their car in a lay-by outside Berriedale, near Wick, Caithness by Pc George Ewing, who enlisted the help of two members of the public to stop them driving away. Inspector Richard Watson of Kent police, who led the search for the teenager, said his officers would also be talking to the schoolgirl but only after she has spent time with her mother.
