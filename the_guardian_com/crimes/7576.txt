Marcel Berlins (1 June) has more reason than he may think to worry about the quality of justice dispensed in so-called virtual courts. The main incentive for defendants to plead guilty in these and other courts is not "to get it over with", but the policy, now enshrined in official sentencing guidelines, that the maximum reduction in sentence will only be awarded to those pleading guilty at the "first opportunity". Also, the reason why the defendant whose case he witnessed may not have had a lawyer to represent him in the police station is that, under new legal-aid arrangements, only advice over the telephone would have been available to him, and then not from a solicitor of his own choice.The government and Legal Services Commission are now threatening, if lawyers do not cooperate in reducing costs under "best value tendering", to extend such restrictions beyond drink-drive and other minor matters to cover almost all criminal offences. Only those involved in the most serious offences, such as rape, murder, terrorism and serious fraud, will continue to be entitled to receive advice in person from a lawyer attending at the police station. What is clear is that under such policies criminal justice - virtual or otherwise - no longer encompasses effective defence of the accused. Professor Lee BridgeSchool of Law, University of Warwick
