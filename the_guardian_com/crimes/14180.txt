The trial of Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan heard a wealth of evidence that was, at times, difficult to follow.From the outset of the case, jurors were forced to contend with the unusual scenario of a string of witnesses whose identities were protected by the court.The mystery royal at the centre of the allegations was referred to only as witness A. The aide who made "disparaging" remarks against his employer was witness D.To complicate matters further, another royal aide and a close friend of the alleged blackmail victim were known as witnesses B and C respectively.During the three-week trial, held in court 11 at the Old Bailey in London, both Strachan, 31, and 41-year-old McGuigan denied ever demanding money with menaces.It was alleged the pair had tried to blackmail the royal family member to the sum of £50,000 using "salacious" recordings obtained from witness D.The court heard that the material included footage of drug-taking as well as tapes of witness D alleging that the royal had been involved in a gay sex act.Prosecutors said the defendants, having failed to sell the tapes to the News of the World and Sun newspapers, had attempted to blackmail the royal.Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting, told the jury: "Whatever they might say about their reasons for doing so, the defendants together gathered hours and hours of recordings of D, who was often intoxicated …" … Much of [it] featured, without any doubt, salacious and potentially damaging allegations about A, his business, his personal life, and his relatives in the royal family, as well as film of D apparently snorting cocaine, and one or two snippets referring to sexual conduct."Strachan, of Fulham, south-west London, and McGuigan, of Battersea, also in south-west London, began their bid to blackmail the royal in August 2007.The pair made threatening telephone calls to a royal aide during which they discussed the married royal and a gay sex act they alleged he had committed.The aide, identified only as witness B, told the court: "The message was clear. What I was told was [that] it was certainly unpleasant, what they were threatening."Following the threats, the royal protection department contacted police, who launched an investigation. Officers decided on a sting operation to catch the men.In September, Strachan and McGuigan were both persuaded to meet a friend of the royal's, witness C, to discuss the deal at a London hotel.Instead of sending C, police sent an undercover officer to the Park Lane Hilton hotel, and the defendants were arrested.Throughout his trial, Strachan defended his actions by claiming he had been trying to expose the wrongdoing of D and "ingratiate himself" with A.He said he was acting out of revenge against D and that his aim was to ensure the employee would be exposed, "get his comeuppance" and be sacked.However, in his closing speech to jurors, Ellison dismissed the claim, saying: "A demand with menaces can be made in many different ways other than by writing a note saying: 'I hereby demand X, or else.'" He added: "We have, if one stands back, a pretty clear, pretty classic example of blackmail."
