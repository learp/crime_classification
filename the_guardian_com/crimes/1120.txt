A 31-year-old man has been arrested following a burglary in which a woman was allegedly "waterboarded" inside her home.Francoise Jansen described the ordeal, which took place in St George's Hill, Weybridge, Surrey, as "sheer hell" and said she thought she was going to die at the hands of the two masked burglars who broke into her home.Surrey police said they had arrested the man from Brookwood, Surrey, on Wednesday in connection with an aggravated burglary.A force spokesman said the man remained in police custody and that inquiries into the incident were ongoing.Jansen was alone when the raiders forced their way into the property at about 10.50pm on Friday. She was forced to open a safe before the men, dressed in black clothes and balaclavas, stole jewellery and personal items worth a reported Â£150,000.Jansen, 73, said she attempted to press a panic button installed in her bedroom, prompting the burglars to boil a kettle and pour scalding water over her arm as punishment. She said she was also gagged, waterboarded and tied to a radiator during an assault that left her with multiple injuries.She told the Daily Mail: "I was consumed by fear. It was sheer hell and all I can remember is praying."Detective Inspector Jake Nuttall, who is leading the investigation, said: "This was an appalling, unprovoked attack on a defenceless, elderly woman in her own home and Surrey police is carrying out a thorough and extensive investigation to bring these cowardly offenders to justice."The victim sustained injuries to her wrists, arms and shoulders during the attack but fortunately she is expected to make a full recovery. She has understandably been left deeply upset by this horrendous ordeal."This type of senseless violence will not be tolerated and I would urge anyone who may have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary in St George's Hill late on Friday night into the early hours of Saturday morning to call police as a matter of urgency."
