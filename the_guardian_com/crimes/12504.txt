After serving six years in prison for the murder of his foster daughter, Billie-Jo, the former deputy headteacher Siôn Jenkins was yesterday granted bail pending his re-trial.Mr Jenkins, 46, whose conviction was quashed last month in the light of fresh scientific evidence, was released from Belmarsh prison at 8.30pm last night. He will live with his family in Aberystwyth while he waits for the new trial. His father, David Jenkins, and brother, John, provided a bail surety totalling £300,000 to help secure his freedom.The bail conditions, imposed by Mrs Justice Rafferty during a short hearing at the Old Bailey, stipulate that Mr Jenkins must not travel more than 10 miles from his family's home, except when visiting his legal team or going to court, and that he must report to a police station daily.He is also forbidden from speaking or writing to his daughters about the trial.Two of his children, Lottie and Annie, were with him on the afternoon Billie-Jo was battered to death on the patio of the family home in Hastings, and they could be called to give evidence at the new trial.Outside court, Mr Jenkins' father said: "We are absolutely delighted that Siôn has been allowed bail. It is another step towards getting justice. It will be great to have him home."He said the fact that his son was given bail "reinforces our confidence that eventually he will be found not guilty".It would also make it easier for him to consult his legal team in the build-up to the trial, which is expected to take place in the new year, he said.Siôn Jenkins did not attend yesterday's hearing. He has spent most of the life sentence handed down at his trial in 1998 at Wakefield prison in West Yorkshire, but he was moved to Belmarsh high security prison in south-east London after his appeal.During yesterday's hearing, which took place behind closed doors, it was agreed that Mr Jenkins would not speak to the media. The police also said that a website set up to support his fight against conviction would be taken down - although it remained available yesterday, with an update reporting that he had been given bail.His father added: "After all these years, you need space and perhaps silence in order to prepare for the retrial."Najma Khanzada, a member of Mr Jenkins' legal team, said there were a number of "administrative" matters which needed to be dealt with before her client could walk free.Mr Jenkins was given bail before his first trial and arrived at Lewes crown court every day accompanied by minders.His lawyers have assured the court that his safety can be guaranteed after his release this time.At the appeal court last month, three judges quashed his conviction, but said that a retrial was required in the public interest.No date for the new hearing has been set, but a prosecution source suggested that it might take place in January at the Old Bailey.Before that, Mr Jenkins will be brought back before the court to plead to a fresh indictment.
