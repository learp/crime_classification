A former policeman has admitted illegally possessing 650 wild bird eggs that were collected while he was still a serving officer.A search of Michael Upson's house in Sotherton, Suffolk, revealed the horde, including those of protected species such as woodlark, Cetti's warbler and marsh harrier.Upson, 52, pleaded guilty to possessing the eggs at Norwich magistrates court after a joint investigation by his old force Suffolk police, Norfolk police and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).Notebooks found at the house documented Upson's egg collecting trips with others around the UK. One note showed he took kittiwake eggs from Lowestoft Pier while on duty as acting sergeant on three different night shifts.The notebooks also detailed visits to Scotland's Western Isles to steal golden eagle eggs, south Devon to take Cetti's warbler eggs, north Wales to steal chough eggs and the New Forest to take hawfinch eggs.Upson claimed to have stopped egg collecting, but the evidence found indicates that he was active between at least 1991 and 2001, the RSPB said.RSPB investigations officer Mark Thomas said: "That a police officer should knowingly break the law in pursuit of this obsession is shocking, and we welcome his conviction."The egg collection was found in an old suitcase in Upson's loft, along with hundreds of egg data cards, which he had faked to suggest the collection was old.The notebooks found in a plastic container hidden in the water tank in the loft gave the accurate details of when the eggs were taken, in full written accounts, according to the RSPB.Upson will be sentenced on Thursday.
