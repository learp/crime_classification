Police officers are still refusing to take complaints of rape seriously if the victims come from "the wrong part of town", if they have been drinking or if they have made previous allegations, according to a report by Sara Payne, the national victims' champion.Payne, who was appointed by the government in January, says this culture of disbelief is matched by a generally held misconception across the criminal justice system that a rapist is a stranger who breaks into victims' homes or attacks them in public places, and who uses force.Her report on the treatment of rape victims says the evidence shows that most victims are attacked in private, by someone known to them, and injuries are not common.Payne says this public misconception needs to be challenged by a high-profile public awareness campaign because it affects every stage of the process from the willingness of victims to report the crime to whether juries are prepared to convict a defendant who doesn't fit their idea of a "real rapist".Her report, which is based on focus groups with adult women rape victims as well as expert groups of police, prosecutors and specialists in sexual violence, highlights the inconsistent treatment of rape victims by different criminal justice agencies.She says many frontline police officers told her they were inadequately prepared to deal with rape victims and felt that, in trying not to do anything wrong, it was better not to do anything at all.The report says that some police officers tried to take on tasks that did not fall to them and cites the case of an officer who spent all night visiting hospitals in his area trying to find a paediatrician with the victim in the back of his patrol car.The study of the treatment of rape victims was carried out at the request of the home secretary and its results have fed into the revised strategy on tackling violence against women and girls and the more in-depth official review of the issue being carried out by Lady Stern.Payne, whose daughter Sarah was murdered by a convicted paedophile, says the initial response to a complaint of rape, especially from professionals, is critical. A raised eyebrow can be the difference between a victim deciding to continue with a case or withdraw from the process.She says that although police told her theirpolicy was to believe the victim from the outset, some said they were aware of "officers who can be sceptical of victims for numerous reasons, such as when the victim had been drinking, had made previous allegations, were from a certain area, had an offending history themselves, or simply because they did not behave in the way that they expected a victim to behave â€“ eg she was not obviously distressed."The report says the intial attitude of the officer who first dealt with the case often influenced how seriously it was dealt with from that point on. It cites the case of a control room officer who did not pass on information about a reported rape until the following day because the victim had a history of reporting rape and so he did not take her seriously."Victims of any crime need to feel that they are taken seriously and that they are supported to overcome the impact a crime has had on them. Too often new announcements do not change anything on the ground. Ensuring that what is supposed to happen, does happen must be a central part of any initiative to tackle sexual violence," said Payne.
