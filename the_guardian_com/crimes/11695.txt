The wife of one of Britain's richest heirs has been arrested after trying to enter the US embassy in central London while allegedly carrying wraps of cocaine and heroin.Eva Rausing was held outside the embassy in Mayfair, leading to a police raid on the couple's Chelsea home, where more than £1,500 of drugs are alleged to have been found. Her husband, Hans Kristian Rausing, the heir to the £5bn Tetra Pak drink packaging empire, was then also arrested. They were released on bail until July while police continue their inquiries.A spokesman for the US embassy said Mrs Rausing, who is a US citizen, had not entered the embassy, and had been due there for an appointment on Tuesday afternoon.Yesterday, Mrs Rausing, 44, said: "I have made a grave error and I consider myself to have taken a wrong turn in the course of my life. I am very sorry for the upset I have caused." Mr Rausing's father, also called Hans, is a Swedish billionaire who built up the Tetra Pak empire with his late brother Gad. He has lived in England since the early 1980s and has donated £500,000 to the Conservatives.Mrs Rausing is a financial supporter of Action on Addiction, a charity which helps people with drink and drugs problems. Nick Barton, its joint chief executive, said: "The E and HK Rausing Trust has been an extremely generous supporter of addiction charities for many years. Their support has resulted in a great many people and their families receiving help for their addiction problems."Scotland Yard said: " At approximately 16:20 on Tuesday police officers arrested a woman in Mayfair on suspicion of possessing class A drugs. Following this arrest a search was conducted at a residential address in Chelsea and a 44-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possessing class A drugs."
