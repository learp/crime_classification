A woman was jailed for seven years today for causing the death by dangerous driving of 15-month-old Finlay Woods, who was crushed by her 4x4 when it mounted the pavement and careered into a primary school.Katie Gutierrez-Perez, 39, was drunk when she crashed her black Toyota into Finlay's buggy outside Selwyn junior and infant school in Chingford, north-east London, on 18 September last year.Several parents who were picking up their children from school tried to lift the vehicle off Finlay, while others shielded pupils from the distressing scene. The toddler, who was out with his mother and grandmother, died soon after arriving at Whipps Cross hospital.Jailing the former restaurateur, the judge, Timothy King, told Gutierrez-Perez she had left the boy's family, including his mother, 31-year-old Tina Woods, devastated.Gutierrez-Perez admitted the charge at Snaresbrook crown court on 2 December. She entered her plea via video link because of fears for her safety. The court heard the mother-of-two had been driving to hospital after a failed suicide attempt and her lawyer Sue Rodham said that her client had a history of depression.Hundreds of people gathered for the funeral of Finlay in September. A eulogy written by his mother read: "So many people loved this little man and it has left an empty hole in our life. He will be forever our perfect little angel, so it is not goodbye, but see you later."
