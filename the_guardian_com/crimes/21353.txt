Tony Blair is considering cancelling a book signing in London after eggs and shoes were thrown at him at a similar event in Dublin.Blair said he did not want to incur extra policing costs, and that his memoirs, entitled A Journey, were selling well enough not to need further promotion.The former prime minister also hinted that, despite his unpopularity, he was eager to return to British political life if "the right job came up".Four men were arrested and charged with public order offences after eggs and shoes were thrown at the Dublin signing.Blair faces the prospect of further disruption, with anti-war protesters planning to target the London launch of his book at the Waterstones store in Piccadilly on Wednesday.Commenting on the protest, Blair told ITV's new breakfast programme, Daybreak, it was "sad" that people wanted to disrupt such events. He indicated that he could call the London signing off amid evidence that other groups protesting against him were set to join in with the demonstration."To be frank about it, I am concerned," he told Daybreak. "I do not want to put everyone through a lot of cost and hassle on this Wednesday's signing, so I am thinking about that."Blair said the Metropolitan police were "fabulous, and they will do whatever we ask them to do" but added that the force should not be asked to commit resources unnecessarily."The book is selling fantastically, the BNP apparently are now saying they want to get in on the action, and you end up causing a lot of hassle for people – and cost – when there are better things for the police to do," he said. "It's not as if we need to do it."In a round of interviews, Blair hinted he was seeking to make a return to British political life, but admitted it would be "very difficult" for him to do so.His comments followed an interview published in the Sunday Times magazine yesterday, in which he said: "I feel a great urge to participate in my country's political life."Blair, who was PM for 10 years before quitting in May 2007, conceded today that he would "love to" be involved in some way.Asked on ITV about his apparent hints at a comeback, he said: "What did I have in mind when I said that? I don't know, actually, because I am sure it would be very difficult for me to play a part here. But what I really wanted to say was that I remain deeply committed to the country. I love this country and I want to see it do well."His "new life" outside domestic politics had shown him that Britain had "a lot that we need to do to prepare for the future", he said. "Frankly, I doubt there is a way I can play a part – but if I can, I would love to."Blair admitted in another interview with Sky News that he feared British politics had probably "finished with me", rather than the other way around."I don't know. You never know, but don't take that as a great sign that I've got some great plan in mind, because I don't really," he said.He underlined his commitment to domestic policy in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph, in which he said he saw himself as "basically a public service guy" and said: "If the right job came up, I'd definitely do it."Blair used the newspaper interview to mount his first direct policy attack on the coalition as he criticised the liberal prison policies being pursued by David Cameron's government.The former prime minister, who once promised to be "tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime", said he "profoundly disagrees" with the approach of Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary, who has rejected the "prison works" mantra of previous administrations.Clarke has challenged the trend towards larger prison populations and questioned the need for short sentences, suggesting the government could save money by locking up fewer offenders and focusing more on rehabilitation.But Blair called for "a far tougher, more targeted way" of tackling crime. "You've got to put in prison those who deserve to be there," he said.He said "dysfunctional families who produce 14-year-old kids stabbing one another to death" are "making people's lives hell", and suggested Britain could learn from developing countries which "just don't accept" criminality.Ed Miliband, a frontrunner in the Labour leadership race, who warned it was time to "move on" from the Blair era following the publication of the former prime minister's memoirs last week, expressed support for Clarke's approach.Miliband said: "I'm proud of so much of what we achieved in government, including getting down the rate of crime. But as Tony once said, you have to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and I still think that's true today. We know prison works for serious offenders. But there are far too many people on short sentences, who will come out unreformed and almost three quarters will reoffend within a year."He called for a change of approach to prisons as well as tougher community sentences."As Britain's former top policeman, Sir Ian Blair, has said this week, too many young people leave prison without new skills other than those they have been taught by fellow criminals, without drug therapy and then get back into gangs and back into drugs. Changing our approach to prison and having more tough community sentences is how we will tackle the causes of crime."
