Two men were arrested yesterday on suspicion of the murder of Jessie James, the 15-year-old shot dead in a park in Moss Side, Manchester, nearly a year ago.A 21-year-old man from Old Trafford and a 20-year-old man from Hulme were arrested in separate prisons in the north-west of England, a spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said. The arrests came after an anonymous witness had come forward on Monday after approaching a religious leader."I am hopeful," Jessie's mother, Barbara Reid, told the BBC Today programme yesterday. "There is a possibility that this witness who came forward out of the blue, his evidence will be able to crack the case."The witness approached a minister after the publicity given to the inquest, where witnesses gave evidence anonymously by video link. The measures were taken because of the difficulty in persuading potential witnesses to come forward."It is the first time since the murder that I have seen witness testimony in any form that causes me to believe it may assist the prosecution," said Detective Superintendent Shaun Donnellan, who is heading the inquiry. Earlier, Mr Donnellan had reiterated his promise to protect any other witnesses. "I will give a guarantee that we will protect anyone who comes forward with evidence," he said.The police are still hopeful that others will come forward and are offering a reward of Â£20,000 for information leading to the conviction of the killers.
