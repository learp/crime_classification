The Home Office yesterday moved to stop the possibility of Maxine Carr being released within weeks by changing the rules governing a tagging scheme.It was announced that "in exceptional" cases the decision over who was eligible for the scheme would be taken not by a prison governor, as now happens, but by Martin Narey as head of the newly-created National Offender Management Service.The prisons and probation minister, Paul Goggins, said the change was being made to ensure that the public retained confidence in the scheme.But the decision was greeted with dismay by Carr's legal team, which claimed the government was changing the rules to penalise one prisoner. It was branded a "dangerous precedent" by the probation union, Napo.Carr was jailed last month for three and a half years for providing a false alibi for her former boyfriend, Ian Huntley, who murdered the 10-year-old Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.The former classroom assistant, 26, will be eligible for release on May 17. By then, taking into account her time on remand awaiting trial, she will have served half her sentence.But she had applied to be allowed out of prison before May, under the home detention curfew scheme (HDC). Under the scheme, prisoners not serving long sentences for violent or sexual crimes, and thought not to be a risk to the public and unlikely to reoffend can be freed up to four months early.Last year the scheme, designed to help tackle over crowding in prisons, attracted criticism when Brendon Fearon, one of the burglars who raided Tony Martin's farm, was released with a tag after being jailed for dealing heroin, three days before the farmer was due to be freed.Inevitably, tabloid newspapers, some of whom sought to depict Carr as the new Myra Hindley, would have expressed outrage had she been allowed out under the scheme.In a written statement yesterday, Mr Goggins said: "A recent case has highlighted the fact that ... there will be exceptional cases where an offender may be considered unsuitable for HDC ... if to grant HDC would undermine public confidence in the scheme." Home Office sources confirmed that the "recent case" was Carr. The source indicated that her case would definitely be looked at by Mr Narey, who has been appointed chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, which is to replace the Prison Service.A Home Office spokesman said it would be up to prison governors to refer applications deemed to be of a sensitive nature to Mr Narey.Carr's solicitor, Roy James, said: "I am disappointed that on the face of it the rules have been changed for one particular person," he said.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, said: "This is a dangerous precedent. It would allow the press to determine whether a high-profile prisoner is released."Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "If the Home Office is seen to be looking over its shoulder at how its decisions will play in the press, rather than explaining the basis on which these decisions have been made, this will undermine confidence in the criminal justice system."But in Soham, Holly Wells's aunt, Lesley Allen, said: "I don't think she should be let out yet, or that she has served enough time."
