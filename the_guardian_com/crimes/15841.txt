A man appeared in court today charged with the murders of two sisters found stabbed to death in their Birmingham flat.Mohammed Ali, 28, of Old Snowhill, Birmingham, is accused of killing Yasmine and Sabrina Larbi-Cherif in a frenzied knife attack. He spoke only to confirm his name and address at Birmingham magistrates' court.The bodies of the sisters, aged 22 and 19, were discovered in the flat they shared in the city's Ladywood district on Monday.Two magistrates were told today that their family, who live in the Wembley area of north-west London, phoned police after failing to contact the women, who usually called home every day.When West Midlands police visited the city centre Jupiter Apartments complex they found the sisters lying on two single beds in the bedroom, the prosecuting solicitor, Louisa Dolphin, said.Yasmine, 22, had been stabbed twice, once in the back, and Sabrina, 19, had suffered a "significant amount" of stab wounds, Dolphin added.The Algerian-born sisters, described by their family as "humble and compassionate" young women who excelled both socially and academically, came to Britain 10 years ago to study.Yasmine, who spoke four languages and was studying biochemistry at Birmingham University, had been looking forward to being joined by her sister.Sabrina, who played the piano and the guitar, had a gained place at the university to study French and hoped to transfer to dentistry. The pair, who had three brothers, had just finished furnishing the flat they were moving into together.No application for bail was made and Ali was remanded in custody to appear next at Birmingham crown court on September 26.
