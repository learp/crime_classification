A star of the Harry Potter films has been sentenced to two years in prison for being part of a violent mob which took to the streets during last summer's riots in London.Jamie Waylett, 22, who played Hogwarts bully Vincent Crabbe in six of the films, was found guilty of violent disorder on Tuesday.The jury at London's Wood Green crown court took three-and-a-half hours to reach their verdicts.The actor, who had already admitted swigging from a stolen bottle of champagne during the rioting, was cleared of intending to destroy or damage property with a petrol bomb he was pictured holding.He has a previous conviction for cannabis possession.Waylett was part of a gang of at least four people who took to the streets of Chalk Farm, north London, on the night of 8 August last year, the third night of violence in the capital.
