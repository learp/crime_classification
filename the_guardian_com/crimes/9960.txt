A date for your diary this week - my colleague Paul Lewis is giving a talk on Thursday about Mark Kennedy and the network of police spies in protest movements. Paul will be talking about how Kennedy operated as an undercover police officer in the environmental campaign for seven years. He will also be talking how the police had been carrying out surveillance of protesters. It starts at 5.30pm at King's Place near King's Cross station, London. Here's the blurb for it - unfortunately you will have to pay to get in.
