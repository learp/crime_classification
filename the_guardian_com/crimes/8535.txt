The police complaints authority last night launched an investigation into the fatal shooting by armed officers of a man who had barricaded himself in a house for nine hours after a domestic dispute.Police were called to the house in Harrow, west London, at 3.24am on Wednesday after a woman, 41, suffered head injuries as the result of an assault. The woman was taken to hospital, and the suspect, who is believed to have had a gun, barricaded himself in a room inside the house. Officers from the Metropolitan police's SO19 firearms unit were called and were inside the house as negotiations went on to try to get the man to come out of the bedroom. After almost nine hours of negotiations, at around 1pm, a shot was heard in the bedroom. Shortly afterwards the man is believed to have come out from the bedroom and was shot once in the chest by police. Paramedics at the scene tried to revive the 62-year-old man. He was taken by ambulance to Northwick Park hospital, where he was pronounced dead just before 2pm. He has yet to be identified and a postmortem examination is expected to be carried out today. An inquest has yet to be scheduled. Scotland Yard said one officer has been "relieved of his firearm duties as a matter of course" while the investigation was carried out. The woman involved in the incident was taken to a west London hospital and her condition was believed to be stable.
