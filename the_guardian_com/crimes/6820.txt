The first nationwide police operation to tackle the sex trafficking trade began today with the launch of posters and leaflets aimed at vulnerable young women lured to the UK by criminal gangs.Operation Pentameter - which will be carried out in cooperation with the travel industry and agencies across Europe - aims to prevent sexual exploitation by targeting potential victims as they arrive in the UK and urging them to contact a helpline.Police will be on duty at major ports and airports throughout the UK to distribute the leaflets, which ask women if they know what they will be doing in the country and whether anybody has taken their passport.Travel staff will also be asked to report any suspicious activity to police and immigration officials.The Association of Chief Police Officers said trafficking victims were mostly women and children from eastern European countries, including Lithuania, Romania, Estonia and Poland. Many had been enticed to the UK by the promise of jobs in childcare or the catering industry, but had their passports taken away on arrival and were forced into prostitution or other forms of slave labour.Some were forced to see up to 40 clients a day and threatened with violence if they refused. The business card-style leaflets and posters - which will also be displayed at ports and airports - are printed in English, Russian, Lithuanian and Latvian. They contain contact details including the Crimestoppers number.The campaign is also intended to educate men about the realities of prostitution in the hope such knowledge will reduce demand.Dr Tim Brain, ACPO's spokesman on prostitution, said an estimate by the Home Office five years ago put the number of trafficking victims at around 1,400. He warned that figure could have doubled since then. "Human beings from other countries are being duped into coming here and being kept captive, subjected to sexual exploitation and being sold for profit," he said. "This is an abhorrent crime that must not and will not be tolerated just because, by its very nature, it is away from the public eye. We will locate and rescue these people from their captors."He said the help of the travel industry - particularly workers at ports and airports - was crucial in the battle to end what he described as "modern-day slavery".Natalia Dawkins, the manager of the Home Office-funded Poppy project, which offers support to women trafficked into prostitution, said she hoped the campaign would encourage women to think twice before trusting people promising them employment in the UK.The government has yet to decide whether to accept a European agreement that would give the victims of trafficking the automatic right to stay in Britain for six months. As the law stands, the fate of victims depends on their individual case.
