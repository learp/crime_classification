Ministers' hopes of curbing the rise in the prison population in England and Wales by appealing to the courts to use community punishments for non-violent offenders have been dealt a blow by the latest official sentencing statistics.They show that despite repeated pleas from home secretaries and senior judicial figures, the proportion of offenders given community penalties or fined actually dropped last year while the proportion sent to prison has remained stable.Prison numbers in England and Wales once again topped 80,000 last Friday despite the introduction of the "end of custody licence" scheme, which has seen more than 1,800 short-sentence prisoners leave jail 18 days early.The rise in prison numbers to 80,229, with 35 in emergency police cells, takes prison chiefs back to where they were at the end of April. Ministers were forced to bring in the early release scheme when the prison population peaked at 81,040 at the end of June. It could hit a new record in September or October.The detailed sentencing statistics show that the courts do not appear to have responded to the repeated pleas from politicians and senior judges to make greater use of community penalties.In February, John Reid, then home secretary, backed by the lord chief justice and the attorney general, stirred controversy by reminding the courts that they should not be jailing offenders who pose no risk to the public.But the detailed sentencing statistics published yesterday show that the use of community penalties fell by 2.7% points to 33.8% last year. Fines were imposed in 16.9% of cases - down 1.9 points. Suspended sentences rose by 5 points to 8.3%. "The most notable change in the period has been the increase in suspended sentence orders," said the Ministry of Justice.A ministry spokeswoman said despite the recent fall, the overall trend in community sentences was still upwards. "They are not a soft option."
