The government last night dropped its plans to privatise the probation service after criticism from judges, magistrates and more than 80 backbench Labour MPs. The Home Office confirmed that plans to introduce a "mixed market" in the community supervision of 200,000 offenders will not be included in a police and justice bill to be published next week.The decision is a big setback for Tony Blair's third term plans to reform the public services and has been taken despite a strong defence of the introduction of "contestability", as it is called into the probation service, by the former Downing Street strategy adviser, Lord Birt, in the House of Lords last week.It is believed that a three-month review of the plans will take place and the Home Office will now "think again" about the future of the national offender management service [Noms] which brings together the prison and probation services.The legislation would have scrapped local probation boards and placed the management of the probation service in the hands of regional offender managers appointed by the home secretary.The review coincides with the arrival of a new permanent secretary at the Home Office, Sir David Normington, from the education department who is believed to have urged a fresh look at the plans. The home secretary, Charles Clarke, "fully intends" to put the plans to parliament as soon as possible.A Home Office spokesman said: "There is no question of the legislation being abandoned. The government intends to introduce it as soon as possible. Final decisions have yet to be taken about which bill will include these measures."The publication of a five-year plan for the development of the probation and prison services and a "detailed contestability prospectus" aimed at private companies and the voluntary sector have also been delayed.The plans sparked strong opposition within the criminal justice system.Labour MPs protested that the plans would have meant private prison companies writing reports for the courts on who should go to prison.Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation union, last night welcomed the delay in the legislation: "The government are planning to abolish the service and replace it with privatisation and competition. It is now apparent there is no support for the plans throughout the criminal justice system. Ministers should now use this space to consider effective alternatives."Juliet Lyons of the Prison Reform Trust also welcomed the decision: "This important breathing space gives time to unravel the Alice in Wonderland world that Noms has become."
