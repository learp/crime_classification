Innocent until proven guilty (with due media decorum exercised, once someone's charged with an offence, up to and including serial killings)? Well, I'm sure the lawyers will have sweated over every word published about Stephen Griffiths, "the 40-year-old oddball … who was always 'Ven Pariah' in his own mind, the confident, dominant character of his dark alter ego."And that was only the Daily Mail, over five pages. You could pick your tabloid – or upmarket paper, agonising about the vulnerability of sex workers – and take your choice of gory detail. Suzanne Blamires, the dismembered victim in the River Aire, gazed from front pages. Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth, two more maybe-victims, were ceaselessly recycled across inside pages. An old, sad picture of Griffiths's mum was also there, for no apparent reason except blanket coverage of everything that moved and died around Bradford.Bradford? Ah, one haunt of the Yorkshire Ripper three decades ago, a building block in serial killer history before Ipswich or Fred and Rose West. And we need to be clear that it was in Bradford, too, that the direst strain on contempt of court and crime reporting first became so obvious.Northern Ireland and the IRA was a bit of it as well. Have you, Joe Public, seen any of these berserk bombers, photos attached? Gotcha! And now can you help us find the Ripper, too? The line between police hunt and appeals for public help and charging a suspect almost snapped under such strain. There became a kind of crime – threatening, repetitive, high profile – where the rules no longer applied. And, in a world where library shelves bulging with James Patterson best sellers, that's natural enough.Sex, violence, madness, fury, crossbow cannibals? Who could ask for anything more? Except the precise prospect of justice, perhaps. Or, at least, a realistic change in the law.
