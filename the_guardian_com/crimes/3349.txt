The parents of an 11-year-old boy killed when a car mounted a pavement in Bristol made an emotional appeal today for the woman believed to have been driving the vehicle to come forward.Hannah Saaf, a 27-year-old mother of twins, should contact the police "so we can begin to put our lives back together", Rachel Riddall said in a brief statement to reporters alongside her husband, Martin.The couple's son, Sam, died after a white Ford Focus struck him as he walked home from a church youth service in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, on Friday evening.Avon and Somerset police took the unusual step of naming Saaf, from Kingswood, Bristol, as the suspected driver of the car, who was seen fleeing the scene on foot."Hannah, if you're watching this or you can hear this, please come forward," said Mrs Riddall, who described herself as "a mum who has lost a precious son".Her husband said Sam had loved football, his three brothers aged five, nine and 14, and "he also knew that he was loved by us very much indeed"."This is an impossible time for us," he said. "We've got three other children and they are full of questions that we can't even begin to answer."Sam was "the most wonderful of boys and we loved him very much," Mr Riddall said, and while the family's religious faith was a comfort, "we miss him very much indeed and we wish that he was with us, every second of the day".Detective Chief Inspector Gary Stephens, of Avon and Somerset police, said there was a "credible" report that Saaf had been seen alone in central Bristol on Saturday. "We also have concerns concerning Hannah's welfare," he said.There had been other reported sightings of Saaf, the registered owner of the car involved, as far afield as Bath and Brighton, Stephens said, and her "transient lifestyle" was making her hard to track down.
