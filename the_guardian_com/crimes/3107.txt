In a blur of expensive suits, mirrored sunglasses and blacked out luxury cars, Asil Nadir, the 69-year-old fugitive Polly Peck millionaire, today returned to the UK for the first time since he fled British justice 17 years ago, accused of a £34m fraud.Surrounded by private security guards and accompanied by his 26-year old wife, Noor, Nadir touched down at Luton airport before sweeping into his new Mayfair base in London from where he promised to clear his name at the Old Bailey next month."My conscience is clear, I am innocent," he said as his borrowed Airbus A320 carried him and his entourage from Anatalya in Turkey. "I am just going to England and we'll see how life goes, we've got a little injustice to sort out."But even before he could feel the tarmac beneath his feet and settle into the sleek grey Jaguar idling on the apron, the reality of his predicament became clear. Immediately after his jet landed at 1.25pm investigators from the Serious Fraud Office boarded his plane to check, and reportedly confiscate, documents.Four marked police cars, including one carrying a pair of search dogs, waited outside the gate, along with journalists from newspapers and TV stations.Nadir is on £250,000 bail ahead of his 3 September court hearing and is due to be fitted with an electronic tag as part of court-imposed conditions agreed before he decided to return to face trial. After about 30 minutes, Nadir finally descended the aircraft steps, followed by Noor in a flowing white two-piece outfit.He was driven towards Mayfair, followed by a marked police car. Despite heavily blacked out windows, his car was swamped by photographers and slowed to walking pace, until the following police car sounded its siren, scattering the press.The special arrangements for Nadir puzzled onlookers. Peter Bates, 61, who had just returned from 12 days in Romania with four members of his family, said he could "just about" recall Nadir leaving 17 years ago."I didn't know he was coming back," Bates said. "But if he's suspected of a crime he should be taken into custody on arrival and taken to court – I thought that's how the legal system worked in this country."When his car pulled up in Upper Brook Street, outside his £20,000 a month rented townhouse, Nadir had lots to say about that very legal system.Engulfed by reporters and photographers, he said he was pleased he had enjoyed "a dignified return to Britain" and asked that the "injustice and abuse of process" ends with a fair trial and some "breathing space to work on the case"."I hope the past mistakes will not continue any longer," he said."I hope that people that rule this country and the entire population are as interested as I am that justice is practised. Everyone should be innocent until proven guilty."Asked "are you innocent?", he replied: "absolutely, why do you think I am here?". He said he was delighted to be back in the UK after so long in exile in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the UK.Nadir, whose Polly Peck trading empire collapsed leaving him facing 66 counts of theft involving £34m fraud allegations, was known for his ability to cut a deal and had clearly done so again, this time with the media.To mark his return, journalists from the Times and Sky News had access to Nadir at his luxury villa in Cyprus in recent days where they filmed him posing beside his pool with wife, his four dogs, including his favourite, Lucy and two parrots, named, inevitably, Polly and Peck.Speaking to Sky News on the plane back, the Conservative party donor said he hoped the new coalition government would offer him a fairer hearing, saying: "Why should the new government own up to the wrongdoings of others in the past? I hope that they will be wise enough and think highly enough of Great Britain to clear this matter."
