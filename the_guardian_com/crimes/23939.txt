Four London probation officers were suspended yesterday and face possible disciplinary action after a damning official inquiry report into the murder of the Chelsea financier John Monckton found a "collective failure" by probation and parole staff.The "numerous" blunders in the official supervision of his murderer, Damien Hanson, after his release on licence from prison included the "utterly extraordinary situation" that he was told to report to a probation officer in an area of London from which he was officially banned.The highly critical report by Andrew Bridges, the chief inspector of probation, says that while it is not possible to eliminate risk altogether when serious and dangerous offenders are managed in the community, the public is entitled to expect the authorities to do their job properly. This "simply did not happen" in this case.Hanson, 25, was jailed for 36 years for the murder of Monckton at his Chelsea home in November 2004. He carried out the killing shortly after being released early from a 12-year prison sentence for attempted murder.There were also repeated failures to enforce the conditions in the drug testing and treatment order that his accomplice, Elliot White, 24, was serving at the time of the attack.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, last night conceded that the case highlighted wider questions about the quality of supervision of high-risk offenders after their release from prison.He will now consider introducing legislation this year which will give the parole board the retrospective power to ensure that dangerous offenders jailed before April last year are not released from prison if they still represent a risk to the public.It may mean that some serious offenders will spend the rest of their lives behind bars even though they have not been given a life sentence.A new "indeterminate" sentence recently put on the statute book gives the parole board a similar power to ensure that serious sexual and violent offenders convicted since April last year are not released from prison until it is safe to do so."I will be examining whether there are any means by which this approach can be applied to those who were convicted before last April," Mr Clarke said.The Bridges report says the original parole board decision to release Hanson was "defensible in principle" but the release plan was "lacking in detail and not fit for purpose" and there was "an overall collective failure by the London probation area".Among his criticisms are:路 There is no evidence that an earlier risk assessment showing there was a 91% probability of Hanson committing a further sexual or violent offence was ever made available to the parole board.路 His release was "strictly conditional" on his going to a hostel in Essex away from his home area in London, but just before his release date that was changed to Battersea, London. On the day of his release he was told to go to Streatham instead.路 He was banned from entering the entire London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, where most of his family and friends lived, but told to report to an unnamed probation officer in the area. This was the "most glaring deficiency".路 His earlier 91% risk assessment meant he should have been classed a "high-risk" prisoner on release and referred to a multi-agency public protection panel for supervision, but no fresh assessment was done on his release and a handwritten supervision plan classed him as a lower, "level 1" risk. Mr Bridges says there is no explanation for this.He concludes: "We are also very critical of the fact that the individuals who found themselves having to deal with this case under these unsatisfactory organisational arrangements did not show greater initiative in making decisions and taking action to ensure that the case was better managed despite these difficulties."Mr Bridges says that five different probation officers, including supervisors, were involved in the case at different times.David Scott, the chief probation officer for London, last night said they deeply regretted the tragedy for the Monckton family and accepted the findings of the report. The four officers were being suspended because it was a case of national importance and there needed to be a further review of staff conduct and capability.
