A rapist with a shoe obsession who attacked a string of women in the early 1980s was finally caught after detectives matched a DNA sample from his sister with evidence gathered at the time of the assaults.The so-called Dearne Valley shoe rapist terrorised women in the Rotherham and Barnsley areas of South Yorkshire, dragging victims off the street and tying them up with pairs of tights before raping them. Afterwards he would take their shoes.His identity remained a mystery until South Yorkshire police decided to reopen the case five years ago. As part of the investigation, DNA samples gathered at the time were compared with samples on the police database. More than 40 close matches were obtained and the third house police visited was that of the rapist's sister, whose sample had been taken when she was arrested for an unrelated matter.Appearing at Sheffield crown court yesterday, James Lloyd, 49, admitted raping four women between December 1983 and August 1986 as well as attempting to rape two other women in February 1983 and October 1984. He pleaded not guilty to a further charge of attempting to rape another woman and a charge of stealing a pair of black and gold stiletto shoes from an eighth woman.Detective Inspector Angie Wright said that when Lloyd heard the police were looking for him, he told a relative: "Look after my children. I have committed a series of offences 20 years ago." He then tried to hang himself.Ms Wright said Lloyd, who had a senior management position, was regarded as a "pillar of the community". But officers who searched the printing firm he ran in Wath-upon-Dearne found more than 100 pairs of shoes as well as jewellery taken from his victims. Lloyd, of Thurnscoe, near Barnsley, will not be sentenced until he has been assessed by a psychiatrist.The Recorder of Sheffield, Judge Alan Goldsack QC, adjourned the case to a date to be fixed in September.
