An elderly man found fatally injured in a street is believed to have been a victim of a hit-and-run, police have said.The 75-year-old, who has not yet been named, died in hospital after being discovered in Smethwick, near Birmingham, at about 9.30pm on Saturday.West Midlands police said they believed the man was hit by a large vehicle such as a 4x4 or a van before he was found in Beakes Road.Inspector Paul Bennett, from the regional collision investigation unit, said police were investigating the incident. "At this stage we believe he has been struck by a large vehicle, possibly a 4x4 car or a van," he said. "Whoever was driving must have known they had hit a person but, rather than stop to help, they left him in the road to die."The vehicle itself would have sustained collision damage and I want to hear from anyone who may have information that could lead us to the vehicle and driver involved."He appealed to garage mechanics who may be asked to fix damage on a car or van and also to members of the public for information.Mr Bennett added: "Have you seen a car or van parked in your neighbourhood with serious damage that isn't usually there? If you have, call us on 101."I would also appeal to repair garage owners to be wary of any vehicles that are brought in with a large amount of damage that the owner can't explain."Please come forward if you think you can help, no matter how insignificant the information you have may seem."Anyone with information is urged call the regional collision investigation unit on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
