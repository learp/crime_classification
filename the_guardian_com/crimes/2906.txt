An elderly man extradited from Australia to face charges he raped young girls in Wales more than 60 years ago has told a court that the claims against him are "all lies".Reginald Davies, 78, is accused of 15 offences of rape and sexual assault over a 24-year period dating from 1949, in what is believed to be one of the oldest historic criminal cases in English legal history.He denies attacking four women when they were children, while living at a series of addresses near Caerphilly in south Wales. The oldest of his alleged child victims is now 71.Standing in the dock with the aid of a walking stick and wearing a hearing aid, Davies told Kingston crown court that the charges were "all false allegations". "'Nothing happened â€“ nothing at all," he said. "There's no truth whatsoever in it."The pensioner, originally from south Wales, emigrated to Australia in 1974. The court heard that one of his alleged victims had written him a handwritten letter around ten years ago, saying she had "lived with anger for 30 years" as a result of the abuse, and threatening to tell his wife.The same woman, together with another alleged victim, turned up at his doorstep unannounced in 2008 to repeat the claims.Australian police arrested Davies at Perth International Airport on 27 September last year, and he was flown to the UK the following day.The oldest victim is said to have been repeatedly abused from the age of eight. She tried to write about her ordeal in the early 1990s but found it impossible to type out her account in full, the court was told.Davies allegedly molested another from when she was aged 10 and threatened she would be taken to a "naughty girls home" and would never see her parents again if she told anyone.A third victim, who was nine when he is said to have raped her, was told the abuse would be "their secret", it was claimed.The court heard Davies left school at the age of 15 to work as a blacksmith. He served in the British Army with the Royal Armoured Corps from 1953 to 1957, during which time he was twice stationed in Germany, later returning to the mining industry in Wales and then Australia.Asked by his barrister, Mark Kimsey, if he had "at any time sexually touched any of those women", he replied: "Definitely not. I can put my hand on my heart. They're all false allegations."The women had come forward so many years after the alleged abuse because of collusion, he said.Davies denies three counts of rape, three counts of attempted rape, eight counts of indecent assault, and a single count of indecency with a child.The trial continues.
