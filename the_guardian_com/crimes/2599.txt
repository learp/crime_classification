A six-year-old girl suffered injuries to her throat after she rode into a bicycle brake cable, which had been tied across a pathway in a park.Lilly Bailey-Deacon was cycling in Wheatlands Park, Titchfield Common, Hampshire, with her grandparents when the incident happened on the afternoon of 14 August.The schoolgirl suffered a bruised throat after the cable caught her neck, pulling her from her bike.PC Jim Heath, of Hampshire police, said: "The cable was fixed deliberately to catch people using the path, and could have caused serious injury. I am very keen to trace those responsible to ensure there is no repeat incident, and to make them aware of how dangerous this could have been."I would like to appeal to anyone using the park who may have seen anyone fixing the cable in place or tampering with an abandoned purple and white child's BMX which has been left at the scene."In particular we would like to speak with two boys, aged around 15 or 16, who were sat in the nearby play park at the time of the incident, as they may have vital information."The girl's father, Bradley Deacon, 29, a heating engineer, told the Portsmouth News: "I was livid. When you get a phone call to say that your daughter has nearly been decapitated by some stupid idiot, I was livid."I can't believe that someone could do something so stupid. This was not a prank, it was a serious attempt to hurt someone for fun and that's unacceptable."
