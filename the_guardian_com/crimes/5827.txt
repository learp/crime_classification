Detectives investigating the murder of the Rev John Suddards in the Gloucestershire village of Thornbury want to speak to a man who was seen sitting on the pavement outside the vicar's church the night before he was killed.Suddards' body was found in the locked vicarage at St Mary's church on Tuesday morning.Det Ch Insp Simon Crisp, leading the murder inquiry for Avon and Somerset police, said officers think this man may be able to help them."If you were passing by please get in touch," he said in an appeal. "Were you out walking your dog that night or were you returning home from work? Did you notice anybody sitting on the pavement around this time?"The 59-year old vicar was stabbed to death after six months in his post in the village 11 miles from Bristol. He was described by locals as a sincere and bookish man who was devoted to the church.The man police seek is described as of average build and wearing dark clothing. Officers believe he was sitting close to the church between 6pm and 8pm.A 43-year old man arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of murder remains in custody and police on Friday secured an extra 24 hours to question him. They will have to decide whether to charge or release him by Saturday afternoon.It also emerged police have removed a white CitroÃ«n van from a property about a mile from the vicarage in which a man in his 40s is believed to have been sleeping and have been searching the surrounding property.On Friday the bishop of Gloucester, the Right Rev Michael Perham, was due to hold a service in memory of Suddards at the village's baptist church.In a statement released earlier by police, the vicar's family said: "We are devastated with the news of John's untimely and shocking death, so we would appreciate being left in peace at this time while we struggle to come to terms with what has happened."
