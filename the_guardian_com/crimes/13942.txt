A railway worker arrested by police hunting the 'Trophy Rapist' was remanded in custody by magistrates yesterday after being accused of a series of rapes against women and children.Antoni Imiela, 48, of Appledore, Kent, was charged with nine counts of rape in connection with the attacks across south-east England. Magistrates in Canterbury remanded Imiela in custody until 16 December, when he is due to appear at Maidstone Crown Court for a preliminary hearing. The defendant, in a grey polo shirt, was driven to court in a people carrier with blacked-out windows, escorted by three police cars. Two uniformed police officers and two plain clothes detectives working on the case accompanied Imiela into the glass-fronted dock. He was covered in a blanket as he walked into the court building. During the 10-minute hearing he spoke only to give his name and address. He answered 'Yes' when asked if he understood each count of rape put to him. The charges included the rape of a 10-year-old girl in Ashford, Kent, in November last year and the rape of a 14-year-old girl in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in October. No application for bail was made and afterwards Imiela was driven away to an undisclosed location shortly after 10am. Imiela was arrested while driving along the M20 motorway on Monday. Det Supt Mark Warwick, of Thames Valley Police, who has led the inquiry known as Operation Orb, was in court to hear the charges put to Imiela. 'This is a complex investigation which has involved five police forces,' he said.
