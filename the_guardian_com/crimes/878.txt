The latest Home Office blunder concerning the conviction details of 525 British criminals came to light yesterday only after MPs asked senior police officers to identify gaps in police cooperation across Europe.Written evidence from the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) disclosed that a new system of dealing with records of convictions of Britons for offences committed abroad had come into force last May. It was part of a system set up around Europe after a notorious Belgian case in which a man had been arrested for murdering six French girls and one Belgian girl. The Belgian police had been unaware that he had previous convictions for rape and indecent assault in France. It was thought that he had killed 40 victims.The new system, which was signed off by the home secretary, meant that the responsibility for dealing with the details of Britons convicted abroad was transferred from the Home Office to a new UK central authority for the exchange of criminal records which is part of the Acpo criminal records operation.This ensures that criminal record bureau checks are carried out against the police national computer, which is updated with the foreign convictions of British nationals. Since the European system started there have been 331 British requests for criminal record checks with 21 EU countries, with one third disclosing criminal backgrounds. These often take as little as two days.Acpo said yesterday that previously the checks through the mutual legal assistance protocol and Interpol would take months.
