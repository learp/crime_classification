The startling fall in the murder rate in England and Wales to its lowest level for nearly 30 years has been driven by a remarkable and largely unexplored decline in domestic violence since the mid-1990s.The number of killings has fallen steadily for the past nine years, since the murder rate peaked at 1,047 in 2002-03 when the 172 victims of Dr Harold Shipman were included in the figures.As the official statisticians point out, more than two-thirds of murders involve a partner or an ex-partner, or stem from some other kind of family-related violence. The extent of domestic violence is still shocking, with more than 1 million women experiencing at least one incident every year. But this masks a 40% decline in domestic violence incidents since 1995, as revealed by former sweeps of the British Crime Survey, which provides the most likely explanation for the fall in the murder rate.Over that period not only have the police treated domestic violence, especially repeat attacks, far more seriously, but so have the prosecutors and the courts. In 2001 crown prosecutors didn't even monitor domestic violence cases, but the figures have risen from 35,000 defendants in 2003-04 to more than 74,000 in 2009-10, with an ever increasing conviction rate.Commentators have suggested that declines of up to 40% in domestic violence incidents reported in public surveys may be due to the provision of better housing and other services that provide women with a realistic alternative to their relationships, the improved economic and educational status of women, and demographic trends.It may also be down to better targeted police campaigns that have encouraged women to report and tackle such attacks rather than treating them simply as "domestics" to be "kept in the family".For the remarkable fall in the murder rate to be sustained, the serious treatment of violence against women and girls will have to be maintained.The official statisticians say the decline in the murder rate in England and Wales mirrors substantial falls in homicide rates since the mid-1990s, not just in Europe, but across Asia and North America where a general tide of violent crime appears to be ebbing.Despite the constant media images of "violent Britain" the fact remains that England and Wales is a "sleepy hollow" with a murder rate of about 11 per million people based on 2009 figures – slightly below the European average and far below the American homicide rate of 49 per million people.But before British politicians and police rush to take the credit it should be remembered that the fall in the murder rate comes against a background of the longest sustained fall in overall crime since the second world war.The official crime survey, which is the most authoritative measure, shows there was a rising trend between 1981 and 1995 when crime doubled. After 1995 there was a sustained fall of more than 40% until 2005 when the decline slowed. In the last three years crime has flattened out and remained stable, despite many predictions that the recession and cuts in police numbers would send it soaring again.Criminologists point to simple factors such as better home and car security – more than 84% of homes now have window locks and deadlocks on their doors – as a major driver of the fall in overall crime, leaving open questions of the link between recession and crime rates and whether there is a direct connection with police numbers.
