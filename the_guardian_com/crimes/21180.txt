A jealous father made a farewell video of his two young children before strangling them in a "spiteful reaction" to the breakdown of his marriage, a court heard today.Petros Williams, 37, urged his four-year-old daughter Yolanda Molemohi and two-year-old son Theo to say goodbye to their mother in the home-made film, which was played to a jury at Manchester crown court. He later strangled his children with an internet connection cable as an alleged "symbolic act of punishment" for his estranged wife, as she had started to meet men through internet dating sites.The video was among several notes found at his flat in Whalley Range, Manchester, after his wife Morongoe, 30, discovered their children's bodies in October last year. Williams denies two counts of murder.The video was labelled: "Daddy, Yolly, Theo. Byee The End", with a note attached which that read: "Play the video, made for your memories, thank you, Petros." It shows the children in the living room, with Williams asking them: "Where's mummy?" Williams was said to be jealous that his wife had started to meet other men, the court heard. Andrew Thomas QC, prosecuting, said: "It was a spiteful, selfish reaction to the breakdown of his marriage". The trial continues.
