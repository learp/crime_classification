Barry George, the man accused of murdering the BBC TV presenter Jill Dando, will not give evidence at his trial, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday.Opening evidence for the defence, his barrister called a forensic science expert to challenge the significance of a single grey-blue fibre retrieved from her raincoat.Dando was found shot dead on her doorstep in Fulham, south-west London, in April 1999. The prosecution says the fibre, allegedly from George's clothing, provides "weak support" for its case. George, facing a retrial, denies murdering Dando.The first witness for the defence, Dr Roger Robson, who runs his own forensic consultancy, said he did not believe any weight should be attached to the fibre. "The fibre could have come from sources other than Mr George's trousers - if the fibre was in fact a match," he said, adding that Dando's coat lay on the pavement for eight or nine hours and could have been contaminated. The fibre itself has been damaged in the course of its examination, making retesting impossible. The court heard that brain scans of George had surprised experts because they were so "abnormal". Prof Michael Kopelman, a neuropsychiatrist, described "repetitive bursts of abnormal brain discharges that last five to 10 seconds, then five to 10 seconds of normality".
