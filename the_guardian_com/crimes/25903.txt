The level of violent crime recorded by police increased by 11% in the second quarter of this year, according to government figures released today.The data also showed that although the number of crimes involving guns had risen, fewer people had died as a result of shootings.One measure of crime - the incidents reported to police - revealed a 14% rise in offences of violence against the person.However, the government instead highlighted the 5% fall in overall crime reported to police and the findings of the British Crime Survey (BCS), which interviewed 40,000 people about their experiences of crime.According to the BCS findings, overall crime had dropped by 7%, with violent crime falling by 6% and violence involving injury decreasing by 12%. In a statement, the Home Office said the risk of being a victim of crime was the lowest since the BCS began in 1981.Figures showed provisional reported firearms offences for the year to June had increased by 3% overall, with the number of incidents rising to 10,590. However, there was a 15% drop in gun killings and a 10% fall in the use of handguns.The Home Office said the rise in violent crime recorded by police was due to more people being willing to report their experiences, as well as more "low-level thuggery" being recorded as crime. Officials said around half of violent crimes did not involve injury to the victim.Previously, officials had put past increases down to there being record numbers of police officers available to register crimes."These are very encouraging figures," the Home Office minister Hazel Blears said. "We are witnessing the longest sustained fall in crime in living memory, with people less likely to be a victim of crime today than since the British Crime Survey started more than 20 years ago."Crimes such as burglary, robbery and vehicle crime are continuing to drop dramatically."
