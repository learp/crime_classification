Italian investigators say they are confident of wrapping up the investigation into the murder of the British exchange student Meredith Kercher by the summer now that DNA evidence links all three suspects to the scene of the crime.The latest forensic science tests carried out have allegedly identified DNA belonging to suspect Raffaele Sollecito, 23, on Kercher's bra fastener, found in the bedroom of the Perugia apartment where she was sexually assaulted and fatally stabbed in the neck on November 1."Additionally, around 70 more test results that could reveal biological evidence in the house are still due to come in," said Edgardo Giobbi, a detective with the Rome serious crime squad.Giobbi said tests were continuing on a print made by a bare foot which left traces of blood in the bedroom of American student Amanda Knox, 20, Kercher's flatmate and Sollecito's girlfriend at the time of the murder."It is too early to say who the footprint belongs to or whether it is male or female," said Giobbi.Knox, whose blood has already allegedly been found mixed with Kercher's blood in the apartment, is being held on suspicion of murder alongside Sollecito.A third suspect being held, Rudy Guede, 21, has allegedly been tied to the crime scene by a bloody handprint on a cushion and DNA traces on Kercher's ripped and discarded bra, as well as on a vaginal swab taken from Kercher.All three suspects deny wrongdoing.If the investigation concludes this summer, investigators believe a year of court formalities and preliminary hearings could follow before the suspects finally face a jury as late as mid-2009.
