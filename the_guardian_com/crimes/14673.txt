Three decades after carrying out one of Britain's biggest diamond heists, two septuagenarian ex-convicts have been arrested on charges of conspiring to rob a suburban Chicago bank.Joseph "Jerry" Scalise, and Arthur Rachel, now aged 73 and 71 respectively, made headlines in 1980 when they robbed a central London jewellers in broad daylight armed with a hand grenade.Scalise, who served as a technical adviser on the 2008 film Public Enemies, in which Johnny Depp played the infamous Depression era bank robber John Dillinger, and Rachel were convicted of robbing Graff Jewellers in central London of £2.3m worth of goods, including the 45-carat Marlborough diamond.The pair were sentenced to 15-year prison terms four years after the 1980 robbery but were released in 1993.On Thursday night Scalise and Rachel were arrested along with another ageing gentleman, Robert Pullia, 69. Court papers filed by the FBI in the Chicago district court revealed surveillance evidence showing the three were planning to rob the First National Bank of LaGrange.The FBI began trailing the pensioners after suspecting they were connected to another bank robbery, in 2007. Although Scalise's DNA was found in the getaway vehicle used in the $100,000 (£65,000) heist, neither he, Rachel nor Pullia have been charged in connection with the case.In a bizarre twist, the men's latest arrest came outside the one-time home of the late Chicago mob boss Angelo "the Hook" LaPietra on Thursday night, where the court was told they were planning a break-in. The three men, two clad in black, were discovered drilling holes in the walls and removing windows, according to legal papers.Scalise was also overheard by the FBI saying he wanted toothpaste to disguise the holes, a technique he said was used by IRA prisoners he and Rachel befriended during their stint in an English jail.The three pensioners were refused bail when they appeared in court yesterday.Outside court, their lawyer said all three would plead not guilty.
