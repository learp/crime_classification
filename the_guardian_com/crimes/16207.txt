A total of 111 surviving horses, ponies and donkeys have been moved off premises believed to be a horse-trading business where 32 animals were found dead.Rescuers from the RSPCA and police had discovered "dead horses everywhere" as well as emaciated survivors, many covered in excrement, mud, scrapes and cuts at Spindles farm, at Hyde Heath, near Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Three more had to be shot because of their condition.Fourteen survivors thought to be in the worst state were moved to the Horse Trust's sanctuary at Speen in Buckinghamshire.James Gray, 44, has been charged with causing criminal damage and assaulting a police officer. He was arrested last Friday when the investigation started after a tip-off.The International League for the Protection of Horses, which was caring for 11 of the animals last night, said the animals were hungry and scared. A spokeswoman added: "They are all putting their heads down and won't stop feeding."All the animals are officially in police custody but under the overall care of the RSPCA. Welfare organisations can only provide new homes for animals, subject to investigations, if owners hand them over or a court transfers ownership.The operation to find secure places for the remaining animals to be treated by vets and given food, water and recuperation was completed late on Wednesday.
