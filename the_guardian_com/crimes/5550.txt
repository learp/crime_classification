An airline captain found to be nearly seven times over the legal alcohol limit for a pilot as he prepared to fly a plane from Heathrow airport to Dubai was jailed today for four months.John Cronly-Dillon, who has since lost his job with the Emirates airline, was tested after ground staff saw him stumble twice as he passed through a security check and joked about not wanting to "blow up my own plane".The 51-year-old Australian national pleaded guilty at London's Isleworth crown court to "performing an activity ancillary to an aviation function" while being over the drink-fly maximum on September 13.Judge Usha Karu told the pilot she had no option but to jail him, despite a previously spotless 25-year record as a pilot."The early evening routine search at Terminal 3 of him and his crew should have been completely routine," the judge said. "Unfortunately, it was anything but."A security officer noticed that Cronly-Dillon's face was red and he smelled of alcohol, the judge said. The pilot then stumbled as he took his shoes off for a security gate, and did so again as he passed through it, hitting the side and activating the alarm."A short while later when your luggage was searched and some items were rejected ... and you made the irrational comment 'I would not blow up my own plane' and the suspicions of the security staff were confirmed and your supervisor was called," the judge said.A test showed Cronly-Dillon had 134 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, while the legal limit for a captain is 20mcg. The legal limit for driving is 80mcg per 100ml.The captain had insisted he was not aware how much alcohol was in his system but this was contradicted by the fact he consumed a whole packet of chewing gum and drank a lot of water while waiting to see his supervisor, the judge said.She accepted that he had followed the rule of not drinking 12 hours before a flight, and was under "extreme stress" and suffering from fatigue at the time.But she added: "The fact is had you not been stopped ... and discovered, you would have put the lives of a number of passengers at risk."
