Detectives hunting for missing nursery care assistant Amanda Edwards today said that they had found a body at a building site.Officers, who believe the body is Amanda's, have also announced that a man in his 40s, who was arrested on Monday on suspicion of her kidnap, has been found dead in woodland in Calne, Wiltshire. He was last night released without charge after being questioned for several days. Wiltshire police said that they were not treating the man's death as suspicious.Speaking at a press conference outside the building site, Detective Chief Superintendent Paul Howlett said that Amanda's family had been informed of the discovery and were "understandably devastated". The 21-year-old had been missing for nearly eight days after dropping her boyfriend off in Calne. Today's discovery came after police officers, including specialist search officers, said that they were examining a "very specific" patch of ground behind a hotel which is under development in the nearby town of Malmesbury. Police yesterday took Amanda's distinctive racing green Rover Metro to the west Swindon car park where it was found abandoned last Thursday evening in the hope that it might prompt shoppers' memories. Officers also used specialist sniffer spaniels and tracking bloodhounds from dog teams in Yorkshire and Wales. They said there had been no movements on her bank account and no traffic on her mobile phone in the days after her disappearance.
