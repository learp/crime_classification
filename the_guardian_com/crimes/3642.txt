The government is to extend its anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) scheme to include fly-tipping, vandalism and noise pollution. The Environmental Agency said the new regime would allow it to target offenders more quickly and efficiently, with a vital backup to prosecution."These new powers are crucial in the battle to crack down and catch individuals who have no regard for our health and environment," said the agency's chief executive Barbara Young. "The Asbo can set out strict conditions perpetrators must abide by to ensure that communities are protected." Ministers also announced that Asbos given to young people will be reviewed after a year to allow changes in behaviour to be taken into account. Guidelines will also be updated to ensure Asbos are used more effectively.Government figures showed 918 orders were issued between April and June this year - 14% of the total since they were introduced in 1999 and an increase of 48% on the same quarter last year, but a rise of 1% on the previous quarter this year.Of the Asbos issued, 54% were to adults and 43% to juveniles (3% were unknown).Announcing the measures, the Home Office minister Hazel Blears said: "Asbos are now well established as a key tool in the battle against the persistent yobbish behaviour, intimidation and vandalism."
