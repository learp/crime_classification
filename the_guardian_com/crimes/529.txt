Details of 1.4m criminal trials in England and Wales from the late 18th to the 19th centuries, including a Jack the Ripper suspect and a would-be assassin of Queen Victoria, are to be launched online. History website Ancestry.co.uk said the collection was a "world first" and painted a detailed picture of the period's legal system. During this time, almost one in 10 were either transported overseas or sentenced to death. Crimes carrying the death penalty included stealing anything worth more than five shillings (equivalent to £30 today), theft of livestock, and poaching from a rabbit warren.By the 1860s, executions had become a public spectacle, with people coming from far and wide to see hangings – the wealthy would even hire the balconies of houses and pubs to get a better view.Notorious criminals in the collection include Dr Thomas Neill Cream, a Jack the Ripper suspect who was sentenced to death in 1892 for poisoning several people; George Lyon, an inept highwayman whose pistol once failed while he attempted to rob a coach in the rain because he allowed his gun powder to get wet; Isaac "Ikey" Solomon, widely considered to be the inspiration for Charles Dickens's Fagan, and Roderick McLean, who attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle with a pistol.Ancestry.co.uk managing director, Olivier Van Calster, said: "These registers testify to the fact that crime and punishment was and always will be a controversial subject. They also highlight the often colourful nature of crime, and in particular how creative criminals could be, even in less sophisticated times."This collection will be of great use to social historians as they contain a variety of in-depth information about crime and criminals in England and Wales during a period of great poverty, change, and ultimately, reform."
