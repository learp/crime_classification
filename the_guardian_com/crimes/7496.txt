The right to jury trial is to be scrapped for more than a dozen of the most complex fraud trials every year, which will be heard by a judge sitting alone.The controversial move was signalled by the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, last April, but the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, announced yesterday that the government would be pressing ahead with a parliamentary vote on it in the autumn.The measure is already enshrined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 but, as a result of a last-minute deal to save the rest of the act, requires a vote of both houses of parliament to bring it into force. Yesterday opposition parties reacted angrily to Lord Goldsmith's announcement, warning that it would whittle away the tradition of the jury system.The reform, expected to affect between 15 and 20 cases a year, will also face fierce opposition from civil liberties groups, lawyers and peers. The Bar Council, representing barristers, said it was "justice lite for white-collar crooks".The problems of jury trial in long-running fraud cases were highlighted by the collapse last April of the Jubilee line corruption trial after 21 months and the waste of Â£60m. Jurors claimed the long-running case played havoc with their lives and careers and threatened to mutiny. But pressure to remove juries from the most difficult cases dates back to the Roskill committee on fraud trials, which recommended trial by a judge with expert lay assessors in 1986.Opponents say better case management and a new fraud protocol should allow any fraud case, however complex, to be put before a jury. Supporters, who include many senior judges, say simplifying the case to the extent to make it manageable for a jury means the full picture of the criminal ity never emerges and guilty defendants may be acquitted or found guilty of a lesser crime.Lord Goldsmith said while some frauds, such as benefit frauds, were easy to prosecute, the most sophisticated were so complex that they could not be prosecuted before a jury. The result was a two-tier system in which some white-collar fraudsters escaped justice, while blue collar fraudsters were prosecuted.Lord Goldsmith said the government had "absolutely no plans" to further restrict the right to jury trial. But Dominic Grieve, the shadow attorney general, said: "Juries are an essential mechanism for ensuring that the criminal justice system is seen to be fair."Reflecting widespread anger at the government for reneging on its promise to consult fully before activating the measure, he added: "There has been no formal consultation. The government seeks to rely only on one informal half-day seminar which was certainly not billed as a formal consultation of any kind." Mike O'Brien, the solicitor general, told parliament that there had been "a full and robust discussion" at the January seminar.Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, warned: "Labour seems obsessed with breaking away the traditions of the jury system and is in danger of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut."One compromise acceptable to many opponents of the measure would be to introduce specialist juries for fraud trials. Guy Mansfield, the Bar chairman, said "justice lite" was "unacceptable for people who bankrupt corporations, raid pension funds and destroy jobs for personal gain."Edward Nally, president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: "The suggestion that juries are incapable of ensuring justice in fraud trials is a patronising and dangerous assumption."
