One of the killers of Damilola Taylor will be released early from prison, despite showing no remorse at his trial and probation reports stating he posed "a high risk" of attacking more people.Under sentencing rules, Rickie Preddie's release was automatic â€“ meaning that he need not show any signs of rehabilitation for the attack on 10-year-old Damilola on a south London housing estate in November 2000.Damilola was stabbed with a broken bottle after being set upon by Preddie and his brother, Danny, who was also jailed and who may be released next year. The nature of the crime and the tender age of the victim made the killing of Damilola Taylor a headline-grabbing crime, sparking debate about gangs and youth violence.Today, the victim's father, Richard Taylor, condemned the imminent release of his son's killer, and said it was especially hurtful as it would fall weeks before the tenth anniversary of the crime.Taylor said he feared Preddie, 23, would reoffend: "When he was sentenced, there was no recognition of guilt and my worst fear is he is going to come out as the same Rickie Preddie, with the same arrogant behaviour he showed in court, slip back into crime, and end up in prison again."Preddie's release was automatic because of the sentencing regime applied to his case. It has subsequently been changed.He served two-thirds of an eight-year sentence given in 2006 for manslaughter, with the time he had spent in remand being taken off his sentence.Preddie was aged 13 at the time of the killing and was judged not to be suitable for parole halfway through his sentence.The brothers were convicted at the Old Bailey in 2006, six years after Damilola's death, following three trials and two police investigations.They were leading members of the street gang, which targeted young children on their way home from school and threatened them with violence before stealing their mobile phones and other possessions. Damilola was stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle and left to bleed to death from a severed artery.The Preddie brothers were tied to the killing by spots of Damilola's blood found on their clothing and possessions. Damilola, who was born in Nigeria, had been in Britain only a few months when he was attacked by the brothers after walking home from the library after school.On being convicted, Rickie Preddie shouted at the court: "You're corrupt ... you must be mad ... you know nothing."Previous offending meant the Preddie brothers were supposedly under supervision at the time of the killing, a fact that heightens Richard Taylor's anxiety about the impending release.He told the London Evening Standard: "Such a short time in prison is not enough after such a heinous crime."It is just going to add to all the pain that I have suffered."Mr Taylor, who set up the Damilola Taylor Trust to combat youth violence by promoting positive role models, added: "What I want now is to ensure that other young lives are not lost and that changes are made to offer positive opportunities to young people that will leave a proper legacy for my son."Sentencing the pair at the Old Bailey four years ago, Mr Justice Goldring explained that a life term was not appropriate as the brothers had not intended to kill.But he said they carried out a gang attack on a young and vulnerable victim.The Ministry of Justice said it would not comment on individual cases, but Preddie will be released on licence and subject to supervision.In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: "If an offender commits a violent offence prior to 4 April 2005 and receives a determinate sentence of four years or more from the courts, they become eligible for release by the parole board at the half way point of their sentence, or they are automatically released at the two thirds point. Once released they will be subject to strict supervision in the community."
