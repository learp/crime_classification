A sword-wielding killer, who claimed he had been chasing an intruder he believed had raped his wife when he attacked two other men in the street, was jailed for life yesterday.Thomas Roe had told Lincoln crown court that he stabbed his victims with a samurai sword he kept next to his door after months of threats and violence had ended in a break-in at his home.The 42-year-old father of four was convinced his wife had been attacked, saying he "lost the plot" when he killed Carl Taylor, 24, and injured Dale Veitch, 28.Roe, a scaffolder, claimed his life had turned into a "nightmare" after moving from south London to the St Giles estate in Lincoln. His wife had been beaten up and there were threats to burn down his home after the family reported a local gang to police.His family had asked to be moved and were given another property 100 yards away on the same estate. Roe said: "It caused a lot of bad feeling because there were other people on the estate who thought they should have got the house."Lyn Taylor, prosecuting, had said Roe was engaged in sex with his wife when a man, Martin Dent, had entered the house.Roe told the court: "He was just standing in the doorway of my front room. I was in shock. I said: 'What are you doing? Get out of my house'."Wrongly believing Dent had tried to rape his wife, Roe picked up the sword from near the door and pursued Dent. "I was in a really bad temper. I didn't want him to come back - they always come back. I was waving my sword up the road towards him. The next thing I was smashed from behind. My first thought was it had to be his mates." Roe was convicted of murder and wounding after nine hours of deliberation. Judge Michael Heath said Roe must spend at least 18 years in prison before being considered for parole.
