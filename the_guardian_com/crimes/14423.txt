Child abuse material is being stored, shared and sold by criminals hacking innocent sites on the open web, who are then using the cryptocurrency bitcoin to sell the material.Research by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has discovered the emergent use of the bitcoin digital currency as a payment mechanism, with criminals hiding images and video on hacked websites that are unknowingly hosting the illegal content.“This is the first time we’ve seen bitcoin be purported to be accepted as the only payment for child sexual abuse on the open web and not hidden in the dark web,” said Sarah Smith, technical researcher at the Waterbeach-based IWF and author of the report.The report, published Monday, details how the IWF found a hacked website hosting a page within an orphan folder – one not linked to from the main, legitimate website on the server – that automatically redirected to another hacked website, this time one hosting a commercial child sexual abuse website inside another orphan folder.A significant proportion of the compromised websites hosting child abuse material seem to be UK businesses, but not necessarily hosted in the UK.The web links leading to the seller of the illicit images were being distributed, hidden within spam emails.‘Started to see a resurgence’The technique of hiding content on hacked servers was originally popular in 2010, but the popularity of free cloud storage sites saw the trend die out.“Around about June 2013 we started to see a resurgence in this technique of using folders on hacked websites to distribute child abuse sexual content or websites,” explained Smith.Free, off-the-shelf hacking tools for vulnerable websites, as well as hackers for hire, have made it straightforward for criminals to hijack legitimate personal or small business sites. There has been a sharp rise is hijacking sites in this way, which circumvents the internet filters championed by David Cameron, according to Smith.“Over the past couple of weeks, since spotting the first site, we have received reports of many other sites using similar techniques and the same template of commercial child sexual abuse site accepting bitcoin,” said Smith.Most of the hacked sites will have no knowledge of the intrusion and will be totally unaware that the illicit material is being stored and served from their servers. Basic security of websites and servers is of paramount importance to prevent abuse, which could lead to consequences for the unwitting owners of the compromised websites.• Missing: hard drive containing Bitcoins worth £4m in Newport landfill site
