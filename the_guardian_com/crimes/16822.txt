An 'antisocial behaviour academy' to train police, local authority and courts staff how to tackle yob culture, was launched today by the government.Home Office minister Hazel Blears said the academy and a new telephone advice line would equip frontline staff with the knowledge and skills to deal more effectively with antisocial behaviour.The Together Academy and Actionline will explain how staff can use new powers brought in under the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 to tackle problems such as nuisance neighbours, crack houses, teenage gangs and firearm offences.Ms Blears said: "We are determined to transform the approach of frontline workers so that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated."The combination of the Together Actionline, academy and new powers will renew the determination of people on the frontline to respond more effectively to those who need their help."The first academy is being held in Birmingham today, and a further nine events will be held throughout England and Wales in March. The 10 areas are piloting schemes to tackle particular kinds of antisocial behaviour.Lin Homer, the chief executive of Birmingham city council, which is tackling nuisance neighbours, said: "The academy will allow us to share our good practice and learn from other experts, so that we can continue to make a difference."The first batch of powers from the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 came into force in January. The legislation allows:· county councils and housing action trusts to apply for antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos) to help tackle nuisance neighbours· the dispersal of groups, if they are causing harassment or intimidation· the restriction of ownership or possession of air guns and replica weapons· the bannig of the sale and manufacture of high-powered air weapons· newspapers to name and shame teenagers given Asbos· and extends fixed penalty notices for disorder to 16 and 17-year-olds.
