Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who murdered 13 women and attempted to kill seven others, today launched a legal challenge to overturn a ruling saying he must be detained for the rest of his life.The court of appeal heard that Sutcliffe had a severe mental disorder at the time of the brutal killings, which diminished his responsibility and justified a minimum jail term of a finite number of years.But the former lorry driver from Bradford, West Yorkshire, who claimed he had a "mission from God" to kill prostitutes, must wait to learn if his bid is successful after three senior judges reserved judgment over the appeal.Sutcliffe, 64, who is in Broadmoor psychiatric hospital, is seeking leave to appeal against a ruling, imposed by the high court in July, saying he can never be released and must serve a "whole-life tariff".Edward Fitzgerald QC, acting for Sutcliffe, said he had been consistently diagnosed as suffering from "encapsulated paranoid schizophrenia" and had been mentally ill at the time of the attacks. Though the "number and nature" of the murders would call for a whole-life tariff, there was "sufficient mitigating circumstance" to justify instead a finite number of years, he told the court.Sutcliffe, who has changed his surname to Coonan, terrorised the people of Yorkshire and Greater Manchester during a six-year murderous campaign, which began in 1975 and ended with his arrest after a routine vehicle number-plate check.Earning his soubriquet through the way he mutilated his victims with a hammer, screwdriver and knife, he received 20 life terms on conviction in 1981 at the Old Bailey.At his 1981 trial Sutcliffe claimed he heard a voice while working as a grave digger in 1967, and later that divine intervention led him to kill prostitutes, although not all of his victims were prostitutes. The jury rejected his case that his culpability was diminished by reason of mental abnormality.No tariff was set at the time, but in July this year Sutcliffe made an application to have a minimum term set on his detention. Mr Justice Mitting ruled then that he had to serve a "whole-life tariff", saying it was not "open to a judge" to reverse that jury's verdict.Today the lord chief justice Lord Judge, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, and Mr Justice Griffin Williams were urged to "go behind the jury's verdict" if there was a "reasonable possibility" that Sutcliffe was suffering a severe mental disorder and it "did diminish his responsibility".Fitzgerald said that there had been "a massive amount of development in the last 29 years, all of which, in our submission, confirm that [Sutcliffe] was suffering from mental disorder".Sutcliffe had been transferred to Broadmoor in 1984 on the basis of his schizophrenia; certificates indicated he had been suffering from it since 1967 and he had been compulsorily medicated because of it, added the QC. He had carried out the killings while in a "psychotic fury". But he had not disclosed his hearing of voices to police at the time of arrest because, due to his condition, it was his "private raison d'etre".Answering suggestions that Sutcliffe was faking his symptoms, the barrister said: "Look at the longevity. After 30 years we say he couldn't be faking it all along. He has been treated on the basis that he was not faking schizophrenia."Peter Wright QC, opposing the appeal for the Crown, said there was "no mitigation capable of displacing the starting point of whole life" for the "terrible catalogue of crimes".
