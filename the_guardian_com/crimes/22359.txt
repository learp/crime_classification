The backdrop to the shootings in west Cumbria is a lovely landscape with a hard edge, which has long made it the plain sister of the neighbouring Lake District.The gunman's murderous drive linked towns that stand within sight of magnificent fells such as Scafell Pike, Pillar and Steeple, but have earned their living from sometimes dangerous industries such as coal mining, chemicals and nuclear power.Wellington pit in Whitehaven, with its "candlestick" chimney designed by Sydney Smirke to harmonise with the most perfect Georgian streetplan in Britain – better even than Bath – saw 136 men and boys die in an explosion in 1910.As recently as 1947, another 104 were killed in the William pit, whose sealed-off tunnels still reach beneath the Irish Sea from their filled-in shaft near Whitehaven railway station.The picturesque hamlet of Boot, where the body of the suspect Derrick Bird was found beside his gun, has a similar history of mining and quarrying, with hundreds of accidents and local pubs notorious for brawls. Now a tranquil base camp for Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain, it was filthy with slag and iron ore from quarries and Nab Gill mine less than a century ago.The "Little Ratty" steam railway to the village from Ravenglass's small port, crammed with trippers in the current sunshine, was built to haul out the iron ore and stone. A 17th-century packhorse bridge over the Whillan beck, one of Boot's best backdrops for souvenir photos, served the same purpose for cartloads of slate from the western fells.West Cumbrians speak with the county's distinctive twang but have always been an ethnic mix, right back to Roman days, when legionaries from north Africa were stationed at the Solway end of Hadrian's Wall.In turn, Scots, Irish and Tynesiders migrated to work in successive industries including three – Seckers silks, Marchon detergents and Kangol berets and seatbelts – which were founded in the 1930s by central European Jewish refugees from the Nazis.Sellafield nuclear complex, close to Seascale, where at least two of today's killings took place, maintains the tradition of major industries, with other factories stretching north beyond Workington and south, via a grim-looking prison in Millom, to the huge shipyards of Barrow-in-Furness.Historically, the rough-tough nature of life in the area has seen its share of murder and violent crime, although nothing on the scale of today's tragedy in modern times.Less than a mile from the police cordons at Boot, however, stand the graves in St Catherine's churchyard of five victims of a mass killing in 1992 – Gail and Ian Spiro and their three teenage children, whose deaths in California were linked to arms-dealing and espionage.Brought up in Eskdale, Gail was shot with the children at a luxury ranch near San Diego, shortly before her husband's body was found in their camper van on a desert backroad at Coachwhip Canyon, killed by a cyanide injection. The case remains unsolved.• This article was amended on 3 June 2010. The original referred to Marshon detergents. This has been corrected.
