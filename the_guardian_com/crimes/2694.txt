Eight suspected members of a sex abuse gang have been arrested in a series of police raids.Thames Valley police said a girl claimed she was abused between 2007 and 2012, and they believe there might be other victims of the same group.Officers made a number of arrests in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, targeting people suspected of child sexual exploitation.Detective Chief Inspector Vince Grey said: "In terms of child exploitation, the general premise is there will be a number of victims."With this particular victim, she's mainly discussed actions involving herself, not going into any great details in terms of other persons, but we believe in terms of what she told us that there will be other victims."The force is appealing for other potential victims to come forward.Grey praised the girl, who is under 18,. He said: "She's been extremely brave and courageous in coming forward in the first place; obviously we can't imagine what she and other victims have gone through. She's come forward and she's indicated what offending has happened to her, who's been involved in that, and over what time period."The force believes that victims may have been groomed – when abusers make friends with potential victims – by members of the gang.Grey said: "You enter the grooming stage first, obviously grooming is a specific offence. One stream can develop into where we are now, when that process has taken place and that turns into an abusive relationship of some sort, which can lead to much more damaging exploitation and sexual offences taking place."The suspects were identified from the account the girl gave police along with additional investigation, Grey said.The force said officers arrested eight men aged between 20 and 28.They were all held on suspicion of committing sexual offences against a girl.Grey said: "We will not tolerate child exploitation in Thames Valley and today's warrants are part of a lengthy investigation spanning many months."We believe that it is likely that there are more victims who have not yet spoken to the police and would like to encourage anyone who is a victim to come forward and speak to us on 01296 396396."We have support networks in place and will deal with each case with respect and confidentiality."Our number one priority is to protect the victims, both their identities and wellbeing in such cases."
