A driver who was talking on his mobile phone when he caused a car smash which killed a motorcyclist was jailed for five years yesterday.Kevin Moran, 46, was chatting to his wife on the handheld phone when he made an illegal right turn into the path of the motorcyclist, Gary Smith, on November 15 last year. Mr Smith, 40, a father of two from Atherton, Lancashire, died from his injuries three hours later. Liverpool crown court heard that Moran, a father of six from Rochdale, had failed to see 15 warning signs. He was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving last month, before the new law banning the use of hand-held phones while driving came in.
