The home secretary, Theresa May, is bringing in new immigration rules to end the "abuse" of the right to family life – as enshrined in the European convention on human rights – which allows foreign nationals to stay in the UK despite having committed crimes or breached rules.May made the decision following a Home Office consultation into article 8 of the convention, concerning the right to respect for private and family life. The government wants to end cases such as that of Joseph Lissa, from Huddersfield, who was branded a war criminal by a judge for activities in his homeland of Sierra Leone, but was allowed to stay in the UK on the grounds he had married a British woman and fathered a child here. Another case was that of Gary Ellis, a violent drug dealer from north London, who twice used article 8 to avoid being sent home to Jamaica.May claims to have attracted support from both sides of the political divide and the public in introducing the new measures. Immigration rules will change at the end of July so that article 8 can only prevent deportation in "rare and exceptional" cases.The new restrictions will take effect within a month of being published. May told the Sunday Telegraph: "By the summer, I will have changed the immigration rules so that we can end the abuse of the right to a family life."Foreign nationals who have been convicted of criminal offences, violated immigration rules or are unable to maintain themselves and their families without being a burden on the state will no longer be able to use the right to a family life when they go before the courts.The move is likely to be challenged in the courts, but ministers are determined to bolster the rules if they do not prove effective. However, they are unlikely to rewrite legislation as the consequences would stretch beyond the UK's borders and only a government acting on a specific mandate after a general election would have the authority to do so.May said: "I have every confidence it [the rule changes] will work. If it doesn't, if it is tested in the courts and we find there's a problem, we'll obviously look at other measures."Supporters of tougher measures have argued that British judges are not giving due weight to provisions built into article 8 including "the prevention of disorder or crime". May had previously expressed a wish to scrap the Human Rights Act altogether.She said in October: "I see it, here in the Home Office, particularly the problems we have in being unable to deport people who perhaps are terrorist suspects. Obviously we've seen it with some foreign criminals who are in the UK."
