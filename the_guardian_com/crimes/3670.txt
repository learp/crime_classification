Fifteen specialist courts to tackle cases of domestic violence are to be set up by next April, ministers announced yesterday, bringing the total number to 64 across England and Wales. The courts use specially trained prosecutors, magistrates, legal advisers and police officers and provide independent advice for victims.The constitutional affairs minister, Harriet Harman, said since their introduction guilty pleas and convictions had gone up. "This sends a clear signal to victims that if they report violence there is a greater chance that their abuser will be punished and they will be protected," she said.Successful prosecutions for domestic violence have risen from 46% of all cases in 2003 to 59% last year in all courts, with the specialist domestic violence courts recording a 71% success rate.Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, which helps victims of domestic violence, welcomed the move and said: "Many women who have experienced domestic violence feel unable to go through the court process."
