Gordon Brown's new government pressed ahead with its attempts to mark a break from the Blair era today when one of the prime minister's closest colleagues signalled an end to the "Asbo era".In what appeared to be the latest in a string of policy U-turns performed by the new administration, Ed Balls, the children's secretary, described antisocial behaviour orders as sign of "failure"."It's necessary, but it's not right," he told the Daily Mirror. "I want to live in the kind of society that puts Asbos behind us."A spokesman for the Department for Children, Skills and Families insisted that Mr Balls's claims did not amount to a change in government policy, but his words were clearly intended to indicate a change of approach.His comments, at the end of Mr Brown's first month in office, mark the latest in a series of calculated policy shifts that have included pledges to rethink terror legislation, border police, supercasinos, drinking laws, and the reclassification of cannabis.The new prime minister has enjoyed a "Brown bounce" that has left the Tories on the back foot as Labour's poll ratings soar.A YouGov survey for the Daily Telegraph today put Labour on a nine-point lead - the party's best rating since the outbreak of the Iraq war in 2003.This comes on the back of a Guardian/ICM poll on Tuesday that gave Labour a six-point lead and showed the Conservative party at its lowest ebb since the last days of Michael Howard's leadership in 2005.Speculation that Mr Brown might try to capitalise on his honeymoon period by calling a snap general election intensified yesterday when the PM held a "political" cabinet meeting at Chequers, at which ministers discussed election planning, as well as preparations for writing the next manifesto.In his first major interview since taking charge of all government policy affecting the young, Mr Balls condemned Asbos - describing one of the Blair government's most high-profile policies as a "failure".Mr Balls stopped short of suggesting that the orders would be phased out, but claimed: "It's a failure every time a young person gets an Asbo."He told the paper: "I want to live in the kind of society that puts Asbos behind us. It is about parents taking their responsibilities seriously."Asbos are civil orders made against someone who has been shown to cause "alarm, harassment or distress to one or more persons not of the same household".Introduced in 1998, they were controversial from their inception for criminalising behaviour that was undesirable but otherwise lawful.Tony Blair, however, was convinced of their efficacy and in 2004 announced measures to improve the application of Asbos. The latest figures issued by the Home Office show that just under 10,000 Asbos have been handed out since 1999.The appointment of Mr Balls, a father of three, into the newly created role of secretary of state for children, signalled Mr Brown's decision to make children's policies more prominent.Mr Balls has only been an MP since 2005 and has held no ministerial position before, but he is very close to Mr Brown, and started working as his economic adviser when Labour was in opposition and Mr Balls was still in his late 20s.Today Mr Balls described his long-term interest in children's policy, telling the Mirror that he had spent a year reading regularly to children at his local London primary school.Mr Balls praised JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter novels, for prompting millions of children to pick up a book."It is about kids having interesting things to do and it is about young people having respect for the society in which they live," he said.Yesterday he announced plans for a "coming of age" ceremony to mark the transition to adulthood and a national youth week.In October the government will unveil its "children's plan", for the first time bringing together the health, behaviour and education of all children under the age of 19.Today's comments about Asbos come one day after the government launched its 10-year strategy, Aiming High for Young People.It says it will "empower" young people by giving them the chance to influence how councils spend millions of pounds on youth centres and recreational activities.Michael Gove, the shadow children's minister, said: "This is an acknowledgement that Labour felt they'd got Asbos wrong. It may have been a gaffe. David Cameron has been outflanking Labour on its more compassionate approach to youth justice compared to Brown's policies of condemnation and incarceration."I don't like the caricatures of 'hug a hoodie', but the idea behind 'hug a hoodie' is the same as Breakdown Britain [Iain Duncan Smith's recent report on social justice]: Blair and Brown haven't done enough to tackle social problems. "The 'respect agenda' shifted to Balls' department at the time of the reshuffle. It was in the Cabinet Office and now it is both in the administration of youth justice, which is in the Home Office, and in Balls' department. Whitehall watchers could say that the reshuffle did not clarify this issue."He added that there was "a deeper question" about the government. "They are trying to characterise themselves as Daily Mail and socially conservative. But then there is another wing led by Ed Miliband whch says the Daily Mail agenda is wrong."We just don't know what Brown's view on crime and home affairs is given he was chancellor and it was always Blair's area."David Davis, the shadow home secretary, added: "Ten years on the minister has realised that addressing the scourge of antisocial behaviour requires more than just handing out Asbos. Over a decade ago Gordon Brown coined the phrase 'to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. This is an admission of his government's failure to do either."A spokesman for Mr Davis said that the Tories felt that Asbos were "a useful tool" in the fight against crime but "we don't think they are effective"."Two thirds of them get breached and only two thirds of these get punished with cutstody. The latest figures show that 2% of offenders were given custody for breach of an Asbo alone."
