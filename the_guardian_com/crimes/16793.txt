The only formal suspect in the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann, British expatriate Robert Murat, was questioned once more yesterday by Portuguese police.Detectives at the police headquarters in Portimao, in the southern Algarve region, a few miles from the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine vanished on May 3, did not say why they wanted to talk to Mr Murat, 33, who was named as a formal suspect in the case 11 days after Madeleine disappeared from her family's holiday apartment. He was released last night, but remains a suspect.Police searched the villa where Mr Murat and his mother, Jenny, live when he was first picked up for questioning on May 14. Forensic scientists took away items for fingerprint and DNA testing. Mr Murat had raised suspicions after volunteering to help investigating police with translation work. Chief Inspector Olegario de Sousa said this week that several people would be brought back for further questioning over the next few days.Police can maintain Mr Murat's status as a formal suspect for eight months before being obliged to charge him or exclude him from their inquiries. He is banned from speaking to the press, though his family continues to protest his innocence.Mr Murat lives 150 metres from the Ocean Club apartments where Madeleine's parents had left her sleeping with her two-year-old twin brother and sister, Sean and Amelie, while they dined at a nearby restaurant on May 3.
