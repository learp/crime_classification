The alleged killer of Martin Dinnegan chased the 14-year-old by bike along a London street before punching and stabbing him, a court heard today.The attack in Holloway, north London, happened after Dinnegan had exchanged "dirty looks" with a group of youths as he sat on a bus with friends in June last year, the Old Bailey was told. The witness, Tom Morgan, gave evidence from behind a screen and told the jury he saw Dinnegan running down the road."He was very white-faced, he was sprinting towards us and shouted 'help me, please help me,'" he said. "He ran past us on the road to my left then a guy with a black tracksuit went past on a large-framed BMX. "He dropped the bike when he got alongside the victim. Martin stood still and put his hands up as if to placate the cyclist. Martin appeared scared, very scared. "The effect on the cyclist was almost nothing whatsoever and the next thing was that a large haymaker came from his right fist. It was a right hook and the blow connected with Martin's head or neck."Then I saw what seemed to be a stabbing motion rather than a punching motion four or five times in very rapid succession."Dinnegan, a pupil at St Aloysius College in Archway, died of his wounds in the street in Holloway, north London, on June 26 last year. The "dirty look" led to a series of increasingly violent exchanges between the two groups, culminating in the attack on Martin in Axminster Road, Holloway, the court heard earlier. Rene John-Baptiste, 21 of Kharthoum Road, Plaistow, east London and Sean Clark, 19 of Axminster Road, Holloway, a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old all deny murder. It is claimed the 16-year-old stabbed Martin. The trial continues.
