You report (August 1) that indeterminate sentences for public protection are given to offenders convicted of one of 153 violent or sexual offences. But these offences range significantly in seriousness. For example, wounding with intent can range in severity from near murder to knocking someone's tooth out. To give an open-ended sentence automatically for the latter is a massive overreaction. Unfortunately, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 makes it compulsory for courts to pass this sentence on offenders convicted of one of the specified offences unless they consider this "unreasonable". We are encouraged by the Ministry of Justice's undertaking to review the use of the sentence, but what is required is an urgent amendment to the law that would allow courts to consider each case on an individual basis. Chris StanleyNacro, the crime reduction charityYour article (Youth crime board is failing to meet targets, August 2) comes as no surprise. For a decade we have observed a disastrous sequence of policies that have created a youth justice system obese in its appetite to criminalise and punish children. Its failure to reduce the number of first-time entrants to the youth justice system and scale down the population of child prisoners is inevitable. Surely the desperate and counterproductive rhetoric of "toughness" has run its course? There is a pressing need for a fundamental and wide-ranging review of youth justice policy. Professor Barry GoldsonUniversity of LiverpoolWhile welcoming the move to set up a youth centre in every town (Report, July 27), the youth service in the 60s and 70s demonstrated that they attract (relatively) well-behaved young people. What is needed is project-based and outreach work to reach disaffected young people - the so-called "unclubbables". Don MacdonaldLondon
