A man charged over an alleged blackmail plot involving a member of the royal family was refused bail today.Lawyers representing Ian Strachan, 30, applied for bail at the Old Bailey, but it was turned down by Mr Justice Gross. Strachan, who is in custody at Belmarsh prison, was not at the hearing. It had been due to take place in private, but was opened to the press following legal representation by media groups. Strachan, of Chelsea, west London, and 40-year-old Sean McGuigan, are jointly charged with blackmail. They are due to appear at the Old Bailey on December 20 when an indictment will be put to them. They are charged with blackmail contrary to section 21 of the Theft Act 1968, alleging they made demands with menaces.
