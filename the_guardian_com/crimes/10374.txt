Two girls have been charged with perverting the course of justice in connection with a stabbing at a Surrey school. The girls, aged 14 and 15, were charged last night in connection with an attack at a school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, on November 10. It is alleged that a 15-year-old girl was stabbed in the eyelid with a pair of scissors by a fellow pupil. The two girls were charged after answering bail at a police station. They are due to appear at Woking youth court on December 21, a spokeswoman said. Another 14-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged last month with causing grievous bodily harm with intent over the incident. She is due to appear at Guildford crown court in January.
