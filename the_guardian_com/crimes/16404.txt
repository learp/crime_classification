Human rights lawyers claimed last night that the government would have little chance of overturning on appeal the legal ruling that the killer of the headteacher Philip Lawrence should be allowed to remain in Britain.The detailed written judgment in the case of what should happen to the Italian-born Learco Chindamo, now aged 26, when he finishes his minimum 12-year life sentence next April makes clear that the decision was taken on the basis of "compelling" European Union law that applies to any EU citizen resident in another EU country for at least 10 years.The papers seen by the Guardian show that the Home Office argued he should be sent back to Italy, a country he left aged six, because he would pose a "genuine and present high level of risk" on his release as his "notoriety" may cause a backlash to which he might react. As a result he might have to be excluded from certain parts of the country, it said.But the tribunal rejected this line of argument and said that far from there being "imperative grounds of public security justifying his removal" - as required by EU law - all the evidence showed Chindamo presented a "low risk".The ruling details the Home Office's acceptance that he is unlikely to reoffend and the progress he has made while in prison: he has gained GCSEs in maths, English and art despite being unable to read or spell his address when he started his sentence. The deputy governor of Ford prison testified that Chindamo was a changed person who would prove himself worthy of trust.As for the links with Italy, the ruling states: "They can really be said to be no more than the fact that he lived there for a few years when he was very young. He does not speak Italian, and does not have contact with his father, an Italian national, who it seems is either in prison in Italy or Spain or on the run from Interpol. It does not appear that the appellant has any other family in Italy."At the time of the murder he lived with his brothers and Filipina mother in north London, while his father was serving a long prison sentence in Italy for throwing acid in a woman's face.The ruling also discloses details of the secrecy surrounding the hearing. A decision was made that the tribunal should sit in private when it heard the case in March this year after extraordinary evidence from the governor of Ford open prison that "hysterical misinformed articles in the gutter press" were undermining their attempts to protect the public in Chindamo's case.The tribunal was told that while on day release from prison in February 2006, Chindamo had been "pursued by members of the press".The judgment makes clear that any consideration of Chindamo's rights under the European convention on human rights, while a secondary issue, was not the crucial factor in the case. This contrasted sharply with David Cameron's repeated use of the case yesterday to demand the abolition of the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the convention into British law.Despite promises by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, and other ministers yesterday that they would "robustly" fight the ruling by three judges on the asylum and immigration tribunal in the appeal court, the lawyer for Chindamo said he believed it was an open and shut case."I do not see they have any grounds for appeal because it can only be on a point of law and there is no legal issue here I can see because it is a matter of facts," said Nigel Leskin.The grounds set out in the detailed written judgment would appear to bear out that view. For example, one argument the Home Office tried to make was that Chindamo had lived in Britain for only nine years before being jailed - not the 10 required under the 2004 EU directive on citizenship to qualify for its protection. But the tribunal ruling clearly decided that the EU directive made no distinction between time spent in or out of prison in an EU state.
