The father of murdered British hostess Lucie Blackman has accepted a payout from a friend of the Japanese man charged with killing his daughter. Tim Blackman was paid 100 million yen (Â£453,797) by a college friend of Joji Obara, who is currently on trial for allegedly abducting the 21-year-old, then raping and killing her.Mr Blackman said Obara still denied the charges, but was aware his friend, an industrialist with businesses in Japan and the UK, had made the offer of condolence, which is acceptable under Japanese law.Lucie's mother, from whom Mr Blackman is now divorced, and the couple's two other children have opposed the decision to accept the money.
