The son of a subpostmaster was shot dead by a gang of armed and masked men who were trying to rob his parents' store, a court heard today.Birmingham crown court heard how Craig Hodson-Walker, the subpostmaster's 29-year-old son, was shot dead at the post office and village store in the village of Fairfield, near Bromsgrove, at 8.20am on 9 January. His attackers were armed with a 9mm automatic handgun and a sledgehammer.Timothy Raggatt, QC, prosecuting, said: "This was a planned attack by men who were going armed when they went to attack the Fairfield store. They went with a loaded gun, everyone on the team knew it and they were prepared to use it."All that Craig Hodson-Walker had done in terms of what led to his death was attempt to defend his parents, who were both in the store at the time, from a group of men who had chosen to attack it."The four defendants ‑ Anselm Ribera, 34, Adrian Snape, 25, and brothers Christopher Morrissey, 32, and Declan Morrissey, 33 ‑ all deny murder and attempted murder.Craig Hodson-Walker's father Kenneth was shot in the leg but survived. This was "a matter of luck rather than judgment" as there had been "an attempt to shoot him in the same way as his son", Raggatt said.He said it was no random crime, but rather a planned act ruthlessly carried out with great determination. "But this was all in vain. It was pointless and it was a failure because they didn't get what they were after, but they took the life of a young man in a thoroughly needless but obviously and wholly deliberate fashion."He told the jury that £20,000 was locked in a safe on the premises but it was on a timelock and would not have opened until 9am.Raggatt said three of the men had gone into the post office with the obvious and plain intention of robbing it. "They were masked effectively, they were gloved and they were thoroughly covered up," he said. Outside in a car with its engine running and the doors open was the fourth man, Snape, who has pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted robbery.Ribera and the Morrissey brothers also deny attempted robbery, a charge that Snape admitted at an earlier hearing. The Morrissey brothers both deny a separate count of robbery relating to stealing the VW Golf getaway car on 31 December 2008.The trial continues.
