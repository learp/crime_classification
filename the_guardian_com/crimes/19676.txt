The government is planning to monitor and offer support to the children of offenders to ensure they do not follow their parents into a life of crime. Under the proposals, the children of criminals will be 'tracked' from birth to their teenage years in a bid to prevent them joining their parents in jail. Home Office minister Hazel Blears said around 65% of the 125,000 children with a father in prison would end up in there themselves. In an interview with the Independent, Ms Blears said she was optimistic that "tracking" and "targeting" these youngsters would prevent them breaking the law. "We can predict the risk factors that will lead a child into offending behaviour," she said. "About 125,000 kids have a dad in prison. That's a huge risk factor. We need to track the children who are most at risk.""I don't think it is stigmatising those children by targeting them," she added.Ms Blears has been in talks with the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, about an early intervention scheme to help the children of criminals, according to the report. She said: "Children who have been in local authority care are low-achievers and are more likely than others to end up offending, so let's track them from early on as well."Under the plans they would be provided with extra support to halt any disruptive behaviour. Teenagers would be monitored and provided with extra support at school and by social services, and encouraged to get involved in sport and drama.However, Ms Blears denied that by targeting these children they were being unfairly singled out. "You can intervene at an early age and say 'Your life can be different and we will help you and your parents make your life different'. Let's put the support in as early as we can." She said the government hoped to build on its Sure Start initiative, which offers support for young children in deprived areas.
