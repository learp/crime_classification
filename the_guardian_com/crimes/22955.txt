The latest report on Lincoln prison - 18 months after a riot - reveals conditions are "unsatisfactory" in many areas and that prisoners are treated as "objects to be managed rather than as people".The report, published yesterday by the chief inspector of prisons, points to a poor regime, epitomised by inmates being locked in their cells for periods well above the national average. The inspection team, which visited Lincoln in October, said control had been re-established since the disturbance in 2002, but the cost was poor relations between prisoners and staff. In the inspectorate's opinion "there was a need to move forward". The prison, a category B site holding both remand and convicted inmates, has 491 inmates, just below capacity. The report says Lincoln now provides a safe environment for prisoners and staff, but that staff remained "overly cautious". Only 15% of Lincoln inmates spent more than four hours a day out of their cells, compared with 45% in jails nationally. Resettlement provision for prisoners was being established at the jail, but at the time of the inspection it was "disjointed" and not systematically meeting the needs of prisoners. Phil Wheatley, the director general of the Prison Service, said: "I am pleased that the chief inspector recognises the efforts of staff at Lincoln to maintain a safe environment. However, I acknowledge concerns in other areas and the governor has already addressed several of the recommendations." Geoff Dobson, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "It is a matter of great concern that only 15% of prisoners spent four hours or more out of their cell. Such an impoverished regime can do little to aid rehabilitation and protect the public." Twenty-four prisoners and former inmates will stand trial this year on charges of mutiny relating to the disturbance at Lincoln. The riot lasted eight hours and damage estimated at Â£2m was caused.
