After the Damilola Taylor trial (Leader, April 26) you were able to report the total inadequacy of the police investigation and the prosecution's reliance on an alleged eye-witness who was both exposed as dubious and offered inducements. Four youngsters were then found not guilty of murder. And you think the criminal justice system has failed again?You are right to say the use of an inquisitorial system should be explored. But what were the "glaring injustices of an adversarial procedure" in the Damilola Taylor case? What was demolished was the evidence. The damage to the witness was sad, but consequential.Peter MartindaleGrantham, LincolnshireÂ· I was stunned to read that the Taylor family thought the British justice system needed to be looked at following this trial. It was quite clear to me, from following the case, and from the judge's comments, that there was only one possible outcome and without doubt justice was done, if not to Damilola Taylor. I am not so naive as to think that the system we have is perfect, but it is better than any other system I have seen or experienced abroad, and should not be reformed in response to a knee-jerk reaction to an emotive case.Simon FunnellLondon
