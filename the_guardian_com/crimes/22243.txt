The parents of Stephen Lawrence have praised the Daily Mail for "going out on a limb" and branding suspects in the death of their son as "murderers" 15 years ago.They led the tributes to the paper that campaigned for justice ever since. David Cameron said the Lawrences were helped enormously by the paper while Labour leader Ed Miliband said it played an "honourable role" in helping to bring the killers to heel.Neville Lawrence, the teenager's father, said that along with the intervention of Nelson Mandela, the Daily Mail's campaign was the crucial turning point in the case.  The Daily Mail's 1997 front page accusing five men of murdering Stephen LawrenceAnd Doreen Lawrence, Stephen's mother said the landmark front page of the Daily Mail on 14 February 1997 branding five suspects as "Murderers" made the case matter to the whole country.Her former husband said he was in Jamaica when the paper ran that highly risky story inviting the suspects to sue if they were not the killers.He told the Mail today: "I was very pleased, but I admit I was very frightened, too, because I realised the implications. If you name people as murderers you have to be pretty sure you have the proof or you'll be in trouble."He added: "The fact that the Mail – which is a very influential newspaper – went out on a limb for us showed how committed you were to the case. Not a lot of editors would have done that. Not a lot would have chanced it."Ms Lawrence said: "When the Mail first published their faces, up until that point nobody – apart from those in their local neighbourhood – really knew what those boys looked like."Then the whole country knew. They were no longer faceless people …"[The Mail's front page] definitely surprised me; that a newspaper would go out on a limb because at the time, even though we suspected they were guilty, there was nothing to prove that they were murderers."It makes a big difference to have that support because you don't want to be this lone voice."The Daily Mail devotes 21 pages to the story today with tributes from 11 key public figures for its unstinting campaign.Miliband told the Mail that its quest for justice was important to salute at a moment when journalism is under fire."At a time when the reputation of the newspaper industry is at an all time low, it is important to recognise when campaigning journalism makes a difference."That includes the honourable role the Daily Mail has played over almost two decades."In its editorial today, the Mail says it hopes readers will forgive it if it takes "credit from our own trade" and for the "special pride" it had in bringing Gary Dobson and David Norris to justice."When the entire British press is, in a sense, on trial at the Leveson inquiry, we believe this case offers a timely reminder of the vital importance to a healthy democracy of independent, self-regulating and viable newspapers."Former journalist and chairman of the Human Rights Commission Trevor Phillips described the decision to brand the accused as murderers as an "act of great courage" by the paper's editor Paul Dacre."But it was also a shrewd recognition by the most acute judge of middle England's temperature that attitudes to race had changed profoundly."Sir Peter Bottomley, the Tory MP who represented the suburb of Eltham at the time, said that in 1993 the media didn't care because the boy was a black kid from south London."I would like to give praise to the Daily Mail and Paul Dacre for their bravery in naming the suspects on 14 February 1997."This helped keep the attention of the country and police on the need to find the evidence which would lead to a full trial and possible conviction of the killers."Without the Daily Mail, I do not believe this would have happened."The full impact of Paul Dacre's decision to run the headline he has described as a "monumental risk" was revealed today by the former home secretary Jack Straw.He told the paper today that it helped secure the co-operation of the police inquiry into the Met's handling of the case."The Daily Mail's intervention made my job much easier in getting agreement from the Metropolitan police to set up the inquiry, which itself changed the face of policing in Britain."• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
