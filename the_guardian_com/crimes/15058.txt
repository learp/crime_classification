Homeowners could face being thrown out of their properties within 48 hours if they persist in antisocial bahaviour, the home secretary said today.Announcing new proposals aimed at tackling a "justice shortfall", John Reid said he wanted to create new powers to evict people who were the "bane of a community".These would be similar to existing powers which allow police to close down crack houses within 48 hours.Mr Reid also announced plans - detailed in a Home Office consultation paper published today - which would mean parents could have to pay fines if their children committed yobbish behaviour. In a speech to residents in Hengrove, Bristol, Mr Reid described the type of scenario in which people could be quickly evicted from a property.He said: "Perhaps it's a site used for raves or a house used as a brothel which draws people in at all times of the night and day. Shutting them down would be a last resort. But it could be done in 48-hours."A Home Office spokesman said the measures - part of the government's wider "Respect" programme to tackle antisocial behaviour - would apply to privately-owned or rented accommodation.Mr Reid said: "I think it is fair that where there is persistently excessive noise and rowdy behaviour or where residents intimidate and threaten their neighbours around the clock, the consequences are clear and tough."He said he wanted to introduce £80-on-the-spot fines - suspended for six months - to the existing system of acceptable behavior contracts (ABCs). The contracts are a voluntary agreement to desist from antisocial behavior, and are seen as an alternative to the tougher antisocial behaviour orders (Asbo) system.Around 13,000 ABCs have already been agreed and the Home Office said the introduction of suspended fines would give the contracts "teeth".The Home Office said that if the person on the ABC was a child, parents would be liable to pay the fine, and would therefore have a direct financial incentive to keep children under control.Mr Reid admitted that some people would complain that the government's plans impinged on people's rights but he argued that communities also had rights.Mr Reid indicated that he wanted to move away from the traditional view that justice had to involve going to court, a move likely to prompt concern from the legal profession and civil liberties groups.The home secretary said crack den closure orders had already been used 52 times in Bristol since they came into force in January 2004.The Home Office said it would involve applying a fine to someone who agreed to an ABC, which would only come into effect if they breached the agreement. The fine could be suspended for up to six months.The Home Office also announced that the top rate for a wide range of existing on-the-spot fines for antisocial behaviour would increase from £80 to £100.In his speech, Mr Reid said: "The problem we face is what I call the justice shortfall. That is, the difference - sometimes big - between what you and I think is justice, and what a lawyer or legal academic might think it is."My kind of justice is swift, effective and matches the crime. To me, justice should work for the victims of crime, not against them. I suspect that's probably your idea of justice too. But too often the perception isn't matched by the reality."He went on: "Although public confidence in the justice system is rising, 36% of people think the justice system meets the needs of victims. That's compared to 80% - eight out of 10 people - who think it's fair to the accused. That chasm in perception needs to be addressed."Mr Reid also asked the public to come forward with additional ideas for new powers needed by the police to deal with bad behaviour on the streets.Critics of the government have attacked the increase in powers which have been given to the police.Today David Davis, the Tory home affairs spokesman, accused Mr Reid of "more grandstanding rhetoric designed to generate headlines" and said the public expected the government to actively enforce laws already in place.Mr Davis said: "John Reid talks about putting the victims first. Yet after 10 years of Labour we have seen a real failure to enforce antisocial behaviour laws, resulting in communities being blighted and lives being made a misery."
