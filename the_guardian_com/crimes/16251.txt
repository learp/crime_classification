A strict new fireworks curfew carrying the threat of a Â£5,000 fine and six months in jail comes into effect today.The ban on letting off fireworks between 11pm and 7am is part of a package of measures to clamp down on anti-social behaviour. Exceptions have been made for special occasions, with new year revellers along with those celebrating Diwali and the Chinese new year given until 1am. But November 5 bonfire displays must be over by midnight, under the new laws. Shops are also banned from selling fireworks louder than 120 decibels, and it is an offence for under-18s to have them in a public place. The consumer minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, said: "Introducing a curfew and a noise limit balances the law to ensure that people can still enjoy fireworks whilst cracking down on their anti-social use." Shops wanting to sell fireworks all year round will need a licence from their local council. Other suppliers, such as newsagents, will only be able to sell them during limited periods.
