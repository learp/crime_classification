When "Robocop" Ray Mallon saw a woman being chased by a man on his old policing patch, he didn't hesitate to spring into action. The former head of Middlesborough CID - now mayor of the town - wrestled the man to the ground and sat on him for 15 minutes, until police arrived, it emerged yesterday. The drama happened in Hartlepool while the 46-year-old civic leader was walking in the new marina after visiting his former colleagues on Boxing Day. He saw the woman run out of a block of flats and attempt to get into a car. She was hauled out of the vehicle by the man - who then smashed the car's rear light. Mr Mallon wrestled him to the ground in a headlock and sat on him while bystanders telephoned the police. The former police chief courted controversy with his zero tolerance policing policy and he quit Cleveland police earlier this year before he was elected mayor, although he stands for no political party. Yesterday he was modest about his intervention. "I am sure other members of the public would have reacted in exactly the same way to assist this lady," he said. "What was very pleasing was that several members of the public offered their assistance."
