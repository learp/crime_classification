A man who was fatally stabbed at a London bus stop last night was taking his three-year-old daughter to hospital to meet her newborn brother, it emerged today.The 26-year-old victim, who has not been named, is thought to have been attacked after becoming involved in an argument with another man in London Road, west Croydon, shortly after 6.15pm.He was taken by ambulance to Mayday Hospital, in Croydon, where he was pronounced dead less than an hour later.A 22-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder remains in custody at a south London police station.The detective leading the investigation described the circumstances of the murder as "particularly tragic".Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons said: "This was a shocking attack in a public place in the early evening."The victim's three year-old daughter was with him when he was attacked, though fortunately she wasn't physically injured."Even more tragically, his partner had given birth to a son just that morning."Lyons said that while he was keeping "an open mind", he was keen to talk to two teenage boys who were at the bus stop when the attack happened."They are described as black, aged between 15 and 20 years old, of slim build and wearing hooded tops," he said.A Metropolitan police spokesman said several bystanders had called 999 after the seriously injured man was found in the street.He said: "We believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed."The attack took place close to a bus stop outside a Lidl supermarket, a short distance from West Croydon railway station.A nearby Sure Start shop – a government-run centre for children and parents – remained closed today and was cordoned off by police. Witnesses at an office opposite the scene said the man might have picked up the girl from the centre.Police were still at the scene and two areas of pavement alongside London Road remained cordoned off.Blue-suited forensics officers were examining the area around the bus stop for evidence. They took samples from the bus timetable as well as the shelter. A white forensic tent that had been erected over the bus stop, used by buses travelling towards Thornton Heath, was taken down this morning.Several residents at flats overlooking the scene said they had been unaware of the stabbing until police arrived doing door-to-door inquiries last night.One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: "We had real trouble getting home last night but we didn't know why until the police came knocking on the door."Another resident said they were shocked: "You don't expect it to happen on your doorstep."
