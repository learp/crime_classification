A woman has admitted handling photographs stolen from Coleen Rooney during a £5,000 blackmail plot.Jennifer Green, 25, admitted at Manchester crown court that she knew her boyfriend and business partner had the stolen photos, which were touted around newspapers and magazines before being offered back to the Rooneys – at a price.Green, who had denied blackmail and handling, pleaded guilty on the third day of her trial on Thursday to an alternative handling charge and the blackmail case against her was dropped by the prosecution.The jury were directed by Judge Anthony Gee QC to formally return a not guilty verdict on the blackmail count.Gee told Green: "I regard your case as being in a different category to that of your co-defendants Lee Platt and Steven Malcolm. But your case is still one deserving of punishment, it is still a serious offence."Green admitted being involved in the handling of the stolen photos, which included personal family pictures of Coleen Rooney, her husband Wayne – the England and Manchester United striker – and their young son Kai.She also admitted putting prints of the photos in a folder, intended to be handed over in return for cash when a deal was agreed with the Rooneys.But she was "further down the chain" and the prosecution accepted she did not know the photos were going to be used to demand money from Coleen Rooney.Green is the girlfriend and business partner of Platt. He and Malcolm, a handyman, have both admitted blackmail and handling. The two men were much more deeply involved in the scam, with Green's role limited to handling the stolen photos, the court heard.Platt and Green acquired the memory stick of Coleen Rooney's Samsung digital camera, which was stolen from her while she was at a concert at the MEN Arena on 24 May last year.The pair then tried to sell the photos to the press before contacting Manchester United and demanding £5,000 to return the goods. An undercover police officer contacted the plotters and, posing as a Rooney representative, agreed to give them cash.But when Malcolm arrived at a location in Manchester to hand over the memory stick and a folder of photos in September last year, he was arrested.Malcolm, 42, was on trial jointly with Green but on Thursday changed his pleas to guilty to both charges.All three will be sentenced on 30 January after the preparation of probation reports.
