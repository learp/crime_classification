A 22-year-old man who was convicted of a public order offence during the Manchester riots: "Usually when there's a protest there's one group of people fighting another. Whereas this time it was like: 'No, we're angry at you now.' People who have got nothing wanted to show that they have nothing."I saw [a man] getting absolutely battered by the police, so I just started shouting at them: 'Scum, get off him.'"The next thing I was getting my face slammed against the window, handcuffs got put on me. I got thrown in the back of the police van."They dragged me out on to the police floor and I don't remember much of it because it was terrifying. They proper battered me. They were laughing at me."When they arrest you they say: 'Stop resisting.' You can't stop resisting because of the way they're holding you; you feel like they're breaking your arm. You're not resisting arrest. You're just stopping them from hurting you."I felt screwed. I ended up in a courtroom, having not slept, having not eaten, shaking, having no idea what the fuck was going on, at 11 o'clock at night, with a load of press looking at me like I was some sort of fucking knobhead."All I was allowed to say was my name. I was so angry because no matter what happens in my whole entire life I am guilty of what happened there."I was in prison for just under nine weeks. I'm a strong person. If anyone says anything to me I'll tell them to fuck off. That's what I did â€¦ and I didn't get in a fight with anyone and I didn't get bullied. But it's not about what other people do to you in there."By the time I was in prison, I couldn't really get my head round any of it. All I felt was this massive, massive, massive hatred for people."I think gangs had something to do with it, but I also think the police are probably the biggest gang in the world. I've always thought they were absolute scumbags. It's just made me realise what kind of scumbags they actually are."
