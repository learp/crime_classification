The collapse of Scotland Yard's multi-million pound criminal inquiry into one of its officers is to be investigated by the Police Complaints Authority, the Guardian has learned.Police officers from another force will conduct the investigation into Operation Helios, the failed prosecution of Superintendent Ali Dizaei which was halted at the Old Bailey despite inquiries by a team of officers which lasted for four and a half years. The Iranian-born officer was cleared of two relatively minor offences. He had earlier been accused of drug dealing, prostitution and acts to pervert the course of justice, but was never charged. The independent inquiry will be conducted under the supervision of the PCA following complaints from the public. The decision to have the matter reviewed externally was taken soon after the case against Supt Dizaei collapsed, but has yet to be announced officially. The inquiry is likely to be headed by a chief constable, given its high profile. Scotland Yard said the complaints received from the public involved officers of various ranks. Despite the referral to the PCA, no officers have been suspended or placed on restrictive duties. Ray Powell, the president-elect of the National Black Police Association (NBPA) said: "We hope the PCA will pursue this with the same vigour the Met showed in its pursuit of Ali Dizaei." Following the collapse of talks between the Met and Supt Dizaei's representatives in the NBPA, the force told him last week that it intended to press ahead with internal disciplinary action against him. But since the pledge by the NBPA to prevent any more black recruits joining the Met, new talks have begun with the force and his representatives. NBPA officials were also called to the Home Office last week. They said they would continue to frustrate all recruitment campaigns until agreement was reached about Supt Dizaei's future.
