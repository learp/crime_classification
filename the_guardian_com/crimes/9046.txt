A man who beat a Finnish student to death had been stopped by police just hours before the attack.Jason Dockrill, 34, was convicted at the Old Bailey yesterday of the "sadistic and sexual" murder of Suvi Aronen in March last year. Hours before the murder an off-duty special constable heard him shouting racial abuse near Wanstead Common, east London. When challenged, Dockrill said he had a gun and he was going to shoot black men who, he said, had raped his girlfriend. He also stated he was on antidepressants and should be sectioned. Other officers were called and Dockrill restrained but found no gun and let him go. Yesterday senior police insisted the officers had acted properly as Dockrill had no history of offending. Before he murdered Aronen, Dockrill, of Stratford, east London, had attacked three other women, including an 80-year-old pensioner. Later he dragged Aronen into scrubland as she walked home, sexually assaulted her and killed her with a brick. The jury rejected his plea of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. The recorder of London, Judge Michael Hyam said Dockrill was "a danger to women and likely to remain so for a long time, if not indefinitely". He recommended he serve a minimum of 25 years.
