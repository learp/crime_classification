After the government drive to move long-term unemployed, lone parents and people on incapacity benefits back into the labour market, the policymakers are turning the spotlight on another "core jobless" group: ex-offenders.However, the government has got its work cut out, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Out of 750 employers quizzed, almost two-thirds excluded recruiting people with a flawed past.Well over half said nothing would persuade them to take on someone released from prison. At present, 90% of prisoners face unemployment on release, and 60% of those are re-convicted within two years.However, post-prison employment reduces the risk of re-offending by between a third and a half.John Philpott, chief economist of the CIPD, says: "More than eight out of 10 (87%) employers with experience of taking on ex-offenders, consider them at least as productive as other workers, and 75% consider them at least as reliable. This would suggest that people with criminal records are, in many cases, being unfairly excluded from the recruitment process."A government drive to retrain prisoners is being energetically pursued through the Prison Service, the Probation Service and local Learning and Skills Councils. The target this year is to offer employment, training or education to 38,000 - up from 31,500 last year.Lindholme prison, near Doncaster, runs the Prison Service's first purpose-built construction industry training facility, jointly funded by regional development agency Yorkshire Forward and the Home Office.The aim is to train participants towards the Construction Industry Training Board and City and Guilds Intermediary Construction Award, as well as NVQ2, during their sentence.And High Down prison in Sutton, Surrey, trains inmates for jobs in the hospitality and catering trade up to NVQ level 3.John Podmore, governor of Brixton prison, recently hosted a gathering organised by Business in the Community, an independent business-led charity, and urged corporate leaders to drop their prejudices. His pitch was that ex-offenders with the right training make loyal employees.Employing organisations participating in Business in the Community's "prison partners programme" include the internet computing firm Cisco Systems, electricity and gas supplier EDF Energy and British Airways.These firms offer training, work experience or mentoring to ex-offenders struggling to shed the shadow of their criminal past. National Grid Transco employs ex-offenders to dig up roads for new pipes, and the rail industry's track renewal programme also provides ex-prisoners with regular work and a steady income to keep them on the straight and narrow.ISV Group, the technology training firm, has been working with Parc prison in Bridgend, south Wales, and Cardiff prison, giving prisoners the opportunity to get hands-on experience of using computers to develop their IT skills, as well as training in customer service skills.However, certain companies implement blanket bans on employing ex-prisoners. Businesses in the social care field, for example, would never employ someone with a conviction for grievous bodily harm, and nursing homes are unlikely to give house room to anyone with a record of drugs- related offences.
