The government today pushed ahead with plans to introduce compulsory lie detector tests for convicted sex offenders released from prison.Under the management of offenders and sentencing bill, published today, sex offenders could be forced to undergo polygraph tests to check they are fulfilling the conditions of their release.The reliability of polygraph tests has proved controversial in Britain, but the results of a small voluntary pilot scheme in the north-east last year has shown their use was welcomed by probation staff involved in supervising sex offenders.The bill puts onto a statutory footing the National Offender Management Service (Noms), which brings together the Prison Service and the Probation Service. More controversially, it will also allow private companies and the voluntary sector to supervise offenders on community sentences instead of the Probation Service.The home secretary will also get new powers to direct local probation boards to commission certain services from private and voluntary sector providers.The assistant general secretary of the probation union Napo, Harry Fletcher, said: "The purpose of the National Offender Management Service, which is established in today's bill, is to dismantle the Probation Service and introduce privatisation in order to drive down costs."This will be done through reducing the terms and conditions of staff," he said."This is unlikely to reduce re-offending and, indeed, could actually lead to an increase in crime, because quantity not quality will become the main principle."The bill also proposes a new system of imposing court fines - called day fines - based on an offender's ability to pay.
