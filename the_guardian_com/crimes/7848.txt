Nine more people have been arrested as part of the investigation into the alleged naming on Twitter of a rape victim who was attacked by the footballer Ched Evans.Five men and four women, all from north Wales, were arrested and are in custody for questioning at St Asaph police station, north Wales police said. It brings the total number of arrests surrounding the case to 12, after three men were arrested in South Yorkshire last week and released on bail until a later date.The comments were allegedly made after the Sheffield United and Wales international striker Evans was jailed last month for raping a 19-year-old woman near Rhyl, Denbighshire, in May last year.Victims of rape and sexual assaults are legally entitled to anonymity for life. It is a criminal offence punishable by a Â£5,000 fine to identify the victim of a sexual offence in a publication or programme.North Wales police confirmed that three men and three women from the Rhyl, Prestatyn and Llanddulas areas were arrested early on Tuesday morning and are being held at St Asaph police station for questioning.Officers later arrested a woman in Broughton, Flintshire, and two men, in Colwyn Bay and Abergele.Detective Sergeant Bob Halford, of North Wales police, said: "We continue to be proactive in this investigation and anticipate that further arrests will be made in the near future."Evans, 23, was convicted of rape and jailed for five years at Caernarfon crown court on 20 April.The footballer claimed the 19-year-old victim had consented to sex at a hotel in May 2011 following a night out, but the jury decided she was too drunk to consent. In her evidence, she said she had no memory of the incident and believed her drink may have been spiked.The trial judge, Merfyn Hughes, told Evans he had "thrown away [his] successful career" and that the victim had been in "no condition to have sexual intercourse".Evans's lawyers say he intends to appeal against his conviction.The Sheffield United reserve defender Connor Brown has already been suspended by the club for comments he made on Twitter following his team-mate's conviction.
