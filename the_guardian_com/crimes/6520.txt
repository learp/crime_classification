One of the peculiarities of Chris Langham's arrest on child pornography charges was that it came more or less exactly as the 58-year-old actor's formerly turbulent life and career had apparently settled into stability and success.Langham, who was jailed for 10 months today after being found guilty of downloading pictures and videos of children being abused, had been widely feted for his portrayal of the hapless government minister Hugh Abbott in the BBC satire The Thick of It.The father of five won a series of awards, including a Bafta, and also gained widespread recognition for another series, Help, which he wrote and starred in alongside Paul Whitehouse.It seemed to be belated success for an actor and writer who, while always acknowledged by his peers as hugely talented, had been dogged by a combination of bad professional luck and personal troubles.After dropping out of a degree when he suffered a nervous breakdown after his parents split up, Langham won awards as a writer for Spike Milligan and then The Muppet Show.He looked set to become a household name as a cast member on the groundbreaking comedy series Not the Nine O'Clock News, co-starring in its first series in 1979. However, for the next series, which achieved considerably more recognition, Langham was replaced by Griff Rhys Jones, a setback that worsened his existing difficulties with alcohol and cocaine use.These addictions - later tackled through treatment - proved a significant impediment to Langham's professional life, he admitted."My career was being a drunk and work was something I did if I had a spare five minutes," he said.As his personal life stabilised - he has two children by his second wife, the stage director Christine Cartwright - Langham appeared more regularly on television again, for example in the spoof documentary series People Like Us, broadcast in 1999.However, it was The Thick of It that brought Langham national fame. The series continued after his arrest, with the actor's character supposedly taking an extended trip to Australia.Langham's television career is now almost certainly over after he was convicted of 15 counts of making an indecent photograph of a child. Some of the material, the judge said, was at the "top end of the scale" in seriousness.The jury did clear Langham of sex offences against a 14-year-old female fan and aspiring actress whom he had befriended while appearing in Les Miserables in the West End in the 1990s. While he admitted having sex with her when she was 18, he repeatedly denied claims that he had systematically groomed and then assaulted her when she was 14 and 15.Langham did not have a convincing explanation during his three-week trial for the videos and pictures of child abuse found on his computer.His claim that he had downloaded the material while researching a sex offender character for Help was dismissed as "spurious" by prosecutors. In his evidence to the jury, Mr Whitehouse said he could see no reason why Langham would need to view such material for research.Langham admitted in the witness box to viewing the child pornography and said he had pleaded not guilty to send out a message that he was not a paedophile.He told the jury he had been abused himself as an eight-year-old and claimed the victims in the child pornography were like his "brothers and sisters".He spoke of his "deep, deep shame" and described the experience of seeing the films as like "putting my face in a chainsaw".When asked if he was a sick man, he replied: "I would describe myself as a human being, a work in progress, as we all are."
