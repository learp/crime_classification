Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PABrothers Steven Barker, 33, and Jason Owen, 37, are also serving prison sentences for their role in the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.  Owen was given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum term of three years. Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAAt the time of the killing, Owen lived with Barker and his girlfriend, Tracey Connelly, who was Peter's mother, at a semi-detached church-owned house in Tottenham, north London. Owen was lodging at the home with a 15-year-old runaway who was his lover. Connelly's two dogs and Barker's rottweiler, Kaiser, also lived in what was described as filthy accommodation. When Peter was killed, Owen changed his name in an attempt to avoid being linked to the case.The two brothers had been in trouble with the police before. They were charged with assaulting their grandmother, Hilda Barker, 82, at her home in Whitstable, Kent, in 1995. She told police they locked her in a wardrobe to make her change her will in their favour. The case was dropped the following year, before they came to trial, after their grandmother died from pneumonia.Steven Barker was tried in May alongside Connelly over the rape of a two-year-old girl which took place before Baby Peter's death. They were tried under assumed names to avoid the jury linking them to the Baby Peter case. Barker was convicted of rape and jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years but Connelly was cleared of a child cruelty charge.In the Baby Peter trial, Barker was told he had played the major part in his death and was given 12 years in jail. Owen was given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum term of three years. He was said to be more worried about being discovered with his underage girlfriend than protecting Peter.
