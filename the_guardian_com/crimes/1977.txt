A sports agent and a cricketer have lost their court of appeal challenges against spot-fixing convictions.Mazhar Majeed, 36, from Croydon, south London, and the former Essex player Mervyn Westfield – the first county cricketer in England to be prosecuted for spot-fixing – were jailed in separate cases.Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge and two other judges in London, who had been urged to overturn their convictions, rejected their appeals, which turned on the same point of law.The men pleaded guilty following pre-trial argument and rulings. Their conviction challenges centred on the correct interpretation of gambling and betting legislation. It was argued on their behalf that the offences charged did not reflect the facts alleged.Majeed, 36, from Croydon, south London, was sentenced in November 2011 to two years and eight months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to make corrupt payments, relating to the case of Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt and events around Pakistan's Test against England at Lord's in 2010. The three players all received custodial sentences for their part in a plot involving the deliberate bowling of no-balls.Westfield, 24, from Chelmsford, Essex, was sentenced to four months in prison at the Old Bailey in February and has since been released. He pleaded guilty to one count of accepting or obtaining a corrupt payment to bowl in a way that would allow the scoring of runs.He was accused of being paid £6,000 to bowl so that a specific number of runs would be chalked up in the first over of a match between Durham and Essex in September 2009. As well as the jail sentence, Westfield was the subject of a confiscation order for £6,000.
