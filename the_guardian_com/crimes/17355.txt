A 61-year-old sex offender from Southport facing jail for offences against children was granted bail yesterday because local prisons are full.Judge Sean Duncan, sitting at Liverpool crown court, was told the nearest jail to which the man could be remanded was in Doncaster, more than 100 miles away.The man was convicted of seven charges but the jury was discharged yesterday when they could not reach a verdict on six similar charges. The judge remanded the man on bail to his home, saying: "The prisons are full. That is the state of our prison system. It is quite ridiculous."
