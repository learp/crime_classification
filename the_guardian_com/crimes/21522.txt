Three media organisations have joined together to challenge a decision by prosecutors to hush up a miscarriage of justice involving a police spy who allegedly gave false evidence in a court case.This month, the Guardian, the BBC and the Press Association will seek to find out if, and how, an undercover police operation was responsible for the unjust conviction.The challenge is due to be heard on Monday January 27 at Southwark Crown court in London.Prosecutors have conceded that an environmental campaigner was wrongfully convicted, but have so far refused to explain how it happened.The controversy revolves around allegations that an undercover police officer, Jim Boyling, was authorised by his superiors to give false evidence under oath during the prosecution of the campaigner.For five years in the 1990s, Boyling had assumed a false identity and pretended to be an environmental and animal rights activist. For more details of Boyling's deployment, see this and this.In October 2011, the Guardian and Richard Watson of BBC Newsnight published evidence apparently showing that Boyling used his fake identity in the court when he was prosecuted alongside John Jordan, the environmental campaigner whose conviction has now been quashed.For background on how Boyling allegedly concealed his true identity from the courtroom, read this, this, and this.Last October, I posted this blog on how Jordan and his lawyer, Mike Schwarz from the civil liberties firm Bindmans, appealed and got his conviction overturned.At the hearing later this month in Southwark Crown Court, Jordan will be seeking to compel prosecutors to tell him why his conviction was unsafe, with the help of his barrister, Matthew Ryder.The three media organisations will also argue that there is a very strong public interest in disclosing to the public the confidential reasons behind the quashing of the conviction.Back in 2011, police chiefs were criticised when it was revealed that Boyling had apparently hidden his true identity and occupation in Jordan's prosecution.Former director of public prosecutions, Ken MacDonald, said police chiefs had made a "monumental misjudgment" and had "crossed the line".Since then, police chiefs have said very little about the allegations.At one point, Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, defended the practice of undercover officers using fake identities in court, claiming there is no specific law forbidding it.Since 2011, the allegations have apparently been investigated by the police's internal inquiry, known as Operation Herne, that has been tasked with examining the broad scope of the conduct of undercover spies in political groups since 1968.Operation Herne has yet to make public any information or conclusions about this particular aspect of its inquiry.In contrast to the police and prosecutors, one person who has shed light on this practice is Peter Francis, the former undercover spy who has blown the whistle on the covert squad he once worked for, the Special Demonstration Squad.It is one of a series of times he has disclosed details about the SDS - see here, here and here, for example.At the time of the original allegations in 2011 (see here), he painted a picture of how Boyling's case was not unique.He said that from time to time, police chiefs authorised their undercover spies to use their false identities in court as it helped to build up their credibility with the activists they were infiltrating.Speaking then under his former pseudonym of Peter Black, he had said that being prosecuted was "part of their cover", as the undercover spies were regularly involved in public disorder.The whistleblower, who revealed his true identity of Peter Francis last summer, spoke at greater length about this technique in our book on the police spies, Undercover, that was published last June.More recently, Bob Lambert, another of the police spies, has admitted after a long silence, that when he was undercover, he appeared in a magistrates court charged with a "minor public order offence".In an interview with Channel Four news,  he said he had to appear in court using his alter ego – rather than his real name – in order to "maintain cover".It is not yet clear how many undercover spies have used fake identities in court since 1968, nor what instructions they received from their bosses, nor what the justification for doing so was.We wait to see if the internal police inquiry will make public this information.
