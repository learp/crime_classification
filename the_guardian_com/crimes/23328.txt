Most victims of racist and homophobic crime do not report their experiences to the police and often suffer ongoing victimisation which they regard as part of everyday life, according to a report published today.The research by Victim Support found most victims of hate crimes, which included verbal abuse, property damage and assault, suffered in silence. Only one in five who reported the offences felt supported by police and many criticised officers for failing to act, particularly over low-level harassment.Some who experienced continued victimisation saw the abuse as part of daily life and even gave up leaving the house. Others lost their home or business because of arson, vandalism or having to move to get away from their abusers.They gave fear of going to court, concern about revenge attacks and a lack of understanding from the police as reasons for not reporting what was happening.Peter Dunn, head of research and development at Victim Support, said: "Hate crime symbolises all the worst aspects of prejudice. Our research shows that it has a more profoundly damaging affect on victims that is often not fully understood by the criminal justice system."He said the report's findings, obtained through interviews with 107 hate crime victims and a survey of support organisations, would be shared to try to improve the help available. The organisation helps 30,000 victims of racist crime every year and the numbers are rising.Maxie Hayles, head of Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit, said agencies needed to prioritise hate crimes."The fact is that people do not trust the criminal justice system and would rather suffer the terror than risk not being helped," he said.Although the Home Office publishes figures for recorded racist incidents and racially or religiously aggravated offences - up 7% and 6% respectively last year - a spokeswoman said it did not break down figures for victimisation based on sexual orientation or disability.
