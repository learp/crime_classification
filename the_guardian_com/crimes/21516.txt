Tony Blair was forced to admit making a humiliating U-turn today over the early release of prisoners to ease overcrowding.The prime minister told MPs he "regretted" having to let prisoners out 18 days earlier than the end of their sentences.The admission came after pressure from the Tory leader, David Cameron, during prime minister's question time in the Commons.Mr Cameron told him: "We have the scandal of you opening the prison gates and releasing 25,000 prisoners onto our streets. "Can you tell us when you were first warned that the prison population would go over 80,000?"Speaking at his last but one PMQs prior to handing over to Mr Brown next Wednesday, Mr Blair said the decision was necessary because prisoner numbers now exceeded "even the top-end projection" made last year.Mr Blair, who just a month ago rejected the prospect of early releases to ease prison overcrowding, said: "I regret having to do so, but we have to do it."Why? First, because the numbers of people in prison has risen dramatically as a result of a 25% increase in sentencing."Secondly, under this government we are now recalling people who breach their licence conditions and there's 5,000 extra in prison as a result of that, and, thirdly, because we now have almost 3,000 people in prison on indeterminate sentences for violent and sexual offences."When we build the new prison places - a further 8,000 with another 1,500 - we can retrieve this situation. I regret having had to do it, but it was necessary to do it."The government was forced to act this week after the daily prison population in England and Wales hit a record of 81,086 on Monday.As a result, about 25,000 prisoners who receive sentences of between four weeks and four years will be eligible for the new early release scheme, which will come into effect from June 29, every year.Foreign nationals will be excluded.
