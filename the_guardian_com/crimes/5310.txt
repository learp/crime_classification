The stepfather of a disabled man whose body was found hidden at the family home is being questioned in connection with his murder, it emerged last night.Brian Kirby, 36, was named locally as the man arrested on suspicion of James Hughes's murder. Hughes's body was found on Wednesday, two days after his mother, Heather Wardle, was discovered dead with a ligature around her neck. The pair was reported missing at the weekend, sparking a major police search. West Mercia police refused to confirm the name of the man they had arrested. A youth is also being held on suspicion of murder. Officers are treating Wardle's death as "unexplained" but believe she took her own life. Detectives revealed yesterday that Hughes's body was being identified using dental records, which suggests it may have been decomposed or badly damaged. Officers refused to comment on rumours that Hughes's body was found in a suitcase. They are trying to establish when and where Hughes, who was 22 but had the mental age of a toddler, was last seen amid suspicions that he may have been dead for some time. Some neighbours claim Hughes had not been seen for several days before he and his mother were reported missing.The Guardian revealed yesterday that Wardle cut off contact with social services some weeks ago, all of which may support the idea that Hughes may have been dead long before his body was found. Hughes lived at the terrace house in the Church Hill area of Redditch with his mother, stepfather - Kirby - and three stepbrothers, Daniel, 17, Callum, eight, and Luke, six. Hughes's father, Paul Hughes, also lives in Redditch. After Wardle's body was found, Kirby paid tribute to a "brilliant mother" who doted on her children.
