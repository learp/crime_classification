Crime has stabilised in England and Wales, but robbery and theft is on the rise, according to two sets of statistics released by the Home Office today.Concerns about anti-social behaviour, including people being drunk or rowdy in the street, were also reportedly on the rise.The British Crime Survey (BCS), which is based on interviews with people 16 and over living in households in England and Wales, showed a 12% increase in robbery and theft between July 2005 to June 2006.Police-recorded crimes - a different set of statistics - showed that robbery had risen by 5% between April to June 2006, when compared with the same quarter in 2005.Both sets of statistics revealed a stabilising of crime across the country, with the BCS showing crime increasing 2% over the year, and police records showing a 2% decrease in the quarter.The Home Office minister, Tony McNulty, said in a statement that although recorded robbery has gone up, the rate of increase is much slower than in recent quarters.He said improvements were being made by working with the police and the mobile phone industry, as well as an advertising campaign warning people to keep their valuables safe.He said "acquisitive crime" was largely drug related and that the Home Office were diverting record numbers of drug-misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment each week. He also said more drug dealers were "behind bars". The Home office report also showed a 16% rise in April to June 2006 in drug offences, compared to the same period last year. It noted the increase was smaller then seen in the previous two quarters.But The Shadow Home secretary David Davis described the statistics as "shocking" and said that police were "stuck behind their desks under an ever increasing burden of Labour red tape".The BCS also found that 33% of people said there was a "fairly/very big problem in their area" with teenagers hanging around on the streets and 25% shared similar concerns about people being drunk or rowdy in public places.Public confidence in the criminal justice system improved slightly with 80% of people saying they were "fairly confident" that the system respects the rights of people accused of a crime and treats them fairly.The Statistics Commission - an independent non-departmental body established to ensure official statistics are trustworthy - released a report in early September recommending changes to the way crime figures are reported.The commission called on the Home Office to separate policy functions and the compilation and publication of crime statistics, and to present the figures with greater clarity. A spokeswoman said today that the Home Office is yet to formally respond to their recommendations.
