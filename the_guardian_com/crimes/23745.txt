A fisherman and registered sex offender who faked his own death – including writing a magazine obituary for himself – to dodge fraud charges has been jailed for two and a half years.Derek Atkins, of Portsmouth, Hampshire, used several aliases including Roger Atkins and Derek Eastwood, and conned a woman out of £3,000. He was sentenced today at Portsmouth crown court after previously pleading guilty to more than 30 charges.The charges included obtaining property by deception, perverting the course of justice, fraud and posing as qualified personnel at sea.Atkins, 56, also pleaded guilty to failing to notify changes to the sex offenders register and 21 fisheries charges brought by the Marine and Fisheries Agency (MFA).The court heard that as Atkins was being pursued by the MFA, he submitted a false obituary for his alias of Roger Atkins in the Fishing News trade newspaper in an attempt to avoid prosecution.Sentencing Atkins, the judge, Ian Pearson, said: "You are a lying, cunning, calculating fraudster – there's no other description for you."The court heard that Atkins's deception was spotted when the MFA suspected that using his pseudonym of Roger he had been failing to log fishing trips according to legal requirements.Officers wrote to him and received a reply stating that he had moved to Holland.He then telephoned the MFA requesting an interview, but before that could take place the investigators received another letter stating that Roger Atkins had died.An obituary was published in Fishing News.Included in the obituary was a rant at government fishing policies: "He was totally dedicated to his career and had little time for officials, MPs or political parties, whom he believed were mostly a waste of time, money and effort."He firmly believed that between them, Defra, the MCA and the government's rules, [they] simply want to stop the British fisherman earning an honest living and have the British fleet scrapped to enable foreigners to take whatever they want from British waters."After all, he would say, they have had everything else so they may as well have our fishing industry too."Describing Roger Atkins, the obituary continued: "People found him to be a gentleman at sea with a great sense of humour who would always help anyone. He was a quiet family man and will be deeply missed by his family and friends."The MFA passed the investigation over to Hampshire police, who uncovered fraud offences and various aliases linked to different addresses.Atkins had conned a woman he met over the internet into giving him £3,000, which he has not repaid.He tried to set up credit cards and a Sky TV account by falsely claiming the identity of a fishing skipper, Robert Viney.The court heard that Atkins failed to notify the police of a change of details on the sex offenders register when he changed his name from Derek Eastwood to Derek Atkins. He is on the register until 2012 because of an indecent assault conviction in 2002.The court heard that Atkins had 32 previous convictions for deception, sexual offences and driving matters.The fisheries offences for which he was sentenced today involved filing false logbook and catch information used by the MFA to decide fishing quotas.
