A Church of England vicar who conducted hundreds of sham marriages in an immigration fraud was jailed today for four years.The Rev Alex Brown married hundreds of African men desperate to obtain permanent residency rights in Britain, to eastern European women who were paid up to Â£3,000.The fraud was detected because of the extraordinary surge in the number of marriages at the church of St Peter and St Paul in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex. Brown presided over 383 marriages between July 2005 and July 2009, a 30-fold increase over the previous four years.He was found guilty in July at Lewes crown court of conspiring to facilitate breaches of immigration laws, along with a solicitor, Michael Adelasoye, and Vladymyr Buchak, an illegal immigrant from Ukraine who recruited the brides.Brown and Adelasoye both denied knowing the marriages were false, but at the trial jurors were told that some couples could not speak the same language, others produced rings that did not fit, and some applied to marry one person and then the following week applied to marry somebody else.Brown was suspended from his duties by the church after his arrest.The judge, Richard Hayward, also handed Brown a five-month sentence, to run concurrently, after he pleaded guilty to solemnising a marriage according to the rites of the Church of England without the banns being properly read.
