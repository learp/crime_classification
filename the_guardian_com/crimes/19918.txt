Military veterans are twice as likely to be convicted for sex offences than other people and more likely to commit violent offences, an inquiry has found.The inquiry's chair, Sir John Nutting QC, who described the finding as "disquieting", said he had no idea why former servicemen go on to commit sexual offences and called for more research.After an 18-month study, the Howard League for Penal Reform found that three-quarters of veterans in jail had served in the army, the largest service. One in seven had served in the navy, and 8% the RAF."It's clear that this is an army problem," said Nutting. However, he said that far from creating the problem the army, which recruits a significant number from those with "socially deprived and economically disadvantaged backgrounds" shared by many in the criminal justice system, had a "beneficial effect". Many out of the 3,000 ex-servicemen in prison would have begun offending earlier had they not joined up, he said.The study found "little or no evidence" that combat trauma is directly linked to offending. However, it stated "clearly some of the symptoms of the condition, such as poor anger management or eroded family relationships, do have established links to offending". The report recommended that service personnel be screened for post-traumatic stress.Nutting conceded that the fear of a "spike" in criminality 15 years after the conflict in Afghanistan was one reason for a screening programme. "It's by no means impossible and people fear it," he said. "That is why it is so important that we plan and servicemen are screened."
