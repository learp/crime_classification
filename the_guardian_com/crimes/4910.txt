A mentally ill man who killed a vicar at his south Wales church had not been given a proper psychiatric assessment or treatment, an independent report published today found.The report, by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, said the killing of Father Paul Bennett by Geraint Evans, who has paranoid schizophrenia, could not have been predicted.But it concluded that mental health experts should have treated Evans for psychosis following a suicide attempt in 2006, and said they might have been able to pre-empt his behaviour had the extent of his illness been diagnosed.Father Bennett, 59, who was deaf, was stabbed 21 times outside the vicarage of St Fagan's church in Trecynon, Aberdare, south Wales, in March 2007, as he went outside to put the rubbish out.His wife, Georgina, went outside to find Evans on top of her husband in the throes of a frenzied attack.Evans, now 26, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility the following October and was ordered to be detained indefinitely at Ashford special hospital.During his trial it emerged that he was obsessed with the devil and suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, which was exacerbated by him using cannabis and inhaling lighter fluid.Father Bennett's family asked for an inquiry after his sentencing amid suspicions his psychiatric care had not been handled appropriately.Evans attempted to slit his own throat in July 2006, but walked out of A&E before psychiatrists arrived to assess him.The psychiatric liaison team failed to follow up the incident once Evans had returned to his home, yards from the vicarage at Trecynon. As a result the extent of his illness remained unknown to medical services.Amid a catalogue of failures the report also found that mental health services failed to support Evans and his family in his early years, leaving him without long-term care despite the repeated requests of his mother.Dr Peter Higson, chief executive of Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, said: "It is clear that Mr D's [Evans's] mental health problems had gone undiagnosed and untreated for some time. While the homicide of Father Paul could not have been predicted, had Mr D received appropriate care and treatment, the risk of him committing an act of violence or homicide might have been reduced."For Father Paul's widow, the tragedy has been compounded by her experiences following his attack and we have made recommendations in our report that are aimed at ensuring the matters highlighted by her experiences are addressed."Speaking on behalf of Mrs Bennett and her daughter, Cynon Valley MP Ann Clwyd told the BBC: "Unfortunately it shows, once more, that society is being let down by failings of our social services and health authority."How many more innocent people must lose their lives in the most horrific circumstances before these organisations begin to realise the consequences of their inadequate actions?"Welsh health authorities say measures to diagnose and treat conditions quickly and accurately have been implemented since Father Bennett's death.
