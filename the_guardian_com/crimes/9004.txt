Nurse Rebecca Leighton has been dismissed from Stepping Hill hospital despite all charges being dropped against her in relation to poisoning patients with insulin.The staff nurse, 27, from Heaviley, Stockport, had been freed from Styal prison in Cheshire in September after spending six weeks on remand following her arrest in July.Leighton vehemently denied any wrongdoing in relation to the deliberate tampering with bags of saline fluid. It was reported on Friday that she had been sacked owing to her admission that she stole medicine from her workplace for her own use.Her interim suspension by the Nursing and Midwifery Council had been overturned in September and she would have, theoretically, been allowed to return to work if the hospital permitted it.But an investigation began over her admission that she took a painkiller from the hospital. She told the NMC that she had taken the medicine for her own use because she was suffering from a throat infection. On Friday, the hospital informed her that she had been dismissed.The hospital said it was unable to comment on reports that Leighton had been dismissed. But sources told the Guardian that the information was correct.Greater Manchester police saidon Friday they were investigating the poisoning of 19 people as part of an inquiry into the deliberate contamination of products at Stepping Hill.Detectives from the major incident team are investigating incidents of hypoglycaemia on two wards at the hospital between 1 June 2011 and 15 July 2011.The deaths of Tracey Arden, Arnold Lancaster and Derek Weaver are included in the 19 cases where insulin was unlawfully administered. Tests to establish whether the poisoning contributed to their death in any way are continuing.The cases of 21 patients who suffered hypoglycaemic episodes are not being treated as suspicious and detectives have not been able to determine whether or not two other patients who suffered hypoglycaemic episodes did so naturally or as a result of being poisoned. Experts with specialist medical knowledge have been drafted in to assist the investigation and 650 key and significant witnesses have been interviewed by police.Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said: "From day one we knew this would be an immensely challenging inquiry – and that continues to be the case – but we are now beginning to see the wood from the trees and have effectively completed the first phase of our investigation."I know victims and the relatives of those poisoned as well as the wider public and those at the hospital want answers and we are working as quickly as we can without jeopardising the quality or integrity of the investigation."I cannot stress enough just how complex and difficult this investigation is. We are continuing to carry out detailed forensic and medical inquiries and these take time and cannot be rushed."It is important the public understands that this is not something that can be done over the space of several weeks or even months but rest assured we are determined to identifying whoever is responsible and continue to commit significant resources to the investigation."
