Rebecca*, in her late teens, spent six months on remand at Holloway women's prison in north London on drugs charges."I was shocked when they sent me to prison. I couldn't believe it. It was the first time I had been separated from my family and it was difficult to cope. Holloway is not a good place to be. There were no televisions in cells and no electricity points to plug in a radio. We were banged up for long periods each day, especially at weekends when there were staff shortages. "Sometimes it was three or four days before you could have a bath. You had to make do with washing from a bucket. At first I was in a cell by myself, but I wanted to move to be with other people. We played cards and talked to pass the time. I also read a lot. "They normally woke us around 7am. We had breakfast at 8am. If there were enough staff you got half an hour exercise in the fresh air. "Sometimes we were forced to take our lunch back to our cells. And if there weren't enough officers we had to be back in our cells early, sometimes by 4pm, especially at weekends. The food wasn't very good. It was difficult not being able to have something to eat or a cup of tea when you felt like it. "The first month was very hard. They treat you like shit but then you do get used to it. If you're quiet and don't bother other people, you will be fine. I got in one fight but the officers stopped it. "It's wrong to lock women up like that. There must be better ways of dealing with people than that." (*Not her real name)
