There is something delightful about tales of criminals being tripped up by their own stupidity.There was the thief in Bristol caught not so long ago because a hidden camera captured not just his face but his tattoo  on his neck with his name ‑ and date of birth.Then there's the Californian robber who targeted a bank that was no longer in business and so had no money. Not exactly Ocean's Eleven-style research.Another American robber ran straight into his mum after holding up a bank. She turned him in.Now two bungling (it is almost obligatory to describe them thus) robbers in Dorset have been told to expect to face a jail sentence after stealing pizzas from a delivery driver.As so often in crime, greed was their downfall. As well as three pizzas, Daniel Ford, 19, and Liam Jarman, 18, stole three Mars bars and three cans of fizzy drink (quite why three was their magic number remains a mystery).They managed to eat the Mars bars and drink the drinks. But the pizza crusts proved just too much. They threw the boxes and the remains of their feast into a bin and were later caught after their DNA was found on those hard, cold crusts. They had broken one of the key rules of the criminal fraternity: destroy all the evidence.Delivery driver David Hallett, 16, was ambushed in an alleyway by Ford and Jarman in October last year on Portland. The pair wore masks for the heist and threatened him with a broken bottle.They denied robbery but were convicted at Bournemouth crown court.Afterwards, a spokesman for Dorset police said that when officers went to Jarman's house, the pair denied having stolen, or eaten the pizzas. The spokesman said: "The DNA tests were crucial as both their DNA was on the pizza crusts and their fingerprints were on the boxes."In all, the food and drink cost about £23. The pair were told to expect a jail sentence.
