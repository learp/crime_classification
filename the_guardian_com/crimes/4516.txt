Three teenagers who killed a woman by pushing a firework through her letterbox following a string of bullying attacks on her son were jailed today.Mary Fox, 59, died in the fire in Bodmin, Cornwall, on bonfire night last year after the silver dart firework was thrust inside to "frighten" the family as part of a prank.Her son Raum, then 17, escaped through a window of the blazing council home in Wallace Road, but his mother inhaled a fatal amount of fumes.Owen Hewitt 18, and Samuel Luckes, 17, were each jailed for seven years at Truro crown court for the manslaughter of the mother of nine. They were also each sentenced to three years concurrently for committing arson, and being reckless as to whether Raum's life was endangered.The pair "laughed and joked" that the burning house belonged to Raum's mother, the jury heard earlier.A third teenager, Ryan Croft, 18, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing, was given five years for manslaughter and two years for arson, also running concurrently.During the trial, a pupil at Raum's former school, Bodmin College, told the court the boy had been tormented for six years.Timothy Mitchell, 18, said: "They pretty much bullied him throughout his whole time in school. I saw it going on in college and on the estate where I live. They would get into his face and try and provoke him to fight back, but he never would. They would push him and call him names â€“ they tortured him really."They used to call him 'mummy's boy' because his mother used to walk him to school to protect him. They used to give Mary abuse when she was with Raum and when she was on her own. She would be called a fat bitch and would get followed on the estate. She never reacted to it."The court heard that Raum was bullied because of his acne and clothes.
