A man accused of murder was freed at the Old Bailey yesterday after a hitman refused to testify against him.As Robert Ward, 47, of Banstead, Surrey, left court, relatives of murdered newsagent Geoffrey Small shouted abuse and had to be held back by police. The hitman, Allan Savage, 73, who was jailed for life in February for the 1976 shooting of Mr Small, has been given a further 18-month sentence for contempt of court, to run concurrently. Judge Martin Stephens told him: "You have steadfastly refused to give evidence for no good reason. Immense trouble, expense and worry has been caused to many people and you have delivered a serious blow to the integrity of the criminal court." His claim that he feared for his safety in prison if he became a "grass" was earlier rejected by the judge. Savage told a detective he "did not see why two people should be punished for the murder" and said the Smalls "would get over it in time". The murder had gone undetected until last year when Savage confessed after a television appeal by Mr Small's daughter, Cathy. She had to be helped from the court after the judge discharged the jury and formally recorded a not guilty verdict against Ward. Savage had told police that Ward, a businessman, had been "upset" about an affair between Mr Small and Ward's mother, Jane. After being freed, Ward, who has described Savage as "delusional", said: "I feel very sad for the Small family. I never had anything to do with Geoffrey Small's murder. I liked him very much." Police said the investigation into the shooting was now closed.
