The jury in the inquest into the death of Mark Duggan - whose killing sparked widespread riots in England in the summer of 2011 - has been told they may consider a conclusion of unlawful killing.Mr Duggan, a father-of-four, was shot by police marksmen who stopped the taxi he was travelling in in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011.The inquest into his death began 12 weeks ago at the High Court in London, and judge Keith Cutler told the panel of 10 to reach their decisions "calmly and coolly on the evidence" as he began summing up the case.He told them they may reach one of three possible conclusions: that the 29-year-old was killed unlawfully, lawfully, or reach an open conclusion.The judge said the jury should reach their decisions "on the evidence and the evidence alone"."This is not a trial, it is not a method of apportioning blame on an individual," he said."It's a public method of establishing facts, and getting to the truth."Please come to your decisions and conclusions calmly and coolly on the evidence."Judge Cutler told the jury they should consider a number of questions, including whether or not Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) "did the best they reasonably could have done" to react to the intelligence that Mr Duggan had bought a gun from his associate Kevin Hutchinson-Foster.He also asked them to consider whether or not Duggan was stopped by police in a location in which they could have "minimised recourse to lethal force"; whether or not Duggan was in possession of a gun; how the gun that was found ended up in a grassy area near where he was shot, and did Duggan have the gun in his hand when he was shot.The judge outlined the three conclusions - formerly known as verdicts - the jury could reach.He reminded them that in order to reach a conclusion of unlawful killing there was a higher standard of proof: that the jury must be sure, "beyond all reasonable doubt", that Duggan was unarmed."You have to be sure that the act was unlawful, that is that it was not done in lawful self-defence, or the defence of another, or to prevent crime," he told them."If you are sure that he did not have a gun in his hand, then tick the box 'unlawful killing'," he said.He then reminded the panel they could use the "balance of probabilities" standard for the other eventualities."If you conclude that it was more likely than not that he did have a gun in his hand then tick the box accordingly, and go on to consider lawful killing or an open conclusion."Judge Cutler then went on to begin summing up the evidence.The inquest has heard police believed Duggan was a leading member of the Tottenham Man Dem gang.
