Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAThe body of Andrew Cunningham, 52, was found at the Windmill Business Centre in Wandsworth, south-west London, at 8am on Wednesday, police said today.A postmortem pronounced the cause of death as multiple stab wounds to head, neck and chest.The Metropolitan police said Cunningham, who lived in a caravan on the site on Riverside Road, also had "non-fatal injuries to other parts of his body".Police said they were not discussing the details of his other injuries for operational reasons, although the Sun reported that his genitals were mutilated.Police have denied the paper's report that Cunningham was attacked by a mob.His body has not been formally identified but police are satisfied it is Cunningham.Detective Chief Inspector Nick Scola, who is leading the murder investigation, said it was possible the victim's sex offences were a motive for the attack.Appealing for information to track down his killers, Scola said: "It is the case that Andrew had previously been on the sex offenders register for an offence he committed in 2000. Although we're keeping an open mind, it is clearly possible that this was a motive for his murder."Regardless of who he was or what he may have done, Andrew was the victim of a vicious assault which ended his life."We're still examining CCTV from the area and working to establish the number of suspects involved. However, there is nothing to suggest this was a mob attack."Donald Findlater, the director of child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said: "There are some 35,000 registered sex offenders in England and Wales, the majority of whom are being managed safely within our communities, but alleged mob action of this nature will make some of those offenders terrified and I fear it may drive some underground and into isolation which is when they become dangerous to children."Findlater said the incident highlighted the danger of giving the public access to information about sex offenders. "When something like this happens, there are no winners and certainly children are not made safer because one individual has been killed," he said."I completely understand why people do and should feel appalled by the harm that sex offenders cause, but members of the public taking the law into their own hands is not the way to deal with the situation."
