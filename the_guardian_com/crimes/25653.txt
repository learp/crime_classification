Police are appealing for witnesses following the "brutal" rape of a 12-year-old girl in east London.Metropolitan police detectives say that sometime after midnight last Saturday the girl was taken by three male teenagers to the end of a residential street in Leyton and attacked.The men, aged 17-19, are said to have carried out the rape between 12.15am and 12.30am on Hibbert Road, not far from the site of an industrial estate.The victim, police say, managed to call a friend who came to the scene and they left together. The suspects then left the area.The first male is said to be 17, skinny, of mixed race, with a diamond stud in his left ear and a London accent, wearing "a black Puffa-style jacket with a hood, black chinos, black trainers", and called himself Mo.The second male was black, tall, with partly shaven hair, and wore black trousers and a red-and-blue shirt.A third black male who is reported not to have been involved in the rape itself had a moustache, wore a blueish hoodie and a red-and-blue cap and called himself Miles.Detective Inspector Simon Ellershaw, leading the investigation, said the girl had been brutally attacked: "This was a very nasty attack on a vulnerable girl just 12 years old by a group of older males who engaged her in conversation before leading her to a secluded area."I would appeal for anyone with information or any witnesses to please contact police as soon as possible."Anyone with information is asked to call the sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command on 0208 217 7408 or if you wish to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
