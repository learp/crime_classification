The collapse of a Â£6m murder trial at the Old Bailey today is just the first development since a House of Lords judgment last Wednesday that could see other trials aborted, prosecutions stymied and people convicted of serious crimes freed on appeal.John Yates, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, has described the ruling as "potentially disastrous" and predicted it could mean dozens of killers going free. The law lords' judgment has thrown into disarray attempts by police and prosecution to crack down on crime involving rival gangs by offering anonymity to witnesses who fear reprisals. Five law lords ruled that Iain Davis, convicted of killing two men after a New Year's Eve party in Hackney, east London, in 2002, was denied a fair trial because the three witnesses who identified him as the gunman gave evidence behind screens with their voices distorted and his lawyers were barred from asking about their identities. The judges, led by Lord Bingham, the senior law lord, said the common law and European human rights law required that a defendant should be able to confront his accusers if they were giving decisive evidence against him. It was for parliament and not the courts to deal with the problem of intimidated witnesses who refused to testify. The judgment casts doubt on the safety of any convictions where the anonymous evidence was decisive in producing the guilty verdict and is expected to provoke a rash of appeals.Among the first beneficiaries of the ruling are expected to be the four men who were convicted of the murders of the teenagers Charlene Ellis and Letisha Shakespeare in Birmingham in January 2003.Errol Robinson, solicitor for two of the men, Marcus Ellis, 24, and Rodrigo Simms, 20, said he would refer their convictions, which depended largely on anonymous evidence, to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.Malcolm Swift, Davis's QC, said the practice of relying on anonymous witnesses had grown "remarkably" in recent years. "In the past 18 months I would say that, probably, three out of five murder cases I've been involved in have had one or more anonymous witnesses."In one forthcoming case, he added, "the crown has got wind of what was coming up in the Lords and has dropped an anonymous witness".Jack Straw, the justice minister, has promised urgent legislation to deal with the problem. But any legislation will have to comply with the common law and the right to a fair trial under European human rights law, limiting his room for manoeuver.
