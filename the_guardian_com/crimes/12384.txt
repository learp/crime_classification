The attorney general’s office is to review the three-month suspended sentence given to the former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis for indecent assault.Travis, 69, was spared jail on Friday after being convicted of groping a 22-year-old woman in 1995 during the making of the BBC’s Mrs Merton Show.The judge, Anthony Leonard QC, said the offence was worthy of a custodial sentence but decided to suspend a three-month term after considering the health and financial impact of the case on Travis.However, within hours of the sentencing at Southwark crown court in London four members of the public complained to the attorney general’s office that it was “unduly lenient”.A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office confirmed on Monday that it would consider whether to refer the sentence to the court of appeal.She said: “We have asked the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] to send us more information on this case, so that one of the law officers (the attorney or solicitor general) can decide whether the sentence should be referred to the court of appeal for review.”The attorney general, Jeremy Wright MP, and solicitor general, Robert Buckland MP, have until 24 October to decide whether to refer the case to the higher court.Any member of the public is able to complain about sentences handed down in England and Wales using the unduly lenient scheme.Travis was convicted last Tuesday by a majority jury verdict. Appearing under his real name, David Griffin, he was found not guilty of another indecent assault charge, and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of sexual assault. The latter two charges were being retried after a jury was unable to reach verdicts on them and other similar allegations at an initial trial in February.The charge on which Travis was convicted, which did not feature in the first trial, involved an assault in January 1995 against a woman, then aged 22, who was working on the Mrs Merton Show.Sentencing Travis, Leonard said: “When you gave evidence you described what she was alleging took place as a nasty thing to do. You were right in your assumption, but it was more than that, it was an unpleasant and intentional sexual assault.“You took advantage of a young woman in a vulnerable position whose job it was to look after you … I judge that you believed she would not make a fuss and you were right about that too.“In my judgment the aggravating feature in this case is the disparity in your age and status compared to that of the victim, which made her vulnerable to your advances.”Outside court, Travis said he was mortified to be convicted of one count and said it was of no comfort to be acquitted of others.
