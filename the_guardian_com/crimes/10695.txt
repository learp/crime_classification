The government's regime for managing offenders in the community came under renewed scrutiny today after it emerged that four of Mary-Ann Leneghan's killers had been under probation supervision.Her horrific murder is now another on the increasingly long list of serious crimes committed by offenders who were supposed to have been kept on a tight leash by the authorities.It is likely to lead to further tough questions for the probation service and the home secretary, Charles Clarke, who was already examining the need for changes to the system in the wake of a spate of similar cases.The highest-profile was the killing of wealthy financier John Monckton in Chelsea by brutal robber Damien Hanson and convicted drug dealer Elliot White.Hanson murdered Monckton during a robbery at his luxury home only three months after being let of jail halfway through a 12-year sentence for attempted murder.He had rarely been out of prison since the age of 14 and an official assessment calculated that his chances of re-offending were 91%, yet his case was managed at the lowest risk level following his release.White was on bail at the time of the robbery, awaiting a court appearance on heroin and cocaine charges, for which he was later sentenced to three years.Last month, an official inquiry by the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, concluded there had been "collective failure" in their supervision.His report found that the handling of the pair by the authorities illustrated "the exact opposite of effective offender management".It revealed that in Hanson's case, he was not referred to one of the multi-agency public protection teams used to manage the most dangerous offenders, despite the fact that "he quite clearly should have been".Furthermore, it was "utterly extraordinary" that he had been required to report to a probation office inside an exclusion zone.Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the probation union Napo, said that at the time of Monckton's murder, London's probation service had been in "financial chaos" and was experiencing a recruitment freeze.In the wake of the report, Mr Clarke said there had been "unacceptable failings" in terms of public protection. He promised to report back to the House of Commons later this year with a series of proposals to restore confidence in the system.But details of another similar case emerged only last week when crack addict Yusuf Bouhaddaou was jailed for life for the murder of teacher Robert Symons at his home in Chiswick, west London.Symons, 45, was stabbed in the heart with a large kitchen knife when he disturbed the burglar in the home he shared with his wife, Linda Davies, and their two young daughters.Just five weeks before the murder, Bouhaddaou had been released on licence from a five-and-a-half-year sentence that included four years for a series of domestic burglaries.Bouhaddaou said he had committed a number of burglaries after leaving prison to fund his drug addiction. He was under the supervision of the probation service at the time he killed Symons.Another recent high-profile case was the murder of the Nottingham jeweller Marian Bates.Last year an official report criticised probation workers and an electronic tagging company for a catalogue of errors in their supervision of Peter Williams, the teenager convicted of her murder.They failed to act quickly enough when his behaviour went off the rails in the weeks before her killing, probation inspectors said. He had repeatedly breached his curfew order and even removed the electronic tag that was supposed to restrict his movements, yet little was done.Williams - a cocaine addict who had been in trouble with the law since the age of 11 for offences including burglary and indecent assault - had been released from a young offenders institution on licence only 20 days before Bates's murder.The 64-year-old was shot dead in her family shop as she tried to shield her daughter Xanthe from armed robbers.Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP) found that in that time, Williams had failed to attend a string of meetings with youth offending and drug workers, education staff and the police. These were breaches of the terms of his licence that could have resulted in his return to custody.Â· Neville Dean is the Press Association's crime correspondent
