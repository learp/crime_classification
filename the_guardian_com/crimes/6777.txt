A City banker and his wife convicted of one of the biggest insider trading deals brought to a UK court have been ordered to repay more than £1.5m.Christian and Angie Littlewood were each told to return £767,000 gained illegally, following a confiscation order brought by the Financial Services Authority (FSA).The former senior investment banker, 37, was jailed for three years and four months last year for tipping off his wife to invest hundreds of thousands of pounds in companies when he learned their share price was set to increase.His wife, 39, who traded under her Chinese name Siew Yoon Lew, was spared jail and given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years.The order will be paid out of funds and assets which were restrained by the court on the FSA's application at the time of the Littlewoods' arrest. If the sums are not paid within six months, the Littlewoods must serve an extra three years in jail.The couple have also been banned from carrying out any function in relation to any regulated activity under the Financial Services and Markets Act.Family friend Helmy Omar Sa'aid, 34, also admitted his part in the illegal trading between 2000 and 2008 in a number of different London Stock Exchange and Aim-listed shares.He was jailed for two years and ordered to pay £640,000 in confiscation at a hearing last year.Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at FSA, said: "Insider dealers are motivated by greed and a belief that they can make easy money at the expense of others."As a result of their actions the Littlewoods have not only received custodial sentences and seen their reputations and future careers destroyed, they have also paid a sum in confiscation significantly greater than the profit from the indicted trading alone."The orders made today, coupled with the sentences previously imposed, should make it clear that insider dealing does not pay."
