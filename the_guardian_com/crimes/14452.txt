The mother of Baby P and two men will appear at the Old Bailey today to be sentenced for his death.Defence lawyers will address Judge Stephen Kramer before he passes sentence tomorrow. The 27-year-old woman, her 32-year-old partner, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, and lodger Jason Owen, 37, each face up to 14 years in jail.The two men were convicted in November last year of causing, or allowing, the 17-month-old's death in August 2007.Baby Peter's mother pleaded guilty to the offence and could be entitled to up to a third off her sentence. The term will also be reduced by the 21 months she has already spent in custody.Her boyfriend, whom Peter called "dad", faces a life sentence after being convicted on 1 May of raping a two-year-old girl. The child, like Peter, had been on the child protection register maintained by Haringey council in north London.Baby Peter's mother was cleared of a child cruelty charge towards the girl.The girl, now four, became the youngest person to give evidence at the court when she was cross-examined by the defence counsel. At one stage, when asked if she had told the truth, she appeared to be upset, but smiled when told her ordeal was over.All three defendants have been warned by the judge that they face substantial prison sentences.Peter was found dead in his blood-spattered cot with a broken back and fractured ribs. He had 50 injuries despite being visited more than 60 times by health and social workers during the final eight months of his life.His mother was arrested twice after bruises were spotted but not charged after lying to officials.Peter suffered months of ill-treatment, culminating in his death after a punch in the mouth knocked one of his teeth down his throat.Haringey council, the police and health services have admitted making mistakes. A doctor who failed to spot Peter's broken back was suspended and is being investigated by the General Medical Council.The government has since ordered an overhaul of child care services and has injected an extra Â£58m into the care system.A second inquiry into Peter's death by the Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board concluded: "The actions of the protecting professions involved with Baby P were lacking in urgency, lacking in thoroughness and insufficiently challenging to the child's mother."
