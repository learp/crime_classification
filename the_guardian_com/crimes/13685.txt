Shafilea Ahmed's mother, Farzana, is seeking leave to appeal against her conviction for murdering her daughter, it has emerged.Farzana Ahmed, 49, and her husband Iftikhar, 52, were jointly convicted of murdering their 17-year-old daughter Shafilea following a three-month trial at Chester crown court in August. Both parents were jailed for a minimum of 25 years by Mr Justice Roderick Evans following their murder conviction.Their daughter was killed at her home in Warrington, Cheshire, almost nine years ago in front of her younger siblings after she resisted her parents' calls for an arranged marriage with a suitor in Pakistan, drinking bleach in an apparent cry for help. Her badly decomposed remains were found by a flooded river in Cumbria five months after her disappearance.The prosecution said she was murdered because she had brought shame on the family as a result of her western lifestyle. For nine years, the couple denied any involvement in their daughter's death, claiming she had run away from home. They were arrested after another daughter, Alesha, helped to organise an armed robbery at the family home in August 2010, and later told police she saw her parents kill her sister. She told the court that her mother had issued the command: "Just finish it here" before both parents forced a carrier bag into Shafilea's mouth, blocking her airways.But midway through the murder trial, Farzana Ahmed unexpectedly changed her version of events, in effect pointing the finger at her husband, saying he was involved in a single, violent attack on their daughter on the night she went missing in September 2003. She told the court that as far as she was aware, Shafilea was safe and he asked her never to question him about it again if she valued her life and that of her children. In July, when she changed her story, the couple were remanded in custody as one parent was testifying against the other.The Crown Prosecution Service said the court of appeal had received an application from Farzana Ahmed. The grounds for appeal have not been made public.
