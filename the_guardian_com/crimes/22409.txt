A hedge fund manager who promised returns of 11% a month to his clients was jailed for four and a half years yesterday for defrauding scores of investors out of £15m.Instead of investing the cash, Marc Duchesne, 47, used it to fund a lavish lifestyle. At his homes in London, Duchesne kept a Ferrari Enzo, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, a Bentley Arnage and several Hummer jeeps. With the money invested in his hedge fund, Benchmark Asset Management, he bought a speedboat for a friend and spent £60,000 on cosmetic dentistry to give himself a Hollywood smile. He spent £22,000 on cigars alone and £1m on antiques for a penthouse in Canary Wharf, east London.But sentencing him at Southwark crown court yesterday, the judge, Michael Gledhill, said the investors who lost millions had only themselves to blame "by accepting the promises made to them".Duchesne, who pleaded guilty to a series of fraud charges including conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to obtain money by deception, was banned from being a company director for 10 years. Gledhill told him: "You are a good conman and a good fraudster." Duchesne had changed his name from Spinks, and had been given a suspended 14-month jail sentence in Switzerland for a string of frauds. When he set himself up in London he sought out clients with high net assets who were taken in by his promise of huge returns on their investments. Stephen Winberg, prosecuting, said: "Investors hand over their money to the managers on the basis of trust. They are not told what their funds are being invested in. Managers are very secretive."Investors became suspicious in December 2005 when they stopped receiving statements, and Duchesne was arrested in June 2006.
