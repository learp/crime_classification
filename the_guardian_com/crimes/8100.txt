Now clearly, interrogating innocent Austrian tourists and deleting their holiday snaps isn't going to do wonders for either our tourist industry or our record on civil liberties.Poor Klaus and Loris Matza were simply doing what tourists do, hanging out in Walthamstow, taking photos of Vauxhall bus station ("We like to go to places not visited by other tourists"), when they intercepted by a policeman who promptly wiped their camera's memory card.But what about the family in Poole, Dorset, who were tracked by the local council who doubted their claim that they lived in a school's catchment area. Or Derby, Bolton, Gateshead and Hartlepool councils who have admitted using surveillance to "investigate dog fouling"?No more, perhaps, because Jacqui Smith announced last week that the use of such powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act will be subject to a government review.This might go some way to deflecting another article comparing Britain in 2009 to Honecker's Germany, but, on the other hand, isn't it a good thing that someone is trying to stop middle-class families with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement from fiddling the school system?Or that someone is trying to force dog owners to pick up after their dogs. I say this as a dog owner, but who wouldn't welcome a CCTV camera in their local park linked to an instant armed response unit that springs into action every time an illegal pit bull looks as if it might open its bowels?There's a question of resources, obviously. When my brother's car was broken into in London last week, I was amazed that his first reaction was to call the police and expect them to come out (he lives in the country). And I was even more amazed when they actually did – a crime reference over the phone is what we're more used to around our way.Crimes investigated under the act include littering, illegal street trading, taxi overcharging and taking the fairy lights from a Christmas tree. None of these are exactly hanging offences, and, given the choice, I'd prefer my local force to be out chasing murderers, but make no mistake, they do impact on our quality of life, every day.The Lib Dems call the act a "snooper's charter", and maybe it is. But in the absence of the kind of society which prohibits its members from nicking fairy lights, or leaving great piles of dog crap where it happens to fall, or – let's be inclusive here – locating a bin for their empty soy-milk latte cup, maybe it's the kind of charter we actually deserve?
