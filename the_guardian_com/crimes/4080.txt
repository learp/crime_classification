Some inmates in youth jails hardly ever get out into the sunlight and fresh air and are living in conditions which fall short of international standards, according to research by the Howard League for Penal Reform. The claim that some youths only got to breathe fresh air when they were moved between units was made in the first two of a series of research studies into conditions inside young offenders' institutions. The inquiries at Lancaster Farms, near Lancaster, and Castington, Northumberland, claimed that boys suffered widespread bullying, lack of specialist help, and were given little preparation for their release. The Howard League said that 55% of inmates at Castington said they had been involved in a bullying incident in the previous week. Some officers were dismissive to children who harmed themselves with one officer referring to a boy who persistently cut himself as "Slasher". At Lancaster Farms the penal reformers were alarmed to find how little access there was to daylight and the open air: "Boys only have access to fresh air when they are moving between units. The lack of access to natural air and sunlight is likely to impact on the boys' mental and physical wellbeing," said their report. "This lack of access is very worrying. Adolescents have a lot of energy that needs to be burned up or it may manifest itself in frustration and aggression." Charlotte Day of the Howard League said the reports showed that since the youth justice board had taken over the running of institutions for under 18s last year there had been improvements but standards still fell short of those laid down in the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. "Children in prison may have committed crimes but they are still children. They should be entitled to the same level of care and provided for children in every other setting." Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, said that he did not believe there was a prison service anywhere in the world which could better British standards of care for "this frequently volatile and unpredictable age group". He said that Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, had said that Lancaster Farms was a "centre of excellence" and had also praised Castington.

Twenty-eight detainees have caught the disease during the outbreak which began on July 27. Some of those who have contracted the disease have been released from the detention centre and all non-essential movements have also been stopped.
