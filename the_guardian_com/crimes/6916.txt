Police will be given new powers to crack down on drugs as a new survey shows Britain has the highest cocaine use in Europe.Under a new drugs bill published today, police will have greater powers to close crack houses and to automatically treat people caught in possession of a certain amount of a drug as dealers.Drug dealing to children or near schools could also lead to tougher sentences.At a press conference in the canteen of Slough police station, Tony Blair said the meaures would "bear down further on organised crime and also the street dealers who peddle the misery of drugs".The measures come as a new pan-European survey shows that Britain and Spain have the highest proportion of cocaine users in the European Union.The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction 2004 report found that 2% of all adults in the UK and Spain reported recent cocaine use, close to figures for the US, compared to less than 1% across the EU as a whole.Alongside the crackdown, today's bill seeks to force drug users into accepting help in a bid to break the link between addiction and crime.The home secretary, David Blunkett, said he had a duty to protect "decent people, but also to help addicts try to get off drugs and out of crime"."But I'm not soft on drugs," he wrote in today's Daily Mirror. "We'll help those who want help, both for their sake and that of their families and the communities they destroy, but we must come down like a tonne of bricks on those who refuse help or who peddle drugs."He said the new Serious Organised Crime Agency would hunt down the large drug-smuggling operations.The bill will also allow a suspect's "unreasonable" refusal to consent to an intimate body search to count against them in court. Magistrates will be given the power to remand into police custody for up to a further 192 hours those who swallow drugs until the evidence becomes available again.The Anti-Social Behaviour Act will also be amended to give police the power to enter premises such as crack houses to issue a closure notice.The announcement of the details of the bill follows talks between the prime minister and police officers last month. Downing Street said the new measures were a direct response to their concerns and built on reforms to rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of law-abiding citizens and victim of crime.The government insists its efforts to tackle drugs are working. No 10 said nearly 1,500 offenders were entering treatment each month, and crime was falling faster in those areas where drug intervention programmes were in place. Those programmes will now be extended.A Downing Street spokesman said that by 2008, 1,000 offenders would be entering treatment every week.
