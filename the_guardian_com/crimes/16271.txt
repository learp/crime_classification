Two brothers pleaded guilty today to killing a wealthy banker after he tried to intervene to stop another man being beaten up during a night out.Tom Cowles, 22, and his brother Ben, 21, both of Norwich, admitted the manslaughter of Frank McGarahan during an incident in the city in the early hours of 28 September last year.McGarahan, 45, of Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, died in hospital after suffering head injuries, Norwich crown court heard.Both brothers had denied murderbut admitted affray, and Ben Cowles also admitted assaulting another man.McGarahan worked for Barclays and ran an arm of the bank which managed the assets of some of the world's richest people.Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said McGarahan, plus a cousin and a brother, had witnessed an assault on another man in central Norwich at about 3am.Dennis said they had stepped in to help, then been attacked.He said McGarahan had been knocked to the floor within three minutes of intervening, after being punched to the head and put in a headlock. Dennis said the banker, a father of two, lapsed into a coma and did not recover."Both young men took part in an unnecessary and joint attack on Frank McGarahan, his brother and cousin," said Dennis."In the circumstances we submit [they] bravely intervened when many others would have stepped back." Dennis said McGarahan and his relatives were in Norwich for a family christening, and trouble flared after they had enjoyed a night out in the city.He said Ben and Tom Cowles lived in Norwich with their father. Ben Cowles was a pipe fitter and Tom Cowles a builder.The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, told the court that he thought the prosecution's decision to accept a guilty plea to manslaughter was "sensible and appropriate". But he said he understood how the decision to accept the plea would have been difficult for prosecution lawyers and for McGarahan's family.McGarahan's brother, Tony, was in court to hear the pleas entered and evidence outlined.
