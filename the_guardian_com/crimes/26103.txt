A former nightclub bouncer, who was first banned from driving 20 years ago and has since become known as Britain's most convicted motorist, was yesterday jailed for his 51st driving offence.Jamie Manderson, 35, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was sentenced to eight months in prison and a five-year driving ban after being caught by police driving without insurance at the weekend.Manderson, who has been repeatedly before the courts for driving offences, has never held a licence. Norman Ames, Swindon's chief magistrate, told Manderson his driving offences were the worst in the country. "You have a flagrant disregard for the law. This is the worst case of driving while disqualified, in total, we have come across," he said.Manderson was 15 years old when he was first banned from driving in 1988 and has gone on to register 51 offences of driving while disqualified and without insurance. His solicitor, Rob Ross, described him as a "likeable idiot" with a serious car addiction. "He still has a problem with motor cars. He always will," he told the court.Ten years ago, Manderson ran over a 12-year-old cyclist while driving a getaway car from a robbery. He also has earlier convictions for aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving in 2004 and 2005 and is awaiting trial on two further charges of driving while disqualified allegedly committed in February. When he was picked up by police at the weekend, Manderson was serving a community-based sentence for other car-related matters. He was jailed for 24 weeks with a further eight weeks added to that from an earlier suspended jail sentence, bringing the total to 32 weeks.
