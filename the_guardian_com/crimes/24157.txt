The Metropolitan police has defended itself against accusations of errors after a woman who rang 999 repeatedly to warn officers she could harm someone was allowed to remain at large and stab two strangers in the street, one fatally.An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report into Nicola Edgington, who murdered Sally Hodkin, 58, and seriously injured Kerry Clark, 22, in south-east London in October 2011, said police should have checked Edgington's details on the police national computer (PNC).Had they done so they would have learned she stabbed her mother to death in 2005 and was thus a potentially immediate risk.The report concluded that while officers who took Edgington voluntarily to a hospital, and those who answered her subsequent 999 calls, did not breach conduct rules they missed opportunities to prevent the attacks later the same day in Bexleyheath, after Edgington walked out of the hospital.The IPCC's findings prompted front page headlines critical of police "blunders". But in a strongly worded response, Commander Neil Basu, the Met's area commander for south-east London, insisted a PNC check alone would not have stopped Edgington.Police had taken Edgington the A&E department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, he said, where she was to be seen by mental health staff.He continued: "The officers left her in a place of safety to be cared for by professionals trained to deal with people with mental health issues, and the IPCC investigation found that this was the correct course of action."Edgington made a number of calls to police from hospital asking for officers to attend whilst she was in the mental health assessment unit waiting to be assessed. She was reassured that she was in a place of safety and would be assessed by medical professionals. Police control room staff made contact with the hospital who advised that the hospital security had the matter in hand and that there was no need for police attendance."While "with the benefit of hindsight" a check with the PNC would have given police useful information about Edgington, when the officers dealt with her in person she was co-operative and actively seeking medical help, Basu said.He added: "The officers acted on the facts in front of them, which they do on a regular basis every day. A PNC check alone would not have prevented the actions that Edgington subsequently took."The IPCC concluded their investigation and no recommendations were made for either misconduct or learning for the MPS. They also identified that no police officer or staff breached the code of conduct or MPS policies. Despite this we will of course review the findings of the IPCC investigation."Edgington, 32, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey on Monday with a minimum term of 37 years. While the killing of her mother saw her admit manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, after which she was released in 2009, the prosecution in her trial for the murder of Hodkin and attempted murder of Clark argued she in fact had a borderline personality disorder rather than schizophrenia.Edgington's condition began to deteriorate during 2011, and on the day of the attacks, 10 October, police took her voluntarily to the hospital, where she made the 999 calls. The record read: "Caller stating she is a dangerous schizophrenic and if police do not arrive on scene asap she is going to harm somebody."The IPCC report is not considering the actions of hospital or psychiatric staff involved in the case.
