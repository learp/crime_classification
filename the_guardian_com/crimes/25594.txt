Jurors today heard a neighbour of Jill Dando describe how she found the TV presenter slumped in her doorway covered in blood.Helen Doble said that she found Dando she had stopped breathing and it was obvious that she was dead.Doble's statement was read out at the Old Bailey trial of Barry George, 48, who denies murdering Dando in April 1999.The witness was on her way to the shops when she made the discovery and called the emergency services.Doble, who also worked in television, said she had often stopped and talked to the Crimewatch presenter, and on that day paused to see if she was there."As I looked into the doorway I saw a woman slumped in the doorway," she said. "It took me a few seconds to realise it was Jill Dando."I saw there was a lot of blood around her face and clothes. She was slumped awkwardly with her head resting on the front door."The front door was closed. I saw the left hand was blue. I saw she was wearing her engagement ring."Doble said the TV presenter's open handbag was by her body."I was very frightened by what I saw. I could not see her breathing. She was a strange colour. To me it was obvious she was dead."I thought she had been stabbed. I came to this conclusion because of the amount of blood."Another witness, Rosario Torres, told the court how she saw George later that day in an "agitated" state.Torres, who worked at a centre for the disabled called Hafad, recalled him arriving there, smartly dressed in a yellow shirt, at around lunchtime.She said he arrived without an appointment with a "bunch of papers" in his hand, saying: "I need help, I need help, I need help.""This man was very stressed out and kind of agitated. He said 'Nobody wants to see me, my GP doesn't want to see me'."He returned to the centre two days later, she said."He mentioned 'I have just been taking some flowers to Jill Dando's house'," Torres told the court.
