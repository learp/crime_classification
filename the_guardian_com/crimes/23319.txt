Police are searching for an £800,000 sapphire stolen during a burglary in London.As well as the gem, which is said to be about the size of a penny, a £39,000 sapphire-and-diamond necklace was taken. The jewels belonged to an unnamed Russian heiress who is in her 20s. She had been storing them temporarily in the safe of the Moving Pictures publishing company in London as she prepared for her wedding. The necklace, which she was to wear at the ceremony, and the 120-carat sapphire, which she planned to sell, were usually kept with relatives in Washington. Police only released details yesterday, more than a month after the publishing company's offices were ransacked during the burglary. They said the safe had been attacked during the raid. The victims of the crime and police have only been able to narrow the time when the burglary took place down to some point over the weekend of August 8. A police source said: "This young woman is absolutely devastated. She wasn't able to wear the necklace at her wedding, and the sapphire had been in her family for as long as she could remember." The sapphire is described as being a dark blue, oval shaped mixed-cut stone. Detective Sergeant Colette Smyth of Kentish Town's burglary squad said: "We believe that this sapphire is unique. There is no other like it in the world." The diamond necklace, which was also taken, has a floral design, and is set in white gold. The raid on the publishing company's safe qualifies as one of the biggest gem thefts since five would-be robbers attempted to steal the 203 carat Millennium Star diamond from the Millennium Dome in 2000.
