A building society manager who took more than £250,000 from her family and friends has been jailed for four years.Denise Salter, 57, of Pilley, Barnsley, withdrew large sums from the accounts of people she knew to help pay her sons' debts, South Yorkshire police said.Following a complaint from a customer in October, Yorkshire Building Society's fraud team uncovered a number of suspicious transactions, which were reported to police.The accounts involved belonged to close relatives and other people who had considered themselves to be friends of Salter, police said. She was arrested in December and charged with 12 offences of theft, fraud and forgery spanning from 1993 to 2012.Salter pleaded guilty to the offences at Sheffield magistrates court last month. Sentencing her at Sheffield crown court on Tuesday, the judge Paul Watson QC gave her credit for the guilty plea but said her offending spanned 19 years, including while in a position of trust as manager of the building society's Sheffield branch.He ordered her to pay £2,200 in compensation to one of her victims. Police said other victims had been compensated by her former employer.Detective Sergeant Karl Saxton said: "We are satisfied that the conviction reflects the offending. Our enquiries identified that Salter used a substantial amount of money to help her sons, who had accumulated debts, and not to fund an extravagant lifestyle. Things escalated from there, leading to the betrayal of trust of her friends and family."Police said they were not seeking a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act as there were no available assets. However, Salter does have a pension fund, and police said the building society was taking steps to recover the money it paid to compensate victims.
