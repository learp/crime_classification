A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of pregnant teenager Amy Williams, police said today.The suspect, whose personal details have not been released, was detained yesterday afternoon.Amy, who was 14 and six months pregnant, was discovered strangled in a churchyard in the Madeley area of Telford, Shropshire, on Monday morning.A West Mercia police spokesman said in a statement: "A man is in custody in connection with the death of Amy Williams."The man was arrested yesterday afternoon. Police inquiries continue and we remain keen to hear from anyone with information which may help the inquiry."The man's age, identity and details of where he lives would not be being released, the spokesman added.The arrest came just hours after Amy's father and sisters made an emotional plead for help in catching her killer.Mark Williams, Amy's 17-year-old sister, Kelly, and half-sister, Katie Neal, 19, said the whole family had been "devastated" and was in shock at what had happened. Amy was last seen at about 9pm on Boxing Day after leaving a family party near her home in the Sutton Hill area of Telford. She was alone and had seemed in good spirits.An elderly man putting flowers on his wife's grave at St Michael's church in Madeley discovered her partially-clothed body at about 9am the next day.Her clothes - a pink tracksuit and white Kappa trainers - as well as a set of house keys have still not been found.A post-mortem examination established she had been strangled although detectives said there was no obvious sign of a struggle.The results of further tests to determine whether she had been sexually assaulted are due next week.The continued appeal for information centres around the 12-hour "black hole" between Amy leaving the party and her body being discovered.Det Ch Insp Dave Morgan, leading the murder hunt, said yesterday: "Those 12 hours are currently a mystery."It is vital we piece together what Amy was doing and who she was with during those 12 hours."She cannot simply have disappeared. We believe someone, several people perhaps, know where Amy was during those 12 hours."This information is absolutely crucial to our investigation."A number of people, including Amy's 16-year-old ex-boyfriend, have been interviewed following the discovery of her body, Mr Morgan confirmed.But he stressed they were being treated as witnesses to build up a picture of the teenager's life and movements on the night she died.
