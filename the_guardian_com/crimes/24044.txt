A couple who repeatedly deceived health professionals by swapping their twin babies to cover up unexplained injuries that led to one daughter's death have been convicted of child cruelty.Mohammed and Nafisa Karolia, of Blackburn, Lancashire, had denied abusing the seven-month-old baby girl, who died in June 2009. But they were convicted at Preston crown court following a five-week trial after jurors deliberated for less than six hours. Mr Justice Irwin, the trial judge, warned them they should expect a considerable jail term when they are sentenced in October.The court heard how the couple attempted to cover up the baby's unexplained injuries to social services and health visitors by swapping the babies when they called at the house. Neither child can be identified for legal reasons.Irwin said: "As you know, this was a bad case of child cruelty. However, I want to know as much as possible about it before deciding the length of sentence." He adjourned the case for pre-sentence and psychiatric reports.Joe Boyd, for the prosecution, said the identity swap was uncovered as a result of discrepancies in the head, weight and height measurements previously taken from the twins – known as Twin M and Twin A.Twin M died after suffering numerous unexplained injuries including fractures to the ribs, legs and arms and skull damage affecting the brain and central nervous system.She also had a mouth ulcer, unexplained scratching to the ears, bleeding in the eyes and injuries to the nose that were "unusual", with damaged tissue suggesting it had been pinched with equal force on both sides by a clasp or clip.The bone breakages were said to have taken place between 24 hours and six weeks before death, while a postmortem examination found she died of bronchopneumonia.In opening the case, the prosecutor said the crown did not seek to prove any maltreatment by the parents caused the baby's death but said they had never provided a plausible explanation for the injuries.The victim had only ever been out of their care for a matter of a few hours in her short life.He said theoretically the injuries sustained could have been accidental but the number, the timescale and the lack of explanation for them "leads inexplicably to the conclusion they were inflicted deliberately by one or both of the parents".Explaining the twin swap, he said: "Growth charts for both twins make it clear that the parents have at some stage swapped the babies. They have very probably done so to seek to conceal the mounting injuries being suffered by the child who died – always the bigger twin but, for some reason, rejected and abused by them."The couple tricked a number of visiting health professionals into thinking they were seeing Twin M. He added that neighbours had only ever seen the Karolias with one baby and there was nothing to indicate they had twins.When interviewed by police, Nafisa Karolia, 22, said she noticed nothing unusual about her daughter apart from a runny nose. Her 29-year-old husband echoed this.Detective Inspector Pete Broome, of Lancashire police, described the investigation as "one of the most extreme cases I have come across".He said: "I can only describe this as a bestial crime – that is what they are, beastly." He added the "surviving twin may never know who she really was at birth"."That must be the most corrosive aspect to come out of this case," he said. "The prospect of not doing anything to an injury like that to a child's nose is abhorrent and I cannot understand anybody worthy of the name parents could leave a child suffering in that manner."
