A toddler who was tortured by a couple employed to care for him was not protected despite his killers being known to child protection agencies, a report has found.Ryan Lovell-Hancox died from a brain injury he received at the home of Christopher Taylor and Kayley Boleyn in Bilston, West Midlands, in December 2008.Ryan's mother, Amy Hancox, who knew nothing of the abuse, Taylor and Boleyn were all "known" to statutory authorities, a serious case review by Wolverhampton's safeguarding children board found.Hancox paid Boleyn and her boyfriend Taylor Â£40 a week to look after her three-year-old son after realising she could not cope.The 21-year-old Hancox had mental health problems and was trying to decorate her flat.She thought Boleyn would provide her young son with the love and attention he needed.The women were cousins, had grown up together and Hancox had no reason not to trust the 19-year-old when she left Ryan at the flat she shared with Taylor, 25, in November 2008.A month later the child was in a coma in hospital, having suffered a massive brain haemorrhage. He died on Christmas Eve.Boleyn and Taylor were jailed for life for Ryan's murder at Wolverhampton crown court in July last year.The serious case review, which did not name the parties involved, identified failures by the police and probation service to record child protection issues relating to Taylor and Boleyn during 2005.Concluding that lessons could be learned from the tragedy, the report's author, Martin Burnett, also identified failings by Wolverhampton city council and a contractor providing the authority's leaving care service.Burnett told a news conference in Wolverhampton that the failings explained why the authorities had not realised Ryan was living with Taylor and Boleyn.He said: "The police should have recorded child protection concerns in relation to [Boleyn] in September 2005, and in October 2005 the probation service should have recorded the assessed child protection risk posed by [Taylor] and they should have passed the information to children's services."He added that the deficiencies in recording information did not directly cause the tragedy, but were significant in allowing Ryan to remain in his killers' care.He said: "A number of failings have been identified which, taken together, help to explain how this came about."In relation to [Boleyn] and [Taylor], records were deficient and did not properly show the background level of risk posed by them."The failure to keep proper records meant that when Taylor took Ryan with him to meet a probation officer in December 2008 "no alarm bells rang" and an opportunity was missed.The inquiry also established that a contractor providing Wolverhampton's leaving care service, which was monitoring Boleyn, failed to visit her often enough.Burnett noted: "If the contractor had visited [Boleyn] more frequently, it would have in all likelihood been clear that [Taylor] was living with her."It would probably also have become apparent that the child was living there too."The conclusion of the serious case review is that this child's death is a case from which lessons can be learned."Taylor and Boleyn's trial heard how Ryan's life was turned to "hell" as he was forced to live in squalor.The violence he suffered at the hands of the couple, who were both addicted to cannabis and alcohol, was not borne from a "flash of temper" but was sustained and horrific.The child was repeatedly beaten about the face, back and buttocks. His skull received 10 severe blows and he had more than 70 injuries to his body by the time he died.Two days before Ryan's death, his mother confronted Boleyn and Taylor at their home as she tried to see her son for what would have been the last time.But by this stage the boy had severe bruising to his face and they stopped her from entering the house.The couple even managed to see off a social worker the day Ryan was taken to hospital in a coma.
