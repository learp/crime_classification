A Home Office spokesman claims that the figures on certain knife-related violence incidents released over the weekend by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies are "a crude extrapolation of British Crime Survey figures" (Report, August 21).The inconclusiveness of the available statistics on knife-related violence is one of the main themes of our report, due out next month, from which the figures are taken. The report is based on an analysis of the best figures available in the public domain, figures largely collated and published by the Home Office. If its view is that more comprehensive and nuanced data are needed, the Home Office will not find itself in disagreement with the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies.In the interests of better-informed political and media debate on the causes of and solutions to knife-related violence, perhaps the Home Office should be supporting the production of more detailed and informative data. This would be a rather more constructive contribution to evidence-based policy making than merely seeking to attack serious-minded attempts, such as ours, to make sense of the data currently available.
