Police investigating the death of oil executive Carole Waugh have arrested a woman on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.Waugh, originally from Durham but living in London, had not been seen by her family since mid-April.Her body was found in a car at a garage in Lime Court, New Malden, south-west London, on 2 August, with a single stab wound.The Metropolitan police said the 61-year-old woman was in custody at a south London police station.Waugh was reported missing by her family on 7 May. She had lived and worked in Libya for a number of years, but returned to London in 2008 and regularly visited relatives in Durham and Cumbria.Her former boss, Stuart Anderson, told journalists she had fled Libya after being threatened by someone in Muammar Gaddafi's regime, but a Scotland Yard spokesman said inquiries were focused in London.Detectives said she met men through a variety of internet sites, including dating websites, and they were investigating the possibility that she might have been an escort.So far, 11 people have been arrested in connection with the inquiry into Waugh's disappearance.At least three women have tried to pose as her since she vanished, police said.Waugh's flat is in an affluent part of central London and her brother Chris previously said she was "very frugal and careful" with money.A second man was arrested on suspicion of murder on Thursday and is still being questioned by police. Rakesh Bhayani, 40, is due in court next month, facing three charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation worth about Â£280,000, following transactions associated with Waugh's identity.The other man, Nicholas Kutner, 47, was arrested on suspicion of murder and kidnap last week.Kutner also faces two charges relating to renting Waugh's property at Tressard Court and a fourth of unlawfully withdrawing funds from the 50-year-old's bank account.Kutner is also facing a fraud charge after being accused of pretending to be Waugh's brother Chris Waugh in a bid to sell her London home. He is in custody ahead of an appearance at Southwark crown court on Monday in connection with the charge.Scotland Yard has appealed for information on the car the body was found in, a blue Volkswagen Golf with the registration number W466 NHL.
