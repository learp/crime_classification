They are naturally very, very distressed. Our thoughts are with them at this very difficult time."Earlier a forces spokesman had confirmed the discovery. "At 9am this morning a couple walking their dogs found the body of a young woman in a roadside verge in Longwood Lane in the Failand area of north Somerset.""The area has been cordoned off and Longwood Lane has been closed at both ends by police, pending an examination of the scene by crime scene investigators."Ch Supt Stratford confirmed that a pathologist will be attending the scene, but said that as yet the identity of the body and cause of death are unknown.Yeates was last seen on 17 December, when she was recorded on CCTV buying a pizza at about 8.40pm in Clifton Village, Bristol, after an evening out with work colleagues. No trace of the pizza or its packaging was found in the flat she shared with her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, 27.The CCTV footage from the night she disappeared was released yesterday.Reardon reported her missing on Sunday night after returning to their flat in Clifton after a weekend in Sheffield visiting family.On Thursday, her parents, who live in Hampshire, made an emotional appeal for her return.Breaking down, her father, David, 63, said: "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat."Appealing to anyone who may be holding her, he said: "I've got to believe she's alive. She had so much life in her. If it turns out she isn't, I still want her back. I still want to hold her at least one last time. I just want her back".He added: "If she is dead, please tell somebody where she is. We want her back, whatever."
