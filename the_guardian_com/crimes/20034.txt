Tomorrow, an animal rights activist is due to sentenced for her part in a conspiracy to blackmail the commercial testing firm, Huntingdon Life Sciences.The case has attracted some controversy as the activist, Debbie Vincent, has claimed that she is a "scapegoat" targeted because detectives could not catch the "real culprits" who have terrorised the company and its suppliers.There has been criticism that the use of the blackmail conspiracy charge could be exploited to clamp down on legitimate protest (see more here, here and here).Her trial however has also shone a spotlight on how police used a particular undercover tactic to convict her.Using a pseudonym, a police officer went undercover and pretended to be a manager in a multinational firm's corporate security department. He passed himself off as a bona fide employee in meetings, emails and telephone calls.The deployment was part of an operation against the campaign known as Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac).For more than a decade, Shac has campaigned to close down Huntingdon Life Sciences on the grounds that the firm abuses thousands of animals.A key Shac tactic has been to target companies or individuals linked to Huntingdon to force them to cut their connections to the testing firm. These have included Huntingdon's customers or firms that supply Huntingdon.More than 10 SHAC campaigners have been jailed for conspiring to blackmail such companies. Read this, this, this and this for accounts of previous convictions.Since Shac started, details of companies associated with Huntingdon have been posted online.Prosecutors have described how these companies have been subjected to an array of menacing attacks in what they have called "a climate of fear".These have included spreading false allegations that employees were paedophiles, posting them threatening letters or hoax bombs, sending them tampons purportedly contaminated with HIV, and damaging the houses and cars of employees.â€¬Representatives of Shac have approached the companies to say that the intimidation would stop if the companies severed their links to Huntingdon.Last month, Vincent was convicted after prosecutors told her trial that she had been part of this conspiracy to threaten and intimidate Huntingdon's customers and suppliers.Prosecutors accepted that Vincent did not herself carry out any of these attacks. But they argued that she conspired with those who were, in order to promote Shac's campaign.Central to her conviction were her dealings with the pharmaceutical giant, Novartis - a firm that had come under attack. The attacks included daubing graffiti on the homes of directors, throwing paint-stripper on the cars of employees and in one instance, stealing the urn of a senior executive's mother.In 2009, Shac contacted Novartis to say that protests against them would end if they declared that they were no longer a Huntingdon customer.Novartis responded by opening up a secret channel of discussion with the campaign. Three meetings were held in London hotels during 2010.Vincent and another campaigner represented Shac at these meetings. Representing Novartis were two men from their corporate security department.One of them introduced himself as "James Adams", a special projects manager for Novartis. He was in reality a British police officer whose real name has not been disclosed.On and off for more than a year, he played the role of the Novartis security manager during the discussions between the two Shac representatives and the multinational.He kept up the pretence in a series of emails and telephone calls with Vincent. The subterfuge even extended to "Adams" sending internal emails in his role as special projects manager to the head of the Novartis security departmentDocuments aired in the trial indicate that "Adams" took the lead for Novartis during the exchanges with Vincent.She did not discover the collusion between Novartis and the police until it was disclosed just before her trial started in February this year. She says that his deployment was a sting operation, as the conversations at the meetings were "tailored and directed" by "Adams" to seek evidence to implicate her in illegal acts over which she had no control.The disclosure of his deployment to Vincent's trial, albeit at a late stage, contrasts with how police and prosecutors have in the past concealed the involvement of undercover police officers in the trials of campaigners - a practice that is now to be investigated by Mark Ellison QC to see if unsafe convictions have resulted."Adams" was unlike the (publicly-identified) undercover officers who infiltrated political activists in previous decades. He did not pretend to be an activist for years at a stretch with an elaborate false identity. His work was more like the short-term, SO10 deployments used to catch serious criminals such as drug-dealers and smugglers.The operation was run by the Metropolitan Police which hailed it as a triumph : "We secured a conviction in a major blackmail case following evidence given by an undercover officer at court."Debbie Vincent was part of a group of animal rights extremists with a track record for using violence, harassment and intimidation to prevent companies from going about their legitimate business.""The deployment was appropriately authorised and managed by senior officers. This case demonstrates the value of undercover policing and the way we operate within legislation to provide evidence in court."
