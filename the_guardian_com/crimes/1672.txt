The leader of a violent gang that terrorised the streets of Manchester was today jailed for a minimum of 39 years.Colin Joyce, the self-styled "general" of the Gooch gang, smirked as he was told he would reach retirment age before being considered for release.Sentencing 29-year-old Joyce and other members of the gang at Liverpool crown court, the judge, Mr Justice Langstaff, likened them to Al Capone."You were all involved in gang-related activity which is all too reminiscent of Al Capone and Chicago in the era of prohibition," he said."Manchester is not the wild west, but many of you treated its streets as if it were."Addressing the court himself, Joyce told the judge the trial had been a "circus" and said any sentence would not take away the "freedom and innocence" from "inside me".He was applauded by members of his gang in the dock to angry shouts from relatives of his victims.Moments later, the judge handed down two mandatory life sentences with a minimum 39-year term.Joyce and Lee Amos, 32, were both convicted of the drive-by killing of a mourner at the funeral of a man the former had murdered months earlier.The court heard that Joyce, whose trouser pockets were adapted to act as a gun holster, led the gang in dealing drugs, torturing street dealers who crossed them and targeting rivals.It culminated in the murders of Ucal Chin, 24, and 23-year-old Tyrone Gilbert, who had links to the rival Longsight Crew.Manchester gang violence erupted in 2007 after the pair were released on licence from jail terms for firearms offences.On 15 June, Chin was driving in south Manchester when he was ambushed by killers in a silver Audi. He was shot seven times with a converted Russian Baikal pistol.On 27 July, six weeks after Chin's death, on 27 July, Gilbert, a father of three, was attending Chin's funeral and the wake at the family home in Longsight.Shortly before midnight, Gooch gang members drove past in a Honda Legend, closely followed by a blue Audi and another silver car.The gathering of around 80 mourners was sprayed with gunfire from a Smith and Wesson revolver and a 9mm semi-automatic machine gun.Gilbert was killed by a single bullet to the chest.Also in the dock during the Â£5m, six-month trial were Narada Williams, 27, known as "Yardie", and his 26-year-old brother Ricardo; Hassan Shah, 25, and Aeeron Campbell, 25, all senior members of the gang.Aaron Alexander, 22, Ricci Moss, 21, Kayael Wint, 20, 25-year-old Gonoo Hussain and 18-year-old Tyler Mullings were lower-level footsoldiers, the court heard.All 11 gang members have now been found guilty of 26 of the 27 charges, which ranged from murder and gun possession to drug dealing.The jury failed to reach a verdict on one count of murder, relating to the death of Gilbert, on Amos.
