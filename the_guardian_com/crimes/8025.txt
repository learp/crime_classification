Relatives of victims of the 7 July bombings have urged the coroner at their inquest to recommend sweeping changes to the way the emergency services respond to major incidents, in the hope of saving lives.Lawyers for the relatives told the inquest that they had identified 33 areas where changes should be made to improve the police, fire brigade and ambulance response and to protect the public.They range from a call for first aid boxes to be kept on underground trains and specialist stretchers to be placed at tube stations, to a new system to alert emergency workers when the current on an underground line is switched off.The families of the 52 victims of the 2005 attack are also calling for a ban on jargon and "management speak" among the emergency services, saying it had led to confusion between professionals on the day of the attacks.The coroner, Lady Justice Hallett, had already criticised the use of jargon and acronyms, telling the inquests last week: "This isn't just somebody being pedantic about the use of English… I don't know whether a crew manager is somebody who is responsible for supplies or is used to fighting fires. I have no idea."One of the lawyers, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, said many of the families viewed the opportunity to make recommendations as "the most important part [of the inquest] because it is looking to the future and seeing whether lessons can be learned from the atrocities of 7/7 and whether the deaths of their loved ones can contribute to saving others".The families have also called on the coroner to recommend either a restriction on sales of liquid oxygen – a product mainly comprising water and bleach and sold under various brand names as a remedy, which can be boiled down to its hydrogen peroxide component – or a demand that such sales are reported. The bombers bought large quantities of liquid oxygen, used to construct their devices, without attracting attention.Nine of the recommendations relate to the question of whether MI5 and police in London or West Yorkshire could have prevented the attacks.Other recommendations include:• More training in triage of casualties.• Clearer systems for declaring a major incident. The inquests have heard that in several instances one emergency worker had declared such an incident, but that had not been conveyed to the other services.• Public funding for helicopter medics, who played a critical role on 7 July but who rely on donations.• The recognition of "pre-hospital care" – the emergency treatment of casualties before they can be taken to hospital – as a formal medical speciality.Addressing the use of jargon, Christopher Coltart, another barrister for the families, quoted from the Cabinet Office's "Emergency Responder Inter-Operability Lexicon". The guide, he said, "helpfully" defines "evening civil twilight" as "'that period between sunset and total darkness when it is necessary to use artificial light to carry out most activities'. So if he wasn't entirely sure as to when he should switch on his torch, the lexicon is close at hand."He added: "It is a nonsense, I'm afraid. We all speak English. There is no reason for us not to communicate in plain English."The coroner voiced concerns about the failure to implement recommendations made after the 1987 King's Cross fire.Sir Desmond Fennell's report into the earlier tragedy, which killed 31 people, highlighted serious concerns about communications on the tube. But the inquest heard that these had not been fully addressed by July 2005, when radio problems meant rescuers underground could not pass information to the surface.Hallett said she had "very major concerns" about the lengthy delays in dealing with the "life and death" issues raised by Fennell. She added: "I don't want to make recommendations that go to the question of saving people's lives and think that it's going to lie on a shelf for 15 years."The coroner has now concluded hearing evidence and is expected to deliver her verdicts before Easter.• This article was amended on 11 March 2011 to clarify the distinction between the hydrogen-peroxide bearing product that goes under the umbrella name of liquid oxygen, and the gas of the same name.
