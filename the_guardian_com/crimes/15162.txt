Tougher community sentences, which almost all include an element of punishment and could see more convicted offenders wearing GPS tags to monitor their location, will be announced on Tuesday .The changes to the crime and courts bill, to be published by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, come a day after David Cameron made his first big speech on crime and justice, promising a new "tough, but intelligent" approach balancing tougher sentencing with more rehabilitation and a focus on crime prevention.But when the plans were announced by Grayling's predecessor, Ken Clarke, the Ministry of Justice's own impact assessment warned the move could increase re-offending if the punitive element squeezes out rehabilitation measures.Grayling will say: "We're today putting punishment back into community sentencing. This is about sending a clear message to offenders and the public that if you commit a crime, you can expect to be punished properly. Community sentences are not a soft option any more."Two-thirds of community orders currently contain a punitive element, such as forcing offenders to clean up graffiti, clear litter and help to rejuvenate their communities. Under the new plans, this will rise "significantly to almost all adult community sentences", said the ministry.Satellite tracking will also be brought in and a £5,000 cap on fines set by magistrates will be removed to "make community sentences much more effective", according to Grayling.He will say: "We will use the latest GPS technology to track offenders' movements, and are giving the courts increased powers to set fines that hit offenders in their pockets and are lifting the cap on compensation orders to provide proper compensation to victims."Earlier, Cameron said he wanted to take a "tough, but intelligent" approach.Speaking in central London, he promised tougher sentences, including mandatory life sentences for third-time serious offenders, a review of punishments for knife crime, and unlimited fines to compensate victims.However, he rejected suggestions – sometimes promoted within his own party – that the government had to make a choice between being "tough or touchy-feely", arguing they needed to "break out of this sterile debate" and do both.The cheapest and most effective method of reducing crime was rehabilitation, said Cameron, who promised that in future, all prisoners, not just those on longer sentences, would be eligible to take part. In future it would be the "norm" to use private companies and charities to deliver such programmes, and those providers would be paid on results, he said.He also stressed the importance of prevention, but offered no new policies beyond existing government changes such as tougher discipline in schools and a shake-up of the fostering and adoption systems to make them work faster.In addition, he highlighted the importance of government moves to speed up prosecution and the courts system, for example with video links between police stations and magistrates, and a pilot scheme in which courts open earlier, later and at weekends, which is to be expanded.The prime minister's focus on the issue was widely welcomed. But there were concerns expressed about the lack of new money to pay for expanding prison places or the initial expansion of rehabilitation. There were also warnings that too many prisons were already overcrowded, while new prison building plans had been cancelled and another prison had recently been told it was to close.Number 10 said it was not aware of any impact assessment done for the announcement, but stressed that the extra cost of any rehabilitation should be offset by fewer prisoners returning to jail, and that if there was a short-term increase in prisoners its information showed there was "a fair bit of capacity in the system".The prime minister also tried to head off such concerns, arguing that in real terms police budgets were being cut by 20% over four years, but crime fell 6% last year, and the independent police regulator, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, recently found frontline policing was being protected and public satisfaction with police had risen.The Criminal Justice Alliance, a coalition of nearly 70 organisations in the field, said the government should focus more on prevention such as drug and alcohol addiction programmes, and on making offenders make amends to their victims. "Several years on, the criminal justice system still often picks up the pieces when others have failed," said Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, the alliance's director.
