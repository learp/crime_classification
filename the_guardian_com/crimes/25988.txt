The killing of a toddler by his mother's drug-addicted boyfriend "could not have been foreseen," an inquiry into child protection services revealed today.Brandon Muir was 23 months old when he died from a ruptured intestine in March last year after being assaulted by Robert Cunningham at his home in Dundee.The significant case review of the death, carried out by an independent social work consultant, James Hawthorn, did, however, conclude that "not all current information was shared" between police and social workers.Cunningham, 23, a drug abuser, was convicted at the high court in Glasgow earlier this year of culpable homicide and jailed for 10 years.The report found there was "little opportunity" to prevent the fatal attack in the three-week period after Cunningham moved in with the toddler and his mother, Heather Boyd.While it later became known Brandon's mother had been taking drugs and was involved in prostitution, those details had not yet come to the attention of the agencies dealing with her case."From my examination of all the relevant records in this tragic case, and through interviews of almost 50 members of staff," Hawthorn said, "I have concluded that while the assault .... could not have been anticipated, there were weaknesses in both interagency working and in practice at that time."There "needs to be a higher profile given to the impact on children of domestic abuse and substance misuse," he suggested.The sharing of information on Cunningham was "hindered by time and resource pressures on health visitors, social workers and police," Hawthorn said, but the commitment of staff was "evident throughout".The review noted how concerns had been raised about Brandon's welfare, including an allegation that Boyd had smacked the youngster on his bare bottom at a parents group until her hand was sore. Boyd's mother and father had both raised concerns about their grandson with social workers.The report said social workers told the grandparents it would "probably not be in the children's best interests" for them to be cared for by Boyd.Later in February Boyd and Cunningham came in with Brandon to see social workers who recorded that Boyd "did not appear to have taken seriously the various concerns raised" and described her as being "smirking and dismissive of the social worker's advice and suggestions".The social workers were concerned about her change in attitude and arranged an urgent meeting, involving police and a health visitor. At that meeting, however, no information was presented on Boyd's previous police history and although allegations of domestic abuse by Cunningham were raised, there was no information highlighting more serious aspects of recent allegations.If all the information had been made available, the significant case review said, it "would have allowed a full and current risk assessment of potential risks to the children" to be carried out. But it added that the "fatal assault on Brandon which led to Brandon's death on 16 March 2008 could not have been foreseen".While those at the meeting had "serious concerns" about the situation, the report added: "There were no red lights or alarms around this case". An urgent case conference was scheduled for March 18 – two days after Brandon's death.Social workers who visited Boyd and her two children at their home on March 11 saw a graze on the side of Brandon's cheek – although this was not recorded in case notes.The next day health visitors saw the family, and when they examined Brandon they noticed a round scab to the side of his left eye. Boyd said the youngster must have fallen off the bed, however the repoxrt said the health visitors "did seriously consider whether it might have been a cigarette burn".Hawthorn's findings were backed by an independent report by former chief constable of Fife constabulary Peter Wilson. He said the recommendations of the significant case review would lead to a "necessary tightening up of procedures".
