The Home Office round-up of released foreign prisoners for deportation in the wake of last year's crisis was so indiscriminate that it included some British citizens, the chief inspector of prisons reveals today.Anne Owers says that the trawl carried out in the wake of the crisis that cost Charles Clarke his job as home secretary also wrongly involved the detention of some Irish ex-offenders, even though they had lived in Britain for decades with all their family ties here, and some who had committed only minor offences.The follow-up report on the foreign prisoner crisis says that immigration authorities were unable to cope with the workload created by the decision to detain 1,000 ex-prisoners who had been released without being considered for deportation."As a consequence, foreign nationals, suddenly and unexpectedly threatened with deportation, also found it impossible to find out what was happening to them, and were held in prisons and immigration removal centres far past their sentence expiry dates, even those who were desperate to return home," says Ms Owers. The chief inspector adds that their presence has "significantly contributed" to the prison overcrowding crisis of the last six months and destabilised immigration removal centres.The report, based on prison inspections and information from 86 independent prison monitoring boards up to January this year, says that the personal cost to many prisoners has been high, with an increasing number of suicide attempts and incidents of self-harm.Inspectors at one jail last November found a man on hunger strike because he wanted to go home six months after the end of his sentence but could not get a response from the immigration authorities. They also found a refugee, desperate not to return home, who was only told that he would not be deported on the day his sentence expired. Shortly after he had tried to hang himself.The report cites cases of British citizens who were caught up in the round-up and were even sent to immigration removal centres pending their deportation before the mistakes were discovered. In one case a man who became a British citizen in the late 1980s was due for release from an open prison on May 26 but instead was detained in a closed prison and then sent to a removal centre four days later.His release was not authorised for a further two days even though his British nationality had been confirmed.Ms Owers says that although extra staff and resources were provided to deal with the problem the inherited backlog of cases and lack of proper systems prevented a swift resolution.This was compounded by the fact that the immigration officials involved, operating at a distance and on paper, often seemed unaware of the human cost of their decisions.The chief inspector says that there are some signs of improvement with the special position of Irish prisoners recognised and immigration officers now working at some prisons, but concludes that the treatment of foreign prisoners in recent years has been "an object lesson in systems and procedures that lack both efficiency and humanity".Lin Homer, director-general of the Home Office's immigration and nationality directorate, claimed that the report was based on a sample of only 22 prisoners interviewed seven months ago and said that public protection had to be the first priority."That means foreign national prisoners are not released without consideration of deportation. While the system is being rebuilt there have been some delays to individual cases, and we have continued to hold people in detention where necessary," Ms Homer said.She claimed that the speed of deportation was largely dependent on the co-operation of individuals and that was forthcoming in many cases.
