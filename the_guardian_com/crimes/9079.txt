A murder hunt began last night after the discovery of the body of a farmer reportedly run down by a vehicle while confronting burglars at a farm in East Sussex.Julian Gardner, 52, was found lying near an outbuilding on the farm in Robertsbridge by a colleague yesterday morning.Local reports said he may have been run over as he tried to protect his property from intruders.The victim ran an agricultural and car repair business at Bush Barn farm, where his 90-year-old widowed mother lives.Police were treating the incident as murder, said Detective Chief Inspector Adam Hibbert."Mr Gardner lived within the farm itself. He had a house there and he ran one of the businesses on the farm. Other than that, we are still trying to complete the picture around Julian," said Hibbert.One unnamed villager said: "I think that he's been targeted by thieves before so I can understand why he's got annoyed and tried to stop them. It's just not worth this at all."Chief Inspector Heather Keating, Rother district's commander, said: "Rother is a close-knit rural district, with very low levels of crime."Today's tragic event will have affected a lot of people in Robertsbridge and my neighbourhood policing team will be working tirelessly to keep them informed about what we're doing and to gather any information that could prove useful."
