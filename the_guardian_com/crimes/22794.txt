The Sunday Telegraph yesterday offered a trenchant defence of its previous week's great scoop: the publication of the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. It was, said its leading article, in the public interest and, coincidentally, in the paper's commercial interest. Private ownership is fine. Competition "in a healthy marketplace" is good. As part of "the contract" between the paper and its readers, it was offering them the first chance to read important news.In other words, we didn't do nuffin wrong, your honour. We wuz only doin' our job. Well, they would say that wouldn't they? The paper has rejected any argument which calls into question the trivial nature of scoop journalism and ignored a mounting concern about it. For the saga of the injunction that shouldn't have been granted to prevent publication of a scoop that didn't merit the description appears to have split the media community. An absorbing debate has sprung up which goes to the heart of modern journalistic principle and practice.  On one side, admittedly drawn largely, though not exclusively, from broadcasters and academics, are those who believe papers have taken the wrong road. The culture of scoop journalism is a mistake which is ultimately damaging to all newspapers.  On the other side are virtually all editors, senior executives and reporters who can't understand why anyone should complain. They believe passionately in publishing exclusive stories. Scoops are the lifeblood of all journalism everywhere and have always been.  I contended last week, and haven't changed my mind, that the Sunday Telegraph story wasn't much of a scoop. It didn't reveal a secret someone was trying to conceal. The Government wasn't planning to censor the document. (Indeed, it may well have been that its desire not to be seen to do so caused that unfortunate blunder which led to the release of informants' names). The public's right to know was never under threat.  All that happened was that the paper's political editor got to see some of the report five days before it was to have been published in full. Big deal. Mirror editor Piers Morgan rightly tweaked me for having criticised him two years ago when his staff obtained a copy of the last government's Budget. Instead of publishing the contents, he handed the document back and splashed on the fact of having done so. I wrote at the time that he was wrong, but I have since changed my mind.  One of the advantages of standing back from the day-to-day internal newspaper decision-making and, most importantly, of not being infected by the atmosphere of the chase which exists in every news- paper office, is that it makes it easier to be objective.  Surely it's time to admit to ourselves that many scoops claimed by papers are not worthy of the name. Worse, the climate created by the belief that exclusives are so vital is part of the competitive cancer which is sure to kill off papers eventually.  Editors can't help themselves. Their daily demand is that their newspapers have everything all their rivals have and then more besides.  There is an assumption, without a scintilla of conclusive evidence, that exclusives attract sales. Papers regularly boast to readers about them. But that's nothing to how editors brag of their scoops to each other, often taking out adverts in the trade press. Why? Who cares? Our scoop culture is a bizarre travesty of genuine journalism. It gives the impression of providing readers with wholly new and important news, yet most of it is the newspaper equivalent of a theatrical illusion.  Think for a moment. There are 10 national daily papers and nine national Sundays. They are all seeking scoops. Inevitably, that isn't possible (though you wouldn't think so from the number of times the exclusive tag is appended to minor stories). Desperation to "beat" rivals leads either to blatant hype - phoney exclusives which were memorably tagged by the late Sunday Times executive Tony Bambridge as 'Â‘scoops of interpretation" - or to the pursuit of fake scoops.  The Sunday Telegraph's Lawrence report falls into the latter category. Just whose public interest was being satisfied by publication: the narrow section of the population which reads the Sunday Telegraph or the nation as a whole?  I'm not suggesting that papers turn their backs on the concept of pursuing exclusive stories. The point is to define what is worthwhile and what is not. When I was on an awards judging panel, there was a discussion about the difference between a scoop and an investigation.  We realised that there are a wide variety of scoops. They might be obtained by money, out-bidding a rival for a book serialisation or an individual's supposedly newsworthy story. Some are pieces of good fortune, a phone tip-off to the newsdesk. Other tips may occur because of a reporter's excellent contacts.  Most scoops, we decided, are one-day wonders. Very few cause waves. In nearly all those cases where scoops do make a difference, they are the result of painstaking investigations. But these are rare. Scoop journalism is a disservice to readers and the result of unhealthy competition. Public service is a front papers employ for private gain, whether they seek to make profits or propaganda.
