The tyres of more than 60 cars were slashed in four streets in Whitley Bay, Northumberland, early yesterday in a vandalism spree described by a Northumbria police sergeant as a "massive, indiscriminate crime binge".Sgt Darren Draper said: "We were expecting a quiet bank holiday and then this happened. The investigation will be a huge undertaking.We'll need to forensically examine each tyre and knock on hundreds of doors.There are a lot of people out there who are still unaware their tyres have been slashed."Police are appealing for witnesses to the vandalism.
