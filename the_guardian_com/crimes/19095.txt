Gordon Brown will today clarify the future role of the police in his plans for a unified border force designed to track and stem the flow of potential terrorists into the country.The proposals follow a review undertaken by the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnell, into the structure of the new border force which was criticised on its announcement in July for excluding the police. The plans are expected to take government policy very close to the long-standing proposals of the Conservatives for a combined force.In a wide-ranging Commons national security statement, the prime minister is expected to announce new measures and funding recommended by his security minister, Lord West, to increase police and public vigilance in crowded public places such as shopping centres, stadiums, airports, and tunnels, and water systems and other utilities.Recommendations on the protection of critical civil infrastructure such as nuclear power stations are unlikely to be published on security grounds.Research in the US has shown that there have been 60 terrorist attacks in shopping centres in 21 countries since 1998.West has been looking at the idea of a specialised force for the protection of critical infrastructure, but industry sources in retail and airports have been lobbying against excessive regulation that leads to a decline in consumer confidence or long queues. They have been arguing instead for better anti-terrorism technology that reduces the need for queues.Brown is also expected to announce that the main contract has been signed to introduce the Â£1.2bn "e-borders" programme to log everyone coming in and out of the country.Today's statement will not produce a new definitive position for the government on the length of detention without trial, an issue that has dominated discussion of counter-terrorism for two years and led to Tony Blair's only Commons defeat. Ministers have not yet reached an agreed position or undertaken the full consultation they promised with the opposition parties, but have hinted that they would like to see the current 28-day limit extended to 50 days.The Labour peer Lady Kennedy, an expert in terror trials, said yesterday she was deeply concerned that there were only 16 police officers with the high-level computer skills needed to penetrate computer hardware, including deleted items.She said: "You have to exhaust all practical steps including extra resources before you ever seek to erode liberty. Overall we have an impressive policing story to tell, but there seems to be a basic lack of skills."Draft clauses of the counter-terrorism bill have been sent to opposition leaders.The border force plan is one of a number of Tory proposals adopted by the prime minister, including the potential use of phone tap evidence in trials, the subject of a privy council review. The Conservative proposals are being prepared by the former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens.
