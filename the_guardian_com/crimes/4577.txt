New proposals to make young offenders wear US-style uniforms while carrying out community punishments appeared to be heading the same way as Tony Blair's shelved plan to make yobs pay on-the-spot fines by marching them to cashpoints.The Home Office minister Hazel Blears who is responsible for dealing with anti-social behaviour, floated the idea yesterday in a newspaper interview as a way of ensuring that justice was seen to be done in the battle against the "culture of disrespect".Ms Blears said that she did not want offenders breaking rocks in chain gangs but did want them to be seen to be doing something useful. In her own Salford constituency young offenders were forced to make floral hanging baskets."When people get fixed penalty notices I would like to see a very quick connection to community punishment, that people see being done. I want them to be identified."But yesterday in the face of criticism that it was degrading, the Home Office stressed that the uniforms were only an idea."This is something that we would consider but it is not a firm policy proposal," said a spokeswoman.A cabinet minister, Geoff Hoon, conceded yesterday that Ms Blears was simply "thinking aloud" about ways to stop the public seeing community service as a soft option."It is very important that ministers should have the opportunity of thinking aloud, of hearing the reaction and seeing what people think about these proposals," said Mr Hoon. "We have got to get respect back into society."The idea has been put forward before by the former Tory minister, Michael Forsyth, who wanted to introduce chain gangs, and Paul Boateng when he was at the Home Office.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation officers' union, rejected the idea. "Introducing uniforms, caps, badges or naming and shaming offenders is likely to degrade them, make them more resentful and not turn up for community punishment. This will mean the breach rate will soar and more will end up in prison. The idea should be quietly dropped."
