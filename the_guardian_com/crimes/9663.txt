The death of a woman at Styal prison in Cheshire followed a catalogue of failures at the jail, an inquest jury decided yesterday.Jolene Willis, 26, was found hanging in her cell in April 2003 - one of six women who died in the prison in a 12-month period from self-inflicted injuries. During the eight-day hearing in Warrington, the jury heard that Willis died three weeks after being sentenced to four months' prison for theft. She had a history of self-harm and was considered to be a suicide risk. The Cheshire coroner, Nicholas Rheinberg, said her attempts at self-harm usually involved the use of ligatures. The jury heard that some Styal staff had received only two hours' suicide prevention training two years before the series of deaths, and staffing levels were inadequate. They returned a narrative verdict that Willis died as a result of "inadequate treatment" following "inappropriate perceptions of her behaviour" during the period before her death. They also blamed low levels of staffing and a lack of staff training in suicide awareness. After the verdict, her father, John, said: "I am not sure that the way to deal with people with a history of minor offences, as a result of drug use, is to keep locking them up." Deborah Coles, of Inquest, a group that investigates deaths in custody, said: "We are shocked and appalled at the evidence that has come out at this hearing. Lessons are not being learned and the prison service must be held accountable."
