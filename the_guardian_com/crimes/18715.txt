The prosecution of "Sarah", jailed for making a "false retraction" after years of marital rape and abuse, screams injustice (She accused her husband of rape – and ended up in jail, 27 November). Why was she prosecuted? Why wasn't her sentence quashed? And why can't her rapist husband, who kept the children and the flat, be prosecuted now before he reoffends?You report that at least 30 women are in "similar positions". We are involved with several women accused of false allegations of rape, and each suffered a miscarriage of justice: evidence not gathered or lost, and a traumatised woman accused of wasting police time, put in the dock and sentenced to two or three years.Criminal justice is harsher on women: 94% of women's convictions are for minor offences, compared to 76% of men's, yet the number of women in prison has gone up by 68% compared to 35% for men. The state which wouldn't acknowledge rape in marriage as a crime until 1991, after WAR's 15-year campaign, is still punishing women for daring to make a fuss.Barely formed, the coalition proposed anonymity for men accused of rape, implying that women are liars. It backed down after a massive outcry, including from women MPs across parties.Shortly after becoming director of private prosecutions, Keir Starmer assured us that he was determined to improve rape prosecutions. Two years down the line, police and CPS still seem intent on prosecuting victims – a sure way to further discourage women from reporting crimes.Lisa LongstaffWomen Against Rape
