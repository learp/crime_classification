A science teacher has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after one of his pupils was attacked in school.Peter Harvey was arrested by Nottinghamshire police yesterday after the incident at All Saints' Roman Catholic school in Mansfield that left a 14-year-old boy with serious head injuries.A class was having a science lesson when, it appears, a row erupted between the boy and the teacher in the classroom. The alleged assault is said to have followed.Parents at the school gates this morning said the boy was allegedly hit with a weight from a set of scales.Police confirmed that a weapon was used in the attack and added that Harvey was also being questioned about alleged attacks on two other schoolchildren.Officers were called yesterday to the school in Broomhill Lane after paramedics arrived to find the 14-year-old boy in a pool of blood at the entrance to a classroom in the science block. Sources said he had suffered a number of very serious head injuries and there was grave concern for his life last night. Although he has not undergone surgery, the boy's condition has now stabilised and his parents are with him at his bedside in the Queen's Medical Centre.Police said the two other children who were assaulted in the same alleged attack were well enough to return home last night. Officers refused to say whether the boy and girl, both 14, had gone to their classmate's defence.Police have been given a further 12 hours to question the 49-year-old man and it is expected that they will require further time after that.The classroom has been forensically examined by officers and has reopened, although it is understood lessons are not being taught in it.Detectives said they were not looking for anybody else in connection with the incident.Detective Superintendent Adrian Pearson, who is leading the investigation, said: "Obviously the whole class is traumatised by what has happened. People send their children here from great distances because of its academic record and what happened is very much out of character for the school."I know a number of parents have rung the headteacher about what has happened but I would appeal for everyone to be calm, particularly in relation to those people involved."Pearson said officers were questioning pupils who had been in the class, in the presence of their parents.He added: "The school, the teachers and the parents are absolutely shocked.It was a trauma to all those involved. It was a full, lively classroom and I can understand the trauma to all the staff. Something like this is very, very rare and it's important to get to the truth of what has happened."We have a full picture of what has taken place and so the welfare of the child and his family are the main concern."Parents expressed their shock as they dropped their children off at the school, which was being guarded by police.Claire Tonks, 23, who was dropping her nephew, said: "It's a good school and I can't believe it as it could have been my nephew."The school is located in a rundown area of Mansfield and boarded-up houses line the street around it.Senior teachers and police officers stood outside the gates ushering in pupils this morning.The mayor of Mansfield, Tony Egginton, sent his daughter to the school, which he described as "very reputable".He said: "It's exceedingly sad that this happened. We don't know the full details but it does seem bizarre that this has happened. It's very concerning."
