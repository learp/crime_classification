One of two remaining suspects in the murder of PC Sharon Beshenivsky was last night charged with her murder after he was extradited back to Britain from Somalia after months of detective work, West Yorkshire police said.Mustaf Jama, 27, is expected to appear before Leeds magistrates this morning. He was also charged with robbery, two charges of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and two charges of possessing a prohibited weapon.PC Beshenivsky was shot on November 18 2005 as she responded to an alarm at a travel agent's in Bradford.The agency handled large money transfers between the local Asian community and Pakistan.There had been doubt that Jama would be possible to trace in the Somali countryside but improved relations with the Somali government helped to find him.Detectives will now renew the hunt for the final wanted man, Piran Ditta Khan, 58, the former owner of a restaurant in Aberdeen. He is believed to have fled to his native Pakistan and to be in the little-policed tribal areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.Following a string of convictions for the killing last year, Detective Superintendent Andy Brennan of West Yorkshire police's homicide and major inquiry team said that the force was determined to track down both men."The inquiry does not stop here," he said. "There is a grim determination to identify all those responsible and bring them to justice."PC Beshenivsky, who was 38 and had three children and two stepchildren, was the first officer at the scene, arriving within minutes of one of the staff pressing an alarm at the Universal Express travel agency on the day of her youngest daughter's fourth birthday.Five members of a London-based gang have been convicted of involvement in the case.
