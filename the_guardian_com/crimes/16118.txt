Your report on domestic violence (Beating the wife-beaters, G2, March 16) gives an incomplete account of what is being done by the criminal justice agencies to fight domestic violence.Julie Bindel does not mention specialist domestic violence courts, for example, which are having a real impact on domestic violence prosecutions. There will be over 60 of these by April 2007. Cases in these courts are prosecuted by specialists, with risk assessments and support for victims. In the pilot specialist courts, leading to the specialist courts programme, nearly three-quarters of defendants were convicted.The CPS takes domestic violence very seriously and we have a robust approach to prosecution. We work with the police and other agencies to ensure that all the available evidence is gathered to enable more cases to be successfully prosecuted. We welcome initiatives such as the head-camera scheme and are proactive in using legislation such as the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to build strong cases. Through ongoing work with voluntary organisations such as Women's Aid and Refuge, we make sure that our policies and training take account of the safety of victims of domestic violence as well as the prosecutions of cases. Last year we linked up with a range of voluntary organisations in initiating a campaign to highlight violence against women and children.Not only have we helped lead the pioneering specialist courts but are also training all CPS prosecutors in domestic violence prosecutions. By December 2006 successful prosecutions in all courts had risen to over 65%.Ken Macdonald QCDirector of public prosecutions
