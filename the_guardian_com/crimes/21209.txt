West Yorkshire police have apologised to victims of Jimmy Savile for the force's mishandling of intelligence and its "over-reliance on personal friendships" with the disgraced TV star.The force said it made mistakes that left Savile free to attack dozens of young people, including a five-year-old, in his home city of Leeds, but denied its officers had shielded the DJ from arrest.A 59-page report on Savile's relationship with West Yorkshire police revealed that eight officers socialised with him at his "Friday Morning Club" meetings. Four attended regularly over some years.Ingrid Lee, temporary assistant chief constable, denied claims that the report was a whitewash and said she was "disappointed and sad" about intelligence blunders without which Savile might have been stopped decades ago."I don't believe we have been cleared at all," she said. "We've failed in relation to how we handled intelligence and how we recorded it, and that has let victims down. What we haven't found is evidence that Jimmy Savile was protected."The report also revealed that Savile offered to act as an intermediary for police in the hunt to find the Yorkshire Ripper in the 1970s.Savile's details were recorded as part of that investigation, but there was no evidence he was a "person of interest" in the inquiry, the force said.Intelligence about Savile's offending was mishandled a number of times, the report found, including in 1998, when West Yorkshire police failed to properly record an anonymous letter that made sexual abuse allegations about the former Top of the Pops host.The letter was forwarded by an officer from the Metropolitan police's clubs and vice unit, who told West Yorkshire police it was "common knowledge within the team in the late 1980s and early 1990s that Savile was a paedophile".The letter was not acted upon, according to the report, and its handling is one of at least eight separate instances of potential misconduct being examined by the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).Lee said: "I'm disappointed that we didn't connect the dots to provide us with an opportunity to investigate Savile."The information was forwarded to the police but actually we've got to look at where we were then. We didn't have robust electronic systems, we've moved forward significantly in how we handle intelligence, how we deal with victims, how we tie information together to ensure we have a complete picture."Early opportunities to investigate rumours about Savile's behaviour with young women were missed, the report shows.A retired police officer told the West Yorkshire inquiry that there were rumours in the early 1960s that Savile "took young girls to his barge in Leeds for parties".Another former detective from the Leeds vice squad said he believed there had been an investigation into allegations of indecent assault by Savile on two girls in the early 1980s, but this was uncorroborated by other retired officers.It also emerged that Savile was presented with an engraved cigarette lighter which read "To Jimmy Savile, from his friends at the Fraud Squad".However, West Yorkshire police said there was no evidence that the lighter had come from a member of its force.Alan Collins, a solicitor representing more than 40 victims of Savile, accused the force of "collective myopia" and said its exoneration of officers did not add up. "Whilst the report exonerates the police officers of misconduct it fails to adequately address the relationship West Yorkshire police enjoyed with Savile and how this influenced their judgment, either collectively or on the part of individuals," he said.Peter Watt, director of the NSPCC helpline, said the report revealed yet more missed opportunities to prevent Savile attacking 68 victims, including one five-year-old, over half a century in Leeds."This is not just about poor record keeping and a lack of joining the dots by the police," Watt said. "Victims were ignored by many people and Savile was therefore allowed to commit horrific abuse against young and vulnerable children across six decades."West Yorkshire police said it was a stark and shocking fact that none of the 68 victims, who all came forward after Savile's death in 2011, reported his crimes while he was still alive.Its report said the majority of his victims were aged between 14 and 17 in the 1960s and 70s, when the disgraced entertainer was at the peak of his TV and radio fame.
