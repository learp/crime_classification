Extradition proceedings were under way in Morocco last night for a British martial arts expert arrested there at the weekend in connection with February's £53m Securitas robbery in Kent.The man was being held in Rabat, the capital, along with three other Britons following a police operation mounted jointly by Moroccan and British authorities.Detective Superintendent Paul Gladstone, of Kent police, who is heading the investigation, said yesterday that Lee "Lightning" Murray, 26, from Sidcup, south-east London, had been arrested on suspicion of robbery, kidnap and other offences linked to the raid in Tonbridge.The arrest was the latest development in the investigation which has also seen two further arrests and the recovery of an estimated £1m over the last few days."The arrest was made with the authority of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kent police and the Moroccan authorities," said Mr Gladstone. "The man is in custody in Rabat and the United Kingdom is now seeking extradition ... We remain determined to bring the people behind the robbery to justice."The arrests took place with the help of Moroccan police in the Mega Mall shopping centre in Rabat. The three Britons arrested with Mr Murray were not being sought in connection with the robbery.Mr Murray is an expert in "mixed martial arts", sometimes known as cage fighting, which employs a number of different disciplines, including kickboxing. Last year, he was seriously injured when he was attacked and stabbed outside the Funky Buddha nightclub in central London where he had been attending a birthday party for a page three model.There are about 2,000 Britons resident in Morocco and a growing number purchasing holiday homes there. No visa is required for entry from an EU country.Britain does not have a formal extradition agreement with Morocco and there has not been an extradition from there to the UK since 1995 but last night the indications were that a request from the British authorities would be successful."The four will be extradited to the United Kingdom according to the rules which means that they will be flown home 48 hours from the time of their arrests," a Moroccan security official told Reuters, predicting that Mr Murray would be flown back to Britain today. The Home Office said extradition requests to Morocco were dealt with on an ad hoc basis.Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said yesterday that Morocco had, over the last few years, been seeking greater ties with the EU, "with all that that implies".Mr Gladstone said two men, from Devon and Hampshire, had been charged with money laundering."We are aware that some media are reporting that a further £1m cash has been recovered, linked to the Securitas robbery," he said."Working with Surrey and Hampshire police, we did arrest a number of people in Surrey and Hampshire on Friday and have now charged two men ... A significant amount of cash was recovered."However, we are not able to confirm the amount at this stage or link the cash to the robbery or any similar crime. The money is now being counted and forensically examined."Kent police said last night that it was not yet known when Mr Murray would appear in court in connection with the extradition proceedings or how long they were likely to last.Five men and two women have already been charged in connection with the robbery, the biggest in Britain.It involved the kidnapping of the Securitas depot manager, Colin Dixon, his wife, and eight-year-old son.The depot staff were tied up while the money was loaded on to a truck. Most of the money is still missing.
