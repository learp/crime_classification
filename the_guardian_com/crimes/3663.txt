A police officer preyed on vulnerable women he met on duty and then raped them, a court heard today.PC Stephen Mitchell, 42, denies five counts of rape, six of indecent assault and 15 of misconduct in public office, with the alleged offences spanning a seven-year period.The officer, from Glasgow, was based at Pilgrim Street police station in Newcastle, where he came across heroin addicts and other vulnerable women.Paul Sloan QC, prosecuting, told Newcastle crown court: "It was during the course of his duties that the defendant came into contact with each of the complainants in this case."As well as being known to the police, each of the complainants was a vulnerable female, whether because of drug abuse, health problems, domestic circumstances or a combination of those factors."The defendant took advantage of their vulnerabilities, usually providing or offering favours but then requesting or in some cases requiring by force sexual favours in return."Mitchell joined Northumbria police in 1998, the court heard.The trial continues.
