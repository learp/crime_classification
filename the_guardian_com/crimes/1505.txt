Directly elected US-style sheriffs and police commissioners would be established by a future Tory government to end Labour's "obsessive centralising tendencies" by giving local people the right to dismiss failing police chiefs.Oliver Letwin, the shadow home secretary, will signal the most radical policy shake-up in law and order for generations when he indicates today that a future Tory government would strip the Home Office of its powers over the police. In a speech to the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales in Newport he will declare that Whitehall must "let go" or risk disaster: "You can't steer a ship from the shore."Mr Letwin will announce the details of the new policy to the Conservative party conference next month. In an attempt to "emasculate" the Home Office, he is expected to propose establishing sheriffs and police commissioners, who would be elected by local people and would have the right to throw out failing police chiefs. The Tories believe that the string of targets drawn up by the Home Office has created a centralised bureaucracy which is hampering police work on the ground. "We are determined to let the stimulus for such policing come from local populations rather than from above," Mr Letwin will say. "And we are determined to let you get on with the job, rather than telling you how to do it." The Tories have already pledged to increase numbers by 40,000 over eight years. Mr Letwin's speech comes on the eve of a policy announcement by Iain Duncan Smith on cutting back Labour's "command state".  theguardian.com/politics
