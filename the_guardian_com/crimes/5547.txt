A theatrical makeup artist who was accused of making disguises for the men who carried out the Â£53m Securitas raid was cleared yesterday at the Old Bailey.Michelle Hogg, 32, had faced three charges connected to Britain's biggest heist, but she was released four months after the trial started on the judge's direction for reasons which cannot be reported.Sir John Nutting QC, prosecuting, said that the crown had decided to discontinue its prosecution of Ms Hogg and asked that not guilty verdicts be returned.Ms Hogg, from Woolwich, south-east London, was said to have created prosthetic masks for the armed gang who robbed the security firm in Tonbridge, Kent. The court heard that the disguises had been crucial to the robbery, particularly during the kidnapping of depot manager Colin Dixon, his wife and child. Ms Hogg had previously admitted to being asked to do a "prosthetics job" but denied knowing what the masks would be used for. The trial of eight men continues.
