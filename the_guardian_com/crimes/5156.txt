Two of Britain's Olympic heroes have reportedly had their medals stolen just hours after the Queen hosted a glittering Buckingham Palace event to celebrate London 2012 athletes.Rower Alex Partridge and hockey star Hannah Macleod took to Twitter to appeal for information to find their Olympic bronze medals which they believe were taken in the early hours of Wednesday morning.Partridge, 31, who won bronze as part of the men's eight rowing team, tweeted that his Olympic blazer as well as his medal had been stolen from an event in Mayfair, central London.Macleod, under the username @hannahmacleod6, also wrote on the site: "My medal was also stolen at the same time. Totally devastated." Macleod, 28, achieved bronze at London 2012 after Team GB's women's hockey team beat New Zealand to secure a medal.Both athletes later published a photo of a man captured on CCTV who they wished to talk to about the alleged thefts.The Metropolitan police confirmed they were investigating reports of a stolen Olympic medal and blazer, but had not yet been contacted about a second stolen medal.A host of Olympic and Paralympic stars had earlier been at Buckingham Palace to mark their achievements along with the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Duchess of Cambridge, prime minister David Cameron and London 2012 organising committee chairman Lord Coe.A Met spokesman said: "An Olympic medal and blazer were reported stolen from a venue in Mayfair in central London."It was believed the items were taken between midnight and 5am on Wednesday, October 24."
