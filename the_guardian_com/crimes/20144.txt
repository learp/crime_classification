The murdered schoolgirl Jodi Jones was killed in a "vicious and frenzied" knife attack but was not sexually assaulted, police revealed yesterday.Detectives investigating the 14-year-old's death said her body had been found partially clothed, but there was no sign of a sexual attack. A post-mortem examination showed that Jodi had been savagely attacked with a knife. It is understood her throat was slit. Senior officers said they were shocked at the brutality of the assault. Jodi was found by a family search party, shortly before midnight on Monday, in bushes near a popular shortcut less than half a mile from her home in Dalkeith, 10 miles south of Edinburgh. Although the 40-strong murder squad has received hundreds of calls from the public, police say they have yet to hear from anyone who saw Jodi after she left home at 5pm. Detective Inspector Ian Martin said: "I think given the level of violence and the circumstances, which I don't particularly want to go into ... there has to be a strong possibility a male was involved." Detectives are trying to find a motive for the killing as Jodi had not been robbed or sexually assaulted. A psychological profiler may be brought in, and police believe that the location of the attack indicated some local knowledge. Forensic teams yesterday continued to search the woodland where Jodi was found as people piled bouquets at the entrance to the pathway. Det Insp Martin urged the public to be aware of anyone whose character had changed over the past 48 hours, had not been seen over that period, or was not wearing a favourite jacket, trousers or footwear. Jodi was a pupil at St David's Roman Catholic high school, which held two assemblies yesterday to help pupils cope with her death.
