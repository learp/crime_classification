A private detective agency run by a former police officer used secret software to hack into the computer of Tamara Mellon, founder of the Jimmy Choo shoe empire, during her acrimonious divorce from a wealthy US banking heir, a court heard yesterday.The London-based firm Active Investigation Services [AIS] sent Trojan horse emails to Ms Mellon which allowed her then husband, multimillionaire Matthew Mellon, to "snoop" on her emails and online bank account.The jury heard that Mr Mellon, heir to a £5bn banking fortune in the US, was one of several wealthy clients, some of whom paid tens of thousands of pounds to City-based AIS for phone tapping and computer hacking.The company was run by ex-policeman Scott Gelsthorpe, 32, and his former colleague Jeremy Young.Jurors were told that Mr Young, 38, who has admitted a string of conspiracy counts relating to the case, was a serving officer at the time of the offences, although he was on long-term sick leave.Yesterday Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, said: "The agency carried out the usual things like tracking people down, looking for information for solicitors. They also had a lucrative sideline involving hacking into people's computers and tapping into their phones, which is illegal in this country."Yesterday Southwark crown court heard that the emails sent to Ms Mellon's account were part of a concerted effort by her husband to track his wife's financial affairs "because he wanted information he was not getting through the court process".Ms Moore said: "You open that email and at that point, in goes the Trojan, lodges itself, sits there quietly and does what it does best - which is record every keystroke that is made."If you had online banking, your account number and password would be logged. Every time, if you are logging on often enough, you can work out what the password is ... and you can go and look at the bank account. And that is exactly what happened."Mr Mellon, now divorced, of Belgravia, central London, denies one count of conspiring to cause unauthorised modification of computer material between July 1 2004 and February 4 2005.The court heard that the case was one of several in which AIS, described in court as "Hackers are us", offered illegal services to a string of clients.Jurors were told that the company charged £5,000-£7,000 to hack into a computer, £2,000 to obtain bank details and £6,000 to tap telephones.Interception specialist Michael Hall installed hi-tech devices in BT junction boxes and overhead telephone wires to monitor the phone calls of its clients' business rivals or spouses.After finding several of the bugs, BT launched an investigation, installing tiny cameras inside the boxes, which filmed Mr Hall at work.Ms Moore said: "He looked for all the world like a BT engineer. If you saw him at the roadside you probably would not think anything of it."The court was told that although Mr Hall, who has pleaded guilty to charges relating to the case, fitted the phone taps around the UK, the computer virus was sent by a US IT specialist, Marc Caron, from his home in Phoenix, Arizona.Ms Moore said one of AIS's other customers was the international transport company chief Charles Kay, who paid the agency to spy on a business competitor and his then wife after she launched divorce proceedings."She [Mr Kay's ex-wife] became aware that Mr Kay was apt to use underhand techniques to gain an advantage in his business dealings."And then, when her marriage to Mr Kay began to falter in 2004, she became aware of odd things happening, including an indication to her that her phone line was being tampered with and that she was being followed," said Ms Moore.The barrister said the court would also hear how Mr Kay, head of Slough-based Kay O'Neill Ltd, used the agency to spy on a rival logistics company with offices in Germany and Hong Kong.Another of the agency's clients was prestige bathroom company boss Anthony Waters, who paid the private investigators to hack into his estranged wife's laptop in the runup to divorce proceedings.The head of West 1 Bathrooms got his son Duncan to instruct AIS to find out whether she had any assets, where they were and what she was saying to her solicitors and family about the divorce.David Carroll, of Highgate, north London and Scott Gelsthorpe, of, Kettering, Northants, both deny 15 counts of conspiracy alleging fraud, the unauthorised modification of computer material, the unlawful interception of computer material and criminal damage.Daniel Carroll, of Westminster, central London, denies three charges, including conspiracy to cause unauthorised modification and intercept communications.Maurice Kennedy, 58, of Barnet, north London, denies conspiring to intercept communications.The trial continues.Explainer: Trojan horsesNamed after the mythical siege device, Trojan horse software is one of the most common ways other internet users can gain access to your computer. Essentially, a piece of malicious code is hidden in an otherwise legitimate program. The user activates this and gets the service expected, but the Trojan unloads and surreptitiously plants a virus, worm or other dangerous program as well.Most often it is used to plant spyware, which monitors the user's actions and sends the information back to the Trojan's originator, or to turn a computer into a "zombie" that spews out spam emails.A stringent approach to what you download, along with regular checks for unwanted material, will probably catch most Trojans, but advanced internet snoopers are increasingly tailoring their attacks to individual victims in order to fool them.
