A police informer who claims that West Midlands police owes him £100,000 for helping thwart a £10m drugs deal is to take his case to the House of Lords, after the court of appeal barred him from taking legal action to claim the cash.John Carnduff, who waived his anonymity to bring the case to the court of appeal, claims to be in fear for his life after going public. He claims his tipoff in the drug case led police to infiltrate the gang, seize a large quantity of heroin, and successfully prosecute those involved. The police applied to have his claim struck out, saying that there had been no legally enforceable deal and that payments were made ex gratia. They denied that Mr Carnduff's information had been instrumental in securing the convictions. A judge at the high court ruled last September that the case could go ahead. Last Friday, three appeal court judges halted the case by a 2-1 majority, ruling that to let it go to trial would oblige the police to reveal sensitive information in open court. The court of appeal refused Mr Carnduff permission to appeal to the Lords, but his lawyers said they intended to petition the law lords direct. Lawyers for the police said that if the case went ahead they would be asked to disclose documents to Mr Carnduff's lawyers for which they would have to claim public interest immunity. Lord Justice Parker and Lord Justice Laws ruled that it would be contrary to public policy for the case to go ahead. Mr Carnduff had claimed that, while no specific sum was settled on, the police had agreed to base his reward on the seriousness of the crime and the success or otherwise of the information supplied. Lord Justice Laws said that if the case went ahead it would bring the business of tracking criminals into the "glare of the public arena of a court of justice". Lord Justice Waller disagreed, and said that in his opinion the issue of whether there was a binding agreement should be allowed to go to trial.
