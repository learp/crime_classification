The police officer shot in the face and blinded by Raoul Moat is pressing for an increase in mobility allowance after being awarded the minimum grade of Â£18.95 a week.PC David Rathband, who was targeted randomly when the fugitive with a grudge against police went on the run in July, said it seemed "somehow not fair" that he should fall into the lowest category.He is in a higher band for the other, larger component of disability benefit which covers daily care, but mobility has been a major issue in his recovery. He was shot at close range while sitting unarmed in his patrol car at a roundabout in Newcastle upon Tyne, just off the A1 Great North Road, the route Moat took to his hiding place in Rothbury, 30 miles north.Rathband, who is 42 and father of two, lost his sight in both eyes in spite of intensive treatment. He announced his plan to appeal for a higher mobility award while thanking supporters and friends on Twitter.In a series of messages on the social messaging service, he wrote: "Now ready for battle with the DHSS. Been awarded lowest band for mobility. Somehow not fair."Thank you for all the words of support, each one makes me stronger to keep up the battle. It's easy to remove the dark days with your support."Rathband underwent facial reconstructive surgery and hopes to return to police work.He has said several times in interviews that he feels no malice towards Moat, who went on the rampage after leaving prison convinced that the police were determined to wreck his life. The officer said the experience of being shot was like having "my head inside a tin can with the biggest firework you can imagine. It was absolutely unbearable."He has been commended for his courage during recovery and has twice been invited to the House of Commons by the home secretary, Theresa May.A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: "We are indebted to PC Rathband for his bravery and we want to ensure he receives all the benefits he is entitled to. For those who require frequent care and supervision, the highest rate of the care component of disability living allowance is awarded to meet their care needs."
