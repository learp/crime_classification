Detectives in Glasgow are hoping a decision to beam a 60ft image of a murdered prostitute on to a tower block will provide fresh leads towards catching her killer.The body of Emma Caldwell, 27, was discovered by a dog walker in Lanarkshire woodland this month. She was last seen five weeks earlier near a hostel for homeless people where she had been staying. Over four hours from Monday night into the early hours of Tuesday, a huge picture of her was projected on to the side of a semi-derelict tower block in the Gorbals area of Glasgow.The image, taken on a day out with her parents a few weeks before she disappeared, could be seen clearly from the centre and the east end of the city, where Ms Caldwell regularly worked as a prostitute to feed her drug habit. Strathclyde police said it was the first time such a tactic had been used in a criminal investigation in Britain. Detective Superintendent Willie Johnson said: "This is an innovative way of putting a fresh appeal over to the public. Someone out there knows something and people who see this may be able to provide that vital piece of information. "This site has been specifically chosen as it will be visible across areas where we know Emma and her associates were known to frequent until the early hours of the morning." Ms Caldwell, a former instructor at a riding school, was last seen walking alone on a street in the Govanhill area of Glasgow, close to the hostel. She left the family home six years ago, a year after the death of her sister, Karen, from cancer. Her parents said she could not cope with the loss of Karen and turned to heroin for solace. She had been working the streets of Glasgow to feed her habit. The great majority of Glasgow's prostitutes are heroin addicts and Ms Caldwell is the eighth prostitute to be murdered in the city in 14 years.
