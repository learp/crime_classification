Three men tried to sell London's Ritz Hotel to unsuspecting businessmen for a "bargain" £250m in an "ambitious scam", a court heard today.In a "well-targeted" plot the trio sought victims interested in the "high-stakes world of dealing in trophy properties". Then, claiming they knew the billionaire Barclay brothers who own the landmark hotel, they enticed their targets with false promises."The deal that sounded too good to be true was a complete fantasy," Anuja Dhir QC, prosecuting, told Southwark crown court.Conn Farrell, 57, a solicitor and retired construction company contracts manager from Aldershot, Hampshire; Patrick Dolan, 68, of Tottenham, north London; and lorry driver Anthony Lee, 49, of Goole, east Yorkshire, deny all charges.They are accused of defrauding Terence Collins and Marcel Boerkhoorn by falsely claiming that Dolan and Lee were in a position to procure the sale of the Ritz in Piccadilly for £250m between 1 January 2006 and 30 March 2007.Dhir said: "The prosecution case is that these three defendants were each involved in a simple but well-targeted and ambitious scam."They promised their targets something that seemed to be too good to be true – the opportunity to buy the Ritz Hotel and Casino in Piccadilly for the bargain price of £250m."As the negotiations progressed, they sucked their victims in with more false promises and frustrated them with unnecessary requests until they managed to extract from them a payment of £1m."She told the jury that the defendants "chose their marks well"."They found people – Terence Collins in particular – who were interested in the high-stakes world of dealing in trophy properties," she said."In that competitive world of secret multimillion-pound deals, some people are prepared to take risks that might seem breathtaking to most of us. Millions of pounds can be made and lost on transactions for trophy properties like the Ritz."What sets this transaction apart from most is that it was all based on one great big lie."The defendants were never in a position to be able to sell the Ritz but said they knew the owners and could buy the hotel and casino for just £200m. They would then sell it to Collins' firm, London Allied, for £250m.Farrell acted as their solicitor, giving their claims added legitimacy by telling Collins he had the contracts for the sale when he did not, Dhir said.It would have been "a very attractive proposition" as it grossly undervalued the Ritz, which would have been worth £450m to £600m at the time, the court heard.Negotiations between Collins and the defendants reached a climax in December 2006 when £1m was paid into an Irish bank account controlled by Lee, who had demanded the money to keep the deal on the table. Collins had justified the £1m payment to potential backers by referring to the reclusive nature of the Barclay brothers. But this "commercial gamble" was based on a false promise, said Dhir.When Lee received the money he paid about £435,000 to Dolan, his business partner, she added. The sale never happened and the money was never returned.Lee and Dolan claim the £1m payment related to a separate property deal with Collins, while Farrell says he was acting on the instructions of his clients, Lee and Dolan, the court was told.Dhir said Lee told "middle man" Karen Maguire, a director of PropertySource.com, which specialises in finding properties for private clients, that he had access to a contract to buy the Ritz for £200m.He said he intended to "turn" the deal, by buying the hotel for £200m and immediately selling it on to a third party for £250m, and offered to split the £50m difference with her if she could find a buyer, the court heard.The trial continues.
