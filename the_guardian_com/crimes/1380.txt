In a letter from Hobson to a friend, written in Wakefield prison on August 5 2004, the killer says: "So where do I start? I am not right sure myself. Drunk and disorderly and fighting. Four murders - no way. But unfortunately that is what I have done."While it is nice to be home, I suppose at least if I ever escape I will know where I am. Ha ha. My first time inside and I am probably looking at 30 years or so. Fuck me! I am in the hospital care centre at the moment on 24-hour watch. It's like being on Big Brother. "The amount of grub I am putting away, I am going to weigh 30 stone. I am playing a lot of snooker. When I get out of here I will be the world's oldest champion - if they allow a 64-year-old to enter. I hope you will come to see me. Ring first to make sure I am home. Hee hee." Notes scrawled in black ink discovered by police at the maisonette Hobson shared with Claire Sanderson give startling insights into his meticulous planning for the murders. Scrawled on scraps of paper, they provide a snapshot of Hobson's mind as he arranged to murder his girlfriend and lure her twin sister to her death. There was also an alarming "to do" list, which spoke of disabling the twins' parents, and also contained the names of his former in-laws, who were presumed to be at risk. While Hobson was on the run, all the people named in his lists were given police protection. One note read: "Ring Di. [Claire's twin sister]. Claire poorly. [He told Diane she had glandular fever]. Go Di's borrow battery charger [He borrowed a charger elsewhere] Off George [Sanderson, the twins' father]. Home garage "Jackie [the twins' mother] in house "Tie wraps. Gafa tape. Mum. Car. Shop" [Police believe he wanted these items to use in the aftermath of the killings]. The "to do" list read: "Text Di [Claire's sister] use Claire's phone. Tell Di to come down. [To their maisonette]. Ring Mum and Dad. [George and Jacquie Sanderson]. "Di's car. [Use Diane's car - which Hobson later did] Tell Mum and Dad same. Disable All! Use and abuse at will! [Police believe this means he wanted to kill the twins and their parents]." Another note read: "Mum early [Hobson's mother Sandra was visiting the house on July 17] ... "Di 2 come here [Lure Diane to the house] meet Claire I'm out. "Do Di here. [Kill Diane here] Money car Dave's sorted! [This refers to being sorted for drugs]. "11ish Di's Mum and Dad - mine! [Presumably kill her parents at 11pm on July 17] Narrow boat [his preferred mode of escape]". One of the most revealing notes, on the back of a bus timetable, reads: "Big bin liners, tape, tie wraps. Fly spray. Neutrodol." This refers to a list of items he needed to clean up, to tie up Diane's body and to disguise the smell of Claire's decomposing body.
