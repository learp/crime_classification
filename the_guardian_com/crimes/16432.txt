The home secretary, David Blunkett, has today launched a big brother-style surveillance scheme designed to deal with persistent young offenders.Mr Blunkett was visiting a pioneering computer project, funded by the Home Office, that can recognise youths' faces if they appear on town centre CCTV cameras.The project, which was started in east London, will be rolled out to 41 other areas of the country at a cost of £45m. Mr Blunkett was visiting the nerve centre in Newham, east London, to see the council's £600,000-a-year system in action, which begins operating today.As well as recognising faces, the project boasts a computerised voice recognition system that telephones juveniles at various times of the day to check they are where they are supposed to be.If the system catches out the offenders, workers from the youth offending team or the police are sent to deal with them. Magistrates at Stratford Youth Court in east London yesterday imposed the first intensive supervision and surveillance programme (ISSP) in the country on a 14-year-old joyrider. The boy has an electronic tag fixed to him.The head of the youth offending team at Newham borough council, Peter Nicholson, said that young people had to offend four or more times and have a previous sentence before an ISSP is put in place.Offenders will have their photographs taken with a digital camera after agreeing to take part in the ISSP. The image is fed into the computer, which will then recognise their faces from any of the 300 cameras in the CCTV scheme run by Newham and neighbouring Tower Hamlets council. Mr Nicholson said some offenders in Newham's scheme would be tagged and have to comply with the voice verification system. Others willl only be monitored by one of the systems.Newham will be able to deal with up to 75 youths at one time, he said, with the ISSPs running for an average of six months. The second area to adopt the system, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, is due to begin operation next week. The announcement of the surveillance project comes as a report claims that government attempts to crack down on young adult offenders are making the situation worse and generating crime. Crime reduction charity Nacro argued that "unnecessary" imprisonment of young adults led them to commit more offences once they were freed.
