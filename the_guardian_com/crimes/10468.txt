Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell will stand trial in September after being accused of child sex offences.The star, who plays car mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV soap, made his first appearance at Manchester crown court on Thursday, under his real name of Michael Turner.The 48-year-old is charged with 19 offences including six counts of raping a child, six allegations of indecently assaulting a child and seven counts of sexual activity with a child. The alleged offences relate to one complainant and all took place between 2001 and 2010.During the preliminary hearing, which lasted about 10 minutes, Le Vell spoke only to confirm his name.Six members of his family sat in the public gallery of the packed courtroom.Le Vell has not yet entered a plea but has stated publicly that he is innocent and will fight the allegations through the courts.Prosecutor Eleanor Laws told Judge Michael Henshell that a plea hearing will take place on 17 May followed by a two- to three-week trial starting on 2 September.Alisdair Williamson, defending, asked for an earlier trial date, saying: "Mr Turner has had this hanging over his head for 18 months." But Henshell said the September date should be fixed and granted the actor bail until the plea hearing, at the same court, in May.Asked by the judge if he understood, Le Vell nodded and said "thank you" before leaving the dock.As he left court and walked to his car, the actor smiled at the large group of photographers and camera crews and joked: "It's an early finish for you lot, innit?" He made no other comments.Le Vell was bailed on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact named witnesses and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 14.Williamson said there might be a defence application for the return of his passport and the judge ruled that if there were, it should be dealt with administratively.Le Vell was arrested in September 2011 and questioned over alleged child sex offences, but the matter was later dropped.In January, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was in the public interest to charge him with the current offences following a review of evidence.The father of two, originally from Manchester, is a well-known TV face after playing garage owner and mechanic Webster for the past 30 years.
