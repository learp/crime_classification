The girlfriend of a Hells Angels motorcyclist shot dead on a motorway today described him as a man with "the heart of a lion".Gerry Tobin's girlfriend, Rebecca Smith, 25, said the hard-working bike mechanic was her "soul mate" and she would always miss him.Marcus Berriman, the president of the London chapter of the Hells Angels, read out a statement on behalf of Ms Smith."To those who knew him, Gerry stood out in the crowd as a true gentleman," the statement said."He was a rare breed of man with the heart of a lion and a soul filled with compassion and selflessness. The nature of his untimely death, due to a callous and cowardly act of violence from which it was impossible to defend himself, only accentuates further the pain and suffering that we are all experiencing due to this terrible loss."Mr Tobin, 35, was gunned down near Junction 12 on the M40 on Sunday afternoon, as he rode away from the Bulldog Bash motorcycle festival. Today police investigating the murder said they had received "significant information" about the killing.Detectives believe that at least two shots were fired at Mr Tobin, although only one struck him."The investigation is making good progress," said Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, who is leading the investigation. "We have made some significant progress. The search on the motorway was very helpful and well worth doing."Mr Lawrence said he now believed that there were at least two people in the green Rover 620 seen near the incident, and he hoped to release descriptions of the pair in the coming days.He said he would be "astonished" if the killer turned out to be another Hells Angel, because of the code of loyalty within the organisation. But he said he was concerned that some groups or individuals might seek to avenge Mr Tobin's death."It would be foolish not to consider that there may be retaliation," Mr Lawrence said, adding that while he was sure the core membership of the Hells Angels would abide by their principles, other more peripheral members might look to carry out retaliation.About 60 officers are working on the investigation and will begin handing out leaflets and beer mats and appealing for information in bikers' pubs and clubs in the coming days.Billboards appealing for witnesses are also being set up at motorway service areas around the West Midlands, along the M40 and throughout the country."It's possible that Gerry was targeted due to some disagreement he had had or because he was a Hells Angel, as he was wearing the colours and the patches of the Hells Angels," Mr Lawrence said.He added that there was "nothing to indicate that he (Mr Tobin) was aware he was being pursued" but that "it did not seem to be just a random attack on anybody".Ms Smith was clearly moved as her statement was read out at the Warr's Harley Davidson motorcycle dealership in Mottingham, south-east London, where her boyfriend worked for more than 10 years.Large photographs of Mr Tobin, smiling broadly and wearing traditional biker clothes, have been posted on a wall beside the business.The statement continued: "Gerry was both a man of his word and a defender of his principles. He was a hardworking and respected motorcycle mechanic who was not only loving towards Rebecca but also to his family and friends. He was Rebecca's soul mate and she feels truly blessed to have spent five wonderful years of her life, the best five years, with such a wonderful man. She will always miss him."
