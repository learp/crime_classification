Two demonstrators who were stopped and searched by the police at random on their way to an international arms fair lost their challenge yesterday to the use of the London-wide stop-and-search powers given under the anti-terrorist laws.Three appeal court judges, headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, upheld a ruling by the high court last October that the Metropolitan police and the home secretary, David Blunkett, acted lawfully in making and confirming a "rolling programme" of secret authorisations under the Terrorism Act 2000 allowing the police to stop and search anyone anywhere in greater London.But the judges called on the Metropolitan police to "review very carefully" how the powers were exercised, because the briefing given to officers on the ground was "poor".The fact that London had been designated a random stop-and-search zone on a rolling basis since February 2001 came to light only when the two protesters, Kevin Gillan, 26, a student from Sheffield, and Pennie Quinton, 32, a freelance photojournalist from Bermondsey, south-east London, brought their case backed by the civil rights group Liberty.They were stopped and searched on the way to Europe's largest arms fair, held at the ExCel Centre in Docklands on September 9 last year.The pollice allowed them to go on their way after nothing incriminating was found on them.Lord Woolf, sitting with Lord Justice Buxton and Lady Justice Arden, said: "Given the scale of the current terrorist threat, the powers under the act cannot be said to be an unreasonable intrusion into the human rights of those who were searched."The disadvantage of the intrusion is outweighed by the advantage that accrues from the possibility of a terrorist attack being foiled by the use of the power."The police were entitled to decide that the power should be exercised in relation to the arms fair, given its nature and its location near an airport and a previous site of a terrorist incident."However, on the evidence, the guidance that was given to the police on how the powers should be exercised was poor," said Lord Woolf. "It is important that, if the police are given exceptional powers, they are prepared to demonstrate that they are used with appropriate circumspection."Lord Woolf said it was clear that under the 2000 act parliament had "unusually" permitted random stopping and searching, subject to certain safeguards. It was "understandable" that the authorisations were not published.
