The Worksop Guardian did not harass the parents of convicted murderer Neil Entwistle when it published hostile letters about them, the press watchdog has ruled.The Press Complaints Commission has today rejected a number of complaints - including one of harassment - from the parents of Entwistle, who killed his baby daughter and wife Rachel in America, before fleeing to Britain.Cliff and Yvonne Entwistle said the Johnston Press newspaper had published numerous hostile letters after they maintained their son's innocence. They claimed that this breached codes on harassment and intrusion into grief and shock, because the paper wanted them to expand on their short published statement.The couple also complained about the Worksop Guardian's numerous attempts to contact them and that the paper clandestinely obtained a photograph of Mrs Entwistle.However, the PCC rejected the Entwistles' complaints, while acknowledging that the couple were caught up in a high-profile news story through no fault of their own. "The newspaper was entitled to cover the many different angles of the case, including the local context and the public's reaction to Mrs Entwistle's statement suggesting that Rachel Entwistle had murdered her child before committing suicide," the regulator said. "In light of her son's conviction for the double murder, the decision to issue this statement would inevitably have been controversial - and in these circumstances the commission did not consider that publishing a variety of views from readers in response, including those that were robustly critical, could be considered to be insensitive in breach of the code." The Worksop Guardian said the letters it published were a representative sample. It denied hounding the couple and added that it took a photo of Mrs Entwistle from a car on a public road.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
