He was arrested in Sussex several days after the attempted raid, which happened on 19 February.At Guildford crown court on Thursday, Valentine, of Walton-on-Thames, was jailed for six years and Price, also of Walton, for three years and nine months after they admitted possessing an imitation firearm, Surrey police said.A third person, 29-year-old Paula Green, of Weybridge, was sentenced to 15 months in jail for assisting an offender, police added.DS Joe Easterbrook said: “This was a highly unusual incident where two men in very distinctive clothing attempted to rob a local business in broad daylight.“The two members of staff working that day refused to be intimidated by the suspects and showed tremendous bravery to challenge the two men and stop Price from leaving the store until our officers arrived.“Although the members of staff were both very shaken by what took place, fortunately they both only suffered minor injuries during the incident.”
