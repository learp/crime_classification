Police firearms experts are to launch three investigations into the performance of the Cumbria police in the aftermath of last week's killing spree by Derrick Bird.The inquiries to be organised by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) will look in detail at how Bird was awarded licences to own the shotgun and the .22 rifle he used in the shootings, the police response and the resources deployed by Cumbria police, and whether any changes are needed to national police firearms procedures and tactics.The "peer reviews" by senior police officers follow a formal request from Cumbria's chief constable, Craig Mackey, to Acpo's president, Sir Hugh Orde, for outside help in reviewing the "police firearms response and firearms tactics."Questions were raised about whether the police did enough to halt Bird's shooting rampage through west Cumbria after it was disclosed that unarmed officers had trailed him but had to flee when he turned a gun on them.Whitehall sources made clear that the highly unusual step of setting up Acpo "peer reviews" will not rule out a full investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the response by the Cumbria police if a formal complaint is filed.The Cumbria chief constable said that he had ruled against a "self-referral" to the IPCC at this stage but had instead invited it to be involved in the Acpo reviews of firearms operations. "We have considered formally referring the incident to the IPCC, but at this stage we do not feel that is appropriate as the incident does not fall within the referral criteria," said Mackey.Orde said the peer reviews would benefit from being led by the senior police officers who hold the professional lead in their areas of expertise across the police service in England, Wales and Northern Ireland: "They are therefore uniquely placed to identify the issues going forward," he claimed.The decision to set up the inquiries was revealed by David Cameron, who promised MPs that the officers' findings would be made public when they reported in the autumn. He made the announcement after a minute's silence in the Commons for Bird's 12 victims.Cameron also gave the first indication of what will be involved in the official Home Office gun law review in the wake of the shootings. He expected it to include mental health issues such as '"follow-up checks" for licensed gun owners and police visits to people who kept guns and ammunition at home. But he said he recalled police evidence from when he served on the Commons home affairs select committee that there was "virtually no leakage" of legally held guns into the illegal black market."If we are looking for what the problem is, it is clearly that in our society we have a huge number of guns that we need to get rid of. Clearly, there was an appalling problem in this case, where, as I have said, a switch flicked in someone's head. We cannot legislate against that, but let us look at every aspect and ensure that we have the robust laws that we need," he said.The government has promised to lead a national debate on the gun laws with MPs debating the issue before the end of July.
