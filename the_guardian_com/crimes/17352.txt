One of the country's most contentious cases of alleged miscarriage of justice, in which two men were convicted of murdering a postmaster more than 30 years ago, returned to the court of appeal for a record sixth time yesterday.David Cooper and Michael McMahon, who were sentenced to life imprisonment for the Luton post office murder in 1970, died while trying to clear their names. In 1980 William Whitelaw, then home secretary, took the unusual step of ordering their immediate release, using the prerogative of mercy, but they have never been pardoned. Yesterday Ben Emmerson QC told Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Cresswell and Mr Justice Bennett: "This appeal represents the final chapter in what can, we submit, fairly be described as one of the longest running and most controversial criminal cases in English legal history." Mr Emmerson, representing Cooper's brother Terry Disher and McMahon's widow Susan, repeated the words of Lord Devlin, who said of the case: "Doubts do not just lurk; from the first they have flown about the case like bats in a belfry." He added that, in the light of fresh evidence, "there can be no doubt in our submission that these convictions are now to be regarded as unsafe". The case concerns the killing of sub-postmaster Reginald Stevens, shot dead in a bungled robbery in a car park near the Luton post office on September 10 1969. The numberplate of one of the vehicles in which the gang were seen fleeing led police to Alfred "The Fox" Mathews, a north London criminal already convicted for a post office robbery. But instead of being charged with murder, he was given immunity from prosecution, became the chief witness against Cooper, McMahon and a third man Patrick Murphy, and received Â£2,000 in reward money from the Post Office. The police officer in charge of the case was Chief Superintendent Ken Drury, who was later jailed for corruption. The hearing is expected to end today.
