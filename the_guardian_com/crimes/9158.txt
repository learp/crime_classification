An animal rights activist who piloted a gyrocopter that killed a hunt supporter spoke yesterday of his fear of reprisals following his acquittal for manslaughter.The blade of Bryan Griffiths's gyrocopter struck and killed Warwickshire hunt member Trevor Morse on 9 March last year at Long Marston airfield.Griffiths, 55, was cleared of manslaughter by gross negligence at Birmingham crown court on Wednesday.He is worried about reprisal attacks by hunt supporters who, he said, may feel he has not been made to pay for Mr Morse's death. He said: "If I had gone to prison I might have been safer because if these people felt I had received some punishment for what happened they might have let it drop."I would not put it past them to take it upon themselves to seek a bit of payback. If you go up against some of these people it can turn nasty."Griffiths has installed CCTV at his home in Bedworth, Warwickshire, and is on a police list of priority callers. If he sees an unfamiliar car outside his house, he takes down the registration number. He also fears for the safety of his wife, Dawn, 53."Ever since I started monitoring these people I was aware how they could be," he said. "They don't like being watched and they'll do anything they can to try to stop people watching them."But Mr Morse's death will stay with him for the rest of his life, he added."A man died and that's not going to be something you forget very quickly. At Christmas the thought crossed my mind that this was going to be his partner's first Christmas without him."A two-week trial heard that Mr Morse's head was cleaved "from top to bottom" by the rear rotor of the gyrocopter as he tried to stop it from taking off.Sam Butler, a Warwickshire hunt master, said: "At no stage has anyone in the Warwickshire hunt discussed using any form of physical action against hunt monitors."He described Mr Morse as "one of the most gentle men" he had ever met and said the hunt was "devastated" by his loss.
