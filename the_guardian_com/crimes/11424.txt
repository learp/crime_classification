Violent robbers armed with knives or guns are likely to receive longer sentences in future under draft guidelines published on Tuesday.Even muggers who threaten victims with a bladed weapon or imitation firearm will find themselves in the most serious category of offending when they come before the courts, according to recommendations by the Sentencing Council.The proposals, contained in a consultation paper on expanded guidelines for robbery, also introduce punishment ranges of up 20 years for those responsible for multiple attacks on commercial premises.Guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales do not alter the law but by setting out suggested ranges for offences ensure greater consistency across the courts and reflect shifts in public perceptions of crime.Penalties for robbery have risen by around 20% since 2007, according to the council, in a period of heightened concern over fatal stabbings and knife crime. Street robberies account for nearly two-thirds of all robbery convictions.“Sentence levels must reflect the serious social problem of offenders carrying knives,” the new guidelines state. “Even in cases where a knife is not produced, and indeed may not exist, if an offender threatens to use a knife the victim has every reason to believe the threat is real as there is societal concern that knife crime has become widespread. This is particularly true in street robberies.”Any offence where a knife or gun is used – or their use is threatened – “will be considered to be the most serious in order to ensure the longest sentences are given to offenders who arm themselves with weapons,” the council proposes. Under existing guidance, use of a weapon does not automatically mean offenders are put in the top category of seriousness.Judges are also urged to take into account the life-changing effect on victims of robberies who “may feel unable to continue to use public transport or walk home from school or work if that is where the offence occurred”.The chairman of the Sentencing Council, Lord Justice Treacy, said: “Robberies can leave victims injured or traumatised as well as losing property, so we are ensuring that the full impact of these offences is at the forefront of judges’ considerations about the length of sentence a robber should get.“Our proposals will give judges comprehensive guidance to help them sentence the great range of offenders who come before them, from a street mugger to gang members responsible for a major heist.”Overall robbery has declined: the number of adults sentenced fell from around 5,500 in 2011 to 4,400 in 2013.
