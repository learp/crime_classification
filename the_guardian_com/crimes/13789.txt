A new crackdown on anti-social behaviour to include making begging a recordable criminal offence is to be unveiled by the government.Truancy, throwing fireworks and other 'low-level' offences such as urinating in public will all be covered by a new system of on-the-spot fines. A Home Office spokesman refused to comment on the white paper, Winning Back our Communities, leaked to the Independent. But he said: "We have been looking at ways of dealing with anti-social behaviour for some time." The package of measures, the most authoritarian yet put together by the home secretary, will cause outrage among some Labour backbenchers and confirm David Blunkett's determination to pursue a zero-tolerance approach. According to the Independent, the white paper says begging can be intimidatory and "there is no need for anyone to beg in this country". It insists that the homeless are entitled to benefits, and it proposes making begging a "recordable offence". Convictions would form part of a criminal record. The Vagrancy Act of 1824 already makes it illegal to beg in a public place but is rarely used. A get-tough scheme is currently under way in Cambridge using various powers already inherent in the act to get beggars off the streets. It is thought the document dismisses the claim that people are forced to beg because they cannot get any state support without a home address. The government's attitude to rough sleepers has been widely criticised by homelessness lobbyists, who insist that there are still not enough hostel places for all people sleeping on the streets. There are also proposals for police, teachers and education authority staff to be entitled to issue fixed penalties of £40 or £60 to truants and, on a trial basis, possibly to children who throw fireworks or cycle on the pavement. But some ideas, such as Tony Blair's proposal to cut child benefit to parents whose children repeatedly play truant, appear to have been dropped after cabinet resistance.
