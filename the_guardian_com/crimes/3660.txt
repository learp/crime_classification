Two members of Portsmouth's victorious FA Cup squad have ended up losers after their winner's medals were stolen in a targeted burglary at the team's hotel.As defender Glen Johnson and substitute goalkeeper Jamie Ashdown celebrated Pompey's 1-0 win over Cardiff City at Wembley on Saturday, a burglar stole their medals.Johnson's was hidden in his washbag, while Ashdown's medal was in his jacket.They discovered the loss after returning to the exclusive riverside Oakley Court Hotel near Windsor following Sunday's victory parade through the streets of Portsmouth.Johnson, an England international said: "I put my medal in my washbag after the game at Wembley. When we got back to the hotel I put my washbag in my room, before packing it into my main bag on Sunday morning before the parade."We checked out of the rooms on Sunday morning and left our bags in a safe place to collect them after the parade. But when I got back to the hotel and checked to look at my winner's medal, it was gone."I'm so disappointed. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed someone's going to give it back."Ashdown, an unused substitute at Wembley, was devastated. "The medal was in its box in one of my jacket pockets. The jacket was hanging on the back of a chair while I enjoyed a drink at the hotel with some of the other players and their families."The Pompey chief executive, Peter Storrie, said: "If someone has taken these medals, they have deprived our players of their lifelong dream."The medals appear to have been taken from the hotel, which is unfortunate because the hotel looked after us so well for the three days we were there."Clearly someone has come in from outside knowing that these medals were about and focused on taking them."A spokesman for Thames Valley police said it was unclear if it the burglary was an inside job. "Our investigations are at a very early stage but we will be talking with staff at the hotel."
