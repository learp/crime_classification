Premier League footballer Joey Barton was today granted bail, barely five hours after magistrates refused to release him from custody.The Newcastle United and England midfielder had been in custody since he was arrested last Thursday.Earlier today he was denied bail at Liverpool magistrates court but a judge at the city's crown court later decided that he could be released, said his solicitor, Daniel Weed. Certain conditions were attached to his bail but they were not made public as the hearing was held behind closed doors. Barton appeared via video link from Walton prison, in Liverpool, wearing a grey prison-issue jumper and jeans. It is alleged that Barton and a group of friends were involved in two separate incidents after a row with another group inside a McDonald's restaurant in Church Street, Liverpool, at about 5.30am on December 27. He was charged and refused bail on the day after the alleged assault. During today's hearing at Liverpool magistrates court, the charge against the 25-year-old, from Widnes, Cheshire, was upgraded from common assault to assault causing actual bodily harm. Depending on the bail conditions, Barton may now be free to play in Newcastle's FA Cup tie at Stoke City on Sunday and the club's game away to Manchester United on January 12. He has already missed Newcastle's defeats against Chelsea and Manchester City. The player's brother, Andrew Barton, 19, from Widnes, is charged with actual bodily harm and affray, and Nadine Wilson, 27, from Huyton, Merseyside, is charged with common assault and affray. They did not appear today but will be in court alongside Barton on January 16.
