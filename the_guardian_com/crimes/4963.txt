I am sure the community will be equally disgusted, and I appeal to anyone who may have seen this man take the purse and walk off on Leigh Road.“There are a number of rumours circulating on social media at the moment, but I would like to reassure residents we are doing all we can to find out who is responsible.“However, for us to do so, we need your help. If you have any information, no matter how insignificant you think it may be, please call us as soon as possible.”The man is described as white, 6ft tall, aged between 30 and 40, medium build, with a dark brown beard, and wearing a light grey hooded top with the hood up, light blue jeans and black boot-style trainers.Anyone with information is asked to phone the police on 101 or the independent charity CrimeStoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
