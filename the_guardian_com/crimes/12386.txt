The teenager, who was arrested on Friday, was remanded in custody on charges of murder and robbery. He will appear before Leeds crown court next Monday.

The 16-year-old, who appeared before Dewsbury magistrates, is the fifth person to be charged with Amar's murder. Three 15-year-old boys and a man were remanded in custody by magistrates last week, and are due to appear before Leeds crown court on Thursday.The boys, who cannot be named, and Amin Hussain Ali, 20, from Dewsbury, are accused of killing Amar and robbing him of Â£10, a silver chain and a mobile phone. Three other youths also arrested last week have been released on police bail pending further inquiries.
