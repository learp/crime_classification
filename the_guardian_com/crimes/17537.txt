Thousands of rape investigations dating back years could be reopened under law reforms intended to increase conviction rates for sexual assault.Ministers want 'hearsay evidence', in which a victim tells family or friends about an attack but not the police, to be heard in court regardless of 'whether the complaint was made recently or not'. At the moment, such evidence is admissible only if the complaint of rape is made 'reasonably quickly' after an attack, meaning that a victim who has bottled up her experiences for several years is put at a disadvantage in court.Experts believe that many rape victims do not report an attack immediately to police because they are too shocked. 'We acknowledge that it is not the natural reaction of a victim of sexual assault to make a complaint spontaneously or early,' a Whitehall source told The Observer. 'We believe that evidence of the first complaint made by a victim of sexual assault...is likely to assist a jury in understanding the facts of that case.'The Attorney General, Baroness Scotland, will shortly announce the results of a 15-month consultation on methods to increase the number of guilty verdicts in rape cases.At present only one in 20 reported rapes leads to a conviction. Ministers pledged to reform the law after the conviction rate dropped from 33 per cent of reported rapes in 1977 to 5.4 per cent in 2005, before rising slightly to 5.7 per cent last year.Among other proposals still favoured by the government include offering the right for adult rape victims to show a videotape in court of their initial interview with the police. It is thought that such 'first complaint' evidence is more convincing than a court appearance, made many months later and often accompanied by hostile cross-examination.The government has, however, rejected the proposal to lower the burden of proof. It also believed to have abandoned the proposal to use experts to brief juries on the 'myths' surrounding rape.
