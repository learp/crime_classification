Humberside police service recorded the highest number of women murdered by their partners, and the City of London police the lowest, in the past five years, according to a new map of murder rates across England and Wales published by the government's Equalities Unit yesterday.The map was included in a report marking the first year since the unit was set up by Gordon Brown to monitor equality and diversity across Whitehall. It was published the day after the government announced a shake up to the traditional "crime of passion" defence in cases of domestic violence.Women's minister Harriet Harman, who is deputy leader of the Labour party and overseeing government matters while Brown is on holiday, said yesterday "there is no excuse for domestic violence". Separately, justice minister Maria Eagle was detailing plans to ensure those who beat their partners face justice.A spokesman for the Equalities Unit said: "We published the map because we wanted to show that domestic violence still happens across the country. Some people think it doesn't happen to their neighbour but we wanted to show it does."Between 2002 and 2007 Humberside police force recorded that 3.27 out of every 100,000 women had been reported as killed by a current or former partner. The City of London police force recorded no women killed in this way, while Avon and Somerset recorded only one woman for every 200,000 women.Alongside the map, the unit detailed progress made since it was set up soon after Brown became prime minister, including £225 million to support carers across the country, extending the right to flexible working to parents of children up to the age of 16 - which will help an extra 4.5 million parents - and creating a cross-government £1m emergency fund to support rape crisis centres.Later in the year Harman will run a "major awareness-raising campaign" with business secretary John Hutton on how to encourage Britain's carers to take up the right to flexible working.Government research shows only 9% of carers think the right to request leave applies to them, and only 7% of people think carers have the right to flexible working. The government will take steps in the autumn to make sure carers know what help is available.Harman said: "It's important that family members caring for older or disabled people don't have to give up their job. Only 7% of people know that carers have the right to request flexible working."
