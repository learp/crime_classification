A 13-year-old boy stole a people carrier and drove so fast that he could only be tracked by police helicopter, a court heard yesterday.The youth, who cannot be named, was recorded speeding at over 110mph and was spotted weaving in and out of the traffic as he raced across the Humber bridge. Hull magistrates court yesterday sentenced the boy to eight months' youth detention after hearing that he had stolen the Volkswagen Touran from a care home in the city in April after being involved in an argument about pocket money.Over a distance of 30 miles, he dodged the traffic and touched 80mph on the Humber bridge before crashing the vehicle in Scunthorpe, north Lincolnshire.He reached 110mph on the M180, where he drove on the hard shoulder to avoid the police. Officers decided it was too dangerous to continue with the chase by car and the Humberside force's helicopter followed the youngster's progress.Film taken from the helicopter showed the boy, who is now 14, bringing the vehicle to a halt after colliding with three cars parked on the street at a housing estate on the outskirts of Scunthorpe. Abandoning the car, he ran up a flight of stairs, leapt down walls and scrambled over fences. He was finally cornered and wrestled to the ground by two police officers.At sentencing, the youth was told that he had endangered the lives of dozens of motorists and pedestrians.At a previous hearing he had admitted taking the vehicle and having no licence or insurance.Last year Timothy Brady had his licence taken away from him for travelling at 172mph on a road near Oxford - the fastest driver ever caught in a routine speed trap.
