David Cameron claimed today that the  case of two young brothers who tortured a pair of boys in south Yorkshire had to be considered as part of what was "going wrong" in society.The Tory leader insisted that such cases could not be treated as individual and unrelated to the wider world.Speaking at a community centre in Gillingham, Kent, Cameron said: "We have had rising violent crime and I think it's wrong to say that each of these incidents come along and somehow there is no connection to what is going wrong in the rest of our society."Cameron, who was at a campaign event to talk about what he called Britain's "social recession", acknowledged that the problems went back decades.He cited the cases of James Bulger, Peter Connelly (Baby P), Damilola Taylor, Garry Newlove and Ben Kinsella, as well as the Edlington torture incident.He said: "On each occasion, are we just going to say this is an individual case? That there aren't any links to what is going wrong in our wider society, in terms of family breakdown, in terms of drug and alcohol abuse, in terms of violent videos, in terms of many of the things that were going wrong in that particular family?"I think we should ask these questions."He said the issue had to be addressed responsibly and he was not trying to blame any particular party or government."This has been going on for decades," he said."But do we have a problem in Britain with violent crime? Do we have a problem with some aspects of what's going on in childhood? Do we have a problem with our care system? Yes, we do."He went on to say there had been "incident after incident since 2004" and suggested that not enough had been done quickly enough."So, I think it's right to raise it in a responsible way and it's right to have this debate."Family and social policy is emerging as a key battleground ahead of the election, which must by held by 3 June but is widely expected to be called for 6 May.And aides said the hard-hitting speech would prove Cameron, who has warned of a "broken" society for several years, feels "comfortable" campaigning on traditional Labour territory.Cameron has called for the serious case review into a crime which "profoundly shocked the whole country" to be published. The two brothers were today sentenced to an indeterminate detention term of at least five years.Liam Byrne, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said people were entitled to be "white with rage" over what happened in Doncaster but added: "When people read what Mr Cameron is saying today, they will see this is quite an unpleasant speech."What Mr Cameron appears to be trying to do is seizing on one absolutely horrific crime and almost tarring the people of Doncaster, if not the people of Britain, with the same kind of standards and I think that people will recoil from that."Cameron was not planning to spell out any new policies in his speech today nor give details of his controversial plans for a tax break for married couples.Today the Daily Telegraph reported that motorists, air travellers and polluting firms could all be hit for a "family fund" that would be used to gradually introduce help for married couples. It said the details had been revealed by an unnamed shadow cabinet minister.But this morning George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Telegraph report was "a bizarre story that bears no relationship to the reality of our thinking in this area".
