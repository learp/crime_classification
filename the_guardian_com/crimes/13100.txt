A carpenter has admitted having a stash of explosives at his house – but only to make fireworks.Benjamin Harris, 30, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to two counts of having an explosive substance and one count of making an explosive substance.He denied having five documents useful for terrorism at the time of his arrest.Police uncovered Harris’s hoard when they raided his home in Heathfield, East Sussex, on 13 March 2013.They seized a quantity of black powders, pyrotechnic fuses, chemicals to make improvised fireworks, a small number of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and commercial fireworks.They also found a USB stick containing electronic manuals, text books, academic and other documents about explosives.At Thursday’s hearing at the Old Bailey, Harris admitted having black powder and oxidising agents as well as making 410g (14.5oz) of low-explosive black powder.Harris, who had already pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules and a cannabis offence, changed his pleas ahead of a trial due to start next week.Prosecutor William Hays told the court: “The Crown accepts what was taking place at his house was he was manufacturing explosives for the purposes of making fireworks.”He said it would not be in the public interest to pursue a trial for terrorism offences and asked for those charges to lie on file.Hays said he might apply for an antisocial behaviour order when Harris is sentenced on Friday 5 June.Requesting a pre-sentence report, Kieran Vaughan QC, defending, said: “He is a young man of 30 years of age and he has some psychological issues.”Harris was granted continued conditional bail until the next hearing.
