A British teenager may have been among the victims of a man who has been arrested in the Netherlands on suspicion of inciting 15-year-old girls to perform sex acts on the internet.Britain's National Crime Agency said Dutch prosecutors had started proceedings against the unnamed 35-year-old Dutch citizen, who is being held in custody.It is believed that young people from the UK, the Netherlands, the US and Canada were targeted and lured into performing sexual acts in front of a webcam.The Royal Canadian mounted police announced that a man had been charged in the Netherlands in connection with the suicide in 2012 of a Canadian teenager, Amanda Todd, who was bullied online.The suspect was charged with extortion, internet luring, criminal harassment and possession of child pornography in order to distribute it between January 2010 and October 2012, Canadian police said.Amanda posted a video before her death in which she said she had been blackmailed into exposing herself online. After pictures were posted on Facebook she was bullied online, and eventually she killed herself.Andy Baker, deputy director of the NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) command, said: "[We] have worked closely with international law enforcement agencies and colleagues from industry to help identify and locate the individual, who is suspected of inciting children and young people to commit sexual acts over webcam."This has been an extremely complex investigation with NCA officers, including our in-house specialist child protection advisers, viewing online material and speaking to both children and adult victims, to obtain evidence to help our Dutch colleagues apprehend this individual."The individual in this case used some of the most advanced techniques available to target his victims and in an attempt to hide himself, but his arrest demonstrates that the NCA will use technology, expertise and international co-operation to ensure that criminals who target British children have no place to hide."Canadian police said the announcement was a major milestone in the investigation into Amanda's death, which has spanned three and a half years and involved both national and international efforts.Inspector Paulette Freill, of the RCMP, said: "Thanks to the diligence of our investigators and the assistance of provincial, national and international partners we've achieved a major milestone: criminal charges. But our work isn't over and Amanda's story isn't done as long as the court processes here and in the Netherlands are still under way."
