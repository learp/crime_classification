Strings of tinsel were still draped around the living room and a box of crackers lay unopened on a shelf.On a bookcase there was a Christmas card that had been addressed but never sent, and a roll of wrapping paper lay unused beneath a table.Jurors spent 22 minutes on Wednesday visiting the Bristol flat where the landscape architect Joanna Yeates was allegedly murdered by her neighbour Vincent Tabak eight days before Christmas last year.They were told that her boyfriend, Greg Reardon, with whom she had shared the flat, had been back to their home to clear his belongings. But Yeates's things – her shoes, her clothes, her cuddly toys – remained as she had left them.The jury had already heard the prosecution's version of how Yeates, 25, was allegedly murdered at Flat 1, 44 Canynge Road, Clifton. It is alleged that Tabak, 33, strangled Yeates on the night of 17 December before going shopping, possibly with her body in the boot of his car, and then dumping it on a roadside verge three miles from the flat.On Wednesday morning, jurors left Bristol crown court to be shown key sites in the case. They was driven in a coach up Park Street in Bristol, where Yeates had enjoyed pre-Christmas drinks at the Ram pub with work colleagues before she was killed.Accompanied by court officials and guarded by police officers, they left the coach when they reached upmarket Clifton and walked to Tesco Express, where Yeates bought a pizza on her way home, and to a second store where she bought two bottles of cider.They briefly went inside Tabak's former home, Flat 2, but spent longer in Yeates's flat.The Christmas decorations were poignant and so too were Yeates's personal possessions: her running shoes, boots and cycle helmet in the hall; a water glass, medicine and white comb on a bedside table.Still in situ were hair straighteners, perfumes, body lotion and nail vanish. A purple jewellery box contained trinkets, earrings and hairgrips.Also still there were two cuddly mice, a large toy spider, a My Little Pony figure and a ceramic smiley cat.In the living room was a signed picture from members of the cast of the sci-fi comedy series Red Dwarf addressed to "Jo and Greg". There was a bowl of Love Heart sweets, and on a table an empty bottle of cider.There were reminders, also, that this was a crime scene. All of the carpets had been removed and fingerprint dust could be seen on cupboards and in the shower.Tabak, who has admitted manslaughter but denies murder, did not accompany the jury.Before the visit, William Clegg QC, Tabak's barrister, asked the jury to consider certain areas closely. Clegg said he wanted jurors to think about the time it would take to walk from a pub called the Hophouse to 44 Canynge Road.The prosecution has said Yeates was captured on a CCTV camera outside the pub as she walked home on the night she died. Its case is that Yeates would have taken just a few minutes to walk home after passing that camera, and was attacked within a few minutes of arriving back at her flat.Clegg also asked them to consider carefully the view from the kitchen window in her flat. Clegg said the defence would say it was through this window that Yeates and Tabak, a Dutch engineer, first saw each other on the night she died.In addition, Tabak's barrister asked the jury to cross to the other side of the road to 53 Canynge Road, where a party had taken place on the night of Yeates's death. The jury has been told that a partygoer heard screams as she walked up the path of number 53.Clegg said: "We would like you to go there and have in mind, having already been to No 44, whether in your judgment you think it possible that the scream that was made inside the flat of No 44 could possibly be heard if you are standing outside No 53."The defence are going to suggest that it was by no means certain that the scream that was heard was connected to this event at all because of the distance involved."The jurors completed their trip by visiting the verge on Longwood Lane, Failand, three miles from Clifton, where Yeates's body was found under a mound of snow on Christmas morning.The six men and six women returned to the crown court, where they are due to hear the first evidence from witnesses on Thursday.
