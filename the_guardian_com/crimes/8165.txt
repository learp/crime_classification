The 'Bradford Batman' dramatically unveiled his true identity on Monday night after becoming an internet sensation.CCTV images of a caped crusader delivering a wanted man to Bradford police caused much amusement and wild speculation as to who the hero behind the mask was.After delivering the suspect to Trafalgar House police station, the lycra-clad superhero disappeared into the night. Police were unsure of his identity and it led to many speculating it could even be the local MP George Galloway - who is no stranger to catsuits - but the Respect MP took to Twitter to deny the rumours.Finally, the crime-fighter broke cover to explain how he ended up marching into the police station in the early hours of the morning and handing police the man wanted on allegations of burglary, fraud and breaching a court order.Stan Worby, 39, told the Daily Telegraph that he was the Dark Knight. Worby, a Chinese takeaway driver from the Wyke area of the city, said he drove his old friend Danny Frayne, 27, into the long arms of the law after returning from Bradford City's Capital One Cup game against Swansea at Wembley stadium, which he had attended in fancy dress.Worby said: "I got a call from Danny while I was at Wembley and he said, 'can you run me to the cop station?' But as I was in London I couldn't."I told him as soon as I was home I would run him to Bradford central police station. We got back about 1am, and I picked Danny up in a minibus at 1.30am."I got some strange looks when I got to the cop station though. One policeman looked at me and just laughed."I said to the policeman, 'I deserve a medal, I'm a caped crusader'."He added: "It was a joke at the end of the day and Danny wanted to go to the police station. I had spoken to Danny during the week and tried to knock some sense into him. It was getting on my nerves having police round all the time asking for him or his whereabouts."Danny's a good friend of mine and I've known him for 15 years or so. Who knows if I'll be doing some more crime-fighting in the future?"
