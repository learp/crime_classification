The largest haul of paramilitary weapons found in Northern Ireland for years was discovered by an amateur metal detector enthusiast, security sources have confirmed.Sixteen semi-automatic handguns and 800 rounds of ammunition were buried in woodland on the Lisnabreeny estate, a National Trust property on the south-east outskirts of Belfast.The guns and ammunition are believed to have been hidden there for several years and were in good condition.According to security sources in the province, the discovery was made by a man using a metal detector at the weekend rather than after a tip-off from informants.The guns, thought to be from eastern Europe, are being examined to see if they have ever been used.Jimmy Spratt, a Democratic Unionist member of the assembly and retired police officer, said he believed the cache had not been buried deep underground, which suggested an amateur operation."It was a matter of inches from the surface. From my previous police experience, the situation looked quite amateurish. It looks like they were put into a five-gallon oil drum and buried. It was fresh digging that has taken place fairly recently."I have an open mind about who owns the guns and I think we should allow the police to finish their investigations," Spratt said."The good thing about it is that at least now the weapons are in safe hands.They cannot now be used for the purposes for which they were brought in and that was to cause murder and mayhem on the streets."
