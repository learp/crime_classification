British scientists are developing technology that will enable CCTV cameras to "hear" a crime taking place and spin round to capture it on film.Researchers are working on artificial intelligence software that can recognise sounds such as breaking glass, shouting or crowds gathering, and prompt a camera to swing towards the noise in 300 milliseconds - the same time it would take a person to turn their head if they heard someone scream. The software may eventually be able to identify words that suggest a crime is being committed. The three-year project at Portsmouth University's institute of industrial research aims to adapt software that is being developed to identify visual patterns such as someone raising their arm suddenly or running. Dr David Brown, director of the institute, said: "The longer artificial intelligence is in the software the more it learns. Later versions will get cleverer as time goes on, perhaps eventually being able to identify specific words being said, or violent sounds."
