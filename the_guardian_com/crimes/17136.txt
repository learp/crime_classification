The appointment of John Grieve yesterday as head of the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation team is the latest in a series of tough appointments for this highly-rated, intellectual detective. His appointment as head of the racial and violent crime taskforce last July was welcomed outside the Met as a sign that the Commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, was taking serious steps to address the loss of confidence among the black community in the wake of the Lawrence debacle. "Garrulous, friendly, but underneath extremely tough," was one observer's verdict last night.  Mr Grieve assiduously attended almost all the Lawrence inquiry hearings, including those outside London, and even went to the first night of The Colour of Justice, the Guardian journalist Richard Norton-Taylor's play on the subject. He was influential in the recent Met apology to the family of the black musician Michael Menson. Driven, liberal, committed to changing the culture, he is encountering resistance from conservatives in the force and needs a major tangible success in his new job. Deputy Commissioner John Stevens said yesterday that Mr Grieve's "analytical" approach would bring "fresh eyes" to the Lawrence inquiry. Mr Grieve, aged 52, was highly rated in his previous role as head of the anti-terrorist branch, SO13. He arrived in the post just as the IRA broke its first ceasefire by detonating the Canary Wharf bomb in February 1996. Far from demoralised, he led the team to a series of successes, including foiling an IRA plot to paralyse London by cutting road, water and electricity links. He was born in Gosforth, near Newcastle upon Tyne, and knew at the age of 11 that he wanted to be a detective. Initially rejected because of bad eyesight, he persisted, and started on the beat in Clapham, south London. He is a formidably hard worker, used to arriving early and leaving late after 12-14 hours.
