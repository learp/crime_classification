Suicide and murder rate in prisons in England and Wales have reached their highest levels in years according to figures released by the Ministry of Justice.In 2013, there were four alleged homicides – the highest number since 1998 – and 70 apparently self-inflicted deaths, more than at any time since 2008. There were 199 deaths in prisons in England and Wales in total.Male prisoners' suicide and self-harm is rising year on year. In 2013, five male prisons each recorded three self-inflicted deaths.The suicide rate among female prisoners has fallen, thanks to safety measures recommended by former Labour MP Lady Corston in a report published in 2007.Her report followed a sharp rise in female prisoners' suicides, including six deaths in Styal prison in 2003.Statistics gathered by the Prison Reform Trust indicate mental health problems may be behind the increase in suicide and self-harm rates: 26% of women and 16% of men were treated for a mental health problem in the year before custody.And 62% of male and 52% female prisoners are classed as having a personality disorder.Commenting on the rise in apparent prison homicides, Professor David Wilson, head of criminology at Birmingham City University and a former prison governor, said: "This is the highest number of alleged murders since 1998 and it reflects deep structural problems about control and order inside our jails – not our most high-security jails, but every prison in which we currently lock people up."In February last year, Subhan Anwar, 25, serving a life sentence for the murder of his partner's baby, was killed at Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire. Two prisoners are awaiting trial for the killing.In the same month, four prisoners were charged with the murder of 25-year-old Adnan Rafiq, an inmate at Hewell prison, Redditch, Worcestershire.Last October, a prisoner at Lincoln jail was charged with the murder of Alan Goode. Goode, 73, was serving nine months for serial voyeurism after spying on women in toilets in Leicester.And in December a 22-year-old prisoner, Michael Hennesy, died from stab wounds at Lindholme prison, South Yorkshire. Two prisoners will stand trial for the killing.An inspection report of Lindholme in the summer was highly critical of safety measures at the jail. More than a third of prisoners said they felt unsafe and inspectors said drugs and alcohol were freely available at the category C prison.Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said almost all the deaths in custody were preventable."The responsibility for an increase in the number of people who take their own lives in prison lies squarely with those who advocate putting behind bars more and more people who do not need to be there."A Prison Service spokesman said: "We are committed to making sure prisons are safe and secure – this includes reducing the number of deaths and applying strenuous efforts to learn from each one."A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: "Every death is subject to an investigation by the police and the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman as well as a coroner's inquest."
