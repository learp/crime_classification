A convicted rapist who won Â£7m in the lottery while serving his sentence was yesterday released from jail. Iorworth Hoare, 52, was jailed for life in 1989 for attempting to rape a 60-year-old woman in a park.Hoare has been released on strict conditions under a life licence. He will have to meet probation requirements and could be taken into custody if he breaches parole terms. Hoare, who had lived in Leeds, had previous convictions for rape, two attempted rapes and three indecent assaults. He was on temporary release from a Middlesbrough bail hostel in August last year when his numbers came up. His win led the then home secretary, David Blunkett, to say the government planned to recover compensation if offenders won the lottery. Yesterday a spokesperson for the lottery operator, Camelot, said rights of prisoners were a matter for the Home Office. The Home Office said it was looking at how to make it easier for victims to claim compensation from offenders who come into money after their conviction. "A victim can only sue an offender for six years after the crime has taken place, and we are looking at the possibility of extending this timescale," said a spokesperson.
