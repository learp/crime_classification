A man arrested for drunken domestic violence could face a murder charge after a police car taking him to the cells crashed following a reported disturbance, killing the constable at the wheel.PC Joe Carroll, 46, died from severe head injuries when his patrol car skidded off a main road in Northumberland at 2.30am yesterday, overturned and slid up an embankment on its roof. The arrested man and a police inspector who was also in the car were treated for minor injuries.Tributes to PC Carroll were led by the home secretary, Charles Clarke, who said he exemplified the "dedication of our police in their work to uphold the law and protect the public in often very challenging circumstances".Colleagues and neighbours described him as "the perfect community bobby". PC Carroll had recently been decorated for 24 years of unblemished service.The prisoner, aged 40, who has been arrested on suspicion of murder, was being transferred 20 miles to Newcastle upon Tyne after being arrested following an emergency call from his home near Hexham, where cells at the local police station were full. No other vehicles were involved in the accident, which closed the A69 near Corbridge for most of yesterday.The chief constable of Northumberland, Mike Craik, said: "Joe was a real old-fashioned copper."Detectives are expected to question the man today while forensic work continues on the wrecked patrol car, which lay covered in sheeting on the embankment last night. A police spokeswoman said: "We believe something happened in the car, but what it was and who was sitting where is all part of the investigation."Friends and relatives of PC Carroll and his wife Caroline, who teaches in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, gathered yesterday at the couple's home overlooking the village of West Woodburn. The chair of the Police Federation, Jan Berry, said: "This tragedy highlights the unknown dangers police officers face every day serving their local communities."PC Carroll had worked for 13 years at Bellingham, where his five colleagues started a book of condolence last night. The first entry, by Inspector Kerr Henry, said: "A true and loyal rural community police officer, well respected by family, friends, and the community."A friend tragically taken."
