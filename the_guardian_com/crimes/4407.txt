A man has been jailed for 17 years after stabbing his girlfriend to death.Two days before her death, Victoria Adams, 22, told friends that Andre Bright, 30, had thrown a bottle at her and degraded her by spitting in her face and taunting her that he was going to sleep with her friends. Bright’s abusive behaviour culminated in returning to her home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he fatally stabbed her in the chest and abdomen with a kitchen knife.Bright was found guilty of murder by a jury at Manchester crown court on Friday. Prosecutors said the defendant was extremely drunk and suffering from the effects of cocaine at the time of the attack but consciously intended to kill or seriously harm Adams on the morning of 8 December 2013.Bright was shot with a Taser by a police officer at the scene and, when warned he might be shot again, he said: “I enjoyed that. You need more volts in your Taser.”Opening the case, Mark Kellett said Bright and Adams had been in an on-off relationship since 2007 and had a young daughter, born in August 2013.On 5 December that year Adams had her first night out with friends since her daughter’s birth, the court was told.Bright called at her home in the early hours of the next day and his alleged behaviour was said to have led his tearful girlfriend to flee in her dressing gown and bare feet to a friend’s house.Kellett said: “She told them that she had run from her house fearing that Andre Bright would kill her.”The following night Bright was out drinking in Oldham with friends when he was refused entry to a bar.Said to be a known troublemaker, Bright – who was barred from a number of nightspots – confronted a bouncer and then attempted to urinate on him, said Kellett.CCTV footage captured the bouncer trying to push him away before the defendant pulled an Afro comb from his hair and repeatedly stabbed his face and head, causing cuts and grazes, jurors heard.Adams left her home in Springwood Hall Road again when Bright arrived in the early hours of the morning and did not return until she knew he had gone.Bright left but later got in a taxi from an address in Royton to her home at about 9.35am. Nearly 30 minutes later, he rang the emergency services and told the operator: “Someone is dying in front of me ... someone has stabbed her, I don’t know what’s happened. She’s dying.”Kellett said Bright became angry as the call-taker tried to get more information from him and, when asked for the third time how the stabbing had happened, he replied: “Shut up”, and put the phone down.Bright was said to have “a fixed, vacant gaze” when police attended and pointed that his girlfriend was in the hallway.He continued to stare vacantly, with his hands inside his tracksuit pockets, as the Taser was deployed when police feared he may still have a knife, the jury heard.A female officer stated that Bright looked directly at her and smiled as he was put in a police van.Adams was taken to Manchester royal infirmary but died from her injuries.Her baby daughter was found in an upstairs bedroom when emergency services arrived at her house.Bright gave no comment as he was interviewed but provided a defence statement last April that said his case was set out as “a combination of accident and psychotic incident”, in that he acted unconsciously and was not in control of his actions.Bright, of Falmouth Street, Oldham, was also found guilty of assaulting bouncer Matthew Wilkinson, causing him actual bodily harm.Following sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington of Greater Manchester police, said: “Bright’s relationship with Victoria had been described as volatile and his family members had noticed he had recently been drinking heavily and taking drugs.“For reasons only known to Bright himself, he decided he would get a taxi to Miss Adam’s house and stab her.“Victoria had a young daughter and, tragically, she will grow up never really knowing who she was. Not only has Bright robbed her of her mum, he has also taken away a beloved daughter of Victoria’s parents. They have been left truly devastated by what happened that morning and will never truly recover.”
