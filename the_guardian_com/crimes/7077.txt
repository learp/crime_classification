During the summer, our book on undercover policing was published.Undercover - the true story of Britain's secret police - revealed a hidden slice of British life.It described a top-secret operation that has so far lasted 40 years. It charted how police chiefs sent officers to spy on political groups for years on end.My colleague Paul Lewis and I started writing the book in 2011. While we were doing so, we started an experiment.We wrote a blog as we were researching and writing the book. We wanted to give you an idea of where we were heading in our investigation. We set out our thinking behind the blog here. We asked you to collaborate with us, by giving us your thoughts and leads. It was, we thought, successful as many people gave us tips and solid information which we were able to use in the book.It seems that the story of the undercover policing of political groups is far from over, so we thought that we should resume the blog. We hope to be able to update you as developments occur.You can always send me a private email at rob.evans@theguardian.com
