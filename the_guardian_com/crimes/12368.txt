Final details of a "victims' surcharge" on all criminal fines will be published today.From this weekend anyone given a fine after being convicted of a criminal offence in court will have to pay an additional £15.The levy will go towards a fund to help improve services for victims of crime.The £15 is a flat-rate charge and will apply no matter how big or small the fine.The surcharge - introduced as part of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 - is part of an attempt by the home secretary, John Reid, to "rebalance" the criminal justice system in favour of victims.It will not apply to on-the-spot fines at this stage.The act does allow the levy to be added to fixed penalty notices but a Home Office spokesman said this would take place at a future date "when it is feasible to do so".
