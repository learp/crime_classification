An “immature and naive” young woman who was strung along by her jihadi boyfriend wept in court as she was told she would not go to prison for agreeing to send him money.Hana Khan, from Willesden, north-west London, was 21 when, in the summer of 2013, she was seduced by dreams of marriage into giving Jafar Turay a total of £1,000 while he was fighting in Syria.Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Khan was found guilty of two counts of funding terrorism and sentenced to 21 months in prison, suspended for two years.The judge Gerald Gordon said hers was an exceptional case, because she had not been radicalised but had acted out of a misguided notion that he was serious about making her his wife and setting up home in Turkey.The defendant hugged herself in the dock and choked back tears as he told her: “I have no doubt that although you knew something of his criminal and gang background in this country you believed that you could change him, and that belief was reinforced when you heard that he had a pilgrimage to Mecca.“When after that he went to Egypt to study you paid two sums of money in order to help him live and study. It seems, and perhaps in the current climate it would have seemed then, that the study in fact involved further radicalisation, but the prosecution did not suggest that you knew that at that stage what was happening.“You, in my view, absolutely believed that your relationship was leading towards marriage, reinforced in your mind when he gave you details of his mother. You were blind to what should have been obvious, that fighting was the reason he was in Syria and at times in Turkey and Egypt also.”The judge said Khan was in marked contrast to other young women in the UK who had gone to join jihadi fighters out of conviction.He went on: “Having considered all the circumstances … I do not think that you were at any stage radicalised. Your enthusiasms were of a very different nature.“In any event I have no doubt that if there were any thoughts of radicalisation they were snuffed out when, on the 12th of August 2013, he unceremoniously dumped you by telling you that he was marrying someone else the next day.“What he did not have the decency to say was he was cheating on you and lying to you for some time before that.”In mitigation, Frida Hussain, told the court that Khan, now 23, was “young and naive” and came from a normal family of professionals, while Turay was older and more mature.She said: “He had completely ulterior motives not least by stringing her along with some notion of marriage where he intended to marry somebody else.”The lawyer said Turay had a knack of contacting Khan when she was at a low ebb, around the time that her father was dying from cancer and her mother had gone to Pakistan.She went on: “Whatever notion she had of the future was absolutely pie in the sky and she can see that now.”Khan smiled tearfully at supporters in the public gallery who had said “thank you” to the judge after he sentenced her.Her co-defendant, Anton Atkins, 31, of Woolwich Common, was found not guilty of four counts of funding Turay following the trial in February.Following Khan’s conviction, Det Ch Supt Terri Nicholson, of the Metropolitan police SO15 counter-terrorism command, said: “Terrorists require the support and assistance of others to carry out their activities. As such, our investigations will always extend beyond those involved directly in terrorist attacks, seeking to identify those engaged in terrorist funding by whatever means.“This conviction should send a very powerful message to anyone involved in terrorism, whether in the UK or overseas, the offences are serious regardless of the amounts of money involved.”
