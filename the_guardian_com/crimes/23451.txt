The early release of prisoners on electronic tagging schemes may be eroding public confidence in the criminal justice system, according to the findings of an independent inquiry published today.The home detention curfew (HDC), introduced by the home secretary, David Blunkett, in 1999, allows non-dangerous and non-violent offenders to be released up to 135 days early.The Crime, Courts and Confidence report, commissioned by the think-tank Rethinking Crime and Punishment at a cost of Â£455,000, criticises the scheme and presents a radical set of proposals to reduce prison overcrowding by boosting confidence in community sentences.Lord Coulsfield, chairman of the inquiry, said of the HDC: "It's a framework we think is unfortunate because it interferes with the court's decision. It is another thing which is capable of suggesting to the public that what the court says is not what actually happens."He said sentencing should be more transparent so that jail terms "mean what they say", adding: "We tried to identify what creates a lack of public confidence in the system and we think this was one of them." But he accepted there would be "political difficulties" involved in such a move because sentences pronounced by judges would be lower than at present.Other proposals contained in today's report include forcing people who are sentenced to non-custodial punishments to be "sent down" from the dock as if being jailed, so they can immediately begin arranging their first fine payment or probation session.The report urges ministers to change the law so courts cannot jail criminals who breach a community sentence or default on a fine, where the original offence would not merit custody. Breaches of community punishment and rehabilitation orders rose 10% from 1997 to 2002, while the number of people jailed for breaches fell from 35% to just 19% in the same period.It also suggests community panels should be set up so local residents play a key role in deciding which projects - such as cleaning graffiti or litter-picking - should be tackled by offenders on community sentences. Rob Allen, director of Rethinking Crime and Punishment, said: "Giving local people a say in how offenders are punished in the community could boost public confidence in alternatives to prison."Rather than promising tougher and tougher prison sentences, politicians of all parties should look to involving businesses, charities and civil society groups much more in the supervision of offenders."A Mori survey of 1,977 people across Britain earlier this month, conducted for the report, found almost two out of three people wanted a say in the kind of punishment undertaken by offenders in the community.Responding to the report, shadow home secretary David Davis said: "Under Labour, confidence in our criminal justice system has fallen because David Blunkett is more obsessed with emptying prisons than punishing criminals."Conservatives would scrap Labour's early release scheme and start a prison building programme to allow judges to give prisoners the sentence they deserve. Tagging should be used as an addition, not an alternative to prison. Sentences should fit the crime, not the number of prison cells available."Prisons minister Paul Goggins defended the use of electronic tags and the early-release scheme. "We have had home detention curfews for five years and it works very effectively," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."The vast majority of prisoners on HDC fulfil all their obligations successfully and only 2% re-offend whilst on HDC. It does help reintegrate prisoners into the community. It doesn't interfere with the court's decision, because the court will know at the point of sentence that HDC is available for that particular prisoner and that particular sentence."I think the public has increasing confidence in electronic surveillance as a way of containing prisoners and ex-offenders out on licence."Mr Goggins said the Home Office agreed with "90%" of Lord Coulsfield's report. "It is important, of course, that the public have confidence in the criminal justice system," he said. "That's why we are introducing the new sentencing framework from next year, where those people who are dangerous will be given an indeterminate sentence and won't be allowed out until it is safe to do so."I think the message should go out loud and clear both from Lord Coulsfield's inquiry and indeed from the government that short-term prison sentences are a waste of time. It would be better for people to be on community sentences, so that prison is reserved for the most serious and the most dangerous."
