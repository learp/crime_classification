It is disheartening, but not altogether surprising, to read that rape conviction rates are still abysmally low when one considers that funding for rape crisis centres is at a critical nadir (Report, July 21). The government's commitment to criminal justice in rape cases should be matched by their commitment to the victims of rape. But with none of the 32 rape crisis centres in England and Wales receiving any stable, statutory funding, half of all rape crisis centres could now face closure. How can we expect women to have any faith in securing a conviction when their needs are so flagrantly sidelined in rape service provision?Vivienne HayesDirector, Women's Resource CentreI can only conclude from his bizarre letter (July 24) that Piers Corbyn, like almost all global warming sceptics that I have come across, has not actually read the IPCC reports. They are packed full of predictions of the effects of carbon dioxide emissions on our climate. What they do not contain is any meteorological astrology.Professor Mike LockwoodSouthampton UniversityAs well as houses on stilts (Letters, July 25) there are also houses which float (not houseboats) at Marsbommel and elsewhere in the Netherlands. Shouldn't these be considered for the Thames Gateway expansion?DBC ReedThorplands, NorthamptonMy colleague and I were wondering when the quick crossword will cease with the floral clues. Could you either provide us with a wallchart, or perhaps change the theme to something more appropriate, such as types of rain?Sonal ShahBirminghamThis cool, wet summer does have one thing in its favour: it is spoiling the fun of those of my neighbours who are incapable of sitting in their gardens without the accompaniment of loud music.Paul KeelingWelling, KentRe Vanda Vickers (Letters, July 25) receiving a 9.20am delivery of the latest Harry Potter book.
