Police investigating the murder of Mary-Ann Leneghan last night arrested two more men, in London and Birmingham, taking to seven those arrested in connection with the attack last Saturday.Police also confirmed a third girl was with Mary-Ann and an 18-year-old minutes before they were abducted and subjected to a "horrendous" physical and sexual assault. The third girl was not attacked.Mary-Ann, 16, and her friend were sitting in a car near the disused Wallingford Arms pub in Reading last Friday night when they were approached by up to six men.They were forced into a vehicle and assaulted for several hours before being left for dead in a nearby park.Mary-Ann died from a single stab wound to her neck, while the 18-year-old - who has not been named - survived being shot in the head. She is in a stable condition in hospital and is helping the police.A man in his mid-20s arrested on Tuesday in London was still being questioned by police over the attack.Police have said they believed there were other people in the car park at the time of the teenagers' abduction.They believe the attack was not random and that the teenagers were targeted, although they have yet to establish a motive.Forensic teams yesterday began searching a flat above a massage parlour for clues to the attack. A witness said up to 12 armed police with dogs entered the property late on Tuesday night and later took away boxes of evidence.Police said the property was unoccupied and there were no arrests.A local woman told reporters she had often seen Mary-Ann and her friend hanging around on a corner near the massage parlour late at night and in the early hours. She added that she had seen the teenager near a red light district.Detective Superintendent Mark Warwick, who is leading the investigation, said the attack was "one of the most horrendous" he had seen. "It has shocked and stunned all officers who have been involved."He added: "An incident of this nature is bound to send shockwaves in the community and, with that, comes speculation, rumour and gossip."Everyone has their own opinion of what happened and why. We are just as keen to get to the bottom of what happened to the girls, and why, as everyone else in this town."Police are examining a blue Mercedes, recovered from the River Thames in the town on Tuesday, for potential forensic clues.Up to 60 police officers have joined the round-the-clock hunt and a reward of Â£15,000 has been offered to help catch the killers.
