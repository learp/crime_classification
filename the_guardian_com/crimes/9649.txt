Two men were yesterday convicted of murder after they broke into a house and machine-gunned a churchgoing teenage boy to death as he lay sleeping in his bed.The pair had been intending to kill his older brother, who was a drug dealer. Michael Dosunmu, 15, was sleeping under a duvet in the bedroom he shared with his brother Hakeem in Peckham, south-east London, when the two burst in and shot him four times with a Mac 10 submachine gun in February last year. Yesterday at the Old Bailey, Mohammed Sannoh, 19, of Peckham, and Abdi Omar Noor, 22, of Camberwell, south-east London, were found guilty of the murder. The pair had wanted to kill Hakeem after a feud broke out among a criminal gang over stolen money, which led to one gang member being killed. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, prosecuting, said Sannoh and Noor forced the front door of Michael's family home in the early hours of the morning, and opened fire at a figure lying wrapped in a duvet. "That person had no chance of surviving. He had done nothing wrong."The court heard that Hakeem Dosunmu's life fell apart after he returned from five years in the army. He was court-martialled over a fight following what he claimed was a racial incident. On his return to civilian life he fell in with a group involved in robbing security vans. A gang involving Hakeem had staged a robbery on a security firm, but fell out over the money. One gang member was stabbed to death, and the two gunmen targeted Hakeem in revenge for that death.Hakeem, 26, admitted his part in the robberies and gave evidence in the trial of his brother's killers. He had a possible five-year sentence for his part in the robberies reduced to two years. After yesterday's verdict Rasak Dosunmu, Michael's father, said the family was sticking by Hakeem. He said: "He is feeling guilty that he brought all this on us. He is our son, we love him. We cannot discard him. He made a mistake in life."
