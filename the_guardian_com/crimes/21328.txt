An orchid collector has been jailed for four months for smuggling more than 126 rare orchids into Britain from Malaysia, including six slipper orchids, which are on the brink of extinction.Pharmaceutical researcher Sian Lim, 32, admitted 13 charges of illegally importing rare orchids in 2004, but denied doing it for commercial gain, claiming he had only brought them back because he feared the climate in his native Malaysia was "too hot".One of the plants, a Paphiopedilum rothschildianum, is so rare that David Roberts, a Kew Gardens orchid expert, said he had never seen it exhibited.Lim, who cultivates orchids at home in Putney, south London, has been granted nearly 400 permits to import orchids for trade since 2003. Isleworth crown court judge Richard McGregor Johnson said he had a "cavalier attitude" to rules designed to protect species.
