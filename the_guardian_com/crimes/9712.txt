Lord Archer was yesterday moved to an open prison in Suffolk only three weeks after being sent to the high-security Lincoln jail for breaking prison rules.The former Tory party deputy chairman arrived yesterday at HMP Hollesley Bay Colony, nicknamed "Holiday Bay", at Woodbridge on the Suffolk coast to serve the rest of his four-year sentence for perjury. He will be become eligible for parole next summer. Archer is not expected to be allowed out to work on day release to avoid a repeat of embarrassing events when he was allowed a backstage job at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln. It is also expected that he will not initially be given any home leave as a result of his attendance at a party hosted by his former Conservative colleague, Gillian Shephard. Hollesley Bay with 1,500 acres, is the largest estate in the prison system and has a seaside location, a relaxed regime and a dairy herd, stud farm and excellent sports facilities, including an outdoor pursuits centre. Many of the 350 inmates are lifers reaching the end of their sentences. Archer will be in a single room with integral sanitation. Some units have a sea view.
