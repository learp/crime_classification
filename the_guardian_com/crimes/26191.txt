Two brothers who used their printing firm's Christmas and new year break to churn out £1.2m worth of fake banknotes have been jailed for seven years each.Amrit Karra, 45, and Prem Karra, 43, acted as "masterminds and architects" of the highly sophisticated counterfeiting operation, Birmingham crown court heard.Sentencing the brothers and two other men who also took part in the scam, Judge Richard Bond said such offences undermined the integrity of the UK's financial system.The Karra brothers and their brothers-in-law, Rajiv Kumar, 40, and Yash Mahey, 44, were convicted of conspiracy to produce counterfeit notes after a five-week trial that ended in December.The trial heard that the Karras, from Walsall, Kumar, from West Bromwich, and Mahey, from Handsworth in Birmingham, even worked through the night to print fake £10 notes with a face value of at least £1.27m.The four men used specialist paper, inks and foil to run off the near-perfect forgeries at a printworks in Hockley, Birmingham.Bond told the men, who are all married with children: "People who commit offences of this type must realise that those who counterfeit currency must expect long sentences of imprisonment."In this case, the amount of money produced and disseminated into general circulation was enormous."Production of counterfeit notes undermines the whole economy of the country … essentially it undermines the whole integrity of the currency system."It is so serious that only lengthy custodial sentences can be justified."Jailing Mahey and Kumar for four and a half years, and barring the Karra brothers from acting as company directors, Bond said the offences had been motivated by greed.He told the defendants: "All four of you knew what would happen to the notes."You knew that if you were caught it would affect your wives and your children and other members of your immediate family."Knowing, as you did, the consequences of being caught, you ignored your families. The risks taken in this case were high, and you must personally take the blame."
