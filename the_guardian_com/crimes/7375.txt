A 35-year-old man who pushed a distinguished lawyer in front of a tube train has been cleared of murder but faces a long prison sentence.Senthooran Kanagasingham was undergoing sex-change treatment when he killed David Burgess, a leading human rights and immigration lawyer, at King's Cross station in London.Kanagasingham, of Cricklewood, north London, was found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at the Old Bailey on Thursday.He faces a long prison sentence after doctors said he no longer requires hospital treatment for paranoid schizophrenia.David Burgess was a cross-dresser who was known to his friends and family as Sonia.Sonia had befriended Kanagasingham, then known as Nina, and brought him to her GP just before the incident in October last year.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said shocked rush-hour commuters had seen Kanagasingham push Sonia from the back.A note found in Kanagasingham's rucksack said he was "broke, depressed and suffering from gender dysphoria".Altman said David Burgess, who was divorced, had built "an enviable and brilliant reputation" as a solicitor in human rights and immigration law.He said: "However, socially, the deceased lived as a woman and was known by friends and family as Sonia."He said Sonia was "gender-variant". Sonia had not wished to have surgery to become a woman but, to all intents and purposes outside her professional life, lived as a woman.This was "accepted and embraced" by everyone, including Sonia's three children."A close friend states that physically Sonia presented as a good-looking, very slim, middle-aged woman," said Altman. "Sonia was caring and generous with her time. She was tolerant of others and she habitually helped others with their problems."Kanagasingham had been going through gender reassignment and would identify himself as a transsexual. "It had been his desire to pass completely as a woman."However, Altman said: "For the purposes of this trial, he [Kanagasingham] wishes to be known by his birth name and his male gender."Kanagasingham met Sonia in a bar and was a frequent visitor to Sonia's Soho flat. But Sonia had feared the effects of prescribed hormones on him.Shortly before the fatal train incident, Sonia told those close to her that Kanagasingham was becoming psychotic and was "imploding".
