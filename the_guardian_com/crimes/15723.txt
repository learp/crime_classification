Police are poised to arrest two people on suspicion of murdering 15-year-old Jessie James after a key witness was persuaded to come forward almost a year after the schoolboy was shot in Manchester's Moss Side.The detective in charge of the case said the witness had volunteered vital new information after being satisfied that police could protect his identity.The inquest into Jessie's death - which has been adjourned because of the new developments - has gone to great lengths to protect witnesses' identities. Many people have given evidence away from Manchester via video link with their voices disguised to the extent that it was impossible to tell their gender.Detective Sergeant Shaun Donnellan told reporters outside the inquest that the new information "could be termed a breakthrough"."The witness is so confident of the measures we have taken he has outlined sufficient evidence for me to call for the arrest of two people on suspicion of the murder of Jessie," he said."They will be taking place imminently."The two people are linked to Manchester gangs. I think people have been assured by the special measures we have had in the coroner's inquest."The witness has been so persuaded of their safety; this person has come forward and provided this witness statement."I'll be seeking advice from the CPS on whether or not we have enough to charge."Det Sgt Donnellan said both suspects were known to him and had previously featured in the investigation. Jessie was shot three times as he rode a bicycle through the Moss Side area of the city in the early hours of September 9.Yesterday Jessie's mother, Barbara Reid, told the inquest run by coroner Nigel Meadows that her son had been murdered because he told local youths he would not join their gang."Jessie disrespected the gang. That's why they killed him," she told the court. "They wanted him to take sides, but Jessie didn't want that."They laid it blatantly to him that there are two sides where you live. They said to him: 'Choose.' He said he didn't want to, he wanted to be everyone's friend."They said: 'If you don't take sides, there is going to be enough blood around here.' Three weeks later Jessie was a dead man."
