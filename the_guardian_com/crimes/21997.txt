A hunt is continuing for a gunman after a fatal shooting in a hotel car park.A man, aged in his 20s, died from his wounds after he was shot outside the Marriott hotel on Old Shire Lane in Waltham Abbey. Essex police, assisted by Scotland Yard and other forces, have launched a murder investigation and are attempting to locate the gunman.After the shooting shortly before 10am on Tuesday, the victim got into a passing couple’s car and drove for more than half a mile to a nearby pub, the Volunteer, in an attempt to seek help. He was treated by paramedics but died at the scene.Rob Chapman, a landlord at the Woodbine Inn, said he was told that it “started at the Marriott Hotel, then [the victim] got in this couple’s car, got shot again and ended up in the car park of the Volunteer”. Police officers were seen on Tuesday afternoon holding up sheets in an apparent attempt to shield people leaving the Volunteer from view, while a police cordon was in place on the road beside the Marriott hotel and a white forensic tent had been erected in the car park.Exit sliproads from the M25, which runs close to the hotel, were also closed. The Volunteer’s general manager, Jonathan Park, said: “We have provided as much assistance as we are able to and we are very grateful to the police for the very fast response and for such professional handling of a dreadful situation.“Although not involved in the incident itself the pub will be closed during the investigation and alternative arrangements will be made for our valued guests.”Ch Supt Luke Collison said that armed units had been mobilised as part of the force’s response to the incident. “At this time there is no evidence to suggest that there is any threat to the wider public or any link to terrorism,” he said.“We will be constantly reassessing the information we receive as the investigation progresses to ensure that the safety of the public remains paramount.”He appealed for anyone who was at the Marriott hotel or the Old Shire Lane area at the time of the shooting and had information to call 101.
