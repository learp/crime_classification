Rolf Harris could face fresh charges as a result of more than 10 new victims claiming they were abused by the former childrens’ entertainer, according to a newspaper report.Operation Yewtree officers are looking at the British cases but any assaults that took place in Australia or New Zealand would be handled by local police, the Sunday Times reported.Former detective-turned-investigative journalist Mark Williams-Thomas told the newspaper: “These new allegations are very serious in nature and could mean that Harris will face more charges.”Williams-Thomas played a key role in exposing Jimmy Savile’s sex offending through his 2012 Exposure documentary.The Metropolitan police wouldn’t comment on Sunday’s report.“We are not prepared to discuss questions on whether there’s any new allegations or new information,” a spokesman said.“There’s no comment from us at the moment.”Harris was sentenced in July to five years and nine months’ jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986.However he’s expected to serve less than three years behind bars.During his lengthy trial another six women gave supporting evidence that Harris abused them in Australia, New Zealand and Malta between 1969 and 1991.Harris wasn’t charged over those alleged incidents because they occurred outside the UK.After his conviction, a host of other women claimed they too had been sexually assaulted by the disgraced artist and singer.London police confirmed at the time that new allegations against Harris were being considered.It was reported on Saturday that Harris has been moved to a new prison for his own safety after being bullied by inmates.The 84-year-old was being housed at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire but the Sun says he is now at Stafford jail after being taunted by fellow prisoners.Harris has applied for permission to appeal against his convictions.
