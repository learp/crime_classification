Two brothers have been convicted of misleading thousands of customers into visiting what they claimed was a Lapland-style theme park.Victor and Henry Mears had denied eight charges brought in connection with their disastrous Lapland New Forest theme park. But they were found guilty on all counts after a jury at Bristol crown court heard a catalogue of complaints from a string of disgruntled customers.The Brighton-based brothers could have made more than £1m from up to 10,000 advanced ticket sales.Visitors were offered a winter wonderland with snow-covered log cabins, a nativity scene, husky dogs, polar bears and other animals, as well as a bustling Christmas market. But instead of the promised magical festive treat, they experienced fairy lights hung from trees and a broken ice rink.Within days of the attraction opening in November 2008, hundreds of disgruntled visitors to the park on the Hampshire-Dorset border complained to trading standards officials that they had been ripped off.Less than a week later, the attraction closed, with its owners blaming the media and sabotage by "New Forest villains" for the decision.The brothers were convicted after a two-month trial of five charges of engaging in a commercial practice which was a misleading action and three of engaging in a commercial practice which was a misleading omission.Victor Mears, 67, was the company's sole director but was assisted by his 60-year-old brother, who managed Lapland and was responsible for promotion.They advertised in local newspapers and with flyers which promised: "Lapland New Forest where dreams really do come true. Lapland has come to Dorset."An eyecatching website offered a "snow-covered village near Bournemouth" with a "magical tunnel of light", "beautiful snow-covered log cabins", a "bustling Christmas market", "wonderful ice rink" and "delicious hot and cold seasonal food".In bold, the website stated: "The attention to detail of our theme park will truly wow you."It also boasted: "As our show is being staged for the first time, our website can only begin to hint at our wonderland."People travelled from as far as Wales and the Midlands to visit the theme park at Matchams Leisure Park, near Ringwood, Hampshire.The "bustling Christmas market" merely comprised two food stalls selling German sausages and a choice of turkey or pork baguettes (with stuffing).The ice rink was faulty, which the Mears brothers blamed on sabotage, and the "magical tunnel of light" amounted to some fairy lights strung across trees.Within days of Lapland New Forest opening, thousands of people complained to Dorset trading standards officers, generating coverage in national newspapers and on television including reports of fights between disgruntled customers and staff.Within a week, Lapland New Forest closed and the company behind it went into liquidation.Malcolm Gibney, prosecuting, said some customers "travelled many, many miles and they told of their utter disappointment at what they saw, and their anger".He said: "The only feeling of 'wow' that many of the consumers felt was 'wow, what a con'. There were a lot of families with young children that spent a lot of money on what they hoped would be a wonderful Christmas treat."Tickets, which were bought in advance online, cost £30 each or four for £100, with children under two being charged £10.The outdoor ice rink cost another £5 for skate hire and there was a charge of £5 for posting tickets bought online.During the trial, the prosecution called several disgruntled customers, who spoke of their shock and sadness at being ripped off.
