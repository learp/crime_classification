Detectives were questioning a man in his 20s last night in connection with the murder of leading literary agent Rod Hall.Mr Hall, 53, who represented many of the UK's top film and television writers, was found stabbed to death in the bathroom of his luxury south London flat at the weekend.Forensic experts spent two days combing the crime scene in Southwark, while police examined CCTV footage.They think Mr Hall let his killer in as there was no sign of forced entry to his flat or the 16-apartment development, which has steel gates and a caretaker. There were no signs of a struggle and no weapon was found.The dead man, whose clients included the writers of The Full Monty and Calendar Girls, was stabbed several times in his chest and stomach. His body was discovered by a friend, who became worried when Mr Hall missed appointments on Sunday.It is not clear exactly when he died. The last record police have of him speaking to someone on his mobile phone was about 7pm on Friday.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "A postmortem could not establish the time of death so it is possible the victim died as early as Friday night. We believe he was attacked by someone he let into the premises."Detective Chief Inspector Colin Dell, leading the murder inquiry, appealed to anyone who had had contact with Mr Hall after 7pm on Friday to get in touch with the police.
