Britain's top police officer has called for the introduction of 24-hour courts to tackle soaring levels of street crime and anti-social behaviour.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, said he had seen round-the-clock courts working successfully in New York. He said they could deal with a growing number of street robbers and thugs in British cities. "You ensure people go through the system quickly. When they are arrested they go straight to court whatever time of day or night," he told the Times. Britain is facing an alarming youth crime wave, caused partly by the thefts of mobile telephones and the lack of recreational facilities in many inner-city areas, he warned. Senior officers in London have warned that street robberies are expected to reach 50,000 this year. Increases in street robberies have been experienced in cities across the country, with numbers rising by about a quarter in Manchester and Birmingham. The home secretary, Jack Straw, is believed to be considering round-the-clock courts as part of his review on speeding up access to justice. A Home Office spokeswoman said: "The home secretary is working on reforms of the criminal justice system ... he is looking at speeding up access to justice and equipping the courts so they can respond effectively to changes in crime." The proposals for 24-hour courts have been supported by the civil rights group Liberty, which said they would mean people would not have to be held for long periods in police cells before appearing in court.Related articleAll-day courts receive careful reportsUseful links Criminal Courts ReviewLiberty human rights organisationLondon Criminal Courts Solicitors' AssociationBackground: Home Office courts information
