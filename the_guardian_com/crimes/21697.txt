Further fooling of the international art market by a brilliant fraudster was revealed yesterday at a court hearing to sentence his 84-year-old father, nicknamed the Artful Codger, who acted as an equally crafty and imaginative fenceAs a judge deferred prison for George Greenhalgh until a "humane" jail capable of taking a wheelchair-bound pensioner could be guaranteed, a fake Gauguin sculpture which bamboozled the Chicago Institute of Art was added to the Lancashire family's tally of 120 hoax antiques.Greenhalgh was bailed by Judge William Morris after a hearing which revealed how he won a sympathetic approach to the work of the forger, his 47-year-old son and carer, Shaun, who did the work in a garden shed in Bolton.Wearing slippers, thick gold-rimmed spectacles and a shawl over his legs, the partially deaf Greenhalgh Snr told the judge, who politely checked if he could hear the proceedings: "I got two bullets in my head in the war in Italy, and one in my back and it still hurts."Greenhalgh has admitted making more than £850,000 from a conspiracy to defraud art institutions and money laundering between June 1989 and March last year. His 83-year-old wife, Olive, was given a suspended 12-month sentence for the same offences in November, and Shaun is serving four years and eight months, with the certainty of lucrative bona fide commissions when he comes out.Bolton crown court was told yesterday that since the November hearing, further forgeries had come to light, notably the Gauguin. An "expertly" exact pottery faun, it was bought 10 years ago for £60,000 by the Chicago Institute, which described it at the time as one of its most important acquisitions.Judge Morris was told that George Greenhalgh won a friendly hearing at dozens of museums and galleries, where he turned up in his wheelchair to ask diffidently if various amazing artworks, "found in the attic" or "inherited in a recent will", had any value.Dubbed the Antiques Rogue Show by Greater Manchester detectives, his performances culminated in the £439,767 sale of a fake Egyptian statuette to Bolton Museum, on his own patch. The purchase was described as a bargain, with the likely price of a genuine version at nearer £1m.The judge told the conman that the scale of dishonesty was such that a younger man would be sent to prison without any hesitation. But he said: "I have decided to defer sentence to make inquiries with the Prison Service to see if any jails will be able to humanely imprison you, as a wheelchair-bound pensioner in poor health." Greenhalgh was bailed to reappear for sentencing on January 28.Previous hearings revealed how Shaun Greenhalgh used his skill to imitate an extraordinary range of masterpieces. His activities were virtually unknown outside the shed and the modest terrace house where he looked after his parents.His work was authenticated at auction houses including Christie's in London and centres such as the British Museum. But the 18 years of lucrative deception ended when British Museum staff noticed a spelling mistake in three "ancient Assyrian" reliefs, plus the fact that horses portrayed were wearing 20th-century harness.The Chicago Institute of Art is expected to be reimbursed for the fake faun, which featured in an international touring exhibition with erudite notes about its "phallic tail ... and iconography linked to Gauguin's failing relationship with his wife."Like many reluctant admirers of Shaun Greenhalgh's work, the dealer who unwittingly bought and sold it said ruefully: "We lived with it ... It was a wonderful object."Explainer: How they did itThe scam began when George Greenhalgh took a small silver container with a scrap of wood inside to Manchester University, claiming it was a 10th century relic holding part of the true Cross. His son Shaun had based the object on a missing Anglo Saxon piece, the Eadred Reliquary, but the experts doubted George's account of finding it in a Preston park. It was nonetheless sold privately for £100.The Amarna Princess, bought by Bolton Museum for £439,767 in 2003, was the Greenhalghs' biggest coup, a 50cm (20in) statuette supposed to date from 1350BC and depict a sister of the boy pharaoh Tutankhamun. Allegedly bought at a sale of the Earl of Egremont's chattels in 1892 - which George Greenhalgh backed with spurious auctioneers' papers - it was checked by the British Museum and declared better than its nearest counterpart in the Louvre. Its short waist has subsequently been seen as a give-away, plus the fact that it was coated in a mixture of clay and tea.Three Assyrian marble reliefs allegedly made in 631BC for King Sennacherib's palace and depicting warriors and horses were valued at £250,000 but an obscure spelling mistake showed they were made in Bolton.A painting called The Meeting House and supposedly signed by LS Lowry failed to convince the Lowry Museum but was sold for £5,000 to a dealer who marketed it for £70,000.A terracotta sculpture of a playful goose was attributed to Barbara Hepworth, whose genuine work included a similar sculpture which has been lost. It was bought for £3,000 by the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds as a bargain.
