An 18-year-old student, Edward Woollard, admitted in court today that he threw an empty fire extinguisher off the roof of the Conservative party headquarters in Millbank, as the student protests over tuition fees on 10 November spilled over into an invasion of the building.Woollard, from Southampton, appeared at Westminster magistrates court charged with violent disorder, which carries a maximum five-year sentence.His solicitor, Matt Foot, said: "Mr Woollard is pleading guilty and I make it very clear he is very sorry for his actions."Woollard was arrested in Southampton five days after the protests. More than 60 demonstrators were arrested when trouble broke out after a peaceful demonstration and march. Police, who had underestimated the scale of the demonstration, struggled to hold the line against the protesters at Millbank.Demonstrators succeeded in breaking into the building, where windows were smashed and furniture destroyed. Some reached the roof and hurled objects, including the fire extinguisher, down at the police lines.Woollard, wearing a black suit, shirt and tie, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his plea while his parents watched from the public gallery.The case was committed to Southwark crown court for sentencing at a later date, and Woollard was released on conditional bail.
