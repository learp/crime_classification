Police were last night examining a massive underground cannabis factory buried beneath the mid-Sussex countryside near the village of Ansty. Officers believe the factory - eight connected shipping containers submerged beneath a field - could have been operating for more than 20 years and have produced drugs worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. The site was found by accident after a caravan fire at the Leigh Water Mill farm in a field adjacent to the underground factory. Police found a large generator nearby that was used to provide the large amounts of electricity required for mass production.
