Police searching for prostitute Tania Nicol, who disappeared in Suffolk more than a month ago, have found a body, they said today.The discovery came less than a week after the body of another prostitute who disappeared from the red light area of Ipswich was found in a stream seven miles from the town.A Suffolk police spokesman said the second body, which had not yet been formally identified, was found in water close to a mill near Ipswich.On Saturday, the body of 25-year-old Gemma Adams, who disappeared from the red light area two weeks ago, was discovered.Police have warned prostitutes in Ipswich to "look out for each other" due to fears the two women might have been killed by the same man. Detectives are checking similar cases in East Anglia to try to establish whether a serial killer could be at large. However, they have said that there is as yet no evidence to link Ms Adams' murder to any other crime.The 19-year-old vanished on October 30, shortly after leaving her home in Ipswich. CCTV footage showed her in the town later that night. Police have not yet announced how Ms Adams died, but say she was not sexually assaulted.
