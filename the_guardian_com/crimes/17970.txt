Ministers should investigate the way offenders are charged by the Crown Prosecution Service to establish the extent to which plea bargaining is taking place in the criminal justice system, MPs say today.The Commons justice committee calls for a public debate on the subject, saying that expanding the use of plea bargaining would have "significant consequences" and that it needs to be considered with "the utmost care and consideration".During an inquiry into the CPS, the committee heard evidence from witnesses – including Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions – who said that prosecutors already engage in informal plea bargaining, in that they routinely ask defence lawyers what pleas are likely to be advanced in response to certain charges.Starmer told the committee that in principle he could see now problem with "a more formal approach", subject to certain safeguards.Plea-bargaining would have to be transparent, put before the court and subject to the agreement of the court, Starmer told the committee. He also said that "over-charging" – charging a suspect with a serious offence in the hope of getting them to plead guilty to a lighter one – was unacceptable.But, in a report, the MPs say there should be a debate on the merits of any move towards formalising plea bargaining."We must not drift towards a situation where it is commonplace without discussing whether it is desirable and, if so, what safeguards must be put in place for defendants, victims and the public," they say.Baroness Scotland, the attorney general, should monitor the extent that over-charging and under-charging occur in the criminal justice system, they say, "not least because of what it tells us about whether plea bargaining is happening".There are suspicions that prosecutors over-charge to intimidate defendants. The committee also heard claims that CPS lawyers under-charge to increase their chances of a successful prosecution.The MPs also criticise claims made by ministers in the past that prosecutors should be "champions of victims' rights" and that victims should be at the heart of the criminal justice system."Telling a victim that their views are central to the criminal justice system, or that the prosecutor is their champion, is a damaging misrepresentation of reality. Expectations have been raised that will inevitably be disappointed," they say."The criminal justice system is set up to represent the public rather than individuals, and there are good reasons for this."
