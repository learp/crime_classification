Today's guilty verdict will do little to quell suspicions among black and Asian police officers that Ali Dizaei has been the subject of a racist witch hunt.There are two main reasons. The first is that, from 1999 to 2003, police put huge effort into pursuing Dizaei – one of their most outspoken critics on race – investigating him as though he was an enemy of the state, only to produce no evidence of criminal wrongdoing.The second is that Dizaei's suspension from duty as a Metrpolitan police commander in September 2008 came at a at a time when he was fighting a very bitter and public battle against his bosses.In summer that year, Scotland Yard was hit by a high-profile race dispute.After years of seething at his treatment, the assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur – the Met's third most senior officer – sued the force for discrimination and described his boss, the commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, as a racist. The claim was withdrawn when Ghaffur accepted an out of court settlement.The Met was used to accusations of discrimination from junior officers – but this row was at the very top.Dizaei was at the centre of it as both Ghaffur's main adviser and the president of the National Black Police Association.It was a dirty fight and, for both sides, much was at stake. Damaging allegations about Ghaffur's private life found their way into newspapers to which elements in Scotland Yard were known to be close.Dizaei was falsely accused by one paper of being a bigamist – a criminal offence. The newspaper later withdrew the story, apologised and paid him damages.Then, in September, he was suspended from duty over allegations that he had falsely arrested Waad al-Baghdadi, a web designer to whom it was claimed he owed money – a claim he denied.Dizaei was also suspended because of claims that he had given advice to a solicitor whose client was being prosecuted after a case brought by the Met, and allegations about his use of a police credit card. He was exonerated on both.Testifying in his own defence, he told jurors at Southwark crown court that, during the Ghaffur race row, he believed supporters of the officer were being hunted by their own force."We feared our telephones were being tapped and feared that we were being followed," he said.Scotland Yard insiders insisted there was nothing untoward about the criminal investigation into Dizaei.Senior sources pointed to the fact that, although the Met started the investigation, it was handed over to the Independent Police Complaints Commission – which they argue is no friend of the force.They also pointed out that the decision to prosecute was taken by the Crown Prosecution Service.Dizaei's suspension came only months after he had been promoted to commander – one of the highest ranks in British policing.That promotion marked a stunning rise following Scotland Yard's earlier pursuit of him.He had previously been suspended in 2001, with the force alleging that he was a danger to national security, had consorted with prostitutes and had taken illegal drugs. It was nonsense.When Dizaei eventually stood trial, none of these headline-grabbing allegations ever made the indictment.Instead, he was accused of a minor offence and, in 2003, was unanimously cleared by an Old Bailey jury.The charge followed a £4m inquiry involving covert surveillance of Dizaei and undercover surveillance teams tracking him. The investigation, conducted by a unit led by Blair, was pursued as thought it was a major murder case.The first criminal investigation into Dizaei had started in July 1999. By October, he was the subject of wiretaps and covert surveillance into his alleged drug use, which would prove baseless.When he was suspended in January 2001, he was the legal adviser to the National Black Police Association and helped officers sue forces for discrimination.But it was only in 2007 that a key reason for the Yard's pursuit of him eventually emerged.He was treated "as an enemy of the state", because MI5, Britain's domestic security service, believed he might be one.In mid-2000, the security service told Scotland Yard it suspected him of being an Iranian spy.The Guardian has learned that the MI5 warning about Dizaei was one of the principal reasons the force pursued him for four years.The Met's anti-corruption squad bugged his phones, investigated his bank accounts, tracked him to the US and set him several integrity tests – which he passed.A key reason why it was so determined to pursue him was the claim by MI5.Informed sources said MI5 had based its warning on Dizaei's association with people from the Iranian embassy and Iranian nationals, his visits to the embassy, and an intercept by the eavesdropping station at GCHQ.Dizaei – who holds dual UK and Iranian citizenship – did not know that the potentially career-destroying allegation had come from MI5.He later said: "MI5 should be ashamed of themselves, as should the police service."I have always told Special Branch when I'm visiting the Iranian embassy in London to get a visa for my son. Are these the actions of an Iranian spy?"After his acquittal in 2003, the force paid him £80,000 in compensation. In return, he dropped a racial discrimination case against it.In a deal reached after pressure from David Blunkett, the home secretary at the time, he returned to work with the Met, declaring that his integrity was intact.But, despite his acquittal in 2003 and rise to the rank of commander, there were still elements at the Yard who remained suspicious of him.• This article was amended on 9 February 2010. In the original, Ali Dizaei was referred to as "the force's commander". This has been corrected.
