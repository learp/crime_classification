A former DJ and friend of Jimmy Savile has been jailed for 25 years for a string of historical sex offences against 11 women.Ex-Radio Caroline DJ Ray Teret, 73, used his celebrity status in the Manchester club scene in the 1960s and 1970s to prey on his victims, who were aged between 13 and 15 at the time.Teret, known as Ugly Ray, was mentored by Savile in the early days of his DJ career, following him around “like a shadow”, his trial at Manchester Minshull Street crown court heard.Last week a jury found him guilty of seven charges of rape and 11 of indecent assault, which took place between 1963 and 1979. He was cleared of various sexual offences in relation to six other complainants.After the trial, Greater Manchester police confirmed it was investigating more sexual abuse allegations against Teret made by four other women.Sentencing him, Mr Justice Baker said: “It is clear that you exploited your celebrity status to sexually abuse young girls when they were between 13 and 15 years of age.“Those who were raped had little or no understanding what was happening to them and felt they could do little to prevent the abuse taking place.”He said Teret’s “ill-judged cynicism” that his victims would not come forward was matched by his belief that the jury would not believe their accounts.The public gallery, which contained a number of complainants in the case, erupted into applause when the sentence was passed.One woman shouted “yes” and another called “monster” as Teret was led to the cells. Teret shook his head in the dock after the judge completed his remarks.Outside the court, DCI Graham Brock said: “After decades of hiding behind the veneer of being a distinguished radio presenter, Ray Teret has finally been exposed as the manipulative and dangerous sexual predator that he is.”Teret had “cast a dark shadow” over his victim’s lives, Brock said.“I know from speaking to them personally how devastating the effects of his abuse have been. They have courageously relived their ordeal at court and should be applauded for having the bravery to speak out and bring this man to justice for his appalling crimes.“Since his trial began, we have received four new complaints about Teret and our officers will now be investigating these fresh allegations. For obvious reasons I cannot go into great detail about those complaints.”
