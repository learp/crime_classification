Offenders who target gay people or people with disabilities will face tougher sentences under plans announced by the government yesterday.An amendment to the criminal justice bill will expand the range of aggravating factors in "hate crimes" to include sexual orientation and disability. Judges can already hand down longer sentences if a crime was aggravated by the victim's race or religion. The Home Office minister, Lady Scotland, said: "All forms of hate crime are particularly pernicious. They undermine the wellbeing of a community as well as the victim. "This government is committed to tackling hate crime, whatever form it takes. I hope this will send a clear signal that these very serious offences will not be tolerated." Metropolitan police figures show a 10% increase in homophobic crime between 1999 and 2000. Last year the Met recorded 98 offences against disabled people and 1,097 homophobic offences. A Disability Rights Commission spokesman said one in four disabled people had experienced abuse, rising to nine out of 10 among those with learning disabilities. "For too long these devastating crimes have not been recognised in law or treated with the seriousness they deserve by the police, prosecutors or the courts," he said. Alan Wardle of the gay rights group, Stonewall, said: "We are delighted ... The law needs to protect gay people from attacks which we know are all too frequent." Â· The law on provocation, which allows a killer to be convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter, is in such a mess that it should be abolished in its present form, the Law Commission concludes in a consultation paper today. The home secretary, David Blunkett, asked the commission to look at the law because of concern that it was allowing men who kill their wives in a burst of anger to receive lenient sentences, but not battered women who kill violent husbands after years of abuse.
