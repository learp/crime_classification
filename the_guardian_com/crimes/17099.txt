Four heart specialists have been sent to jail for up to three years each after they were convicted of a £430,000 fraud against an NHS trust they billed for hours they spent moonlighting at other hospitals.Although employed by Basildon and Thurrock hospital trust in Essex, leading heart expert John Mulholland and three other clinical perfusionists routinely moonlighted as private contractors at other NHS hospitals at the same time.Mulholland, 41, and co-conspirators Ann Clements, 51, Tom Cumberland, 42, and Martin Oliver, 37, found it so easy to make money that they referred to the hospital as "Bas Vegas" in emails rejoicing in the success of their swindle.Mulholland was sentenced on Wednesday to three years in jail after being convicted of conspiracy to defraud in a trial that ended on 31 July. Clements, Cumberland and Oliver each got two years.The quartet began working at the trust when it opened a new cardiothoracic centre in 2007. They worked as clinical perfusionists, who are specialists in blood circulation who operate heart and lung bypass equipment which keeps patients alive while they are having surgery.However, between 2007 and 2011 they only worked at Basildon hospital for 55% of their contracted hours and in the process defrauded the trust of 14,000 hours of their time, worth about £430,000.They took advantage of the fact that there were too few operations for their services to be needed all the time to set up a private company, London Perfusion Science Limited, and work elsewhere too. During the 14,000 hours they worked at five NHS hospitals in London and the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, and also at one private hospital in the capital.The quartet were convicted after an investigation by NHS Protect, the service's anti-fraud service.The head of NHS Protect's national investigation service, Sue Frith, said: "From day one, John Mulholland and his associates set out to defraud the NHS of hundreds of thousands of pounds. The time, effort and planning that they were willing to put in to their criminal activities reaped them considerable rewards – until NHS Protect caught up with them."These custodial sentences reflect the seriousness of the offences and will act as a powerful deterrent to others," said Frith, who added that she hoped the jail terms would deter other NHS employees from doing anything similar."Unlike other private health work, which is legitimately undertaken by senior health professionals with the full knowledge of the NHS, this was fraud, pure and simple," said Andrew Penhale, deputy head of fraud at the Crown Prosecution Service, when they were convicted in July after the longest-running trial ever held at Basildon crown court, which lasted 59 days."John Mulholland and his co-defendants took advantage of their specialist role to systematically defraud Basildon NHS trust for their own dishonest enrichment."Their emails revealed that they did so with cynical disregard for the loss to the National Health Service and the public purse."
