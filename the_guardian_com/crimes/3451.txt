The striking decline in the number of killings in England and Wales may be due to advances in medical science saving the lives of potential victims, the Home Office suggested today.The long-term homicide rate in England and Wales peaked in 2002-03 when the inclusion of 172 of Harold Shipman's victims inflated the total to 1,047. The 23 Chinese cockle pickers who died in Morecambe Bay in 2004 and the 52 victims of the London bombings in 2005 also increased the toll in those years.The fall of 136 from last year's total of 784 to this year's 648 was described today by Home Office statisticians as "very striking". But officials say they will not be able to pinpoint the reasons for the fall until a breakdown of the homicide figures is available inÂ January.The figures published today for fatal shootings and stabbings fail to provide a whole explanation. Gun crime deaths fell in 2008-09 from 53 to 38. Fatal stabbings, which usually make up a third of all murders, also fell from 270 to 252, but these figures are not sufficient to explain the drop of 136 in all killings.The long-term homicide figures show the average death toll in the 1950s was around the 300 mark before climbing to 400 to 500 in the 1960s and 1970s. This year's reduction takes the figure back to the levels last seen in the early 1980s.Home Office criminologists say that female murder victims are more likely to be killed by someone they know. In 2007-08, 73% of female victims knew the main suspect, compared to only 48% of male victims. Nearly half the women were killed by their current or former partner.
