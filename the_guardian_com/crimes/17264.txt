Three arms smugglers who bought military equipment on eBay to sell to Iran were jailed today for their "complex and lucrative conspiracy" to break the British arms embargo.The plot involved an attempt to supply Iran with equipment for F-14 Tomcat fighter jets similar to those in the Hollywood film Top Gun, Southwark crown court heard. The three arranged deals to import military parts to the UK and export them to Tehran.Mohsen Akhavan Nik, his son Mohammad Akhavan Nik, and Nithish Jaitha were caught after HM Revenue and Customs officers swooped on a consignment of oxygen cylinders at Heathrow that were bound for Tehran.Mohsen Nik, 49, and Mohammad Nik, 26, of Ascot, Berkshire, have been jailed for five years and two and a half years respectively. The father and son came to the UK under political asylum having apparently fled Iran in 1995.Jaitha, 43, of Chalgrove, Oxford, was sentenced to two and a half years for conspiracy to export controlled goods.The three sourced parts in the US through eBay to avoid export controls.Iran's ageing jet fighters, including F-14 Tomcats, F-4 Phantoms, F-5 Tigers and Cobra attack helicopters, can only be kept in service through parts bought in the United States and illegally shipped to Iran using fraudulent paperwork.The items were bought on eBay in the US and shipped to an address in Florida to avoid the need for an export licence.From there, the goods were normally dispatched under misleading descriptions to Iran via the UK, Romania or Hong Kong to overcome US export controls and obscure the final destination.During their five-week trial the three claimed the equipment seized was for use in the health sector, specifically for breathing apparatus in an ambulance.Documents and trade catalogues they used to reinforce their claim were discredited by technical experts in court.Peter Millroy, from customs and revenue, said: "These men were involved in a complex and lucrative conspiracy to supply military equipment to Iran in contravention of a UK arms embargo. This is an excellent result, dismantling as it does this particular supply route."Mohsen Nik was also disqualified as a company director for seven years. A confiscation hearing has yet to be fixed.
