The editor of a national police magazine was forced to apologise last night after the title published a cartoon showing a man escaping from a mosque with explosives while police removed their shoes at the front door.The strip in the Police Federation magazine prompted a complaint from Bedfordshire police, who described it as "sacrilegious" and "bound to offend". The drawing showed a bearded man clutching bags marked "explosives" fleeing through a mosque's window while police struggled with footwear outside the front door.According to the BBC, Bedfordshire's chief constable, Gillian Parker, wrote: "Insensitive actions only serve to make our life more difficult. We have worked hard over an extended period of time to achieve relationships and I feel that the stereotypical portrayal of Muslims as terrorists has unnecessarily jeopardised this."Where it is feasible to do so we continue to consider the individual customs of all communities when we enter their homes and places of worship; I make no apology for this." The cartoon, published in the September issue, was published as part of a series intended to illustrate challenges facing police when dealing with different cultures, the federation told the Guardian last night. Another image showed officers unable to enter a church because it was a Sunday. The magazine's editor, Metin Enver, said: "We do apologise sincerely if the cartoon featured caused any offence to anyone."
