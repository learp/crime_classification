Thousands of criminals with serious mental illnesses or drug addictions will no longer be sent to prison but will instead be offered "voluntary" treatment in hospital, under controversial proposals to be unveiled tomorrow.The Ministry of Justice will publish details of plans to divert offenders from jail to secure NHS units, but will admit that they will be free to walk away. Officials define "secure" as having a grip on the individual, rather than locking them up.Kenneth Clarke, the justice secretary, pointed to figures that show seven out of 10 prisoners have taken drugs in the 12 months before being jailed. "And quite a lot of people take heroin for the first time while in jail," he added. "For those for whom drugs are the main problem, it is obviously sensible to tackle their addiction outside prison, if that is what is needed to stop them committing crime, rather than incarcerate them with more drug addicts."He will argue that the plans will provide the most effective way of cutting reoffending rates. The Ministry of Justice revealed last week that 61% of prisoners are reconvicted within a year of release. It will roll out a scheme of "payment by results" for providers that successfully cut reoffending.Dominic Williamson from the charity Revolving Doors Agency said there was an opportunity for improvement in the system if ministers recognised that offenders often had complex needs arising from drug and alcohol addiction and mental health problems."I think community-based treatment as part of a sentence would work for a lot of people as long as there is a clear pathway once they leave. What happens in prison is that people receive treatment but then they are kicked out and go into the community where there is nothing for them," he said.
