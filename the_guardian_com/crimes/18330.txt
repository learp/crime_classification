A hotel receptionist has been jailed for a minimum of 26 years for murdering two young workmates, after a trial in which he claimed not to know why he had killed them.Attila Ban, 32, was given two life sentences at the Old Bailey on Friday after being convicted of murdering fellow receptionists Tibor Vass and Alice Adams, both 20.They had been stabbed in Ban's flat at the Heathrow hotel where they all worked in August last year.Police were called after all three failed to turn up for work and Ban updated his Facebook wall saying: "I would like to wake up from this nightmare." Ban, who is Hungarian and was voted employee of the year in 2010 at the Radisson Edwardian hotel, was found after two days hiding under the bed where Vass's body had lain.After the bodies were removed, Ban cut his way out of the divan and attempted to kill himself.Richard Whittam, QC, prosecuting, said: "It became apparent he had been hiding in the divan base of the double bed."He must have been there throughout the attendance of the pathologist, the removal of the bodies and the examination of the scene."The victims' mothers begged Ban to tell them what happened after he was convicted of the murders last month. But on Friday, Michael Birnbaum, QC, for Ban, said: "This remains a baffling case. The two people he killed were his friends."He killed them both for reasons which remain obscure. He genuinely cannot remember what triggered the killings."Doctors had suggested Ban may have been infatuated with Vass, a Hungarian student, who may have been starting a relationship with Adams.Judge Gerald Gordon told Ban he had killed "two decent, innocent 20-year-olds".He said they had been killed "extremely violently" â€“ Adams had 22 stab wounds and Vass was stabbed twice.The judge added: "Exactly what happened will probably never be known. That creates an even greater burden for the two grieving families."He said it may have been a combination of Vass's imminent departure to university and some sexual contact at an after-work party which drove Ban to kill.Outside the court, Detective Inspector John Finch said police had not been negligent in not looking under the bed. "I would not want anyone to do anything differently in the future," he said.Adams, from Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, had been working at the hotel for three weeks and was described as popular and fun-loving.Her mother Sarah Adams said: "Every single person I love and care about is carrying the burden of incredible grief."Vass's mother Rozalia Vass told the BBC that her son had fallen in love with the "free spirit" of London.
