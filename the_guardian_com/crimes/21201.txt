Lawyers representing one of the suspects held in Italy for the sexual assault and murder of exchange student Meredith Kercher were yesterday seeking to prevent her body being returned to Britain for the funeral.As the coffin was due to leave Perugia, they petitioned a judge to stop it being flown from Rome airport to investigate what they said were crucial discrepancies over the time of her death. Last night Meredith's body was at the airport with a decision still pending.They also issued an 'international appeal' for witnesses they say can prove the Congolese suspect, Diya Lumumba, was at Le Chic bar he owned in Perugia at the moment Kercher's throat was cut on 1 November at the rented house she shared with three other women. Lumumba was identified as involved in the killing by fellow suspect Amanda Knox, 20, an American student and Kercher's flatmate. Lumumba, Knox, and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, are all being held on suspicion of the abduction and murder of Kercher.Police are reportedly also searching for a possible fourth suspect in the killing, after a fingerprint was found in Kercher's bedroom which did not match Lumumba, Knox or Sollecito. The report has been tied to the sighting of a North African man hastily washing clothes including trainers in a nearby launderette the day after the murder.Investigators now say Kercher died between 9pm and 11pm, based on food traces in her stomach, with the fatal blow struck around 30 minutes before she died. Lumumba has produced copies of receipts which he says he gave out at the bar, but they are only timed from 10.30pm onwards, convincing police he could have rushed the short distance from her house after killing Kercher.'We want a new examination of Kercher's body because the original autopsy suggested her death could have been as late as midnight,' said Lumumba's lawyer, Giuseppe Sereni. 'In the final report, the time of death is brought forward.'A number of Belgian students present at Le Chic that night were also being encouraged by friends of Lumumba to go to the police after they revealed they had been drinking there from 10.30pm to 11.30pm. Sereni said he was trying to track down a Swiss professor he believed was at the bar from 8.30pm, who could extend Lumumba's alibi, even covering the earlier time of death suggested by police. 'We think he is back in Zurich and we are searching,' he said.Police sources said that they did not believe Lumumba's story after he said he opened the bar between 5pm and 6pm, only for a witness to claim he had seen it closed at 7pm. According to Italian media reports, police have found no DNA or fingerprint traces of Lumumba in the room where Kercher's body was found semi-naked after being stabbed following an apparent sexual assault, which police believe could have been carried out by all three suspects who are being held.Knox's mother, who flew in from America over the weekend, met her daughter for the first time yesterday during a 'family day' of visiting at the prison. Edda Mellas made no comment as she arrived.Knox has admitted to being in the house during the murder, while police found a footprint in Kercher's blood matching the blue Nike shoes worn by Sollecito, 24. Sollecito always carried a pocket knife with him, which police say was probably used to stab Kercher after she was forced to the ground.Knox was said to be 'shell-shocked and writing page after page of her feelings', according to Father Saulo Scarabottoli, the prison priest who has visited her daily since the suspects were taken into custody last Tuesday.'I am grieving about what happened to Meredith, but I was not involved,' Knox was said to have told an Italian politician, Franco Zaffini, who visited the suspects last Friday and was asked by Knox for an Italian-English dictionary.Zaffini said that Sollecito asked when he could see his father, Francesco, and requested cleaning materials to clean up his cell. Sollecito Sr was allowed to see his son yesterday, and told reporters he saw no relevance in his son's knife collection. 'I collect weapons including rifles, while he has this passion for knives,' he said.Kercher's two Italian flatmates were absent on the night of her death, the eve of Il Giorno dei Morti, the Day of the Dead, when families up and down Italy gather to visit the graves of their relatives.Kercher's four downstairs neighbours were also out of town, leaving no one to hear her cries for help at the cottage perched on a tumbling slope outside the medieval city walls.According to the magistrate's document released by judge Claudia Matteini on Friday, giving permission for the suspects to be held for up to year as the investigation continues, Sollecito and Knox, who had been dating for two weeks, smoked dope throughout 1 November before accompanying Lumumba back to the cottage, where Kercher arrived shortly after 9pm having returned from the house of her British friend Sophie Purton.Lumumba, who is married with a one-year-old child, had seen his advances on Kercher rejected, the document alleged, and was determined to have sex with her. Sollecito, who was filled with a desire for 'strong emotions,' as he had written on his blog, may have joined Lumumba in Kercher's room.Bruises to Kercher's face suggest that she was then forced into a prone position with her face pressed to the ground, before she was twice stabbed lightly in the neck, possibly to persuade her to submit sexually. A third blow created huge blood loss and caused her death.The judge's ruling brought an end to a remarkable week in which leaks from the murder investigation fuelled speculation about Lumumba, Knox and Sollecito. The Congolese bar owner, known as Patrick, has been resident in Italy since 1988 and is well known in Perugia's student community.'I have happily handed over my apartment for Patrick to use for dinner parties. He is a great guy,' said Estaban Garcia Pascual, owner of the La Tana del Orso bar.Sollecito, the hardworking product of a well-to-do family from Bari, would hang around Lumumba's bar at the end of the evening to pick up Knox, who worked there. After photos were taken from his blog this week showing him dressed as a mummy and waving a meat cleaver, friends put out a statement on Friday calling him 'timid, kind and available' and blaming the photo on the 'exhibitionism of all boys of our age'.A creative writing student and the product of a Jesuit education, Knox has also received glowing character references from her peers at home, despite the short story she posted on her own MySpace web page that refers obliquely to rape.Raised in a plush Seattle suburb, she graduated in 2005, where she excelled at football and obtained good grades before enrolling at the local University of Washington. At college she was a keen soccer-player, did yoga and was a skilled climber, a high-adrenaline sport but one that is not unusual in America's mountainous north-west where outdoors activities can be a way of life for many people.One university friend of Knox's, Andrew Cheung, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that he had climbed with Knox on several occasions and had trusted her with his life. 'I never would have seen this coming,' he said. Other students described a woman who liked to party with her friends but also studied hard. Knox was studying Italian, German and creative writing. She was a so-called 'Dean's list student' last spring due to her good academic grades.But she was considered aloof by some in Perugia. 'A friend of mine who was in class with her found her brash, over-talkative and likely to laugh hard at her own jokes,' said Conti Von Hirsch, 18, who has studied in Perugia. 'She would enter a crowded room and introduce herself to just one person.'From statements given to police by Purton, Kercher and Knox may have been flatmates, but were not close friends, a view backed by Lucio, manager of the internet cafe which they both used. 'They may have been flatmates, but they never came in together. Meredith was shy and well dressed, Amanda was more grungy and unorthodox,' he said.The legal battleClaudia Matteini, the Perugia judge who has ordered the three suspects in the killing of Meredith Kercher to be kept in custody for up to one year, has a reputation for scrupulous attention to detail, from her elegant appearance to her handling of tough cases.In her mid-40s and the daughter of a senior Perugia judge, Matteini has been assisted in the Kercher case by Domenico Profazio, 37, the bearded, bear-like head of the Perugia flying squad, who made his name fighting organised crime in Sardinia and is a recent arrival in the Umbrian city.The investigating team will now do battle with the lawyers for the accused trio, chief among them Tiziano Tedeschi, retained by Francesco Sollecito, the wealthy southern Italian urologist whose son Raffaele is suspected of owning the knife that killed Kercher. Tedeschi arrived in style at the Perugia jail where Raffaele is being held, emerging from a black, chauffeur driven Mercedes to confirm the 'complete innocence' of his 24-year-old client.
