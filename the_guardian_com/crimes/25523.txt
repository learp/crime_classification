Suffolk police spent £9m hunting the serial killer of five women who were abducted and murdered over the space of a few weeks in Ipswich, it emerged yesterday.The tiny constabulary, which called in support from 36 forces during the inquiry at the end of last year, has asked the Home Office to pay the costs, according to an application for extra funding submitted to the government.Officers predict they will spend a further £9m in 2007-08 on the inquiry, according to papers from Suffolk police authority.Senior ministers, including the prime minister, Tony Blair, indicated during the investigation last December that they were sympathetic to Suffolk over additional costs incurred from the hunt, which began after the bodies of two sex workers, Gemma Adams, 25, and Tania Nicol, 19, were found last December. A week later a third body, that of Anneli Alderton, was discovered in the village of Nacton, south of Ipswich, and two days later the bodies of Annette Nicholls, 29, and Paula Clennell, 24, were discovered.Suffolk hopes to be reimbursed the £9m it has spent. But there are fears that the Home Office will not pay it all.The Home Office said police forces were expected to use reserves and pay at least 1% of their budget towards any extra costs incurred as a result of an extraordinary investigation. In Suffolk's case, the force is likely to be expected to pay at least £1m before additional funding is approved by the government.A source within the police authority said: "After hearing from our representative from Her Majesty's Inspectorate for Constabularies we are worried the government won't come up with the money."A Home Office spokesman said: "There has not been a commitment that we would pay the full costs but we will look to give them substantial additional funding. This is still being discussed with HMIC and Suffolk. A decision is likely in a week."Steve Wright, 49, from Ipswich, has been charged with the murders of five women.
