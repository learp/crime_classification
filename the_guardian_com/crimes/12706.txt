The case of Daniel Gonzalez again shows our mental health services to be failing dismally (Killer made random attacks to emulate horror film character, March 17). It has been revealed that both Gonzalez and his mother begged repeatedly for help and support but were dismissed, although he had previously been involved extensively with mental health services and was diagnosed with schizophrenia on more than one occasion. Mr Gonzalez also made many attempts to convey how desperate he felt. In what is now becoming a depressingly familiar scenario, the healthcare authorities that failed to assist this young man or his mother have fallen back on the overused argument that he had a "personality disorder".Our investigations have revealed that this scenario - although, thankfully, not usually resulting in such terrible consequences - is being played out all over the country. Personality disorder is being employed more and more by mental health professionals and seems particularly useful when they are dealing with difficult patients they would rather wash their hands of. Alongside this, there is an increase in the assertion that such individuals should "take responsibility", which is what desperate, distressed people and their carers are now frequently told by mental health services.In many cases, it would seem obvious that the patient's clinical condition renders it virtually impossible for them to "take responsibility" and their carers are simply too exhausted to do so. We know of cases where this seems to have been said as a substitute for any care at all. As it becomes increasingly obvious that the psychiatric services are now a shambles, we wonder when society is going to realise that the "personality disorder" approach is simply not going to work.
