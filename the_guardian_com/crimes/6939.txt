Failures in the system allowed child murderer Ian Huntley to get a job in a school despite having had a string of relationships with underage girls, headteachers said today.Huntley, who is serving two life sentences for the murders of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, had also been accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and suspected of three other attacks, but was employed as a caretaker at Soham community college even though a police vetting system was in place.Although that system has been replaced with the new Capita-run Criminal Records Bureau, police and Home Office sources accept that under the new system Huntley would probably still have slipped through the net.Today, the Secondary Heads Association submitted evidence to the Bichard Inquiry, set up after Huntley's conviction to examine what went wrong with the vetting system. Sir Michael Bichard is chairing the inquiry.The SHA welcomed the review, but warned that the new system was not guaranteeing children's safety. "We recognise that a balance has to be struck between the safety of the child and the rights of the individual. We believe that the way that balance is struck in practice does not at present give sufficient priority to security for children."We consider that an inconsistent system prevents employers and headteachers from making secure judgments on the level of risk that potential employees may present to children," they wrote. Bob Carstairs, assistant general secretary of SHA, said it was crucial that all police forces submitted their intelligence on known child-offenders to the vetting system. "We recommend that this should include details of any convictions and investigations that, on the balance of probability, suggest a risk may exist. The guidelines for this should be drawn up jointly by the Office of the Information Commissioner and those concerned with law enforcement and child protection," he said. Sir Michael is due to make his report in May.
