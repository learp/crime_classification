Smartphones thefts have declined dramatically in three major cities since manufacturers began implementing “kill switches” that allow the phones to be turned off remotely if they are stolen.The number of smartphones stolen dropped by 50% in London, 27% in San Francisco and 16% in New York in 2014, according to an announcement by officials in the three cities.After Apple added a kill switch to its devices in September 2013, iPhone thefts specifically were down 40% in San Francisco and 25% in New York year-on-year.Apple iPhone 'kill switch' cuts thefts – and Microsoft and Google are to follow In 2014, Samsung added a kill switch to some of its smartphones, while Google added a kill switch to its latest Android operating system Lollipop. Microsoft has promised to add a kill switch to its smartphones by July 2015.London Mayor Boris Johnson said: “We have made real progress in tackling the smartphone theft epidemic that was affecting many major cities just two years ago.”Johnson, San Francisco district attorney George Gascon and New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman were among numerous officials arguing for new laws mandating the kill switches. In California, where a law mandating kill switches has yet to go into effect, smartphone theft is dropping because some manufacturers have already started installing the software-based switches on the devices they sell, Gascon said.“The wireless industry continues to roll out sophisticated new features, but preventing their own customers from being the target of a violent crime is the coolest technology they can bring to market,” he said. California’s law, one of the US’s strongest, received wide support from California prosecutors and law enforcement agencies that hoped it could help reduce smartphone thefts. According to the US National Consumers League, 1.6m handheld devices were stolen in the US in 2012. In California, smartphone theft accounts for more than half of all crimes in San Francisco, Oakland and other cities.Other states experiencing a high rate of smartphone thefts have considered similar measures, and Minnesota passed a theft-prevention law last year.Some of the smartphone systems require consumers to opt in, meaning not all will be protected when their phones are operating by default.Gascon, Johnson and Schneiderman called on all manufacturers to make the technology active as a default position, as Apple has done with its iPhones.
