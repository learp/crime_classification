A victim of a murderer and serial rapist has demanded changes in the law after her attacker was jailed for an identical knifepoint sex attack.Kenneth Mark Shirley, 42, was told by a judge he would probably die in prison for the sadistic rape and assault of a woman in her own home seven years ago.Mr Justice Astill handed Shirley another 16 life sentences on top of the seven he is already serving for the rape of Helen Stockford in 2009 and the murder of Mary Wainwright in 1987.He was only at liberty because he had been released from prison on licence three times by the parole board.Avon and Somerset probation trust defended its management of Shirley and said he had not posed "an increased level of risk" and there was no suggestion it could have done anything to prevent him reoffending.But Stockford, who gave up her anonymity in 2009, said "strong lessons" needed to be learned by the authorities who repeatedly freed him. "Again, Shirley has shown that he is a highly dangerous individual who has total disregard for the terms of his life licence," she said."He's already broken it three times and now a fourth with this current case."I believe the justice system in this country needs a complete overhaul particularly with respect to victims of rape and that's what I've been campaigning for for three long years."Stockford said she wanted to meet both prime minister David Cameron and justice secretary Chris Grayling because "strong changes" needed to be made.Police praised the bravery of the Shirley's most recent victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in telling officers what Shirley had done to her.Shirley tied the woman to her bed, gagged her and repeatedly degraded her with a knife and other objects in a 12-hour assault in her home in the Bristol area.The woman was so traumatised by the attack in December 2005 she suffered a mental breakdown and gave up her career. She did not tell police until last year.Detective Inspector Jill Kells, of Avon and Somerset police, said: "The victim endured one of the most traumatic of crimes. I would like to thank her for the courage she has shown in this investigation and in giving evidence."Kenneth Mark Shirley is a dangerous man who has previous convictions for murder, rape, kidnap and sexual assault."His further sentence means the public are protected from this predatory and violent individual."Shirley was found guilty of four rapes, 12 assaults by penetration and a single charge of wounding by a jury at Bristol crown court on Thursday.The judge told Shirley, who is known by his middle name, that he would serve a minimum term of 16 years imprisonment but would probably never be released.
