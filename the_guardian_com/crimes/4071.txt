A paedophile former priest who fled to the US in 1985 was today jailed for 21 years for a campaign of sexual abuse against young boys which began in the 1950s.A jury at Birmingham crown court deliberated for about six hours before unanimously convicting 73-year-old James Robinson. He was found guilty of 21 sexual offences.Passing sentence, Judge Patrick Thomas QC described the defendant as devious and manipulative.Thomas told Robinson: "The offences you committed were unimaginably wicked and caused immense and long-lasting – we can only hope not permanent – damage to the six victims."You used, you abused your position of trust, your position of authority and total trust within the communities that you moved to and from."Richard John James Robinson worked as a Roman Catholic priest in Staffordshire, Birmingham and Coventry, after being ordained in 1971. He was extradited from California last year to face trial. He denied all the offences, which were found to have been committed between 1959 and 1983.The trial of the former colliery blacksmith, who was brought up in Brownhills, near Walsall, heard that he later turned his back on a professional boxing career, in his early 20s, to train for the priesthood. He moved from parish to parish sexually abusing children, including two altar boys.Jurors were told that he used his status as a priest to gain "unfettered and unlimited" access to boys, giving them gifts and taking them for trips in his sports car.Unusually, Robinson did not face charges relating to two of his six victims because they contacted the police after he was extradited. Although extradition law prevented Robinson from being charged with abusing the two victims, they were allowed to give evidence in support of the other four victims.
