A 23-year-old woman has died after being stabbed in a south London street.Police said she was attacked in Battersea at about 9.20pm yesterday and died in hospital.It is believed the woman, from nearby Wandsworth, knew her attacker, who fled on foot.Detectives have launched a murder inquiry and are appealing for witnesses to come forward.Although investigators are keeping an open mind about the motives behind the stabbing, a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said it "appeared to be some sort of domestic [argument]".Knife crime has become a political issue following a spate of violent deaths in London. This attack brings to 90 the number of murders in the capital so far this year.Official figures released last month revealed there were more than 22,000 serious offences in England and Wales involving knives in the last year, although overall crime fell significantly.
