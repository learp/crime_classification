Flying squad officers investigating the Â£40m jewellery robbery at an exclusive Mayfair shop have arrested a 50-year-old man in east London in connection with the raid.The man, who has since been released on bail pending further inquiries, was arrested outside a house in Ilford on Monday, police said.Officers have also raided several properties in the capital and are following up new lines of inquiry following the release of CCTV footage showing two men entering Graff jewellers in New Bond Street.The two armed robbers, one white and one black and both dressed in smart suits, made off with 43 items of jewellery on Thursday in what is believed to be the biggest gems robbery in British history.Images of them entering the shop were captured by CCTV. Once inside, they pulled out hand guns before snatching expensive items from a cabinet.Dragging a female member of staff outside, they then fired a warning shot before releasing her and making their escape initially in a blue BMW, which an onlooker captured on video on a mobile phone.It is thought they were helped by a series of getaway drivers, and a second warning shot was fired as they changed vehicles nearby.A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "Following the release of CCTV images of two men they want to speak to, officers are currently following up a number of inquiries."
