Scrap metal yards are experiencing an epidemic in thefts as metal prices soar. 'It's a major, major problem,' said Michael Wright, chairman of ELG Haniel Metals in Sheffield. 'In just 15 minutes we had Â£8,000 worth of metal stolen from our yard one lunchtime. It's organised crime. These guys know what they are looking for.'A number of valuable metal sculptures - including a Henry Moore - have been stolen. Electricity pylons, lead from church roofs and swimming pool ladders are also popular targets. Gloucester council has been forced to replace scores of metal manhole covers.And now the crime wave has spread to Britain's scrap yards, stimulated by the burgeoning price of recycled metal as countries such as India, Turkey and China look to expand.
