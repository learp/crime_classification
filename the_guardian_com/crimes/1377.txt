More than a third of students have been crime victims in the past year, according to a Home Office study published yesterday. It shows that students face a much higher risk of becoming a victim of crime than the rest of the public, particularly of burglaries, thefts and criminal damage.Ministers are to write to student leaders with crime prevention advice and to urge students to contact police. At present, 60% of student crime is unreported. The study, based on 315 students at seven higher education colleges in the East Midlands, found that those in private accommodation were much more likely to be burgled than those in university accommodation. It found that 5% of students had been assaulted in the past year and 4% robbed. Just over 4% said they had been stalked, with 62% saying they had received threatening or obscene phone calls or notes.
