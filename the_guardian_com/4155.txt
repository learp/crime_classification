A hospital trust has admitted breaching health and safety law over the death of a diabetic patient who was not given insulin.The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust pleaded guilty to failing to ensure the safety of Gillian Astbury, who lapsed into a fatal coma while being treated at Stafford hospital in April 2007.The trust pleaded guilty to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act by failing to properly manage and organise hospital services, including its systems for record-keeping, patient information and communication between staff members.The criminal prosecution at Stafford magistrates court was brought by the Health and Safety Executive three years after an inquest ruled that low staffing levels and a systemic failure to provide adequate nursing facilities contributed to Astbury's death. The inquest also concluded that the failure to administer insulin to the 66-year-old amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care.Astbury, from Hednesford, Staffordshire, died on 11 April 2007 while being treated for fractures to her arm and pelvis.Maggie Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said they had worked to improve the standard of care provided at the hospital since Astbury's death.In a statement, Ms Oldham said: "Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Gillian Astbury and we apologise for the dreadful care Ms Astbury received at Stafford Hospital in April 2007."We have been very open and candid and have co-operated fully with the Health and Safety Executive throughout its investigation."The Trust offered no defence to the charge which the Health and Safety Executive brought against it today and accepts the court's decision to refer the case to the Crown Court."Although of little consolation to Ms Astbury's family, we can assure them that we have done everything we can to put right those things which went so very wrong in 2007 and that the standard of care now provided at the hospital has improved considerably over the last few years, as has been recognised by many independent organisations and individuals."Stafford hospital has been the subject of several highly critical reports, including that of a full public inquiry, which identified "routine" neglect of patients between 2005 and 2009.
