The government should place a cap on prison places to lessen overcrowding and stem the resources poured into building new jails, the former lord chief justice Lord Woolf said today.He told the home affairs select committee that prison places should be reserved only for "those who really deserve it and need it".He said overcrowding was a big barrier to rehabilitation and that the country could not afford to keep building new prisons.Lord Woolf suggested judges be told how much their sentences cost taxpayers.He told the cross-party group of MPs: "The judge should know how much the sentence he is imposing will cost the public, and if there is a suitable cheaper option then he should choose that."He said: "We have not got over the message just how expensive incarceration is. The cost of sentences should be set out in clear and realistic terms."He also suggested a Bank of England style five-year budget for prisons.He went on to describe his suggestion: "These are the resources that the government can provide for the prison population, and you must see that your sentencing guidelines achieve a prison population within those resources where the commodity of a prison space is used in the most constructive way."He added: "The primary use of prisons must be for violent offences."Lord Woolf called for a "proper assessment" of prison spending."What we know is that the more money spent on building prisons, the less money will go on rehabilitating and reforming prisoners."We've got to make a proper assessment as to how much of the economy of this country should go to imprisoning individuals."He continued: "It would be a brave government to say we're not going to have an open door policy for prisons in this country. We have many people in prisons now who don't need to be there."We need to ensure that a prison place is reserved for those who really deserve it and need it."The shadow home secretary David Davis said: "Lord Woolf is right to identify chronic overcrowding as a major problem undermining prison services."The lack of capacity in our jails means that, not only are prisoners being let out early, they are not receiving adequate drug rehabilitation or educational training while there. The government's failure to tackle this problem has led to unprecedented growth in reoffending since 1997."However, while he has identified the right problem, he has not identified the correct solution, which is to actually address the chronic lack of capacity in our jails."Criminals should be sentenced according to crime, not the government's convenience. Extra prison places are vital in ensuring not only that prisoners are punished but they are effectively rehabilitated as well as adequately protecting the public."
