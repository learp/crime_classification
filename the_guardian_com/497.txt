Efit images have been released of two men wanted by police investigating the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old girl in Oxford.Detectives said the victim continued to be supported by specially trained officers as they sought to gain more details about her ordeal.No arrests have been made since a man forced the schoolgirl into a hatchback car, possibly a Volkswagen, as she walked along Banbury Road in Summertown on 28 September. A second man was inside the car and the teenager, who was wearing her school uniform, was raped. Officers from the Thames Valley police major crime unit said the alarm was raised when the girl was found afterwards knocking on doors in Cavendish Drive, Marston. One week on from the crime, police deployed high-visibility patrols in the area to try to unearth clues about her attackers. Now they have issued efit images of two men they want to speak to. DS Chris Ward, the head of the major crime unit, urged anyone who recognised the pair to call police. The first offender is described as a white male in his mid-20s, about 1.8 metres (6ft) tall and of average build. He was wearing a grey hooded top, which had a single pocket, and black trousers. The second offender is described as white, in his late teens, of slightly muscular build and was wearing black clothing.
