Three holiday company employees were found guilty of negligence today over the death of an 11-year-old girl who drowned in a boating accident in Greece.Laura Morgan, from Nottinghamshire, died in July 2003 when the catamaran she was sailing in with two teenage friends capsized and dragged her under the water.Judges at the court of misdemeanours in Lefkada, Greece, found hotel manager William Hutton, 31, water sports manager Rebecca Morgan, 30, and assistant manager Kevin Jones, 25, guilty of negligence in connection with her death.The three, all employees at a resort in Paleros run by the holiday firm Sunsail, were given 18-month jail sentences suspended for three years.Fellow Sunsail employees Benjamin Annetts, 39, and Colin Bradley, 28, who were also charged with negligence and safety breaches, were cleared of any wrongdoing.The judge told Hutton and Morgan that they had not taken enough care in making sure the three girls were supervised by an adult.He said the Jones should have been on a boat on the sea keeping a closer eye on the tourists because he was responsible for safety at the time.Laura's mother Lynne Morgan, who had travelled to Greece to give evidence at the trial, broke down in tears after the hearing. "I am relieved and I am pleased that the truth has come out but I still have a life sentence," she said outside court. Laura had gone out onto the water with two friends, twins aged 14, in a Hobie catamaran as part of activities laid on for holidaymakers.But after around 30 minutes the vessel capsized. The twins swam to safety but Laura was trapped.Lifeguards who arrived on the scene were unable to free the trapeze harness that had trapped her underneath the boat. During the trial Mrs Morgan told the court she had taken the girl and her sister Sarah, now 19, on holiday after the break-up of her marriage.She said she believed staff at Sunsail, which organised the family trip, lied about what happened to her daughter when they said she had become tangled in the boat's ropes."I know it was not the truth," she said. "I know that Laura was attached to the boat with the harness and that the boat capsized and she could not disentangle herself from the harness."In a statement, Portsmouth-based Sunsail said it was "disappointed" with the verdict and said it planned to appeal."The company recognises that this has been an extremely difficult time for Laura's family and wishes to reiterate that the thoughts of everyone in the company remain with them," it said.
