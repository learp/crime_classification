The murdered teenager Hannah Foster probably struggled for more than 30 seconds while being strangled, a Home Office pathologist said yesterday.Dr Hugh White told Winchester crown court that she suffered "pin-point haemorrhages" to her face and eyes, which were "classic symptoms of a neck being compressed". She also suffered bruising to the neck and to her windpipe and there was a 6cm (2.5-inch) scratch to her neck caused by a fingernail.White said: "This indicated pressure had been maintained for sufficiently long enough for these changes to appear in the face and neck. I suspect the process took longer than 15 to 30 seconds because she has a number of injuries to her neck."The marks were caused by the movement of hands on Hannah's neck and the implication is she has been struggling."Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 40, a sandwich delivery van driver, denies the murder, rape, kidnap and false imprisonment of Hannah, an A-level student. Her body was found in a bramble-filled ditch in West End, Southampton, on March 16 2003, two days after she disappeared near her home.The jury heard two statements from Hannah's parents, Hilary and Trevor, confirming the voice on a 999 recording was that of their daughter.Mrs Foster said: "Prior to listening to the recording I felt a rising panic. At the first listening, I heard the word Sarah quite clearly. Since I have not heard Hannah that scared, I could not be sure it was her. The second time I believe it was Hannah, her trying to control her panic, particularly because of the way she said Sarah."Mr Foster said: "Although there was a tremor in her voice, the controlled intonation was Hannah. There was no doubt in my mind that the voice I heard in the recording was my daughter, Hannah." The trial continues.
