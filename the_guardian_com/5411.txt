After 12 years, countless consultations, a scrapped draft bill and lengthy delays, the government today finally published new bribery legislation.The bill presented to parliament by Jack Straw, the justice secretary, will make it a criminal offence to give or offer a bribe in the UK or abroad, and increase the maximum prison term from seven to 10 years. A corporate offence of negligent failure to prevent bribery on behalf of a business will be introduced, and for the first time MPs and peers can be prosecuted in bribery cases.The bill's publication is published as 20 investigations are under way at the City of London police's foreign bribery unit, Straw said. During Labour's 12 years in power, only one UK company has been prosecuted for foreign bribery.The legislation is likely to be scrutinised by business groups whose previous concerns arguably contributed to the UK's failure to modernise its corruption laws, some of which date from 1906. There are suggestions the bill could lead to an increase in directors' liability insurance premiums.But there will be concern among anti-corruption campaigners that the introduction of the bill, 15 months before a general election must be called, could mean it does not have enough time to get through parliament.The existing requirement for the attorney general's consent to prosecute, notoriously deployed in the Â£43bn BAE Systems Saudi arms deal, will be ended. If the bill becomes law, the decision will be taken by the director of the relevant prosecuting authority. But it is unclear whether national security can be a reason for stopping bribery investigations as it was in the BAE case.Liberal Democrat justice spokesman David Howarth said: "The government's response to international criticism of Britain's law on bribery has been to obfuscate and delay, so this change of tack is welcome."Changing the law of bribery, however, will not in itself answer all the serious questions that arose from the exceedingly murky BAE Systems affair. In particular, the government should take the opportunity to back down from its position that the attorney general should be allowed to intervene in Serious Fraud Office investigations on self-defined grounds of national security."The legislation comes six months after the UK was castigated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for failing to modernise its anti-corruption protocols.The OECD said it was "disappointed and seriously concerned" by what it saw as Britain's tolerance of corruption. Straw said: "We have acted on their [the OECD's] particular criticism because it was true that our bribery legislation is to be found in a number of separate acts of parliament and in common law. Most of these statutes go back a hundred years or so and they're incoherent."A joint parliamentary scrutiny committee will soon be formed soon to evaluate the bill.
