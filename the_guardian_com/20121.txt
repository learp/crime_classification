An Oxford University student was today sent to Broadmoor security hospital indefinitely for the killing of an aspiring fashion designer and warned that he might never be released.William Jaggs stabbed 25-year-old Lucy Braham, a family friend, more than 60 times during a frenzied attack at her home in Harrow on the Hill, north-west London, last September.Mr Justice Bean, at the Old Bailey, told Jaggs that Ms Braham had been "entirely innocent and blameless - a young woman who had had done you no harm"."I am satisfied there was no relationship, sexual or even romantic, between you and her. Her only crime was that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time."Jaggs, 23, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but not guilty to murder. The lesser plea was accepted by the prosecution at the Old Bailey.The prosecutor, Aftab Jafferjee, said that after his arrest Jaggs gave psychiatrists a "chilling insight into his sick mind".He said he went to Ms Braham's house with a kitten, intending to use the pet as a ruse to persuade her to invite him in, and as he walked around her house the thought of having sex with her became "predominant" in his mind.Jaggs tried to undress Ms Braham, but after she resisted he used a pair of scissors to cut off her clothes and then took a knife from the dishwasher and decided to cut her on the arm for, he claimed, erotic purposes.Jaggs claimed that once they were both naked Ms Braham said to him: "Stop hesitating and do it."Mr Jafferjee said: "He presumed this meant he should get on and stab her. He said he believed stabbing or killing her would be the same as having sex with her."Neighbours who heard a commotion looked into the kitchen and saw a pool of blood on the floor and Jaggs standing naked with blood on his body.They called the police who broke in to find Jaggs standing over Miss Braham's lifeless body. He was holding a kitchen knife and began to stab himself in the stomach, chest and legs, inflicting more than 30 wounds on his own body.He was arrested after being discharged from hospital.Jaggs had been enrolled in English at Oriel college but his studies had stalled after he encountered difficulties.Miss Braham's father, Jason, who was an art director at Harrow school where Jaggs's father also taught, stood up in the witness box to make an emotional attack on his daughter's killer. He claimed Lucy was "badly let down" by the school, which he accused of not tackling Jaggs's drug-taking when he was a pupil there.Mr Braham said his daughter was nicknamed "the ray of sunshine" and that one of her school friends referred to her "amazing smile which said everything's going to be OK".By contrast, Jaggs "spat in the face of everyone who had given him his advantages - his parents, his teachers, including Julienne and myself, and everyone who put him in a position of trust".Jaggs was "ideal prey for the drug dealer and pornographer" and by the time he started studying at Oxford he had moved "from the gutter to the sewer", Mr Braham said."Our lovely, funny, creative, principled daughter has been taken from us by the selfish act of a depraved, immature young man in the grip, it seems, of schizophrenia."Mr Jafferjee said: "This was a sexually motivated homicidal attack on an entirely innocent and blameless young woman inside her family home."But Jaggs was mentally ill at the time of the killing and that substantially reduces his responsibility for the terrible crime - in law if not probably in the minds of Lucy's family."It was the unanimous opinion of four psychiatrists dealing with him, including, exceptionally, two instructed by the crown, that the sexual element did not adversely impact on the plea of manslaughter."
