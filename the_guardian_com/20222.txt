One of the Geese Theatre Company's most widely used performances with young offenders is Lifting the Weight, an interactive game in which actors deal with a variety of realistic situations that they face during their first year after release from custody.There are five areas in which characters confront challenges: survival, free time, family, work and authority. Each area contains tokens - players must try to "win" them to stop themselves returning to custody - which focus on issues such as personal responsibility, self-control, resisting peer pressure, alcohol and drug abuse. Adding to the challenge is another actor, The Fool, who tries to persuade characters to take the offending option. As the characters confront difficult situations, they lift their masks and ask the audience what course of action they should follow. The likely outcome is acted out and there is a debate on whether the character deserves a token. Geese programmes director Sally Brookes says: "To negotiate the game successfully, the characters in the play need to look honestly at their often dangerous behaviour and its consequences, for both themselves and others - and begin to identify alternative solutions. "But, as young offenders well know, it's not about pat solutions or happy endings. There are always more tokens to work for."
