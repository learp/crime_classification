A police officer convicted of punching a suspect who spat in his mouth has avoided jail, Scotland Yard said.Rohan Scarlett, 47, launched the assault on Andrew Uba as he put him in a police van at 3am on 20 February.Scarlett, of the Metropolitan police, had denied common assault but was sentenced to a three month community order at Highbury Corner magistrates court. He was also given a curfew and ordered to pay compensation to Uba.The court previously heard the incident happened when Scarlett was transferring Uba from Islington police station to custody in Lewisham, east London.As the burly 6ft 1in officer struggled to put him inside the van with the help of a colleague, Uba spat at close distance in his face without warning.Scarlett, a former nightclub doorman and security guard from Croydon, south London, said he did not want to be assaulted again and hit Uba to "distract him" from spitting a second time.Commander Allan Gibson, of the Met's directorate of professional standards, said: "I appreciate that there was alleged provocation in this case, but police officers are expected to remain professional at all times, irrespective of provocation."PC Scarlett failed to remain professional – he reacted and has paid the price of being convicted at court."Now that the criminal proceedings are complete the misconduct process can continue."Magistrates heard that Scarlett wiped his face of the spit, opened the van door then intentionally "launched" himself at Uba, punching him twice.Delivering the guilty verdict on 27 August, chairwoman of the bench Sue Rose said: "We do not accept that the defendant honestly believed that he needed to use force to defend himself in these circumstances."The court was shown a photograph from the scene in which a small pool of blood was on the seat where Uba had been sitting.The father of two said that after he wiped the spit from his face, an Islington officer who was present, PC David O'Hara, told him he was in "a world of trouble".O'Hara then "grabbed my right wrist and put some cuffs on saying I am under arrest on suspicion of GBH – I was in shock" and physically tried to remove Scarlett from the suspect but was not strong enough.He told Scarlett after the punch "we don't do that", to which Scarlett replied, "yeah we do", the court heard.Scarlett, who has been an officer for eight years and has an unblemished career, claimed O'Hara was lying.He remains suspended from duties.
