The Yorkshire Ripper should be moved from Broadmoor high security hospital to an ordinary prison because he is not really mentally ill, an MP said yesterday.Fabian Hamilton, Labour MP for the constituency in Leeds where Peter Sutcliffe killed his 13th and last woman victim, university student Jacqueline Hill, said new evidence suggested he had fooled psychiatrists. Mr Hamilton said evidence in new a book suggested Sutcliffe had attacked and may have murdered a number of men in Yorkshire during the 1960s, before he began his killing spree a decade later. He suggested that this proved that Sutcliffe's claim to have been directed by voices was false. The claims about the other murders come in Michael Bilton's book, Wicked Beyond Belief, about the police investigation. Mr Hamilton, MP for Leeds north-east, said that if Sutcliffe was "bad rather than mad" he must be treated like any other prisoner. This would mean moving him from Broadmoor to a maximum security prison for the rest of his life sentence. However, many police officers and psychiatrists who worked on the case were convinced that Sutcliffe had a mental illness, probably paranoid schizophrenia. Sutcliffe told police that the motivation for his crimes came from voices which had first come to him in a cemetery when he worked as a gravedigger. Others had doubts and suspected he had made a deliberate effort to feign mental illness. During his incarceration, he has been attacked by other patients. Six years ago, he was blinded in one eye after being stabbed with a pen.
