People from ethnic minorities are still being denied justice in the courts, a study published today by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has suggested.An analysis of almost 13,000 case files found that the CPS was more likely to object to bail for male African Caribbeans (13.2%), compared with white men (9%).Prosecutors also more frequently argued against bail on the grounds that their black defendants would "obstruct" justice if they were not put on remand, the report found, despite cases involving African Caribbean or Asian defendants being most likely to fail in court.But the report refused to consider whether the CPS was "institutionally racist" and insisted instead that it should merely "seek to establish the nature and extent of any such tendencies which in fact disadvantage minority ethnic people".The study, carried out by Gus John Partnership on behalf of the CPS, said these findings should not be seen as a "damning admission of culpability" but a "necessary step towards a sophisticated understanding of the challenges faced by an organisation".Commissioned two years ago, the Diversity Monitoring Project was prompted by recommendations in the Stephen Lawrence inquiry and a public assurance given at the time by the CPS regarding its commitment to promoting equality and eliminating discrimination. The report aimed to assess whether institutional practices were leading to biased decision-making against black and minority ethnic people and women at any stage within the prosecution process.However, the small number of women proved statistically insignificant for analysis and the brief was switched to race bias alone. Particular attention was also given to "special category" cases with a racial dimension. All but 12 of the 370 racially aggravated cases involved white defendants.The study also found that racial offences were usually regarded as cases which could be heard either in the magistrates court or the crown court, rather than exclusively in the latter.The study recommended the appointment of specialist prosecutors for racist and religious crimes to oversee the prosecution and monitoring of such cases, the establishment of a "common standard" for prosecuting advocates and chief crown prosecutors to improve the quality of case review, file endorsement and use of racist incident data sheets.The CPS must also nurture a management culture which encouraged clearer lines of management accountability and better procedures for monitoring performance and sharing best practice, the report recommended.Trevor Phillips, chariman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), called on the CPS to tackle the discrimination in its procedures, but praised the organisation for opening itself up to scrutiny. "The CPS now has significant changes to make to its policy and practices in this area," he said. "Ethnic minority communities have not always had complete confidence in the criminal justice system - often with good reason. The CRE will continue to work closely with the CPS to support them in securing the best criminal justice system for a diverse Britain."The sample was take from 15,000 cases finalised at court between September 2000 and August 2001 across 10 CPS services, across the country, of which 12,913 were eventually analysed.Researchers were unable to identify the prosecutors' gender and ethnicity, and compared minority ethnic offenders' experience of the CPS and that of white offenders.
