David Blunkett's new package of police reform announced today marks the first instalment of the new 'going local' politics that all three main parties are pledged to introduce after the next general election.They hope that they can reach the disaffected non-voter by introducing new neighbourhood methods of accountability for the delivery of local services and so make them feel that they can have some influence over the quality of their lives.So the shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, has already promised to introduce neighbourhood sheriffs and now Mr Blunkett has detailed his plans for 'community advocates', elected police authorities and other methods to make sure the police respond the needs of local residents."I want members of the public to know who their local police commander is and to be able to get answers to basic questions when things are not up to scratch," says Mr Blunkett. "I want to see the police commander of the future with much more power to take the decisions on the ground that make a difference, with the backing of local residents who feel they can make their voices heard and are able to ask sensible questions of their police about local priorities, such as patrols."Although much fun can be made of Letwin's 'deputy dawg' sheriffs there is in fact a lot of common ground between the politicians about what 'going local' should mean when it comes to the police. Their disagreements are more to do with the balance of power between the elected home secretary and the unelected chief constables.There is bigger argument within Labour between New Labour modernisers, such as Blunkett and his police minister, Hazel Blears, and more traditional labour local government figures. It is already been dubbed a debate between 'new localists' and 'old localists'. The 'old localists' say no need to invent 'community advocates' when you already have local councillors and similarly oppose what they see as a proliferation of directly elected local officers. They argue that a low turnout election to an obscure police authority could easily allow the BNP and other extremists to get a foothold in important services. But this is a false alarm. Elections to police authorities or neighbourhood policing panels would take place on the same ballot paper as the regular local council elections alongside the directly elected mayor. In fact it might actually be seen as a new reason to vote in the first place. If it can prove wrong the old anarchist slogan that 'voting never changed anything' then that would be a step forward.Â· Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor
