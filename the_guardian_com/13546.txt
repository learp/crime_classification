Five teenagers accused of the murder of a Catholic schoolboy who was allegedly attacked with baseball bats appeared in court in Northern Ireland today.Michael McIlveen, who was 15, died in hospital on Monday, a day after being savagely beaten by a gang in the town of Ballymena, Co Antrim.He was attacked after buying a takeaway pizza in the early hours of Sunday morning.The five youths - all from Ballymena - were remanded in custody after their appearance at Ballymena magistrates court pending their next court appearance in June.Groups across the political spectrum condemned the killing, which is believed to have been sectarian.Detectives believe Michael and two friends were chased through the streets of the town from a car park before the attack. He managed to stagger home to the Dunvale estate, and was taken to hospital.His family remained at his bedside until his life support machine was switched off on Monday evening.The court was told that Aaron Wallace, 18, and Christopher Kerr, 19, had said "not guilty" when formally accused of the murder at Antrim police station.The 15-year-old suspect said "no" when charged, while the other two, both aged 17, made no reply, Detective Inspector Robert Paul said.The 15 and 17-year-old suspects cannot be named for legal reasons. None of the five spoke during the hearing this morning.Ballymena, a town north-west of Belfast, has seen frequent sectarian clashes, and tensions have been running high since the killing.There was a heavy police presence for the suspects' court appearance. Abuse was hurled at them during the proceedings and as they left the building.The charges were confirmed hours after Michael's family and friends held a candle-lit vigil outside his home. Flowers were also left outside the house.Politicians in Ballymena urged the community not to retaliate, and Sinn Fein called for the Northern Ireland Assembly to hold a minute's silence when it reconvenes next week.Martin McGuinness, the party's chief negotiator, described the killing as needless and unjustifiable and urged civic leaders not to "turn a blind eye" to sectarianism.The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, this week said he was appalled by the "sickening" attack, while Ian Paisley, the local MP and Democratic Unionist party leader, appealed for calm as the marching season approached.
