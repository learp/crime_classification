Today a conference will be held by Veterans in Prison, of which I am president, to examine a problem that was drawn to the attention of the public last year by the National Association of Probation Officers, which published the surprising and shocking figures that some 20,000 ex-members of the armed forces were in the hands of the criminal justice system, more than 10,000 of them in prison. The ministries of defence and justice responded by denying that figure, suggesting that the figure was nearer 5,000 and admitting that, while exact records were not available, the total included a number who had served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan and were suffering from various mental problems including post-traumatic stress disorder.Whatever the actual numbers turn out to be, the exposure of the situation demands a national response in line with the much-vaunted military covenant. The nation is reminded of the debt that it owes to the men and women who serve in its armed forces, most obviously when images of hearses containing union flag-draped coffins passing through Wooton Bassett appear on our TV screens. The military covenant is the term used to describe that debt, which should include help given to enable servicemen and women to return to civilian life at the end of their service.However, this highlights the Greek tragedy of this process for many of them, who joined the armed forces to get away from the chaotic and dysfunctional lifestyle which had been theirs at home. The armed forces, as institutions, are often accused of overprotecting service people from the realities of life, meaning that the shock of exit is something that many cannot absorb. They don't want to go back to where they came from, are not provided with an alternative, find it difficult to settle, take to drink and/or drugs and end up in trouble with the law.Although this is not a new problem, what makes it particularly poignant today is that, by and large, the nation does not understand the stresses and strains of serving in the armed forces. But that does not absolve it from its debt, whose repayment should, I believe, be orchestrated by a minister of veteran affairs, not, as now, based in the Ministry of Defence but in the Cabinet Office, and so able to mobilise the resources of all relevant ministries â€“ Defence, Justice, Health and Work and Pensions, and also local government. I expect that many people do not even know that there is such a person, tucked away in the Ministry of Defence, which shows how seriously his role is undeveloped. No crime is excusable, but the nation should do everything possible to prevent its committal by ex-members of its armed forces, in return for their service, which, after all, includes the possibility of losing their lives.
