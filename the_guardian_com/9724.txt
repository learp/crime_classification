An inquest into the death of a Harvey Nichols beauty consultant who was shot at close range in September by a former security guard at the London store was adjourned yesterday after claims of "systematic failures" by the police, legal authorities and British customs.The Westminster coroner, Paul Knapman, agreed to adjourn the inquest for further submissions after hearing that Clare Bernal's mother had concerns that the police may have overlooked vital evidence about the state of mind of her daughter's killer, Michal Pech, and that the authorities may have been negligent in failing to stop him importing a handgun. "I thought the police had it in hand and that she was safe," Patricia Bernal told the coroner. "That was my mistake."But Clare Bernal's father rebutted her mother's claims, saying he did not believe there was anything more the authorities could have done to prevent Pech walking into the store and gunning down his daughter on September 13.Under the terms of a harassment order, Pech, a 30-year-old Czech national and former boyfriend of Bernal, had been banned from approaching the 22-year-old beauty consultant at home or work.But two weeks before he was due to return to a magistrates court to face the harassment charge, he slipped into Harvey Nichols and shot Bernal four times in the back of the head and face. He then fired a fifth bullet into the ceiling before turning the gun on himself.Victoria Daniels, who was working on the cosmetics counter next to Bernal, said when she first spotted Pech "creeping" up behind her friend she assumed he was a boyfriend or a "silly" customer."At that point Clare was looking in my direction and I smiled at her because it was time to go home, and then he pulled a gun out," she said.Detective Inspector Anthony McKeowan told the coroner the store had been empty when Pech, who had seen service in the Czech military and was high on cocaine at the time, had fired the sixth shot, so no one had seen him kill himself.Police established that he had bought the gun in Slovakia in July and had probably smuggled it into Britain in his hand luggage when he returned to London by coach on August 11. Mr McKeowan said he could not be sure what checks had been carried out on the journey. Nor could he explain why Pech, who had been remanded in Belmarsh prison, south-east London, for eight days in April for breaching his bail conditions on the harassment charge, had been released, or why he had not been given a custodial sentence when he pleaded guilty on August 31.In a statement after the hearing Mrs Bernal welcomed the decision to adjourn the inquest. She said the system had been "inadequate" and a wider inquiry might help to prevent others suffering the same fate as her daughter.
