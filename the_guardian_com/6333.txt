Failing police chiefs could be sacked by elected commissioners under reform proposals unveiled by the Tories today.A review ordered by David Cameron claims that taxpayers are not getting value for money from the police and that more local accountability is vital.Police authorities would be replaced by directly-elected commissioners who would take control of budgets, target setting and policing plans, leaving chief constables in "operational control" only of their force.In a speech today, Mr Cameron will say: "It's quite clear what the police should be doing: not filling in forms, driving round in cars or hassling law-abiding people so officers can hit government targets."The police should be out there doing what they want to be doing: stopping crime from happening and catching criminals when it does happen."But Mr Cameron will claim that these tasks have "got lost in a Labour sea of red tape, and targets, and management consultants, and reorganisations".Replacing "Labour's top-down centralisation" with "bottom-up local accountability" and replacing "state control with social responsibility", will make the country "a safer and better place to live, for everyone", Mr Cameron will say.Under the Tory proposals, residents would get a "right to policing", including cash to tackle local crime and safety issues by "hiring" a police officer or buying equipment.And forces would also face tougher scrutiny from a new independent watchdog to look at value for money as well as standards.Drawn up by Nick Herbert, the shadow minister for police reform, the report also sets out cuts in red tape and reforms of training, recruitment and pay.Mr Cameron has long advocated a reform of police accountability, earlier this year praising Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, over the issue.Today's report says that the police are being prevented from doing their job properly by a combination of "excessive bureaucracy and central intervention, an inflexible workforce, inefficient processes and political correctness".It calls for more graduates to be recruited as well as professionals from outside the force, a new military-style senior staff college and a revamped promotion system.Performance-related pay and a cut in the Â£243m bill for the 8,000 officers at present on full pay for restricted duties are also suggested.More work should be handed over to civilian staff and private firms in a bid to allow officers more time on the beat, it says, to the point of paying commercial security firms to guard crime scenes, hunt down people who jump bail, monitor "at risk" prisoners and carry out security checks.The report also says that the government's "vague pledge" of a dedicated neighbourhood policing team in every area by 2008 is not being met.But Tony McNulty, the policing minister, insisted that the government was delivering on its promises, and said that Labour had invested "record resources" in the police service and boosted police pay to "record levels"."Yet year after year the Tories refuse to back our spending commitments," he added.The report states on its first page that it is "not a statement of party policy, which will be agreed in due course. We make no specific spending pledges at this stage."But Mr Herbert denied that this meant that it lacked credibility."We've already made it quite clear that our direction of travel is towards much stronger local accountability," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning. "We've already said that we wish to see elected commissioners to replace police authorities, which are largely invisible to the public."And Mr Herbert also rejected accusations of confusion in Tory policy because the report proposes either better co-operation between the existing 43 forces or the creation of a single national force."The status quo ... creates a problem because it leaves a gap in the ability of forces to deal with incidents that cross their borders," he said."Now, the government's solution was to have regional forces. That was a bad idea that was widely opposed and is now rejected ... We wish to consult about which of those two options is the best way forward."
