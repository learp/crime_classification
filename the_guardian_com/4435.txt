Helen Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed by a gang of teenagers in 2007, is to be made a Conservative peer, it was reported today.Mrs Newlove has campaigned against drink-related violence since her husband was punched and kicked to death after going out at night to investigate noises outside his home in Warrington three years ago.During the election campaign, Mrs Newlove joined David Cameron on a visit to a youth club in Bolton, saying of the Tory leader: "I am impressed by David Cameron the person, not the politician. He is a good person."Jordan Cunliffe, Stephen Sorton and Adam Swellings were convicted of the murder of Garry Newlove in 2008. They were 16, 17 and 19 respectively when convicted. His eldest daughter Zoe witnessed the attack and told the court that her father's assailants were kicking him "like you'd kick a football".Mrs Newlove has called for better training for pub workers and a more responsible drinking culture in Britain, and earlier this year launched the National Licensed Trade Association, which aims to use campaigns, education and staff training to help stop binge drinking.She is expected to be one of the peers created by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition to "balance" the House of Lords so it better reflects the share of votes won in this month's election. At the moment there are 211 Labour peers, 186 Conservative and 72 Lib Dem, as well as 186 crossbench peers, 26 bishops and 26 others.Conservative sources declined to confirm reports that Newlove would be rewarded for her campaigning with a peerage. The No 10 press office could not be reached for comment.• This article was amended on 25 May 2010 to correct the figures on the composition of the House of Lords.
