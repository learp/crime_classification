A postmortem examination on a man who died after being attacked while returning home from a local shop on Sunday will be carried out today.Reports suggest Michael Eccles was confronted by a gang who demanded that he hand over a bottle of wine he had bought from the shop near his home in Lichfield, Staffordshire.The 43-year-old died in hospital after the attack, which happened in the Dimbles area of the town.A 20-year-old man and a 15-year-old youth, originally detained on suspicion of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, have now been rearrested on suspicion of murder.It is thought the victim, a factory worker, had been returning from his local Costcutter shop when he was attacked in the street shortly after 8pm on Sunday.Police have not confirmed whether the gang demanded that he hand over the bottle of wine he was carrying.Reports have indicated that he was beaten to death in front of his daughter.Chief inspector Ricky Fields, of Trent Valley police, said officers' thoughts were with the Eccles family."Specially trained liaison officers will be working closely with Mr Eccles' family to give them every support possible," he added.Fields described the attack as an isolated but shocking incident, and confirmed that high-visibility patrols were being carried out in the area."A mobile police station will be at the location for the rest of the week, with officers there to listen to and deal with any concerns local people might have and to talk to anyone who has information they think could help the investigation," he said."The inquiry, which is being carried out by the force's major investigations department, is progressing well."Tributes to Eccles began appearing on his page on Facebook.One described the Liverpool FC supporter as "one hell of a bloke" and offered sympathy to his family.Many of the posts expressed disbelief at what had happened, with one friend asking: "Why does it always happen to the good people?"The attack prompted Helen Newlove, whose husband Gary was kicked to death by a gang of youths outside his home in Warrington in 2007, to demand tougher sentences for violent criminals.She told ITN radio: "It does bring back memories, and it does make me very angry that, 18 months on, we are still hearing of attacks every day."This government says statistics are going down and violent crimes are going down. These statistics are not a PR stunt for us, they are actually our lives we are leading."She said that "until victims have more rights and the balance is better for victims, it is always going to be the way because there is no punishment out there that fits the crime".
