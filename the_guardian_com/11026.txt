Jacqui Smith today announced that the government's proposal to allow the detention of terrorism suspects for up to 42 days would only apply in situations where there was a "grave exceptional terrorist threat".The home secretary is going to write the phrase into the counter-terrorism bill in an attempt to avert a rebellion from Labour MPs when the legislation is put to the vote next Wednesday.The wording emerged this afternoon when Smith published a series of amendments to the bill, spelling out in precise detail the concessions that she floated before MPs at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party last night, and again in a series of media interviews this morning.The concessions seem to have significantly reduced the prospects of the government being defeated next week by an alliance of Labour rebels, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.The government has always said that it only wants the police to have the power to detain terrorism suspects for up to 42 days, instead of up to 28 days as they have now, in certain situations. Originally the home secretary would have had to have been satisfied that there was an "operational need" for the new power.Under the amendments tabled today, the power could only be used in circumstances where there was "a grave exceptional terrorist threat".A Home Office briefing note said: "A grave exceptional terrorist threat is defined as an event or situation involving terrorism which causes or threatens the serious loss of human life or serious damage to human welfare in the UK (through, for example, disruption of energy supplies or transport facilities) or serious damage to the security of the UK. The terrorist attack planned or executed need not have taken place in the UK."The Home Office said this would cover situations similar to the attacks of July 2005. But it would not cover situations where people were accused of being engaged in lesser terrorist offences, such as weapons training or terrorist financing.The amendments also confirmed that parliament would have to vote to approve the extension of pre-charge detention to 42 days on a case-by-case basis, with the first vote taking place within seven days of an order being laid, instead of 30 days as originally planned.And the amendments also confirmed that the use of the 42-day extension would only be available for 30 days, instead of the 60 days originally planned.Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons home affairs select committee, said that the changes were "directly in line" with those it called for in a critical report last year. He indicated that he would support the bill. "The home secretary has agreed with us that there is no evidence for the need for a permanent extension of the 28-day detention period, but that there may be exceptional circumstances where it may become necessary," said Vaz. But Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said that the amendments would not stop his party opposing the bill."All she has to do is to tell parliament that there is a grave and exceptional terrorist threat, and she will be entitled under the proposed amendment to go ahead without even considering whether the proposals are proportionate to the problem," he said."Holding someone for 42 days without knowing the charges against them is nearly four times as long as the maximum 12 days' period in any comparable English-speaking country. "It risks alienating the very communities we need on side to tackle terrorism by providing leads and witnesses."Shami Chakrabarti, director of the pressure group Liberty, described the amendments as "fig leaves" which did not alter the objectionable nature of the bill.Earlier Smith said that a select group of senior politicians would be given access to the kind of legal and security information on individual cases that would otherwise only be seen by the home secretary and the courts."I accept that it may well be necessary to have other independent advice on this, which is why I will make it clear in amendments that will be laid before parliament that other senior parliamentarians, on privy council terms, will need to be informed about the decision the home secretary is making," Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.She said that the measure would help to address concerns that MPs would find it difficult to scrutinise the legislation because legal restrictions would mean they would not have access to the full facts.At this morning's cabinet meeting, Smith told fellow ministers that, although some reports have suggested that the government is now confident of winning next week's vote, victory was not certain."It was emphasised that, despite the conclusions that the BBC appears to have reached, it was certainly not yet the case that we can assume that the vote is in the bag," the prime minister's spokesman said at the daily briefing for parliamentary lobby journalists today.David Cameron, the Conservative leader, accused the government of sending out mixed messages about its position."One minute the prime minister says he is standing firm and he's sticking to his guns and the next minute it's headlong retreat and concessions. It's quite hard to work out what the government is doing," Cameron told BBC Radio 4's World at One.Cameron said the government had still not convinced the Conservatives that it was necessary to allow pre-charge detention for up to 42 days. But he insisted that he was not opposing the proposal because he was soft on terrorism."The first politician I ever worked for, Ian Gow, was murdered by the IRA. There isn't a bone in my body which is soft on terror. But we must do the right thing," Cameron said.Opponents of 42-day detention may need 50 or more Labour backbenchers to rebel to defeat the measure, something the whips believe they can prevent.On the Today programme, Smith described the legislation as "proportionate" and "precautionary" and a "sensible approach to the risks that we are now facing".She said it would introduce "reserve powers" which would then have to be approved by a judge in individual cases when the current 28-day limit was deemed insufficient.MPs would also have to agree to the use of the powers after 30 days - although ministers are discussing whether that could take place earlier.Smith said that the bill would set out the "grave and exceptional" circumstances under which the legislation could be used â€“ a definition that MPs would use to decide whether to approve any use of the power to extend detention to 42 days."Trust me, as a minister and as a home secretary, one of the things that makes you think very carefully about the decision that we are making is not only the immediate explanation that you are going to need to give to parliament but the fact that, six months to a year down the line, an independent reviewer will go back over this decision," said Smith.Later she told BBC News that she was hopeful of winning next week's vote, adding: "I am not giving up, because frankly, this sort of decision is about what being in government is about." Peter Clarke, the former Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, gave a boost to the government's case today when he said that the current 28-day limit would "undoubtedly" soon become insufficient.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Clarke, a former chief of terrorist investigations, said that the debate had become politicised and that the "principle of being able to protect the public in extremis must be right".
