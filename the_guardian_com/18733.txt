There must have been times when they thought they would get away with it: when Sir William Macpherson stated "no fresh evidence is likely to emerge against them now", when they insisted they were just "lovable rogues", or when prosecutors announced there was not enough evidence to try anyone for the murder of Stephen Lawrence.But in reality Gary Dobson and David Norris – and the three other prime suspects – have never escaped the notoriety and hatred of 18 years of suspicion from the media, the public and a chastened criminal justice system that has pursued them as they grew from teenage racists into jobless middle-aged men.Today, the swagger of thugs – who armed themselves with coshes, swords and knives to terrorise Eltham in a string of racist attacks – has long gone. Gary Dobson, his face slightly chubby, his waist a little thicker, still wears a flash three-piece suit, but has the bearing of a harried bank clerk. David Norris, who for so long was protected by his gangland father Clifford, cuts a pathetic figure. His cheeks are sunken, his skin white from prison pallor and his hearing so poor that he had to wear earphones throughout the court proceedings.Over the past 18 years, Dobson and Norris and other members of the gang they belonged to, including fellow suspects the Acourt brothers Jamie and Neil, and Luke Knight, have retained strong links, bound by shared criminal activity and a vow of silence that has resisted repeated attempts by the police to "turn" one or more of their number into a grass.When detectives came for Dobson and Norris in September 2010, it was no surprise to either man. "Conspiracy or murder?" Dobson asked his arresting officer. "All right", were the only words Norris uttered.Within 48 hours of Stephen's murder, they and others in the gang had been named by 26 different sources as responsible. Dobson and Norris have been arrested three times, put under surveillance at least three times, appeared at an inquest, a public inquiry and on television – each time lying about their involvement in the racist murder.In the past 18 years none of the gang has moved far from Well Hall Road in Eltham, where Stephen Lawrence died, or from the criminality that began as they marauded around their manor as teenage racist thugs. Led by the Acourts, who called themselves the Eltham Krays, they had a fearsome reputation, at any one point numbering up to 11, and including Norris, Dobson, Luke Knight, Charles Martin and Danny Caetano.With the conviction on Tuesday of Dobson and Norris, only the Acourts and Luke Knight remain at large of the core group. Martin and Caetano were jailed in 1995 for attempted murder and grievous bodily harm respectively, for slicing a knife wound down a man's back in an attack likened in court to skinning him alive.Today on the streets around the Progress Estate, which borders Well Hall Road, people still remember the gang and their reputation. "I know of them by sight," said one resident. "I used to see them about over the years after the killing, in the supermarket and that, but not so much now."Over the years, Dobson and Norris have continued to see the Acourts, and have been spotted gathering outside the J Ayre bakery in the town, where Dobson's mother used to work, lunching together at the Eletriq Italian restaurant in the high street or playing golf at a nearby range.Dobson's parents, Stephen and Pauline, still live a stone's throw from the site where Lawrence was stabbed, in the three-bedroomed semi-detached house where two weeks after the murder police found the jacket and cardigan which were to prove the key to their son's downfall.Dobson has moved several times – as he, like the others, tried to remain anonymous – but never more than a few miles away.Living in Westerham, Kent, with his partner and their son, who is now 11, there was evidence of his continued links to the gang when neighbours called the police after they saw men unloading garden furniture late at night. Dobson was charged with handling stolen goods but the case was not pursued. He later moved to Woolwich, just a few miles from Eltham, and now lives in Swanley, Kent, with his new girlfriend Michelle Lines – who appeared in court to blow kisses and wave at him during the trial.Before the Lawrence murder he had already shown his violent, racist tendencies. He was named by Kevin London, a 16-year-old black teenager, as one of a larger gang of white youths who threatened him with a large knife in November 1992 – five months before the Lawrence killing.What happened to London was just one of a string of racist assaults around Eltham and Thamesmead, areas which in the early 1990s had bitter experience of racial assaults, many of which police now believe were linked to the gang.Dobson blames his inability to hold down a job for nearly two decades on the notoriety caused by unfounded suspicion for the Lawrence killing. He has always been the most outspoken in protesting his innocence to anyone who would listen. And at times there were many willing to air his denials, from the Tonight programme on ITV, where he was interviewed by the journalist Martin Bashir and insisted he and his friends were "rascals, lovable rogues", to Talk Radio, where he complained his life was "constantly under threat", and blatantly lied: "I swear to you on my mother's life that I am not guilty of this crime. I am innocent."Until last year, Dobson had managed to stay out of prison – although he had been arrested several times on suspicion of a number of offences, including handling stolen goods, running an illegal immigrant importation racket through a Kent port with the Acourts, and a series of burglaries. The only offences he had been convicted of were shoplifting and stealing kegs of beer from a pub near Chelmsford, Essex, in 2000, for which he was fined.But in 2010 Dobson was caught by members of the Serious Organised Crime Agency trafficking £350,000 worth of cannabis into the country. He was sent to prison for five years, and was still serving his term while on trial for the murder of Lawrence.Seen as the weak link in the gang, Dobson has been pressed several times by the police to turn supergrass. "I wish I could tell you something because then we would all be out of this mess," he told police after his arrest in 1995. "I'm not enjoying sitting here in this police station and I didn't enjoy it the last time [in 1993]. If I did know anything believe me it would come off my chest."When shown footage of the police surveillance tapes made at his flat in Footscray Road, a year after the killing, which provide graphic illustration of his violent racism, Dobson became uncharacteristically quiet, refusing to make any further comment.One senior police source told the Guardian that repeated attempts to turn Dobson always failed because he would never admit his guilt. "It was going to go nowhere while he refused to admit what he had done," the source said.Dobson faced trial in 1996, but was formally acquitted by the judge when the identification evidence presented by a traumatised Duwayne Brooks was ruled inadmissible.At that point he might have thought he would never be brought to justice. Four years later he became a father to a little boy, but his relationship with the mother did not last long – and neither did any belief that he was in the clear.With a change to the double jeopardy law in 2005, Dobson could be charged again for the Lawrence murder if "new and compelling" evidence came to light, which with the advance of forensic science it did in the form of a microscopic spot of Stephen's blood on the collar of his jacket.Throughout the last six weeks, Dobson has barely exchanged a word in the dock with his long-time friend David Norris. The jury was never told about Norris's past, his conviction for racially aggravated harassment, and the protection provided to him by his father, Clifford Norris, a drug dealer and gangster.A police intelligence map, seen by the Guardian, put Clifford Norris at the head of a crime group which controlled much of south London's drugs trade in the early 1990s, and presided over criminal associates including members of the Acourt family.Norris Sr's shadow hung over the first investigations into the Lawrence murder, with suspicions that he had corrupted police officers on the inquiry. The allegations were never substantiated, but there is clear evidence outlined in the Macpherson report that Norris senior was always watching out for his son, and through a mixture of threats and inducements tried to fix another trial in which his son was accused of stabbing another man.It was Clifford Norris's criminal career that paid for the luxury in which Norris was brought up in a large mock Tudor house behind gates in Chislehurst, Kent, protected by the family dogs, two terriers and a rottweiler. He lived there with his mother, Teresa – who invented an alibi for him during his murder trial after 18 years of silence – his father and two brothers. "There was never any shortage of money," Norris said in court.His horizons were always limited; holidays were taken in Hastings on the south coast in the family caravan and Norris said in evidence that he had rarely been outside south-east London and had never been north of the river. When he was still a child in 1988 his father went on the run, wanted by customs and excise for major drug dealing offences, but Norris Sr was to maintain contact with his family in his absence.By the age of 16, David Norris had given up on education and begun working as a scrap metal man with his grandfather, an occupation punctuated by an emerging criminal career which was always characterised by violent racism, thuggery and cruelty.Nearly a year before the Lawrence attack, Norris, Jamie Acourt and Luke Knight were suspected of assaulting two brothers, one of whom was stabbed with a butterfly knife. Norris was charged with wounding, but for no apparent reason in 1993 the charges were withdrawn because they were deemed too "stale".Later in 1993, Norris Sr was involved in apparently fixing a trial in which his son was accused of the attempted murder of Stacey Benefield with a nine-inch sword. Benefield had named Norris as his attacker, and said Neil Acourt had looked on. Both men were charged with attempted murder but Norris's father came to his son's aid. Still on the run, he arranged a meeting through his henchman with Benefield and another witness and put pressure on them to drop the charges, offering him £2,000 as an inducement, wrapped up with a veiled threat: "This is how I sort people out – not by shooting them," Macpherson records him as saying. Benefield refused to change his evidence.During the trial there was a further apparent attempt to nobble the foreman of the jury and David Norris was found not guilty in November 1993. The charge against Acourt had been dropped before trial.A year later, on the police surveillance tapes made at Dobson's flat, the true face of the racist thug that is Norris was exposed when he was heard talking about torturing black people and Asians, and routinely referring to them as niggers and pakis.At that point Norris's father had finally been captured, and he was sentenced to nine and a half years for drugs and firearms offences leaving his son, for the first time, to stand alone without his protection.Kicked out of his father's £800,000 home in Chislehurst, which was seized by the authorities, he did not fare well, and over the years has been in and out of prison several times.But there was always a tinge of something pathetic about David Norris's criminality. In 1999, he was convicted with Jamie Acourt and Danny Caetano after they cut their way through the wire fence outside a warehouse in Swanley, Kent, and stole 32 empty soda siphons.A year later he was sent to jail for driving while disqualified, and two years later he returned to the scene of the Lawrence murder, Well Hall Road, with Neil Acourt, where he shouted "nigger" at a passing black man, who happened to be an off-duty police officer, Gareth Reid.Both men were jailed for 12 months for racially aggravated intentional harassment, and wrote a letter before they went to prison to the nail bomber David Copeland. "We are being done for abusing a black copper," they said. "We hope we don't get stuck in with a load of niggers."Briefly out of prison, he was jailed again in 2004 for 27 months for stealing beer from a pub in Kent and handling a stolen Range Rover.By the time Norris was arrested for the murder last year he was living a pitiful existence. His girlfriend, the mother of his five children, had kicked him out and police found Norris sleeping in a hostel above a pub in Greenwich.
