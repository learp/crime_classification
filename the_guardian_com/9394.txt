The Home Office minister Liam Byrne apologised today after he was fined £100 for talking on a mobile phone while driving.Magistrates in Sutton Coldfield also ordered Mr Byrne to pay £35 costs and a £15 victim surcharge, and imposed three penalty points on his licence.Mr Byrne, 37, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, was stopped in the city earlier this year.The former police minister told the court in a letter that he had been taking an important call on a deportation matter at the time.Today Mr Byrne said in a statement: "Talking on a phone without a hands-free is wrong. I have apologised unreservedly to the court." The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, later gave him her support.The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents welcomed the sentence.Kevin Clinton, the society's head of road safety, said: "The Home Office is responsible for the law and its ministers should be well aware of it and set the correct example."Far too many lives have been lost needlessly because of mobile phone calls, and whether you are on a handheld or a hands-free phone you are four times more likely to crash."Mr Byrne, regarded as intelligent and ambitious, is a high-profile figure for a junior minister and handles a key government brief. He had been tipped for a cabinet post in the last reshuffle.His conviction completed a torrid week for the minister. On Wednesday he suffered a setback when a high court ruling confirmed that Learco Chindamo, the killer of headteacher Philip Lawrence, cannot be deported to Italy when he is released from jail. Mr Byrne has said the government wants foreign nationals who commit serious crimes to be automatically deported.On Tuesday, he conceded the public was "right" to expect the government to have accurate immigration statistics, after it emerged that ministers had underestimated the net increase in foreign workers over the past decade by at least 300,000.Mr Byrne, a father-of-three, becomes one of an increasing number of motorists to have been punished for using a mobile phone at the wheel.The number of drivers handed on-the-spot fines jumped by 71% in 2005 compared to a year earlier, new figures showed this week.The Ministry of Justice said police in England and Wales issued 126,800 fixed-penalty notices for the offence in 2005, up nearly 53,000 on the previous year.
