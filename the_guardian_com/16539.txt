Two men have been convicted of stealing from an injured Malaysian student after pretending to help him during the London riots.Mobile phone footage of Ashraf Rossli being attacked during last August's riots caused widespread outrage.On Friday a jury at Wood Green crown court convicted John Kafunda, 22, of robbery and violent disorder.Kafunda, of Ilford, was captured on camera putting his arm around Rossli and pretending to protect him.Reece Donovan, 24, of Romford, was caught on camera rifling through the accountancy student's bag while the victim's back was to him. He was convicted of theft, violent disorder and later burgling a Tesco store.The jury of five women and seven men was given a majority direction to continue deliberating over whether Donovan was guilty of robbery. The jury returned to unanimously convict him of the charge.The judge thanked the jurors and adjourned sentencing to 13 March.The pair shook their heads as the jury foreman returned the unanimous verdicts.Kafunda walked out of the dock down to the cells as the jury rose and initially refused to return. Judge James Patrick asked where he was and was told by a dock officer that he had gone for a walk.Kafunda later returned to hear his co-accused's verdict.Rossli, 21, had been in Britain for just a month when he was attacked. He was cycling to keep a female friend company on 8 August and had to find his way through a crowd as he cycled on a flyover in Barking.He was attacked by Beau Isagba, 17, of Ilford, who thumped him in the face, smashing his jaw and cycling off on his bike. Rossli was left bleeding on the pavement and now has metal plates in his jaw.Isagba is due to be sentenced on 9 March, the day after his 18th birthday.Footage of Kafunda and Donovan preying on Rossli was posted on YouTube and received widespread publicity.Rossli told police a portable Sony PlayStation and 10 games were taken, worth Â£500. He said in his statement: "I was sat on the pavement with blood pouring from my mouth."I remember being approached by a male who asked if I was OK. I remember being pulled to my feet, then I felt someone again tugging at my rucksack."I was not in a position to defend myself and was still suffering from the effects of being hit. I knew they were stealing from me but I could do nothing. Once they had taken what they wanted, they left."Chief Superintendent Gary Buttercase, temporary borough commander at Barking and Dagenham, said: "I would like to commend Barking and Dagenham robbery squad for their tenacity, professionalism and detective ability in securing a conviction in this and the previous case of Beau Isagba."I have met Mr Rossli and he is a man of humility and dignity and a tremendous credit to his country, and I am particularly pleased that we have managed to get justice for the appalling attack he suffered and the subsequent theft that has attracted derision from across the world."I would also like to thank the many witnesses in this case who have shown fantastic public spirit in coming forward and assisting my officers."I wish Mr Rossli an enjoyable stay in London for the rest of his studies and thank him for his co-operation in this matter."
