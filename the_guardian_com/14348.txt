Thousands of dangerous offenders released into the community from prison are going largely unchecked, according to senior probation officials, who have expressed alarm at the quality of the monitoring of 30,000 released criminals.Senior Whitehall sources are braced for further revelations involving a number of 'supervision failures' similar to those involving Damien Hanson. There was public outcry last year when it emerged that Hanson, who was convicted for the murder of Chelsea banker John Monckton, was given only the lowest level of supervision when released after serving seven years of a 12-year sentence for attempted murder.Under the current system, offenders are graded according to the risk they are judged to pose to the public. Level-three offenders, considered to be the most serious threat to the public and who number some 1,500 in the UK, are assigned almost permanent surveillance by a range of protection agencies.The 11,500 level-two offenders at large are also monitored by a combination of outside agencies, from the police to probation officers and mental health workers.But 30,000 level-one violent and sexual offenders receive little supervision other than meetings with probation officers. The Observer understands that a Home Office analysis has found that these offenders are responsible for 80 per cent of the serious crimes committed by those released from prison and subject to supervision orders.The furore that followed Monckton's murder prompted an inquiry into the failings of the London probation service and sparked calls for more offenders to be subjected to stringent monitoring by qualified probation officers.But the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo) says a shortage in the number of trained probation officers means that supervision is often patchy. Napo estimates there is a shortfall of some 700 trained officers nationwide. In a typical London borough, about 30 per cent of probation officer positions are vacant, which means that untrained staff are often being used to make up for the gaps, according to sources within the service.'Just because somebody is initially classed as low-risk does not mean their behaviour will not deteriorate,' said Harry Fletcher, assistant general-secretary of Napo. 'We calculate that there is an urgent need for hundreds more experienced police and probation officers to work in public protection units to meet Home Office requirements for the correct level of supervision. Even if the Home Office started to recruit now, it would take three years before they were properly trained.'There are claims that the pressure on the probation service has been exacerbated by an increasing number of 'high- risk' offenders being released from prison after serving only the minimum amount of their sentence.The Conservative Party's home affairs spokesman, Edward Garnier, has tabled questions in parliament demanding to know how many prisoners on licence were recalled to prison following a breach of their licence.The government had planned to allow the private sector a greater role in the probation service in an attempt to make it more efficient and to shore up staffing levels. The move was part of an overhaul that would see the service combined with the prison system under the National Offender Management Service (Noms).However, concerns that this might harm the quality of the probation service have forced the government to postpone for at least a year its plans to merge the two services.It is understood that the Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, now believes that the private sector should be barred from bidding for contracts that would allow it to supervise dangerous offenders.A Home Office spokesman disputed Napo's claims about a national shortfall in trained probation officers. He said that there were currently 197 vacancies within the probation service nationally. 'We're actively looking to fill these posts. It doesn't affect performance or our ability to protect the public,' the spokesman said.
