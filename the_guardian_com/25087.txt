The jailing of the "pathetic fantasist" Andrew Purdy for three months for wasting police time - Purdy had falsely claimed he had received threatening phone calls during the height of the police investigation into the murders of five young women involved in the sex industry in Ipswich during December 2006 - raises interesting questions about why people make false claims, especially false confessions about high-profile crimes.In Purdy's case perhaps we can simply accept the judge's verdict that Purdy "got satisfaction and a sense of importance by pretending to be a significant prosecution witness in a case that attracted a huge amount of public attention". That only seems to scratch the surface of the motivation of those people who almost routinely walk into police stations claiming that they are in fact the murderers or rapists that the police have been looking for, and hardly dents a growing body of research into why people confess to some of the most gruesome crimes that have been committed here and elsewhere.In fact, Purdy is only the most recent "fantasist" who has involved himself in a high-profile police investigation, and, for example, in March 2006 John Humble - a "hopeless alcoholic", was sentenced to eight years in prison for falsely claiming to be the Yorkshire Ripper. Humble had sent three letters (one of which was modelled on a suspected forgery from 1988 during the original Ripper investigation) and a tape to Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield who had been leading the investigation, and who was sufficiently impressed by "Wearside Jack" to divert time, attention and police resources to uncovering the author.Of course, these are "fantasist confessors" who volunteer "information" to the police, but policing interviewing techniques can also induce perfectly innocent people to claim that they are in fact guilty of some of the worst crimes that we could imagine. Professor Gisli Gudjonsson, for example, has been at the forefront of research which has attempted to understand why people "confess" to awful things which they did not do, and has identified a range of important emotional and psychological factors - such as compliance, personality disorders and especially suggestibility to understand and explain why some people admit to crimes that they did not commit when being interviewed by the police in circumstances that will induce a confession from a completely innocent person, and thereby "solve" the case.Gudjonsson's research is important and deserves far greater dissemination, but perhaps I can also be allowed some more personal and far less researched observations about a confessional culture, based on my work in Ipswich last December on behalf of Sky News. As an analyst on the case who was appearing hourly on TV, I became aware of another phenomenon that was happening - as it were - before my eyes. People had become so involved in what was being reported that they wanted to "solve" the case by identifying suspects from TV as though they were engaged in a reality TV programme about "whodunnit".It became commonplace for me to receive emails from well-intentioned members of the public sincerely identifying the likely culprit, based on the most scandalous and slanderous of reasons. There were those who saw religious reasons as being at the heart of the murders (prostitutes were being "cleansed" of their sins through their murders), or xenophobes who pointed out to me that the nearby ports to Ipswich suggested that the culprit had to be "a foreigner". Emails even came from those who thought that the murders were the work of the KGB desperate to get bad publicity about the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko off the front pages.And it is here - bizarrely - that I find myself in the same camp as Sir Alex Ferguson, who last week claimed that that the booing that accompanied England's 3-0 victory over Andorra was the by-product of reality TV shows, where castigation and humiliation are the mainstays of both how we are entertained and expected to behave. While Ferguson has a point, he misses another aspect of this reality TV culture. We are all, in effect, encouraged to believe that, in the words of the old national lottery advert, "it could be you".In other words, it doesn't actually matter if you have talent and ability for you can still be the winner - just look at Sanjaya Malakar, the unlikely favourite to win the new American Idol, and in this vein you can be the culprit even if you haven't actually committed the crime. In short, Andrew Purdy is no more a pathetic fantasist than those who routinely think that they are capable of singing, dancing, skating or learning a musical instrument or the French language. We are increasingly inhabiting a culture where what is real and what is fantasy has become so blurred that it no longer matters at all. In a culture of "it could be you" what matters most is that you get attention - any attention - whether that brings with it the label "singer" or, in the most extreme cases, "murderer".
