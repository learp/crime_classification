Police are investigating the suspected sabotage of intravenous drip bags in the paediatric department of an NHS hospital where a three-year-old girl died on Saturday.Staff at Basildon University hospital, Essex, called in the police on Sunday after 12 intravenous fluid bags were found to have been punctured, prompting fears that they might have been spiked.Essex police said an investigation into damage to the bags is being run in tandem with an inquiry into the death of the child, who was admitted to the hospital on Friday and died the following morning.Staff discovered the bags leaking fluid in a storeroom for the children's wards on Sunday and sent them for forensic analysis to establish whether they had been spiked with any dangerous drugs or substances.Essex police said the girl was seriously ill when she arrived at the hospital, but a postmortem examination is being held tomorrowto establish whether there was any link to the suspected tampering.Detective Superintendent Tim Wills said: "A postmortem examination will be carried out by a specialist forensic pathologist and the purpose is to establish the cause of death, support the family and keep them informed."A police spokeswoman said: "This investigation is being run in tandem [with] the investigation into the damage to 12 intravenous bags discovered at the storeroom in the paediatric wards on Sunday evening."However, there is no evidence to link the two incidents at this time. Police are undertaking a very thorough investigation with the full support of the staff at the hospital."She added: "Detectives will be speaking to staff on the wards of the hospital including porters, cleaners everyone." CCTV footage is also being examined.Maggie Rogers, director of nursing at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: "I can reassure our local community that we rapidly took necessary steps to ensure patient safety."Essex police appealed for anyone with information to contact officers.
