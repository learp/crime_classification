The women's prison investigated following the self-inflicted deaths of six inmates was this week the scene of an another attempted suicide, it has emerged.The prisons ombudsman, Stephen Shaw, yesterday published a critical report on the deaths of six women who all took their own lives within one 12-month period at Styal prison in Cheshire.The investigation marked the first time that an independent body had been asked to report into a death in custody and was the first-ever inquiry into a series of deaths.Mr Shaw concluded that the major factor in all six deaths at Styal was drug misuse among prisoners he describes as "intensely vulnerable".Following the six deaths a new governor was installed and a number of measures put in place to improve safety.These include a first night centre, where the medical and psychiatric needs of women are thoroughly assessed; the introduction of a methadone detoxification programme; and the opening of a therapeutic unit.But as the results of Mr Shaw's investigation were published, reports emerged suggesting that Styal, which is set to become the biggest women's prison in Europe, is still failing to meet the needs of prisoners requiring the greatest care.This week inmates criticised the treatment of Fadeke Badderin, 29, who was distressed when told that she was to be transferred from Styal to Drake Hall prison in Staffordshire just two months before the end of her sentence.On Tuesday, her cellmate woke to see Ms Badderin swallowing a cocktail of medication and cosmetics - skin cream, mouthwash, tablets prescribed for thrush, antibiotic ear drops and a large quantity of liquid Gaviscon.The cellmate claims she pressed the alarm bell at 7.30am but that staff did not respond until 8am and then told other prisoners that Ms Badderin would have "done no harm to herself".At 9am prisoners escorted Ms Badderin, now vomiting violently, to the heathcare centre. Two hours later she was transferred to Drake Hall.One prisoner said that, while many of the staff were dedicated and caring, others "did not give a fuck about sick women".A number of inmates are believed to have lodged official complaints about the treatment of Ms Badderin..
