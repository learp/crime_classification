A plastic bag containing a decapitated woman's head was found by children as they played on a beach in Scotland today.Police arrived to seal off the beach, in Arbroath, Angus - where a woman's hand was also found - shortly after 10.30am. Officers said two young sisters had made the grisly discovery. They immediately went home and told their mother, who alerted police.Tayside police said the items were being removed and an "extensive search" of the beachfront was being conducted."The body parts will be subject to further detailed forensic examination," a spokesman said. "Efforts are under way to try to establish the identity of the deceased."A team of forensic officers combed the closed off area of the beach, while two officers wearing white protective suits, face masks and blue gloves worked next to what appeared to be a large tarpaulin. The Angus MSP, Andrew Welsh, said the discovery was an "absolute shock"."This would be a shock in any area of Scotland, but especially in Arbroath, which is a family holiday town," he added. "This incident has come completely out of the blue, and it is a hideous situation for these youngsters."He said children should be kept away from the beach in case of more body parts being found.Patricia Millar, chairwoman of the Royal Burgh of Arbroath community council, said she was "shocked and appalled" by the discovery.A major crime team being put together to assist the investigation will be contacting forces around the country to see if the discovery relates to any current missing persons.The police spokesman appealed for anyone with information to contact the Tayside force.
