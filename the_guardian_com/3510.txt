A conman who went on a "prolific" burglary spree at top hotels around the world to fund his playboy lifestyle was jailed for three and a half years yesterday.Juan Carlos Guzman-Betancourt, believed by police to be the son of a Colombian diplomat, repeatedly criss-crossed continents for wealthy prey. Using his charm, good looks and designer suits, the "jet-set thief" hijacked the identities of wealthy guests, including an Arab billionaire, to gain access to their rooms and safes. London's Southwark Crown Court heard that his modus operandi of "lost room keys" and "forgotten safe codes" never failed, allowing him to burgle rooms with impunity after staff had unlocked safes. The 29-year-old, an expert linguist who used 10 aliases, stole at least £150,000 of jewellery, cash and other goods in Britain alone and up to £500,000 worldwide. He admitted at an earlier hearing burgling the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, in May 2001 and the Dorchester, Park Lane, in December last year. In the first, an English couple lost £35,000 of jewellery; in the second, a Bahraini businessman lost items including a £2,000 Valentino leather jacket and an £8,000 watch. The conman, who asked for 14 other offences to be taken into consideration, showed no reaction as he was sentenced.
