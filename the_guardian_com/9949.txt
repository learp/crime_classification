A member of the influential Coulsfield inquiry in 2006 into alternatives to custody, Marcel Berlins is well placed to set in context probation's part in the failure to protect the two young French students from the murderous behaviour of Dano Sonnex and his accomplice, Nigel Farmer (Writ Large, 8 June). Probation staff throughout the country will be appalled by these savage murders, and every probation chief will be committed to ensuring that their area services improve the capacity of staff to protect their local communities from dangerous, violent and sexual offenders. What we need now, however, is both public and political support for our work and recognition that our supervision of dangerous, troubled and troublesome individuals, often with little stake in society or concern for their victims, is effective in more than 99% of cases.In the last year for which figures are available, 2007-08, some 50,000 dangerous offenders were managed under the multi-agency public protection arrangements, of whom 79 were charged or convicted of serious further offences. We do not prefix this figure with "only" because we know that every one of those 0.67% of cases has involved immeasurable suffering to the victims and the people close to them. The justice secretary accepted in his statement to the House of Commons this week that it is simply not possible to eliminate risk completely, but probation's track record does show that we can minimise the risk of harm posed by dangerous offenders and we must ensure that when tragic incidents occur in future, they are not down to failures within probation or the multi-agency arrangements.
