One of the prisoners facing trial for the July bombings has been separated "for security reasons" from his co-defendants and put in a "prison within a prison within a prison" at the Belmarsh maximum security jail in London, the chief inspector of prisons discloses today.Anne Owers says she is so concerned that the quality of life for the man, held in isolation with a dedicated staff and separate exercise area, is so poor that he should be moved to alternative accommodation. She says the prison is at full stretch dealing with demands of legal visits for inmates facing terror charges.The chief inspector also discloses that four others charged with terrorist offences held in another special secure unit are allowed to associate only in pairs and were banned from attending Friday prayers to avoid contact with other prisoners.The report of the inspection is the first disclosure of the conditions in which those facing trial for the London bombings are being held.Ms Owers reports general concerns among the 140 Muslim prisoners held at Belmarsh that white staff were "punitive" towards them, and did not understand their social and religious behaviour.The chief inspector says in her report on an unannounced inspection last October at the east London prison that half the prisoners felt unsafe at the jail, particularly Asian inmates. Her report also raises concerns about the intimidatory behaviour of some of the younger Muslim prisoners, but she says it has more to do with gang culture than religious affiliation.The four "spurs" inside Belmarsh's high security unit were in full use at the time of the inspection, with 18 high risk inmates and five in the exceptional risk category. There are so many in the unit that its capacity to cope with legal visits is under strain.One spur is the special secure unit holding four prisoners charged with terrorist offences who, at the time of the inspection, were banned from attending prayers with others. The chief inspector suggested they should be allowed to join communal prayers as soon as possible.Two other spurs hold high risk, category A prisoners and the fourth spur holds eight prisoners awaiting trial for crimes linked to the London bombings.The chief inspector says the decision to put these eight inmates in the high security unit was understandable as there was "credible intelligence" they would have faced intimidation and threats from other prisoners if they were held in the rest of the prison.But the ninth prisoner being held in connection with the London bombings is being held in a special secure area that is locally known as the contingency planning unit and was set up specifically to manage that prisoner, who needed to be kept apart from the others. This comprises his cell, a small multi-gym recreational space and a separate visiting suite. He takes open air exercise in a separate part of the prison by himself."We are concerned that this unit provided a very poor quality of life for the one prisoner detained there," says the chief inspector. "If this degree of separation from co-defendants is required for what may be a protracted period awaiting trial, alternative arrangements should be found for him, at least until his trial is imminent."Her report says there were 140 Muslim prisoners among the 905-strong Belmarsh population and they were part of "a complex ethnic and religious mix of prisoners", with a quarter foreign nationals and half black or from minority ethnic groups.Phil Wheatley, director-general of the prison service, said the multi-faith chaplaincy team at Belmarsh had "excellent working relationships" with staff and managers which enabled them to meet the "diverse faiths and cultural needs of the prisoner". A spokeswoman added that the four facing terrorist charges had been allowed to take part in communal prayers since the inspection.
