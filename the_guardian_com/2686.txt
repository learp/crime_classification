A student pub-crawl organiser has been given a suspended jail sentence for punching a 61-year-old man unconscious after he expressed concerns about noise during an event involving 1,000 students.Ryan Hilton, 23, was given a six-month sentence suspended for two years for attacking 61-year-old Mark Roberts during an event in Bangor, north Wales, organised by the Carnage company.His victim, a commercial diver who lives near a number of student venues, approached Hilton to seek reassurance that he would get a good night's sleep.But Hilton, a 6ft 4in nightclub bouncer, responded with a foul-mouthed tirade and punched Roberts on the chin with such force that he fell to the ground, banged his head and was knocked unconscious.Hilton, from Muston, North Yorkshire, was convicted by district judge Miriam Shelby following a trial at Llandudno magistrates court in March.Having asked Hilton about the noise and been told to "fuck off", Roberts tapped Hilton on the shoulder. Giving evidence at the trial, Roberts said: "He swung round so fast and, with his right hand, he caught me on the chin."As he fell backwards he heard the defendant say: "Get your fucking hands off me."The ordeal continued even after an ambulance was called. Roberts told the court a student wearing a Carnage T-shirt followed him and the paramedics to the vehicle and accused him of exaggerating his injuries to spoil their party.Roberts said the ambulance workers locked him in the vehicle with them for their own protection when the unknown youth added: "I'll finish the job."Hilton had claimed Roberts was drunk and aggressive and he was acting in self-defence when he "pushed" the resident away from him. But the judge rejected this version of events.The trial last month heard that around 1,000 students were taking part in the Bangor pub crawl on 3 March last year, watched over by 25 volunteer stewards. Following a Carnage night in the city the previous year, North Wales police had expressed concerns about the event.Sentencing Hilton today, Judge Shelby told him she was convinced to suspend the jail term by a plea for leniency from Roberts.She told Hilton: "You were employed by a company with an unsavoury name – Carnage UK – which is involved in making commercial profit from mass bar crawls for students in university towns."You told me it was your job to sort out complaints."Mr Roberts was a 61-year-old man living in the area directly affected that night."Your response to him was to abuse him verbally and punch him to the face with such force that you knocked him to the floor and he lost consciousness."The judge added that, in her view, the force of the attack and the disparity of age between the two men meant Hilton should go straight to jail.But she added: "It is unusual to hear such a cogent plea from the victim that the offender should be spared a prison sentence."Hilton, who no longer works for Carnage UK and can no longer work in security because of his conviction, was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay his victim £1,500 in compensation.Carnage UK has attracted criticism for apparent excessive drinking by students taking part in its pub crawls across the country.Last year, Sheffield student Philip Laing, 19, was convicted after being photographed urinating on a war memorial during a Carnage UK event.Andrew McInnes, in mitigation, said Hilton did not accept the guilty verdict, and it is understood he is planning to appeal.Outside court, Roberts said he was pleased with the sentence. He said: "I wrote to the judge saying I would like to see him carry out community service, perhaps cleaning up the streets after one of the Carnage events."
