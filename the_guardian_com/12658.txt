A senior police commander whose officers bungled investigations into the rapist John Worboys and other high-profile cases has been removed on the orders of the Metropolitan police commissioner.Chris Jarratt, 49, is the first senior police figure to be moved in the aftermath of revelations showing that Scotland Yard officers missed several opportunities to arrest the cab driver Worboys and to stop his sexual attacks on passengers. Sir Paul Stephenson, the Met commissioner, ordered the removal of Jarratt as commander of Greenwich borough, south London, after expressing "deep concerns" over failures in the Worboys inquiry and in the investigation of the murder of the teenager Rob Knox by Karl Bishop.In both cases, police under Jarratt's command, at Plumstead station, failed to investigate properly. They arrested 51-year-old Worboys but did not pursue the inquiry and left him free to attack 29 more women. They failed to arrest Bishop, now 22, over a knife robbery two months before he stabbed Knox to death in Sidcup. Knox, 18, was an actor who had starred in the Harry Potter films. Sources said there were concerns over the leadership of Greenwich borough on a number of issues. Stephenson has already acted to move serious sexual assaults and rapes investigations to the homicide and serious crime command, because of failings over several years.Worboys was one of Britain's most prolific sexual attackers. Detectives believe he could have assaulted more than 100 women passengers in his black cab before he was arrested last year. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is now investigating the case.A Scotland Yard spokesman yesterday said Jarratt had "undertaken a good job in Greenwich but in common with many roles at this level it's time for him to utilise his skills elsewhere in the Met".
