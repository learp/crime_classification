Pete Doherty was arrested today for suspected drug possession - less than a fortnight after a judge warned him he faced prison if he failed to clean up his act.The 28-year-old singer was arrested when police stopped the car he was travelling in in the Tower Hamlets area of east London at about 2am today, hours after he had performed at the V festival in Stafford.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "A 28-year-old man was arrested in east London on suspicion of possession of drugs. He is in custody at an east London police station."On August 7, while appearing before west London magistrates court on other charges, a judge told the Babyshambles singer he would be sent to jail if he did not make an effort to fight his drug addiction.Doherty will be sentenced on September 4 after admitting driving illegally while in possession of crack, heroin, ketamine and cannabis. He had told the court he was trying to address his problem.The judge, Davinder Lachlar, said: "What I have in mind is to adjourn the matter for four weeks to assess his motivation."What I have in mind is a community order or prison. If he does not show his motivation, it's prison - as simple as that."
