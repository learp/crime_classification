The government is looking at ways to fast-track criminals out of the country as part of a series of measures to gain control of the crisis engulfing the Home Office.As police continued their attempts to trace hundreds of foreign criminals who were released without being considered for deportation, ministers were yesterday considering ways of improving removal procedures between the UK and other countries, particularly Jamaica and Nigeria, whose nationals make up a significant proportion of the foreign prison population - more than 130 of the prisoners freed recently came from there. However, there is concern that any initiative might fall foul of human rights legislation.Ministers also want to act more urgently against foreigners who have committed offences while overstaying their permission to be in the country. It is thought it might be possible to short-circuit court procedures in such cases.The ideas came as further evidence emerged of the complacency within the Home Office that led to what Charles Clarke, the home secretary, referred to as its "shocking administrative failure".The man who was in charge of the unit dealing with the cases for the last three years was promoted in January. And Home Office newsletters seen by the Guardian show that despite No 10's claims this week that Â£2.7m was made available last summer to double the 100-strong team dealing with prisoner deportations, most have yet to be recruited.Since then, the number of foreign prisoners being released without being considered for deportation has been running at an average of more than 40 a month. Mr Clarke said this week that he had first learned of the problem last July but only became "fully aware" of the scale in October. But at the same time the senior immigration inspector, Alan Kittle, in charge of a "criminal casework team" responsible for deciding whether foreign prisoners should be deported, was telling colleagues: "It has been rewarding to see an improvement in the way both [the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and Prison Service] departments work together."Mr Kittle was due to leave his job for a more senior post in the Home Office on January 25. In a farewell note that month he confirmed that the bulk of the extra staff had not been recruited. He said the criminal casework team had seen "some increase in casework staffing but have, however, been promised a far greater increase in the spring of 2006 which is good news for our staff and you!"Though prisoner releases were still going on without being considered for deportation, Mr Kittle told colleagues: "I think we would all agree that IND and the Prison Service stand in a far better position now than has ever been the case in the past to work closely together."A Home Office spokeswoman last night said the department would not discuss personnel issues within the immigration service but added that "standard assessment procedures for promotion are in place across IND".The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said last night: "Promoting people who were at the heart of this mess suggests the Home Office is in a state of denial from top to toe."Yesterday Mr Blair again defended Mr Clarke and his two other embattled ministers, Patricia Hewitt and John Prescott. He said that all three should keep their jobs despite the ongoing furore over reforms of the health service, and questions being raised over the behaviour of Mr Prescott, who has admitted having an affair with his diary secretary.Mr Blair admitted that Wednesday had not been a good day for his government, but he also shrugged off speculation about his own future.Today could be another testing one for the home secretary and Downing Street. A statement has been promised on the progress that has been made tracking down hundreds of foreign prisoners, and whether any of the worst offenders have committed crimes since they were released. Police forces and probation boards were yesterday sent details of the rapists, murderers and sex offenders who were released into the community instead of being considered for deportation. As the hunt for the most serious offenders among the 916 whose whereabouts is unknown grew increasingly frantic yesterday, it emerged that 170 officers were involved in checking names against the police national computer, looking up the electoral roll and chasing down any last known addresses.The Home Office would not comment on whether it knew the names of the most serious offenders - the three murderers and nine rapists who are missing. Mr Clarke is due to give MPs an update today on what has happened to the most serious offenders. The Home Office says it cannot say at present whether any of the missing offenders had been found to have committed further serious offences. But probation experts predicted that with a reoffending rate for prisoners of more than 50% it was likely a proportion of those released by mistake between 1999 and 2005 had committed further crimes.Senior officers within the Association of Chief Police Officers said the investigating team was being given more names by the Home Office yesterday and had now received the bulk of the 916 missing prisoners.Acpo said that police forces affected had been sent details of the names of offenders who might be in their area.The murderers on the list should have been under licence and as such should be easy to find, but there were no details given yesterday by Home Office officials.
