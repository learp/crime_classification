One of Scotland Yard's 12 most wanted men was arrested yesterday in Malaga, Spain. Clifford Hobbs, 47, who faces charges over a Â£1.25m Securicor van robbery, had been on the run for four years.He escaped from a prison vehicle, also a Securicor van, outside Inner London crown court on June 10 2003, in an ambush during which one guard was shot. Hobbs and another prisoner, Noel Cunningham, 45, were being transported to court from Brixton prison when two gunmen, one disguised as a postman, approached the van. One shot the driver through his door, injuring his knee. The second guard, in the back of the van, was pistol-whipped.Hobbs, Cunningham and a third prisoner fled with the gunmen. The third man, wanted for robbery, later gave himself up to police. The escape prompted inquiries into the Prison Service and Securicor.Hobbs and Cunningham were described as "very dangerous" and their pictures posted on Scotland Yard's most wanted website.
