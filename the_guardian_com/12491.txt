The thieves went in and the animals went out two by two. A taxidermy warehouse in London has been raided by burglars who stole £100,000 worth of stuffed animals including lions, a sloth and a chimp in a top hat.The lifeless menagerie was taken from the property in Wandsworth, south-west London, on 1 March between 7.20pm and 7.41pm, Scotland Yard detectives said.The antique haul also includes a giraffe and zebra. The thieves arrived in a Luton van with a grey cab and white body and used angle grinders to force their way into the premises, police added. DC Edward Bird said: “This was not a random crime, the burglars had come prepared and well equipped. This was a criminal enterprise and these thieves need to be stopped before they commit further crimes.“The items they stole are of high value and are very distinctive. I am appealing for anyone with information to contact police. In particular, I would ask anyone who deals in such animals to be on the lookout and contact police immediately if you are offered any of the stolen items.”The Metropolitan police have asked anyone with information to call them on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 anonymously.
