A teenager stabbed to death near the site of a planned Olympics party may have found himself in the middle of a turf war, it emerged yesterday. Charles Junior Hendricks, 18, became the 24th teenager to be murdered in the capital this year when he was attacked near a bus garage in Walthamstow, east London, early on Sunday. He was taken to Whipps Cross hospital, where he was pronounced dead.Organisers of the London Olympics had intended to show the closing ceremony of the Beijing games on a giant screen near the scene, but police cordoned off the area following the stabbing. Yesterday, his friends said CJ, as he was known, was not a gang member but the victim of rivalry between two groups.One woman, visiting the spot where he was killed, said: "It's called gang war. He wasn't in a gang himself, but he got caught up in something that was going on, he was in between something."Another friend, Tiffeny Alexander, 20, an admin worker, said: "He never started any trouble. He wasn't a follower, he was a leader, and he always tried to tell everyone the right things to do. He had just passed his college exams. Out of everyone I know he was doing well with his life."What has happened was completely unpredictable, because he doesn't cause trouble and obviously the trouble has come to him. He had loads of friends and he was really popular."Police arrested two youths aged 17 and 19 in connection with the attack, but the latter was yesterday released on bail. The Metropolitan police said detectives were waiting for the results of a postmortem examination and were keeping an open mind about why Hendricks was killed.
