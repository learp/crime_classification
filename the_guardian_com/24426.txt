A man police wanted to question in connection with the knife attack on Abigail Witchalls in Little Bookham, Surrey, has died in hospital after taking a suspected overdose, police said last night.Richard Cazaly, 23, is believed to have taken a large amount of painkillers between April 25 and 28, a spokesman for Surrey police said. He drove to Scotland a few days after the attack on Mrs Witchalls, 26, who was pushing her two-year-old son Joseph in a buggy on April 20. On April 28, he was admitted to Raigmore hospital in Inverness and later transferred to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where he died on April 30. The police spokesman said that Mr Cazaly had been living at an address in Little Bookham on the day of the attack and that he had been working at a local garden centre. He said Mr Cazaly was being treated as a suspect, but this was only one of a number of active lines of inquiry. Detective Chief Superintendent Adrian Harper, who is leading the inquiry, said: "This is a large and complex inquiry which continues to take huge leaps forward. "The case presents very complex forensic issues which are being progressed as quickly as possible, but which will nevertheless take some weeks to resolve, even using the latest and most advanced techniques."
