A man found dead in woodland after injuring three women in a shooting at a hair salon was targeting his estranged wife, police said.Darren Williams, of Cwmbran, south Wales, walked into the Carol-Ann salon in Newport on Friday afternoon with a shotgun and unloaded two shots from its double barrel.He then went on the run and a five-hour search was launched by Gwent police using armed response officers and helicopter teams. Williams, 45, was found dead later in the afternoon in Brynglas woods – a mile from the salon on Malpas Road.His wife worked at the salon and was shot in the leg. Two clients were injured from the shotgun being fired in such a confined space, officers said.Police described his wife's condition as stable but said she remains at the Royal Gwent hospital. The two other injured women have been released.Following a police appeal for information about a grey Mini Cooper, a member of the public reported seeing the vehicle at the side of a canal close to the scene of the shooting.After a search by officers, Williams's body was found about a mile away near the M4. Police said they were not treating his death as suspicious or looking for anyone in connection with it.Speaking outside the Carol-Ann salon, Superintendent Dave Johnson, said Williams was estranged from his wife, which he had been finding "difficult", and had come to the salon to confront her about their separation.Williams, who was known to police, did not own a shotgun licence but was described as someone who enjoyed hunting and the "outdoor life".Johnson said the investigation was now focusing on "slow-time inquiries" about "understanding the sequence of events, how he came to possess the weapon that he did and actually what exactly took place" on Friday afternoon. Asked if Williams had been the subject of a restraining order, Johnson said: "I'm not able to comment on that at the moment as it's all part of the inquiries we are seeking to undertake.""Obviously understand in terms of the victim's injuries and her treatment in hospital, some of those are slow-time inquiries and officers are actually working on that as a line of inquiry as we speak," he added.He said police believe Williams's intended target was his estranged wife, and that they were "quite comfortable that no one else in the shop was actually being focused on by Williams".Johnson, who described the use of a firearm in Newport as a "rare incident", said: "We have a greatly increased police presence in Newport at the moment."He added: "Please be assured that we are devoting substantial resources to both the investigation and to working with the community here."Police are looking at CCTV images to piece together events leading up to the shooting and are keen to talk to anyone with information about the shotgun used in the incident.Local councillor Paul Cockeram said: "It's sad something like that has happened in my area … but obviously these domestic incidents can happen anywhere."
