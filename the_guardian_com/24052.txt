Members of the National Appropriate Adult Network watched with interest ITV's drama Appropriate Adult (Fred West's final crime, 10 September), which highlighted the need for people supporting mentally vulnerable detainees to receive proper support and training themselves. Over the past eight years the NAAN has developed standards and training for appropriate adults to help volunteers and paid workers fulfil this complex and demanding role.Over 100 member organisations use trained appropriate adults who are working towards our national standards – standards that have been endorsed by the Home Office and the Department of Health. However, anyone can be asked to take on this role and no statutory body is responsible for ensuring the provision of this vital service for vulnerable adults – those with learning difficulties or mental health problems. NAAN believes local authorities should be given that responsibility and that all appropriate adult services should be expected to train and support their staff and volunteers. This would better protect vulnerable people caught up in the criminal justice system and be in the best interests of justice, as the police could investigate cases with much less danger of the process being undermined. It would also contribute to the government's much publicised commitment to reducing the number of vulnerable people ending up unnecessarily – and expensively – in prison. NAAN works to improve the service offered to children and other vulnerable people detained in police custody and welcomes the greater public awareness the film will give to the vital appropriate adult role.Elisabeth PritchardChief executive, National Appropriate Adult Network
