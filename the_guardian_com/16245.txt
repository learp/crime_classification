A schoolboy given a life sentence for raping a teacher at his London school today failed in a high court bid to keep his identity secret. Sixteen-year-old Dwayne Best - now named for the first time - was told at the Old Bailey that he had left the 28-year-old teacher mentally and physically scarred after subjecting her to a degrading ordeal. Lawyers for Best, who was 15 at the time of the attack, told two senior judges that naming him would put his life at risk, cause "very considerable risk" to his rehabilitation and significantly affect his wider family. But Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Walker, rejected the plea for secrecy.Best appeared before Judge Moss QC for sentence on July 4 and was sentenced to detention for life, with a notional term of nine years, of which he had to serve half before he would become eligible for release on parole. At the same hearing, the judge said an order made under section 39 of the 1933 Children and Young Persons Act preventing him from being identified by the press and media should be lifted. But the naming of Best was delayed so that his lawyers could make today's last ditch bid to remain anonymous. Rejecting the application, Lord Justice Kennedy said he was entirely satisfied that Judge Moss's intention had not been "to name and shame" but was acting in the interests of open justiceThe teacher, who remains anonymous, said she hoped that naming Best would help him accept responsibility for his actions. "The end of the legal process gives me the opportunity to put the whole thing behind me and start to put my life back together," she said. "Naming him may help him to accept responsibility for what he has done and recognise the gravity of his actions." The teacher was not thought to have pressed for Best's name to be made public and had no strong feelings in favour or against lifting anonymity.
