Two men have been arrested in Barbados following the shooting of a British couple on a cruise who were robbed during a stopover on the island.Ann Prior, 59, and her 72-year-old husband Philip, who are from Suffolk, were shot on Sunday during a port call to the island as part of an 85-day world trip with P&O Cruises. Police said that two suspects were being interviewed but had not been charged in connection with the incident.Mr Prior was hit on his left side and his wife, whose handbag was stolen in the attack in the capital, Bridgetown, was shot in her right thigh. She was released on Monday and her husband was expected to be discharged last night.Inspector David Welch of Royal Barbados police said: "Mr Prior is resting and is comfortable. He is in good spirits. We have two suspects in custody."The couple, believed to be from Woodbridge, Suffolk, were on a three-month cruise around the Caribbean and South America on board the Adonia, which left Southampton in January and is due to arrive back in the UK on April 3. Pictures have emerged showing fellow tourists and passersby rushing to give first aid to the couple before they were taken to the Queen Elizabeth hospital.A P&O spokesman said: "Our shoreside customer care team and ship's medical team are providing support." The Foreign Office is providing consular assistance.The shooting was raised in the Barbadian parliament on Monday when opposition leader Mia Mottely  expressed concern about increasing acts of violence against visitors, describing such attacks as "acts of economic terrorism".
