A teacher who was spared jail after beating a 14-year-old pupil with a dumbbell warned today that "lots of teachers are ticking time bombs" because of stress in schools.Science teacher Peter Harvey attacked the boy at All Saints Roman Catholic school in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, after repeatedly being taunted by pupils in his class.Last month, jurors at Nottingham crown court took an hour to clear the 50-year-old of attempted murder or intending to cause serious injury. Yesterday, he was given a two-year community order for causing grievous bodily harm without intent.In an interview with the Mirror, Harvey said: "I love kids and I'm the last person who would ever want to harm a child. I didn't make a decision to hurt the boy – it just happened."If it could happen to me, it could happen to anyone. There are lots of teachers who are ticking time bombs. I know teachers who, because of stress, can't hold a cup of coffee or are too frightened to cross the road."It could happen again, and probably will if something isn't done."Harvey also offered an apology to the boy, who was left with a fractured skull and partial loss of hearing after the attack, which happened last July."I hope he is able to forgive me or he will never move on with his life. I'd just like to say I was so sorry," he said.The married father of two hit the boy with a 3kg (6.6lb) dumbbell while shouting: "Die, die, die."But the jury accepted his barrister's claims that his pupils had driven him over the edge and he did not know what he was doing when the youngster – now 15 and a known troublemaker – told him to "fuck off".During the four-day trial, it emerged that pupils at the school were trying to goad the science teacher so his reaction could be caught on a camcorder being used secretly by a girl in the class.The footage was then intended to be passed around the school as a way of "humiliating" Harvey, and the incident happened only weeks after he had returned from a four month lay-off for stress.He said his memory of the attack was "surreal", adding: "[It's] a memory without any emotion or feeling or thought in my head."Passing sentence yesterday, Judge Michael Stokes QC said: "On any view, this is a tragic case."You are a thoroughly decent man, and for well over 20 years you have been a dedicated and successful schoolteacher."The incident involving the 14-year-old boy whom you assaulted was brought about, I have no doubt, by a number of factors combining together and producing in you a quite disproportionate reaction to misbehaviour, abuse and rank disobedience by him and some of his classmates."In previous years, you would have handled this easily and professionally, but in July of last year you were far from well."You were undoubtedly suffering from depression, stress and a serious lack of confidence."Harvey, who now faces a disciplinary hearing, will not be allowed to work with children again.
