The millionaire brother of former footballer Gary Lineker was today jailed for two and a half years for a £220,000 tax fraud.For 18 months, the sports bar owner Wayne Lineker systematically smuggled cash into Britain using a "tried and tested" money mule system of unsuspecting family and friends.Once here, bundles of pesetas and escudos from pubs in Spain, Portugal and the Canary Islands were laundered into sterling, London's Southwark crown court heard.Initially the cash was "thoroughly cleaned up" at bureaux de change. Later, the City stockbroker John Stacey was brought in to secure a better exchange rate.Recruited to the conspiracy with a series of four-figure sweeteners and a holiday in Portugal, Stacey siphoned it through several NatWest bank accounts before handing it back to Lineker, the hearing was told.Lineker, whose brother captained England during a glittering international career and currently presents Match of the Day, admitted one count of conspiracy to defraud the Inland Revenue between January 1 1999 and December 31 2001.The 43-year-old businessman, who owns a £2m mansion in Fyfield, Essex, owns eight pubs and has franchises on three others, stood with his hands clasped in front of him as Judge Stephen Robbins told him: "You, through your counsel, accept prime responsibility for initiating this conspiracy which was sustained over a period of about 18 months ... and led to a loss of £90,000 tax including interest".The judge said the court of appeal had made it clear that defrauding the Inland Revenue was a "serious offence because it means defrauding the vast majority of honest taxpayers".As a result, he would not only be jailed for two and a half years, but would face a further 24 months in prison if he failed to pay a £90,000 confiscation order.Lineker's manager, David Hodges, 43, of Waltham Abbey, Essex, also pleaded guilty to the same charge.Stacey, 56, a former administrative manager at NatWest stockbrokers, from Southend, Essex, was convicted of the offence after a two-week trial earlier this year. The court had heard that by keeping the cash secret, the men left the Inland Revenue £90,000 worse off.
