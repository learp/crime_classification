Police in the West Country are hunting a wandering thief who has been living in style at the expense of pub landlords throughout England and Wales.The man is believed to have a considerable thirst, knocking up a bill of £120 during a night spent in one bar, and has left a trail of swindles extending from Cumbria to Devon. The cost of his unpaid bills is likely to have reached tens of thousands of pounds. Detectives in the Avon and Somerset force say the peripatetic fraudster steals chequebooks, cash and jewellery from the landlords, then moves on to a new place. As well as cash and goods, he also steals the identity of his victims, using their names to pay for food and accommodation. He spent £10,000 with the help of just one chequebook. "This man has been stealing from people all over the country," said Detective Sergeant Dave Trotter of Avon and Somerset constabulary's serious crime group. "Once he gets the confidence of the landlord, he steals if the opportunity arises, taking chequebooks, cash and jewellery. He then moves on to the next pub or inn and continue his trail of crime." Police say the man has visited Somerset, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, Dyfed Powys, Devon, Cheshire, Manchester, Norfolk, North Yorkshire, Gloucestershire, Gwent, Hampshire, Kent, Humberside, and Cumbria. Detectives believe he has also hit other parts of the country. "The offending runs into hundreds of crimes," added Det Sgt Trotter. "Many publicans have fallen victim to him, though his unpaid bills, giving him cash back and unpaid services. "One chequebook alone has resulted in fraudulent use to the value of £10,000, and at one pub he ran up a bar bill of £120 in just one night." The man is described as white, 1.85 metres tall (6ft 1in) and of proportionate build, and speaks with a strong Yorkshire accent. He is normally clean-shaven, and has receding, thinning hair, which he is known to dye.
