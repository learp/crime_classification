5.43pm BST17:43Afternoon summaryMichael Fallon, the defence secretary, has announced that two Tornados have attacked Islamic State targets in northern Iraq. They bombed an armed pick-up truck and a heavy weapons position.The Lib Dems have accused Theresa May of peddling “misinformation” when she claimed that their opposition to the so-called “snooper’s charter” was putting lives at risk. (See 3.35pm.)The NASUWT teaching union has welcomed Nicky Morgan’s speech to the Tory conference. Chris Keates, the union’s general secretary, said: Schools will welcome that Nicky Morgan has established herself as the secretary of state for all schools, not just academies and free schools. Teachers will welcome the recognition that their professional lives are blighted by excessive workload. They will welcome the secretary of state’s commitment to address this. But tackling workload effectively will require the secretary of state to recognise the contribution of this government’s policies to the current excessive workload burdens.George Osborne, the chancellor, has played down suggestions he is obsessed with becoming prime minister. At a fringe meeting at the conference, he said it was a mistake for politicians to become too focused on ambition. I try and live the life I’m leading now. I don’t always think about what’s going to happen in the future.I think people who, particularly in politics, are always waiting for the next job and angling for the next job, have a pretty miserable time - personally are miserable - don’t enjoy politics, don’t enjoy their careers in politics.I am determined not to be that person. There are quite a lot of unhappy people in politics, disappointed people, people who through no fault of their own sometimes have been passed over.Osborne has said he does not respect Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader. Asked if he admired him, Osborne replied. The short answer is no, because I don’t think he is being serious about the challenges the country faces.Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has said that all patients will have a named GP on their medical record under the new GP contract for 2015.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments (those of you who are left!)Updatedat 5.45pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.36pm BST17:36Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has announced that two Tornados have attacked Islamic State targets in northern Iraq.

But it’s quite a long item.Anthony Seldon, who has written biographies of John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, gives his first, lengthy assessment of David Cameron’s premiership. Cameron’s standing in the eyes of his contemporaries will depend greatly on whether he wins an outright majority in 2015, especially after his failure to do so in 2010. The judgment of history upon the years 2010–2015 will be far less dependent upon the result of the 2015 election. Indeed, Cameron’s place in history is already secure: by holding together the coalition for five years, significantly improving the economic outlook from a desperately weak starting point, overseeing some steady if still unproven domestic reforms, and possibly winning the Scottish referendum, Cameron has ensured that he will be seen as a prime minister of enduring importance. In particular, Cameron accomplished two profound achievements as prime minister: sticking to ‘plan A’ on the economy, and sticking with the coalition. The ‘big, open and comprehensive offer’ to the Lib Dems was very much his own initiative. For better or worse – and I think better – the coalition was his, and history will judge him for it.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.00pm BST17:00Conservative conference policy announcements - A round-upFor the record, here are the conference-related Conservative party policy announcements we’ve had so far.

Over-75s already get a named doctor on their medical record, he said.He confirmed that patients in England would be able to see their medical record online from April next year. He criticised Labour for trying to politicise the health service. It’s not a Labour Health Service or a Conservative Health Service ... it is a National Health Service.When people in this hall volunteer to support the local league of friends or join the board of a hospital we’re not Conservative supporters - we’re NHS supporters. We all support the NHS because the NHS is there for us all. So don’t turn the National Health Service into a National Political Football and don’t use the NHS to divide us when it’s the fabric that unites our nation.He said that Labour was “unfit to run out NHS” because it had not learnt the lessons from the Mid Staffs hospital scandal.He accused Labour of scaremongering about privatisation in the NHS. If we increase spending on the NHS we must also look every one of them in the eye and promise that every penny is being spent wisely.Which means we mustn’t stop new ideas that come from outside the NHS – whether from charities or, yes, the independent sector.Labour call this privatisation.But using a charity like WhizzKids to supply wheelchairs to disabled children or using Specsavers to speed up the supply of glasses is not privatisation.When the last Labour government used the independent sector to bring down waiting times that wasn’t privatisation either.So stop scaremongering about privatisation that isn’t happening.He claimed this scaremongering about privatisation “nearly cost us Scotland”.He said the government had plans to train an extra 5,000 GPs.He said the next Conservative government would have “no greater priority than to protect, support and invest in our NHS”.

Morgan immediately adopted a more emollient tone and the key message of her speech to the conference this afternoon was that the government wants to restore good relations with teachers. She could not have been more positive.Here are the main points.Morgan said she wanted to reduce the burden on teachers. Teachers who have to stay up late marking homework will be “too tired, too stressed and too anxious to do the job well”, she said. She said she would be talking to unions and teachers about finding solutions. (For a Conservative minister to talk positively about talking to unions in a conference speech is almost unheard of.)She paid a lavish tribute to teachers. She said thank you: to the teachers, teaching assistants and support staff, who rise early every day, go to work, and turn our plans into action.  If our school story has a hero, it is them.The teacher you see every day at the school gate - there when the children are dropped off, and again when they’re picked up.The teacher that works late into the night, and then does it all again the following day. As a parent – and through my own family – I know how dedicated and inspiring teachers can be. But in this job, I am reminded of it every day. She said she wanted to do more to tackle homophobic bullying in schools. She announced the approval of 35 new free schools.She said she wanted to show “every school that we are on their side”, not just free schools and academieShe criticised Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, as “a part-time politician and full-time celebrity historian”.

(See 1.28pm.) This is from a party spokesman.We utterly reject the allegation that the blocking of the communications data bill has put lives at risk. Police already have the ability to obtain data in urgent cases where lives are in danger.The real problem is the availability of IP address data, where we have always accepted there is a need for action, and indeed publicly committed to legislation last year.Frankly, it is woeful inaction on the part of the Home Office that solutions have not been identified to deal with this issue.If failure to act on the IP matching problem has put lives at risk, the home secretary must explain why her department has not acted.Theresa May is peddling misinformation in a vain attempt to get the so-called ‘snooper’s charter’ back on the table.Liberal Democrats will continue to oppose the Tories’ obsessive intrusion into people’s lives.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.32pm BST14:32Lunchtime summaryTwo prominent Conservative MPs have criticised Theresa May’s proposed plan to ban extremists from speaking in public. After May used a well-received conference speech to confirm the party’s commitment to extremism disruption orders, to attack the Lib Dems for not backing the communications data bill and and to make a wide-ranging case for confronting extremism generally (see 1.28pm), Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, said the extremism disruption orders could be counter-productive. If one introduces measures which may be perceived as draconican, restricting other people’s liberties, then this can have the unintended consquences of not actually tackling, correctly, the problem of which is arising, but simply fuel resentment. It’s a very delicate balancing act, these two concepts that we have to pay attention to. On the World at One Grieve said there might be a case for banning orders directed against organisations. But he said the government should be “much more careful” about placing restrictions on individuals. There was already a law criminalising incitement to hatred, he said. It is difficult to see how in practice some of these restrictions would operate without leading to the consequence of that a person would end up being prosecuted for expressing a point of view which the home secretary has considered is extreme ...In so far as the behaviour may be less serious than the commission of a criminal offence, then of course we have to carefully consider, in a free society, whether we are entitled to stop people from expressing views that we find repellant ... But any restriction on freedom of expression of individuals outside the criminal law is something that has to be approached with very great caution.David Davis has also attacked May’s plans at a fringe meeting.Jonathan Freedland (@Freedland)David Davis slams Theresa May terror proposals at Tory fringe. Says "they define me and define you as a terrorist"September 30, 2014Boris Johnson has said that the Conservatives do not need to be too worried about Ukip. Speaking on the World at One, when it was put to him that people in the party were “very worried” about the threat posed by Nigel Farage’s party, Johnson said:  I’m not as worried as all that. The great secret in life is, when you’re facing an opponent who tries to take the wind out of your sails, the secret is to talk about what you’re going to do, not talk about them the whole time. The Conservatives want to deliver a better deal in Europe and we’re the only people who is offering that and are the only people in Europe who can deliver that.Earlier, in his speech to the conference, Johnson told the party they could win the general election. I genuinely think that this is a fantastic time to be a Conservative and that just in the last few months we have seen the beginning of the end of the tapioca-like consensus that Ed Miliband could somehow osmotically infiltrate or inveigle himself into power by pandering to his core vote and relying on the gross unfairness of the electoral system. The light is dawning, scales falling. Across the country the chattering classes are waking up to the reality that victory is within our grasp in the next eight months.  Boris Johnson addressing the Tory conference Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty ImagesDavid Cameron has defended his plan to carry out billions of pounds of extra cuts to benefits for the working poor, saying it is only fair to ensure welfare payments are not rising faster than earnings.Sir Alan Moses, chair of the new press regulator, Ipso, has said the Sunday Mirror’s Brooks Newmark sex sting is a “matter of urgent public concern” and indicated it would look to speed up the resolution process following a formal complaint.Cameron has said the EU is not a matter of the heart for him, suggesting he would not be too emotional about whether Britain stays or goes in a referendum.Richard Barnes, a former Conservative deputy mayor of London, has joined Ukip.Tories have been told that people who walk past sex advertisements in phone boxes are missing evidence of modern slavery. As the Press Association reports, Mike Emberson told the conference one of the biggest mistakes to make was to assume slavery was a hidden crime, telling delegates at the Conservative Party conference: “If it’s hidden, it’s hidden in plain sight.” Asked what he would say to people who cannot believe slavery thrives in Britain, the project director of the Medaille Trust - a charity which seeks to help women, men and children freed from human trafficking - told delegates in Birmingham: “Open your eyes. It’s been very well covered in the press now, there’s lots of government information out there and we’ve got a lot better at recognising and reporting on it.” Cameron has told Scottish Tory activists that the no campaign’s victory in the independence referendum has created a huge opportunity to win back seats at the general election.Updatedat 3.13pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.55pm BST13:55Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has said that Labour will look at the detail of Theresa May’s plans for new banning orders and extremism disruption orders before deciding whether to back them. But she criticised the government’s record on counter-terrorism generally. David Cameron and Theresa May have weakened counter-terror measures, so more action is needed to deal with extremists and terror threats and to prevent young people being drawn into barbarism.But why won’t they bring back tried and tested measures to stop terrorists and serious extremists - including relocation powers or control orders which experts believe would be far more effective than the TPIMs [terrorism prevention and investigation measures] Theresa May introduced?And if the Home Secretary is serious about preventing extremism, why isn’t she restoring the community Prevent programme that helped communities themselves prevent radicalisation? They were wrong to scrap this and it should be restored.Ministers have made promises about extremism ASBOs before. We will need to look at the detail behind today’s rhetoric as too often ministers have made announcements on tackling terrorism and extremism without any clues how they would work - for example David Cameron’s press conference last month about holding British citizens in foreign airports.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose1.28pm BST13:28Theresa May's speech - SummaryImmigration and the police are two of Theresa May’s key responsibilities as home secretary. But, unusually for a Conservative conference speech, she covered both these topics in just a single paragraph. Instead she focused almost entirely on extremism, after starting her speech with a sobering passage asking her Tory, mostly white and middle-aged audience to imagine what young black men feel about stop and search.The full text is here. And here are the main points.May warned there was a risk of Islamic State (Isis) acquiring nuclear weapons if it is not defeated. Britain could not ignore the threat it posed, she said. If [Isis] succeed in firmly consolidating their grip on the land they occupy in Syria and Iraq, we will see the world’s first truly terrorist state established within a few hours flying time of our country. We will see terrorists given the space to plot attacks against us, train their men and women, and devise new methods to kill indiscriminately. We will see the risk, often prophesied but thank God not yet fulfilled, that with the capability of a state behind them, the terrorists will acquire chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons to attack us. This is not somebody else’s battle. They have made clear their ambitions. And they have made us their enemies. And the lesson of history tells us that when our enemies say they want to attack us, they mean it. We must not flinch. We must not shy away from our responsibility. We must not drift towards danger and insecurity. While we still have the chance, we must act to destroy [Isis].She confirmed plans to introduce new banning orders and extremism disruption orders to tackle extremism.She said it was right to challenge extremism, not just violent extremism.To live in a modern liberal state is not to live in a moral vacuum. We have to stand up for our values as a nation. There will, I know, be some who say that what I describe as extremism is merely social conservatism. But if others described a woman’s intellect as “deficient”, denounced people on the basis of their religious beliefs, or rejected the democratic process, we would quite rightly condemn their bigotry. And there will be others who say I am wrong to link these kinds of beliefs with the violent extremism we agree we must confront. To them I say, yes, not all extremism leads to violence. And not all extremists are violent. But the damage extremists cause to our society is reason enough to act. And there is, undoubtedly, a thread that binds the kind of extremism that promotes intolerance, hatred and a sense of superiority over others to the actions of those who want to impose their values on us through violence.(Earlier this year May was seen as being in the “beating back the crocodiles” camp on extremism, as opposed to those, like Michael Gove, who favoured “draining the swamp” instead. The metaphor comes from Gove. Now it sounds like May has joined the crocodile beaters.)She invited members of the audience to imagine what it felt like to be a black Briton subject to repeated stop and search by the police. It’s difficult for most of us here in this hall to really appreciate the effects of stop and search. You see, most of us are white. Most of us are of a certain age. Well, we’re certainly not teenagers anymore. But imagine walking home, or driving to work one day, and being stopped by the police. Imagine, having done nothing wrong, you are patted down, you have your pockets turned inside out, and your possessions examined. Imagine you ask why you’re being searched and you’re told it’s “just routine” even though the police need “reasonable grounds for suspicion” that you’ve broken the law. Imagine growing up and the indignity of this happening to you twenty, thirty, forty, even fifty or sixty times. And imagine what it’s like to feel, deep down, that this is only happening because you’re young, male and black.She said more than 250,000 stop and searches carried out by the police were probably illegal, because there were not sufficient grounds to justify them.She criticised Labour’s record on stop and search. Under Labour - you remember them, the party of equality - stop and search powers were extended and extended. Under the Conservatives, they’ve been cut back. Under Labour, oversight rules and safeguards were downgraded and discarded. Under the Conservatives, they’ve been strengthened. And the result is less and better-targeted stop and search.She said that she had already acted to reduce the police use of stop and search and that, if stop and search did not become more targeted, she would legislate to make this happen.She claimed that Liberal Democrat opposition to the proposed communications data bill was putting lives at risk. Over a six-month period, the National Crime Agency estimates that it had to drop at least twenty cases as a result of missing communications data. Thirteen of these were threat-to-life cases, in which a child was judged to be at risk of imminent harm. In a three-month period, the Metropolitan Police had to drop twelve cases because communications data was not available. These cases included sexual offences and potential threat-to-life scenarios relating to a suicide threat and a kidnap.The solution to this crisis of national security was the communications data bill. But two years ago, it was torpedoed by the Liberal Democrats. I’m told that the Lib Dems now tell the newspapers that “they might have to give ground on surveillance powers in a future coalition agreement”. But they also say that they have “no intention of allowing changes before the general election”. This is outrageously irresponsible, because innocent people are in danger right now. If we do not act, we risk sleepwalking into a society in which crime can no longer be investigated and terrorists can plot their murderous schemes undisrupted. The Conservatives would bring in the bill if they won the election, she said.She praised Islam as a religion of peace. This hateful ideology has nothing to do with Islam itself. And it is rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain and around the world. The Quran says: “O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other.” It says: “let there be no compulsion in religion.” So let the message go out from this hall that the extremists will never succeed in dividing us. Let the message go out that we know Islam is a religion of peace and it has nothing to do with the ideology of our enemies. Let us stand side by side with the British Muslims who are coming together and saying “not in my name”.
