A man who smashed his way into a furniture store during last summer's riots shouted "let's burn the place" before starting a blaze that destroyed the building and put residents and firefighters' lives "in very real danger", a court has heard.Gordon Thompson, 33, was a leading figure in the rioting in Croydon on 8 August and had grabbed a laptop from the House of Reeves furniture store before asking another rioter for a lighter. The court heard he then set fire to a sofa.The ensuing blaze was so fierce it spread to properties on the opposite side of the road, sending residents fleeing for their lives. The court heard how a photograph of a young woman who escaped the flames by jumping from a first-floor window of a nearby flat became one of the defining images of the disturbances.A jury at the Old Bailey heard on Wednesday that Thompson grabbed a laptop from the store before asking another rioter for a lighter. He then set fire to a sofa.Oliver Glasgow, prosecuting, said: "Having vandalised and looted the store, the defendant was still not satisfied. In an act of cynical cowardice he went back inside the shop and set fire to one of the sofas that was stood inside the window."The effect, as anyone would realise and as he plainly intended, was catastrophic. The sofa went up in flames, as did other pieces of furniture in the showroom and within minutes the inferno was raging out of control."The heat was so intense that tram lines in the road caught fire and the building – one of the oldest in Croydon – was reduced to a "smouldering pile of rubble", the court heard.The jury was shown images of Monika Konczyk, who was forced to escape from her first-floor flat as the fire spread to nearby buildings."She realised the building she lived in was on fire and she had become trapped inside," said Glasgow. "Eventually, she had no option but to climb out of the window and to climb down on to the parasol of the shop that was below her, and once there jump into the arms of police officers and members of the public who were stood beneath her."Konczyk and another eyewitness, Craig Street, had filmed the moment the store was set alight and Glasgow said the footage would be played to the jury."She saw a man run into the shop and place something square on a piece of furniture, which he then lit," said Glasgow.Street also filmed the moment the fire started and alleged that he heard Thompson saying "let's burn the place" or "let's torch the place" and asking "Who's got a lighter?"The jury was told that Thompson had been part of a mob that had run riot through Croydon on the afternoon of 8 August.Before he targeted the Reeves Corner store, said Glasgow, Thompson had been part of a group of rioters that targeted the Iceland supermarket in nearby Surrey Street and the House of Fraser store in the Centrale shopping centre.The painter and decorator was caught on camera clutching bottles of alcohol he had stolen from the supermarket. He then helped others prise open the security shutters at the department store, enabling would-be burglars to make their way inside, the jury was told.Glasgow said: "Once out of sight of the cameras he, like the others who had broken in, ran amok and left with armfuls of goods he had stolen for himself. After leaving the store he stood at the top of the stairs pointing out the direction of the broken entrance and encouraging others to loot the store."The jury was also told that Thompson was seen pouring petrol into the street before attempting to set light to it on the afternoon of the riot.A bus driver, Flint Agyekum, who was working on the 157 service, watched in horror as he tried to allow passengers to disembark and move his vehicle away from the disorder, jurors were told.A short time later, Glasgow said, Thompson was at the forefront of a group of rioters who attacked House of Reeves furniture store."He claims he only placed his foot just inside the broken window and that he was acting as a law-abiding citizen, trying to stop the looting and determined to bring the shocking behaviour of others to a close," Glasgow told jurors. "Whether there is any truth whatsoever in his claims will be for you to judge."The court heard that Britain had seen unrest on an "unprecedented scale" last summer. Glasgow added: "Men and women, apparently of all ages and backgrounds, descended on the streets determined to steal what they could and set upon causing as much damage as they were able. The defendant is one of those rioters."Thompson, of Croydon, has already admitted looting the Iceland and House of Fraser stores, jurors were told.He denies violent disorder and burglary at House of Reeves, as well as charges of arson with intent to endanger life and arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered.House of Reeves was founded in Croydon in 1867 and survived two world wars before it was reduced to ashes. The street on which it stood was named after the family business.The trial continues.
