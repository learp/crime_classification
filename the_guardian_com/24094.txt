What should you do if you go back to your illegally parked car and spot a traffic warden scribbling ominously? The answer seems to be jump right in and floor the accelerator, for yesterday a high court judge ruled that Transport for London could not later collect a fine from a motorist who had driven off before the warden could slap a ticket on his windscreen.The landmark judgment applies only to London at present, but the ruling, by Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, could affect millions of motorists in the UK when planned legislation to extend the system of penalty notices by post nationwide becomes law.Simeon Ademolake, a fashion designer and ward councillor in Newham for the Christian People's Alliance, got the Â£50 penalty fine notice after stopping on double red lines in Commercial Road, east London, in June 2005. He disputed the notice, sent through the post, and won his case at the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service after explaining that he told the warden "I'm driving away now" and no ticket was ever given to him or placed on his windscreen.Transport for London, whose appeal in the case was turned down with the adjudicator agreeing with the original finding, took the case to the high court, where Mr Justice Calvert-Smith ruled that the two earlier decisions were correct.The London Local Authorities Act 2000 states that if a warden tries to issue a ticket but is prevented by anyone from doing so, the authority may send a fixed penalty notice by post to the vehicle's owner.The judge ruled that jotting down details about the car and driver, as the warden had done, did not amount to an "attempt" to issue a parking ticket.Mr Ademolake, 43, from Newham, east London, said yesterday that he had stopped for five minutes and that only one tyre was on the double red lines. The warden told him to wait for the ticket but he did not. "The purpose is not really to clear the road," Mr Ademolake said. "It's to raise revenue. If the driver has driven off, is he still obstructing the road? No."Ian Rogers, counsel for the traffic adjudicators, told the judge at an earlier hearing that his judgment would have wide importance because a bill due to be introduced soon would allow local authorities outside London to issue fixed penalty notices by post.A TfL spokeswoman said: "Transport for London enforces the red routes where very short stoppages can cause congestion. If a driver stops, sees a warden and drives away the damage is already done."
