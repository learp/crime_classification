The government is to look again at the detailed operation of its controversial scheme to vet the 11 million adults who are in regular contact with other people's children in the face of a public outcry that it could jeopardise "perfectly safe and normal activities".The children's secretary, Ed Balls, tonight announced that he had asked the head of the new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA), which will be operating the vetting scheme, to check that the government has "drawn the line in the right place on this issue".The ISA chairman, Sir Roger Singleton, is to report by early December on whether any "adjustments" in the operation of the scheme need to be made.The introduction of the "barring and vetting" scheme for those who have "frequent or intensive" contact with children follows the official inquiry by Sir Michael Bichard into the Soham child murders in 2002. Failure to register by those, including volunteers, who are involved with children through organisations such as schools or clubs could result in a fine of up to £5,000.Ministers insist that those involved in private arrangements, such as just giving friends' children a lift to school, will be exempt.But the question of who exactly will be required to undergo the £64-a-time criminal record checks was extensively debated when the legisation underpinning the scheme went through parliament in 2006.The controversy was recently renewed when children's authors, including Philip Pullman and Anne Fine, said they would rather give up their regular school visits than comply with the "insulting requirement". Unpaid volunteers are not to be charged.Balls said tonight that the government had been careful to consult on where to draw the line between those who should be covered and those who should be exempt, with the critical point being how precisely the principle of "frequent or intensive" contact with children should be applied to real-life situations."In recent weeks some concerns have been voiced again about this specific point," Balls said. "The response we have received to our consultations suggest to me that we have got the balance about right, but it is tremendously important that we are certain this is so."Singleton, the government's chief adviser on the safety of children, would now "check the government has drawn the line in the right place on this issue", said Balls in a letter to Barry Sheerman, the chairman of the Commons children and schools committee.He emphasised that because the scheme only applied to arrangements made through third parties such as a school or a club, the personal arrangements made by parents with friends were not included: "This means that the scheme will not come into play when parents agree to give their friends' children a lift to school or to cubs. Nor will it cover instances where parents work with children at school or a youth club on an occasional or one-off basis, or when parents visit their child's school, for example, to watch the Christmas play."Balls said the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which had voiced its concerns at the weekend that the scheme jeopardised some "perfectly safe and normal activities", had now confirmed its support for the scheme.The vetting and barring scheme is due to come into effect from 12 October. Balls said applications for registration would open in July 2010 and would become mandatory for new workers in areas including schools, hospitals and youth organisations in November next year.But the Conservatives were not convinced he had gone far enough. "I'm afraid this is just not good enough," said the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling. "The reality is that the government's words on this are so vague and ill-defined that no one will know where the dividing line falls. They'll look at the level of fines and register everyone to be on the safe side. The government has to look at this whole issue again."
