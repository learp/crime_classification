A man who repeatedly stabbed his pregnant partner after pressure from his disapproving mother “tipped him over the edge” has been jailed for 18 years.Babur Raja, 41, admitted attempted murder, attempted child destruction, possession of a knife in public and the wounding and assault of two passersby after the attack in Sutton Coldfield town centre on 4 March.At his sentencing hearing at Birmingham crown court, his barrister said Raja’s conservative Muslim mother “literally drove him mad” in the run-up to the attack by forcing him to choose between her and his partner, Natalie Queiroz.Jane Humphryes QC said the family turmoil led to a temporary mental illness, or adjustment disorder, leaving him with little memory of what he had done.She said: “His mother had not been happy he was in a relationship with a white woman, and told him he must leave her or she would not be in contact.“This man of impeccable character is driven literally to distraction, forced by his own mother to choose between her and his chosen partner and their unborn baby.”The court heard that Queiroz’s breast implants probably saved her life during the frenzied assault.Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, said that if Raja had plunged his knife 2mm further into Queiroz’s abdomen, her unborn baby would have died.The child was born unharmed and was now doing well, the court was told.The judge, Simon Drew QC, told Raja: “Once you chose your mother over your partner and child, you resolved not only to terminate your relationship, but to terminate them.“This was a deliberate, premeditated attack designed to kill and destroy your partner and unborn child.”
