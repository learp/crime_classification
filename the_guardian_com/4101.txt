Home secretary Theresa May hailed an "important step forward for child protection" yesterday as Sarah's law, which allows parents to check if someone has a history of child sex offences, was rolled out to police forces across England and Wales.Some charities expressed concern that it could drive those on the sex offenders' register underground, or spark vigilante action, though police leaders gave the move cautious support.May said the programme, which followed the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne by convicted sex offender Roy Whiting 10 years ago, would also help police manage known sex offenders more effectively."The roll-out of this scheme is an important step forward for child protection in this country," she said."Being able to make these checks reassures parents and the community and more importantly keeps children safer."Not only will it help parents, carers or guardians ensure that their children are safe, but it also assists the police in managing known sex offenders living in the community more effectively."The decision to expand the programme follows the independent evaluation of a £600,000 pilot scheme in four police force areas. The pilot saw 315 formal applications from parents and carers that resulted in the disclosure of the background of 21 convicted child sex offenders. The Home Office says more than 60 children were protected from abuse in that period.The scheme has been rolled out to eight other force areas and will be implemented across England and Wales by March 2011.The evaluation by De Montfort University, Leicester, said the programme had provided the public with a formal mechanism for asking for information about individuals who have unsupervised access to children and may be convicted sex offenders.The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Sir Hugh Orde, said: "It is only part of the far wider way in which the police service keep young people safe ... It is a welcome part of that armoury, but it is only part of it."Asked whether he was concerned that the law might have unintended consequences, he said: "There are always risks. People say people will go underground – frankly, people go underground anyway.""It's good that the disclosure pilots have helped to protect children. The government needs to tread cautiously in rolling out the scheme to more forces." said Diana Sutton of the NSPCC. ""We are concerned about the risk of vigilante action and sex offenders going underground.All new local schemes need close management and proper resourcing to avoid this."The introduction of the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme follows the trial that took place in Cambridgeshire, Cleveland, Hampshire and Warwickshire.The scheme has now been rolled out to eight other force areas, and a further expansion is planned for the autumn, with Northamptonshire, Staffordshire, Sussex, Leicestershire, Wiltshire, Cheshire, Durham, Northumbria, Dorset, Lincolnshire, Surrey and Gloucestershire joining the scheme.
