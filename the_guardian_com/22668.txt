Detectives investigating the disappearance of the chef Claudia Lawrence have sealed off a pub and arrested a 46-year-old man on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.Officers have been searching The Acomb pub in York, which is thought to be one of the places she socialised in the months before she vanished in 2009, since 8am on Wednesday morning.Local people watched in the hot sun as uniformed officers guarded the perimeter of the building, which has a bookmakers business on one side and a children's play area at the rear.Other officers could be seen working inside the building and taking objects out into waiting vehicles.Some of the things brought out appeared to be doors wrapped in plastic.A North Yorkshire police spokesman said: "The man is currently being interviewed in custody while searches and forensic inquiries are conducted in relation to the investigation."The force said the investigation was "very much active" and that there was the possibility that further arrests would be made.The force reminded the media not to publish information which might compromise the inquiry or the legal rights of people involved in the proceedings.A spokesman said Lawrence's father Peter hoped the latest development was significant.Family friend Martin Dales said: "Peter remains very grateful for all the hard work that North Yorkshire police are continuing to put in to finding Claudia."It is to be hoped that this is another vital piece in the jigsaw of information that needs to come in to the police. It is much better if people volunteer information than wasting valuable police time in them having to find it out for themselves and then come looking for people."A 59-year-old York man, named locally as former lab technician Michael Snelling, was arrested in May on suspicion of Lawrence's murder. He was re-bailed last month.Lawrence worked in the kitchen at York University and was 35 when she went missing.She was last seen at around 3pm on 18 March 2009 as she made her way home from her shift. Her father reported her missing two days later.It is believed something happened to her as she left for work early on 19 March.Since the fifth anniversary of her disappearance new lines of inquiry have emerged, but her body has never been found.North Yorkshire police launched a review of the investigation last year and carried out a detailed re-examination of Lawrence's home.Detectives launched a fresh appeal for information on the BBC's Crimewatch programme on the fifth anniversary of her disappearance.New lines detectives have explored include two unknown vehicles, one of them a car seen near Lawrence's home, and the disclosure of mystery fingerprints found in her flat.Victor Overall, 68, who lives opposite the pub, said he noticed the police arrive between 7.30am and 8am today. He said: "We thought it must be something more serious than a robbery at the bookies, with all these police and the CSI and everything, but never in our wildest dreams did we think it was anything to do with Claudia Lawrence."Overall, who has lived in his house for 20 years, said the pub used to have a bad reputation but it has been "turned around" by the current landlord over the last few years. "We can't believe what's happening so close to our own home," he said. "We've lived here 20 years and there have been occasions in the past, as there are in all pubs, when things get rowdy and the police get called. So we've seen the odd police car over there but never anything like this amount."
