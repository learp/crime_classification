A misleading focus on the proportion of rape cases that result in conviction has left victims' needs neglected and stopped women coming forward, the author of a landmark government review said.The independent report by Baroness Stern was commissioned by the government last year in response to ongoing concerns over the level of rape cases resulting in convictions. But in an interview with the Guardian, Stern said that while they remained important, the conviction rate was "not the be all and end all".Stern suggested the figure of 14% – the estimated proportion of reported rapes that end in a conviction on a charge of rape or another related offence – was "not dramatically low" compared to other crimes. Of the cases that get to court, 58% result in a conviction. (As with the 14% figure, the 58% rate is for a range of charges from rape to sexual assault.) Stern said that figure was a sign that the system was "working very hard" and was never going to be considerably higher under the current legal system."We have probably put so much emphasis on the criminal justice process ... that the actual needs of the human being who's suffered this appalling violation come second," she said. "What I've tried to suggest is that they should at least be equal." Better victim care would help improve the conviction rate because fewer people would drop out of the process, she added.But some campaigners said that the recommendation effectively let the criminal justice system off the hook, when women were still receiving "shocking" treatment. "What she's proposing is to cover up what's happening in the criminal justice system just at the time when women are finally getting the truth out," said Ruth Hall of Women Against Rape.Stern's conclusions mark a significant departure from the previous policy agenda. At the launch of the review last years, the solicitor general, Vera Baird, said: "Conviction rates are far too low ... the Stern review should help us identify how we can improve the handling of rape complaints and drive up conviction rates."In future, Stern found, police and prosecutors should be rated on how well victims are treated, as well as clear-up rates. Independent sexual violence advisors (ISVAs), who support victims throughout the process, should be an intrinsic part of the system and available to every complainant.There are currently only 43 ISVAs in England and Wales, with 13,000 rapes reported last year. Stern said she believed enough ISVAs could be provided for a cost of just £1m a year.Stern also called for all police forces to consider setting up a specialist rape unit and focus more on joined-up, intelligence-led policing to prevent more cases like that of the taxi driver John Worboys, who was jailed indefinitely last year for a succession of sexual attacks. Detectives should be aware that computer technology could help them track information on sex offenders at a national level.The report found problems persisted in the system, with implementation of policies for improvement "patchy". In some areas target-driven approaches meant rape cases were fighting to get priority over burglary and theft; the focus was on easy to prove cases; some officers were still influenced by the false idea that rape didn't count when it was between two people who knew each other; and communication with victims could be poor.The researchers were told that in some places there were no female physicians available for intimate forensic examinations, and victims complained that overseas doctors with poor language skills were being used.But Stern said she believed that most people were treated well by the police.The report called for an end to the use by politicians and campaigners of the much-quoted 6% conviction rate, which represents the proportion of reported rapes that end in a conviction for rape itself. It was misleading and may be putting victims off reporting attacks, Stern said.The suggestion is controversial, because campaigners say women who have been raped want to see their attacker convicted for rape, not a lesser offence that may carry different connotations. The 6% figure most accurately represented the situation women faced when reporting rape, Hall said. "To move away from that is to hide what women are really up against."The report's other recommendations include:• the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority should end its practice of docking victims' payouts if they have previous unspent convictions or did not report the rape immediately• responsibility for forensic medical examinations should be transferred from the police to the NHS, and every victim should have the choice of a male of female physician• a study into the number of false allegations, to see how it compares to other offences. An idea persists that false allegations are higher for rape, and it is hoped that a review would show this was not the case• better use of video interviews, which can be amateurish, cause distress to victims and hinder effective trials• consideration of the idea that victims should be given their own lawyer for part of the criminal proceedings• an end to the use of conflicting performance targets for the police and CPS, which see detectives keen to charge a certain number of people and prosecutors keen not to take harder cases to courtRape Crisis said that while it welcomed many of the recommendations, it wanted to know what sustainable resources would fund support for victims.Many rape crisis centres face the threat of closure because of a lack of cash, and when money does come from central government it is only for a year at a time, meaning uncertainty continues."We would also ask questions about who is going to monitor the 23 recommendations, as they are similar to those that came out of previous rape reviews in 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2007," a spokeswoman said.She added that Rape Crisis still considered the conviction rate when taken as a proportion of rapes reported to the police to be "extremely low".Ceri Goddard, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for an increase in conviction rates, said: "Whilst we welcome Stern's call for greater focus on supporting victims of rape we would caution that this should be alongside more not less efforts on increasing conviction rates."Using only the 58% conviction rate would not reflect the high attrition rate in rape cases that was so important, she added.Baird said: "Rapists must know that they won't get away with it anymore, whatever the circumstances, even if the woman is someone they know, even if she is drunk. Things have changed, and they now stand a more than one in two chance of being convicted."She added that the government would be announcing grants worth more than £3m for ISVAs and rape crisis centres this week. But the Equalities Office admitted this money had been been announced previously and was not new funding.• This article was amended on 14 March 2012 to add detail on the range of charges which the 14% and 58% figures pertain to.
