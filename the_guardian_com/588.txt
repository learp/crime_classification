Humberside police said yesterday that they were still treating as suspicious the death of a skydiver killed during a competition in Lincolnshire last year.The reaction followed weekend reports that detectives were about to reveal that Stephen Hilder, 20, an army cadet, took his own life, falling to his death after deliberately tampering with his parachute. Police launched a murder inquiry after the incident at Hibaldstow, near Brigg, in July. They interviewed 2,500 people and took almost 800 written statements. Two army cadet colleagues were arrested and questioned about Hilder's death. Both were on the jump when he fell 4,000 metres (13,000ft) to his death. "The one question that keeps coming up is whether Humberside police can confirm that Stephen Hilder committed suicide," said a spokeswoman yesterday. "The answer to that is no. Our inquiries are still ongoing." She added that there were no immediate plans for any announcement about the case. "The case will not be closed until such time that both our inquiries and those of the forensic team have been concluded. We did have some significant development in terms of the forensic side of the inquiry in March and are now conducting further tests on different items to try to get more conclusive results." The Sunday Express claimed yesterday that Hilder had cut the cord on his main parachute and severed the four harness straps on his reserve. The spokeswoman said detectives were still investigating all aspects of his death. "Until we have the results of the forensic tests, it would be entirely wrong to speculate about exactly what happened to Stephen," she said.
