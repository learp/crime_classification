The coach of a six-year-old boy who ran a marathon in an attempt to set a world record last year, has been charged with torturing the youngster.Biranchi Das was arrested after the mother of Budhia Singh claimed her son was being severely beaten, and that she had found scars all over his body.Budhia became an instant celebrity in India when he ran 40 miles at the age of four - a feat that drew widespread condemnation from medical officials and child rights activists.Despite the criticism, the boy's mother, Sukanti Singh, continued to support Das' efforts to train her son for further marathons.Today, however, Sukanti alleged that her son was being badly mistreated and claimed "Biranchi was beating him up regularly."She added: "He even once tied Budhia up from a ceiling fan and threw hot water on his body."Yesterday, authorities took Budhia, who had been living with his coach, to hospital for a series of medical examinations.The boy was also assigned security guards after his mother claimed Das had threatened their lives.Das has denied the allegations, however, and has called the charges "a conspiracy against me hatched by the state government's child welfare department."In 2006, Budhia attempted to run a 43-mile marathon, sparking protests from child rights activists. But doctors stepped in after he had run 40 miles and found the child to be undernourished, anaemic and under cardiac stress.In May this year, child welfare officials in India branded the boy's participation in marathons as "torture."A month later, police stopped the youngster from making a 60-mile walk in scorching heat across east India.Today Sukanti, who was once allegedly close to selling her son to another villager for 800 rupees (Â£7), also complained that Das was not sharing the money he had earned from the boy's long-distance exploits."He has given me very little, but he was earning a lot of money from my son's hard work," she said, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.Budhia's father died when the boy was seven-months-old. Das, who met the family two years ago, has said in the past that he has raised the boy as his son.
