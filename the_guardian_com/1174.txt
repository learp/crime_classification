Despite knowing that his odds of becoming the next England football manager would be slashed following his acquittal, Harry Redknapp refused to play down the personal costs of the tortuous saga that ended at Southwark crown court on Wednesday morning."It really has been a nightmare," he told reporters on the court steps. "It's been five years and this is a case that should never have come to court because it's unbelievable really."Both the Tottenham Hotspur manager and his friend, the Sheffield Wednesday owner Milan Mandaric, attacked the decision to try them on the tax evasion charges of which they were eventually acquitted."I would rather not talk much now, and I'm quite sure you understand that," Mandaric said. "I've got to go somewhere to try to pinch myself and wake me up from that horrible dream that I had in the past."But no sooner had the verdict been returned and the ordeal declared over than the talk turned to Redknapp's future. A few hours later, as Fabio Capello resigned as England manager, questions about Redknapp's future became all the more pressing. As the most successful English-born Premier League club manager by some distance and a man recognised for his skill at handling the temperaments of star players, Redknapp is favourite to replace Capello, while Paddy Power's odds moved from 15/8 to 10/11.Although the Football Association would not comment officially on such speculation, Redknapp's acquittal, together with the judge's description of both him and Mandaric as men of "good character", means that the last external obstacle to his appointment has been removed. Spurs, who would feel his loss acutely were he to take the England job, released a statement saying everyone at the club shared the Redknapp family's delight in seeing justice done."This has been hanging over him for over four years and the last two weeks have been particularly difficult," the club said. "We are pleased to see this resolved and we all look forward to the rest of the season."The prosecution in the trial had alleged that the two men had evaded tax on payments totalling £189,000 that were made by Mandaric into Redknapp's offshore bank account while the two men were at Portsmouth football club.The first charge of cheating the public revenue alleged that between 1 April 2002 and 28 November 2007, Mandaric paid $145,000 (£93,100) into the account. The second charge for the same offence related to a sum of $150,000 (£96,300) allegedly paid between 1 May 2004 and 28 November 2007.But Redknapp, who served as the Portsmouth manager, and Mandaric, the club's former owner, successfully argued that the money was given as a gesture of friendship and had nothing to do with Redknapp's job.The prosecution had claimed that the two sums represented bonuses for Redknapp and were therefore eligible to have tax paid on them. Redknapp received the first payment from Mandaric, it was said, to make up for money he lost on the profitable sale of Peter Crouch to Aston Villa in 2002.After Crouch was sold, Portsmouth paid Redknapp a bonus of £115,473, representing 5% of the net profit, with PAYE tax and national insurance deducted. Mandaric acknowledged that Redknapp was unhappy with that figure as he felt he was due 10% of the profits because he had had to work hard to convince his boss to sign Crouch in the first place.Four days after he received the £115,473 from Portsmouth, Redknapp went to Monaco on Mandaric's suggestion and personal recommendation to open the bank account. Redknapp told the court that when asked to chose a password for the account, he had opted for Rosie47, in honour of his pet bulldog and the year of his birth. A month later, Mandaric paid the $145,000 into the Monaco account.Mandaric described the first payment as "seed money", given to "do something special for Harry" and intended to help his friend grow profitable investments. He also denied the second payment of $150,000 was in any way connected to Redknapp's job, saying it was merely paid into the account because the investments had lost their value and he felt "embarrassed" by the losses.Mandaric told the court: "I did not know what the word [evade] means," adding that over six years his companies paid a total of £55m in taxes.Redknapp said that far from being "any kind of tax fiddler", he was "the most ungreedy person you have ever met in your whole life – ever".However, he admitted under cross-examination that he had lied to a News of the World reporter, Rob Beasley, who had challenged him in 2009 about where the money came from by telling him that the first payment was a bonus to make up for the money he had lost on the Crouch sale.Redknapp said he had told Beasley that the money was a bonus in order to get rid of the reporter. "I have to tell the police the truth, but not Mr Beasley. He's a News of the World reporter."Redknapp and Mandaric embraced in the dock as the verdicts were read out after five hours of deliberations. Redknapp left the court immediately, while Mandaric walked up to Detective Inspector Dave Manley, who led the City of London police inquiry into corruption in football, to shake his hand and say: "Thank you."Manley – who was shouted at by Redknapp during proceedings – made no comment other than saying: "I accept the court's decision."Following the conclusion of the case, it can now be reported that DI Manley had faced accusations that police had leaked details of the case to the News of the World.Although Beasley's recorded conversations with both Redknapp and Mandaric had formed a central part of the prosecution, Redknapp's QC, John Kelsey-Fry, attempted to get the evidence thrown out, claiming the press was "effectively conducting a satellite investigation".Both Manley and Beasley denied City of London police was the "source", with the reporter saying he had instead paid several thousand pounds to someone close to Redknapp.The Tottenham manager – who was furious with police after press photographers came to be present at a dawn raid on his Dorset home that had terrified his wife – was further enraged by the volume of information Beasley had obtained when they spoke to each other on the eve of the 2009 League Cup final between Spurs and Manchester United.Kelsey-Fry said during legal argument that Beasley's intentions were "repugnant".But during evidence heard in the absence of the jury, Judge Anthony Leonard dismissed the QC's submissions that the evidence was "evasive, contradictory and manifestly unreliable".He also ruled out a later bid by Mr Kelsey-Fry to have the case thrown out altogether.It can also now be revealed that Mandaric and the former Portsmouth chairman and ex-chief executive Peter Storrie were both cleared by a jury after being accused of a £600,000 tax dodge over player transfer payments.A jury, also at Southwark crown court, dismissed prosecution claims that £424,000 of income tax had been evaded and £177,000 had been dodged in National Insurance (NI) contributions.Storrie, 60, of Hayling Island, Hampshire, was accused of arranging a signing-on fee to Amdy Faye to be paid via the bank account of agent William McKay "in order to conceal its true nature and purpose".He and Mandaric were also jointly accused of arranging for or causing to be paid a termination payment to Israeli international striker Eyal Berkovic via the account of Medellin Enterprises Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.Following the not guilty verdicts, Storrie applied in November to have a reporting ban lifted, saying it was having a "devastating" impact on his personal life.But a judge ruled against his application pending the conclusion of the Mandaric and Redknapp trial.Both the City of London police and HM Revenue and Customs released statements on Wednesday saying they accepted the jury's verdict, although the latter added: "We have no regrets about pursuing this case because it was vitally important that the facts were put before a jury for their consideration."Redknapp Jr ... and other talking pointsJamie Redknapp With his sharp suits, neat hair and carefully maintained stubble, Harry Redknapp's son was a constant presence in court, sitting listening to each day's evidence from the public gallery close to the dock. His attendance also provided photographers with a welcome supply of pictures as the Redknapps entered and exited court. The footballer turned pundit broke his silence yesterday to utter six words to the press: "Just glad it is all over."Peter Crouch Milan Mandaric was not bowled over by Crouch's talents, apparently telling Redknapp: "If this is the best you can do, you will end up paying me money." The 6ft 7in striker confounded his critics, and was eventually sold to Aston Villa for a £3m profit, triggering a bonus for Redknapp.Rosie Redknapp chose to give his Monaco bank account the password Rosie47 after his beloved pet bulldog, Rosie (above left). The last two characters of the name are an abbreviation of 1947, the year of Redknapp's birth. Mandaric told the court he had met the late Rosie several times and saw nothing unusual in naming a bank account after a dog.Monaco Redknapp told the court he had opened the Rosie47 account there to receive a payment from Mandaric of $145,000 (£93,000). A second deposit of $150,000 was later paid in by Mandaric.Oxford United Redknapp admitted losing £250,000 in an attempt to help his friend Jim Smith keep his managerial job. A US takeover bid fell through and Redknapp never saw his money again.
