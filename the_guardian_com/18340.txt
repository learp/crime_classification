A Conservative MP was banned from driving for two months today after pleading guilty to riding a quad bike on a public road with no insurance.Nicholas Soames, the MP for Mid Sussex, was filmed driving the quad bike following a new year's day hunt. In addition to his two-month driving ban, he was fined £200, and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge, plus £35 costsSoames, 60, was caught on film by hunt saboteurs at the hunt in Slaugham, West Sussex. Footage showed a group of people, including three children aged three, five and seven, and a pregnant woman, riding behind him.Prosecutor Nigel Pilkington told Crawley magistrates' court that the quad bike was ridden on private land and then briefly on the public highway to cross from one field to another at about 10mph at 12.30pm."Mr Soames accepts that as can be seen in the video, he was carrying a number of people in the vehicle and in the trailer, all of whom were unrestrained and all of whom were standing up," he told the court. "Had any injury occurred to his party, or any others then there would have been no insurance in place to compensate the parties."Soames was candid with police in his interview and had provided his insurance details to highlight the lack of cover, he added.A charge of using a vehicle in a dangerous condition against Soames had been withdrawn by the crown.The Tory MP had three previous endorsements on his licence, all fixed penalties, one of which is out of date now but not at the time of the offence.Stills from the footage of Soames driving the bike were printed in the Daily Mirror on January 3, shortly after seven-year-old Elizabeth Cooke died in an accident on Boxing Day while riding a quad bike on a public road in Blackmore, Essex.
