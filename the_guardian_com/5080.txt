The family of a woman murdered by a sex offender, released early from prison, is to sue the government for breaching her human rights, the civil liberties group Liberty said today.Verna Bryant is suing the Home Office for failing to protect her daughter, Naomi Bryant, who was murdered by a serial sex attacker released on licence from a life sentence.Liberty, which is representing the family, will argue that the Home Office did not adequately consider the safety of the public, and women in particular, when Anthony Rice, who had a 34-year history of violent sexual attacks, was released.It also contends that the victim's human rights to life and to be free from degrading treatment were violated by the early release of a convicted violent sex offender.Rice murdered mother-of-one Naomi Bryant at her home in Winchester in August last year, nine months after his release. He had served 16 years for rape, indecent assault and actual bodily harm.Lawyers had won Rice his early release on human rights grounds but the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, later found that the sex offender was "too dangerous to be released in the first place".In a report published last month, Mr Bridges added that there were "substantial deficiencies" in the way Rice was supervised by probation and other officials in Hampshire, where he was staying on licence at a charity hostel.Mrs Bryant said: "I want the whole system to be shaken up. Victims have human rights too. What about my daughter's rights?" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I think by letting [Rice] out when he was on a life sentence and knowing he was a dangerous man and not being monitored, they have made a mistake."I do believe in human rights for people but the ones who are ill and sick like Anthony Rice, I think they have to be monitored."The director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, said: "The Bryant family deserve justice for their terrible loss and a real sense that others will be better protected in the future. The Human Rights Act is the best hope for victims who in the past had only limited redress against the government." To date there has been no public investigation into Rice's release. The family has received no compensation, nor a ministerial apology. Rice, 49, is now serving another life sentence.The probation inspectorate criticised the parole board for placing an "increasing focus" on Rice's human rights rather than on protecting the public.The report added that once he was freed, the local multi-agency public protection panel, designed to protect the public from serious offenders in the community, was also "distracted" by Rice's human rights.
