Though he would not receive his first life sentence until the age of 60, there are some conspicuous clues in Peter Tobin's early life of the violent killer he would become.He was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire in 1946, the second of eight children born to a council worker and housewife. He was, in the words of his younger brother Robert, "a bit wild", and was in reform school by the age of seven.He met his first wife, Margaret Mountney, when he was 22 and she 17; she has described a relationship that began with great charm but quickly degenerated into terrifying violence, in which she was frequently beaten and locked up by her husband.On one occasion, she returned from an errand to find he had decapitated her pet puppy, after which she was raped and brutally sexually assaulted with a knife.A neighbour raised the alarm when he saw her blood dripping through her ceiling, but though hospitalised for weeks, she was too scared to report her husband to the police. It was not until he was jailed for five years for theft, of which he served three, that she was able to escape the marriage.Tobin met his second wife, Sylvia Jefferies, in Brighton in 1973. She has also described a violent and manipulative relationship. Tobin had taken a job for the city's water department in which he was trained in digging trenches – experience which he would later put to use, jurors heard, in burying several of his victims.She had a son, Ian, and later a daughter, who died soon after she was born, but despite repeated attempts to escape the marriage she was unable to leave her husband until 1976, when she fled to a women's refuge and, in a measure of the evidence of abuse she had amassed, won a lifelong injunction against Tobin ever contacting or approaching her.Little is known of Tobin's movements in the next decade, but in 1986 he met wife number three, Cathy Wilson. She fitted a familiar pattern — young and naive, she moved in with him, aged 16, three weeks after they met.She was soon pregnant with their son Daniel; in August 1989 they married and moved to Robertson Avenue in Bathgate, West Lothian, the house in which he would later murder and mutilate Vicky Hamilton.Wilson, too, has described a violent, controlling man, who banned her from leaving the house and rarely left her alone.In April 1990 she fled with Daniel, having secretly saved the bus fare back to England. Shortly afterwards she was told that Tobin had attempted an overdose with amitriptyline, the same drug which he would use to subdue Hamilton and McNicol.She later moved to Portsmouth and, when Tobin himself moved to Margate in March 1991, she agreed to give him some access to Daniel.She did not know that he had brought the body of Vicky Hamilton with him from Scotland, nor that he would abduct Dinah McNicol, still with Daniel's child seat in the back of the car, while returning from droping the toddler back with his mother.
