A man who harboured violent sexual fantasies of strangling women was yesterday found guilty of murdering a special needs teacher.Graham Coutts, 39, a musician from Hove, East Sussex, who trawled violent pornographic websites to fuel his fantasies, strangled 31-year-old Jane Longhurst with a pair of tights after forcing her to have sex with him in March 2003, the Old Bailey heard during his retrial. He then hid her body in a storage depot for a month before taking it to secluded woodland and setting fire to it.Coutts was found guilty by a majority verdict after the jurors had deliberated for 13 hours. There were cheers from the public gallery, where Ms Longhurst's mother, Liz, 76, had been watching the trial. The trial heard that Coutts murdered Ms Longhurst to satisfy his perverted sexual interest in the strangling to death of women. They rejected his claims her death had been accidental.He was originally convicted of murder three years ago, but law lords ruled the conviction unsafe as jurors had not been offered the alternative of manslaughter.Liz Longhurst has campaigned against violent and extreme pornography on the internet and ministers have vowed to outlaw such material.Philip Katz QC, prosecuting, told the court that Coutts had been looking at horrific images on websites the day before the murder, and had a fetish for dead bodies. For a month he had repeatedly visited the body, which he kept in a storage unit and regarded as his trophy. A former partner said Coutts had confessed: "I get the most awful feeling that I'm going to strangle and kill a woman."Later, he told a psychiatrist he had been having thoughts about murdering women since the age of 15 and feared the thoughts might lead him to commit a crime. He had carried out web searches including terms strangled women, dead women, asphyxia, rape, murder, necro and snuff.Coutts will be sentenced today and he is likely to face a life sentence. He was originally given a minimum term of 30 years which had been reduced to 26 years on appeal.Ms Longhurst's partner, Malcolm Sentance, shouted "rubbish" when the defence counsel, Christopher Sallon QC, told the judge that there could have been a degree of consent to the events leading up to the killing.
