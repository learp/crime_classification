All three will be interviewed in police stations local to where they were arrested.The arrests were made as part of a joint operation involving the local forces and the East Midlands special operations unit.Three officers from the unit travelled to China – where relatives of the victims live – last month as part of the inquiry.Detective Chief Inspector Tom Davies, who is leading the inquiry, said it was known that Du also had contacts in China.Anyone with information concerning the whereabouts of Du is asked to contact police or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111, or via www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
