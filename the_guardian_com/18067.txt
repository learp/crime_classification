A 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a fight at his school today. The teenager suffered multiple injuries in the incident at Park Campus school in West Norwood, south London.Emergency services went to the scene shortly before 9am and took the boy to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A second boy was receiving hospital treatment after being stabbed in the arm during the fight. Three people have been arrested.A Metropolitan police spokesman said officers were called at 8.50am to reports of an assault in Gipsy Road Gardens."Police, London ambulance service and an air ambulance attended the scene to find a 15-year-old male suffering multiple stab wounds," said a spokesman. "He was taken to a south London hospital and confirmed dead shortly after arrival. A postmortem will be arranged in due course. A second teenager was also stabbed in the arm during the incident. He has been taken to a south London hospital with minor injuries."Park Campus is a specialist school educating some of London's most troubled young people, including those with social, behavioural and emotional difficulties. Launched two years ago, it was hailed as the first of its kind in Britain, aimed at getting young people back into mainstream education.Its headteacher, Richard Leonard, said: "This is a terrible tragedy and the whole school is in shock. We will be providing all the support we can to pupils and their families as the school community tries to come to terms with this awful loss."The boy was the 13th teenager killed in London this year and the ninth to die in a stabbing. Last year 14 teenagers were murdered in London, 10 of them stabbed and one shot. Police have had some success in reducing youth violence, partly as a result of a crackdown on carrying weapons.
