It was once a familiar story: the planned animal testing laboratory or breeding centre quietly abandoned as company after company dropped out of the project, its staff and their families worried about intimidation and threats of violence.The most infamous case saw animal rights extremists exhume and steal the body of an elderly woman whose family ran a farm breeding guinea pigs for research. Three people were later jailed.Now, however, as illustrated by today's arrest of 30 suspected animal rights militants in a series of raids around the UK and Europe, the pendulum appears to be swinging back.Much of it has been down to the shared resolve of the government and city investors involved in medical research to fight back against what they perceive as blinkered anti-science fanaticism.Tony Blair has sided very publicly against the militants, in May last year even signing a "people's petition" organised by an science industry group demanding that medical research on animals, where necessary, be allowed to continue.Six months later in a major speech in Oxford - site of one of the main recent animal rights battles, over Oxford University's new biomedical research laboratory - the prime minister called himself "practically born again" on science and vowed to stand up against those who opposed it.The main weapon Mr Blair's government has handed to medical researchers is the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The law was used in the arrests today.Among other measures, the act created specific new offences including "interference with contractual relationships so as to harm animal research organisations" and "intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisations".Some complained the measures were too severe and that existing laws available for such offences - from the Public Order Act to the Malicious Communications Act and the Protection from Harassment Act - were enough.The new law was soon put to use. In March this year three people were jailed under its terms for harassing businesses believed to be linked to Huntingdon Life Sciences, a perennial target for animal rights groups.The government has also sought to protect those involved in animal-related work, amending the law to make it easier for firms to apply to withhold personal details of directors from company records available for public inspection. As of August last year more than 10,000 directors had applied.A month before that, figures from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry showed that the number of attacks by animal rights militants had decreased by 50% in the first six months of 2006.The courts have also stepped in. Oxford University has been able to keep in force a landmark injunction banning activists from protesting against its new laboratory, keeping them at least 100 yards from the home of a "protected person".Parallel to all this has been a perceived change in public attitude against what some complain is the tyranny of militant groups trying to impose what is, according to opinion polls, a minority view about animal testing.The most public face of this has been Laurie Pycroft, a Swindon student who set up a group called Pro-Test to campaign in favour of vivisection.
