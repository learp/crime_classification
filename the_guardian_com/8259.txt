The son of a businesswoman was being questioned today on suspicion of murder after she was allegedly stabbed to death.Assia Shahzad, 40, was found with fatal injuries at the family home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.Her son, Usman Shahzad, 21, was arrested at the scene along with a 16-year-old.Neighbours told reporters that Assia Shahzad's husband, Rashad, 45, moved out of the house earlier this year after claims she had been seeing other men.Police dismissed suggestions that her death was an "honour killing" but said it related to a "domestic dispute".Raj Khan, a local councillor who grew up with Shahzad, described the death as a "nightmare event"."The community is drowned with upset. We are horrified at what has happened," he said. "This has been a great loss for the family, for her friends, for everybody."Khan added that Shahzad, who has lived at the address for around six years, was the director of a travel firm.Police were called to the six-bedroom property just before 6.45pm on Saturday. Shahzad was taken to Stoke Mandeville hospital with serious injuries but died shortly after 8pm.Detective Chief Inspector Vince Grey, from Thames Valley police, said: "Our investigation is still in its early stages. However, we believe this was not a random attack and that both the suspects and victims are known to one another."A postmortem was being carried out last night, and results are expected later today.Grey added: "I have been made aware that there are rumours circulating that this was a so-called 'honour killing'. I would like to categorically state that we do not believe this to be the case but that we are dealing with a domestic dispute."For legal reasons, I cannot say any more about the motives for the murder at this point."
