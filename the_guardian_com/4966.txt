The son of the murdered soldier Lee Rigby will be forced to see "images of his dad that no son should ever have to endure", his widow has said.A moving victim impact statement written by Rebecca Rigby was read to the Old Bailey on Wednesday, where her husband's murderers, Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are due to be sentenced.Prosecutor Richard Whittam QC read excerpts of the statement, in which Mrs Rigby described the effect of suddenly being in the public gaze after the brutal killing.She said: "I was also living in the public gaze. I couldn't go out or do anything. I felt like I didn't want to go on. I saw people nudging and looking at me if I tried to walk down the street. It was surreal."Of all the feelings I have, the one thing that overrides everything is that I know my son will grow up and see images of his dad that no son should ever have to endure, and there is nothing I can do to change this."Adebolajo and Adebowale hit Fusilier Rigby, 25, in a car before hacking him to death near Woolwich barracks in south-east London on 22 May 2013.Mrs Rigby said she had accepted her husband would be at risk when he went to serve in Afghanistan, but not in Britain, where he was based when he died.She said: "When you wave someone off you accept that there is a chance you will never see them again. You do not expect to see this on the streets of the UK."Mrs Rigby told the court she had lived with the prospect of death while her husband served as a soldier in war zones such as Afghanistan but never expected it on Britain's streets.She said: "When you wave someone off you accept that there is a chance you will never see them again. You do not expect to see this on the streets of the UK." She added: "Lee will never be forgotten. We will always love him and miss him every day."His stepfather, Ian Rigby, said in his victim impact statement: "All he was doing was just walking through London."He told how he and others battled to comprehend the brutal killing of their loved one, saying: "It just doesn't click in your head."
