The two men who carried out Britain's biggest jewellery robbery asked make-up artists to age them 30 years, it was reported today.The pair asked staff at a make-up salon in Covent Garden, central London, to make them look like old men hours before making off with £40m of jewellery from Graff Diamonds in Mayfair, according to the Mirror.They reportedly abandoned the plan to look like old men because of the length of time it would have taken. A 29-year-old make-up artist who transformed the men by using rubber masks is believed to be under police protection.DNA tests are being carried out on masks that the robbers tried on in the studio but did not use, according to the Sun.The same make-up studio was also the source of the materials used to disguise the gang behind the £53m raid on a Securitas depot in 2006.Detectives investigating the robbery at Graff have recovered a loaded firearm but Scotland Yard said it is not believed to be the one fired during the incident. The robbers fired shots into the ground as they left the jewellers and again in nearby Dover Street when challenged by members of the public as they switched vehicles during their escape. Officers have also found a high-powered motorbike possibly used to spirit away a bag holding the stolen gems.More details of the cars the robbers used have been released. Scotland Yard described the first vehicle as a silver B-class Mercedes with the registration LV06 HFA.The second vehicle was a blue Volkswagen Sharan with the registration RA07 XEV. Both number plates were "cloned", a police spokesman said.Officers arrested and questioned a 50-year-old man in Ilford, east London, on Monday in connection with the robbery.They suspect that the man, who has been released on bail, may have been involved in planning the raid, although he was not in the West End when it took place.Officers have searched at least three properties in raids in London and the south-east.
