A young Arab student was killed in a fracas that started after his friend was taunted for being black, a court heard today. Mohammed al-Majed, 16, from Qatar, died three days after suffering a serious head injury when he hit the pavement during the incident in Hastings, East Sussex, on 22 August last year. George Austin, 22, of Bermondsey, south London, is accused of his manslaughter. Lewes crown court heard that the co-defendant Paul Rockett was alleged to have racially assaulted Majed's friend. Rockett, 21, denies a charge of racially aggravated common assault, while Austin denies manslaughter.
