A box office manager at the Barbican in London was jailed for 18 months today after he swindled the arts centre out of Â£33,000 in a bogus ticket refund scam.Over a period of 13 months, Christopher Todd, 35, transferred cash into his own bank account through scores of transactions involving unsuspecting arts lovers.The Old Bailey heard how Todd, of Teddington, Middlesex, was a gambling addict and was using the money to pay off debts.Having worked at the arts and conference centre since January 2008, he began the scam in August that year. In charge of a team of 10, as a ticket sales manager, Todd was caught after an anonymous tip-off by a colleague.He had previously worked at a number of theatres including Sadler's Wells, in London, the court heard.His barrister Jonathan White described Todd's past. Todd had begun drinking heavily when his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and then started gambling to try and win money to pay for private hospital treatment for him.Todd had previously experienced periods of mental illness, having been diagnosed with depression while at university, said White. The barrister added that his client had tried to kill himself in the past and that he tried again last month while awaiting sentence.White said Todd "had difficulty coping with life" and that his unsuccessful gambling "became an addiction and spiralled disastrously out of control".The judge, Recorder David Spens QC, told Todd his crime was an abuse of trust and merited a custodial sentence. "Over a considerable period of time you seriously abused your position of trust by refunding the proceeds of tickets into your own bank account. The number of transactions ran into scores," Spens said. "Your offence is aggravated by the period over which this all took place."He added: "In my opinion your offence is so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for it."Todd pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to a single count of fraud by an abuse of a position of trust.The Barbican Centre said: "We are shocked at the abuse of a position of trust in this case. The Barbican takes any theft or misappropriation of its resources very seriously and we would like to give reassurance that at no time were any customers who had purchased tickets affected by this fraudulent activity."
