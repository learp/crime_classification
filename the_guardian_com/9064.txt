On 14 April 2012, the Guardian published an important piece by Eric Allison and Simon Hattenstone about the historic abuse of children in custody by a prison officer, Neville Husband. I took little issue with this moving account.Subsequently, however, the Guardian published two letters. The first said that I had declined to apologise for the abuse (and because of that had been unsuitable to lead Barnardo's, as I did for six years). The second implied that, as director general of the Prison Service, I had tolerated the widespread rape and beating of children.Husband's offending began when I was 13 years of age, and the offences for which he was subsequently convicted took place in 1977 when I was still at university, five years before I joined the Prison Service and 21 years before I became director general. Later, when Husband's victims sued the Prison Service, I had resigned from the Home Office and was in no position to make a response. The Guardian knew from email exchanges, however, that I stood ready to make public my personal apology, and that I had, many years ago, expressed regret about the abuse.I do not deny the appalling nature of Husband's crimes. But it should not have needed me to complain to the Press Complaints Commission before this letter was published to make clear that the abuse did not occur when I was in a position of authority, and that I did not tolerate the abuse or fail to express my regret for it. I may have had many failings as director general of the Prison Service. But failing to address the abuse of prisoners of any age was not one of them.Martin NareyWhitby, North Yorkshire• Editor's note: The Guardian accepts Mr Narey made representations to senior editorial staff in May 2012 but would like to point out that the matter of a proposed response from him was not referred to the readers' editor.
