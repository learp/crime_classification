Shrien Dewani, who is suspected of having his wife murdered while they were on honeymoon in South Africa, has been admitted to hospital after suffering a reaction to his medication, his family said.Dewani, wanted in South Africa for allegedly hiring a hitman to kill Anni, 28, is suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).He was taken to hospital in Bristol on Sunday after having a reaction to his sleeping tablets, a family spokesman said in response to reports that he had attempted to kill himself.It has also emerged that the 31-year-old care home boss has lost more than 12kg (26.5lb) and become extremely fragile because of stress and depression.The family spokesman said: "Shrien had a reaction to his sleeping tablets on Sunday and was taken to hospital as a precaution."They allowed him to sleep it off without any other treatment and he has been assessed as being medically fit to be discharged today."There was no intention to kill himself. He continues to suffer from severe PTSD under the most extreme pressures from South Africa."Dewani's condition has been exacerbated by "recent revelations about the sexual assault of his wife in South Africa and unhelpful and prejudicial comments from senior officials", the spokesman added.New evidence has emerged in recent days reportedly indicating that Anni Dewani was sexually assaulted before her murder and casting further doubt on the theory that she was killed on her husband's orders.But South Africa's national director of public prosecutions, Menzi Semelane, accused the Briton of committing a "heinous crime" during a television interview last week.Shrien Dewani's supporters say he has little chance of getting a fair trial while such comments by senior figures are being broadcast around South Africa.Dewani's PTSD has been causing particular concern to his family and doctors, his spokesman, Max Clifford, said."He is in a very bad place at the moment, which is not surprising given the tragic case of his wife and all the accusations since," said Clifford."He is in a bad way. He has lost as much as 12 kg in recent weeks."This hasn't just happened in the last week, it's been building up after Anni's death and obviously what happened would have traumatised anybody. What's happened since has made it worse."Anni Dewani, from Sweden, was shot when a taxi the couple were travelling in was hijacked in the Gugulethu township, on the outskirts of Cape Town, on 13 November.She was found dead in the back of the abandoned vehicle with a bullet wound to her neck after the driver, Zola Tongo, drove the newlyweds to the impoverished area.He and her husband were ejected by the hijackers before Anni Dewani was driven away and shot.Shrien Dewani, of Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, is due to appear before City of Westminster magistrates court on 23 March for the next stage of the proceedings, with a three-day extradition hearing set for 3-5 May.In a plea bargain, Tongo claimed Dewani had offered him 15,000 rand (Â£1,400) for the killing.The 31-year-old, from Bothasig, was sentenced to 18 years in jail for murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and perverting the course of justice.Xolile Mnguni, 23, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 25, who are charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances, will appear before Wynberg regional court on Friday.
