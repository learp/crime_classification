An Australian accused of murdering the backpacker Peter Falconio today told a court he had been almost 400 miles away from the scene of the Briton's death.Taking the witness stand, Bradley John Murdoch admitted that he was a drugs smuggler who had transported "large quantities" of cannabis around Australia and carried guns "for protection".The 47-year-old repeatedly denied any link to the disappearance of Mr Falconio, who the prosecution say he shot dead in the Australian Outback on the evening of July 14 2001.Under cross-examination, he said he had no explanation for how his DNA had been found in a spot of blood on a T-shirt belonging to Mr Falconio's girlfriend, Joanne Lees. Ms Lees had been wearing the T-shirt on the night of the alleged murder.Mr Murdoch told the Northern Territory supreme court, in Darwin, that - like Mr Falconio and Ms Lees - he had gone through Alice Springs on the day of the backpacker's death. "I don't know whether I crossed their paths or not," he said.He denied being in the same area as the British couple on the evening of July 14, insisting he was nowhere near the section of the Stuart Highway outside the tiny settlement of Barrow Creek, north of Alice Springs, where the alleged murder took place.Rex Wild, for the prosecution, opened the cross-examination by asking Mr Murdoch: "Where did you bury Peter Falconio?"Mr Murdoch's lawyer objected, saying the question implied something that "was simply not true".The defendant also denies assaulting and attempting to abduct Ms Lees, now 32, after flagging down the couple's camper van. Mr Murdoch told the court that after he left Alice Springs, he headed for the north-western city of Broome, to which he regularly transported cannabis. He said he was 370 miles west of Barrow Creek at the time the prosecution alleges he killed Mr Falconio.He told the court he had been driving along the so-called Tanami track, near the Aboriginal community of Yuendumu. Asked by his lawyer, Grant Algie, whether he went to Barrow Creek on July 14, he said: "No, I did not."Mr Murdoch also denied it was his vehicle on CCTV footage taken at a Shell truck stop in Alice Springs on the night of the alleged murder.The defendant said the vehicle pictured had no camper trailer, its bull bar was different from the one he was using, and that his vehicle, unlike the one pictured, did not have fibreglass mudguards.He also denied he was the man pictured on CCTV footage inside the shop. Asked by Mr Algie how he could say that, Mr Murdoch replied: "I was further down the Tanami track."He admitted he regularly made changes to his appearance, and that of his vehicle, and had changed both after the trip to Broome in 2001."I cleaned my face up, had a shave," he said. "I grow a decent size beard and then the beard comes off ... we're running drugs, we've sort of got to."Ms Lees was not in court as Mr Murdoch first took the stand, but walked into the courtroom as he was giving evidence. She stopped twice on her way to her seat in the public gallery with members of Mr Falconio's family, and appeared to stare at him.The defendant told the court that he and another man, James Hepi, regularly ran cannabis across Australia, stashing the drug in a spare fuel tank on the back of his truck.Giving evidence for the prosecution earlier this month, Mr Hepi told the court that Mr Murdoch had appeared "scattered" after returning to Broome. "He'd been on the gear [amphetamines] for four or five days, racing around the country, and was fairly scattered," he said.Today, Mr Murdoch said he had a disagreement with Mr Hepi and believed his former associate could have "set him up". He also denied telling Mr Hepi that he knew of places where a body could be buried.Ms Lees, the key prosecution witness, told the court in October that Mr Murdoch had stopped the couple's camper van by signalling that there was smoke coming from its exhaust.When Mr Falconio went round to the back of the vehicle to inspect it, she told the court she heard a noise like a gunshot and never saw her boyfriend again.Ms Lees said Mr Murdoch then appeared with a gun and attempted to abduct her, but she escaped by running into the bush and hiding. Mr Falconio's body has never been found and no murder weapon has been recovered.The trial, which has been running for 29 days and has heard from more than 80 witnesses, was adjourned until tomorrow. It is expected to end later this week or early next week.
