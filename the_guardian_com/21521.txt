People who download violent pornography could face three years in jail under new legislation proposed by the government in the wake of the death of Brighton school teacher Jane Longhurst, who was killed by a man addicted to extreme porn.Ms Longhurst's mother, Liz, has led a three-year campaign, backed by a petition signed by 50,000 people and many MPs, to ban such images.Today the government unveiled proposals to create a new offence of possessing pornographic images of extreme sexual or life-threatening violence, with a new maximum sentence of three years for possession, or five for distribution of such material.The new offences - which could be included in a bill in this autumn's Queen's speech - would effectively update the 1959 Obscene Publications Act to take into account the ease with which such images can be distributed over the internet.The proposed offences, which also cover necrophilia and bestiality, come after a year-long consultation by the government.The exercise prompted lobbying by organisations in favour of a ban, including 18 local police forces and many religious groups, but also a large number of submissions by individuals concerned about freedom of speech, according to the government's conclusions published today.The Spanner Trust, which campaigns for the rights of consensual sado-masochists, was also opposed to any new measures.Home Office minister Vernon Coaker, announcing the measures, said: "The vast majority of people find these forms of violent and extreme pornography deeply abhorrent."This sort of material is not just offensive it contains images of sexual acts and sexual violence that are already illegal to publish or distribute in the UK."Such material has no place in our society but the advent of the internet has meant that this material is more easily available and means existing controls are being bypassed - we must move to tackle this."By banning the possession of such material the government is sending out a strong message - that it is totally unacceptable and those who access it will be held to account." Clauses will exempt documentary films, news and works of art, largely by defining material as primarily pornographic in purpose.The definition coming out of the consultation applies strictly to pornographic images which are also "acts that appear to be life threatening or are likely to result in serious, disabling injury".The 31-year old Ms Longhurst was killed in 2003 by musician Graham Coutts, who the court heard was obsessed with internet sites of women being strangled.Ms Longhurst had been strangled with a pair of tights and her body kept in storage for several weeks before it was found.Coutts received a life sentence with a recommendation he serve at least 26 years.Last month, however, Coutts won his House of Lords appeal against his conviction for the murder.Five Law Lords agreed that jurors should have been offered the possibility of bringing in a manslaughter verdict.They sent the matter back to the court of appeal, which last year dismissed Coutts's appeal against conviction, to "invite that court to quash the conviction".Ms Longhurst's mother, and sister Sue, launched a campaign, which received cross-party support, to create new offences regarding such images.Mrs Longhurst told the BBC "My daughter Sue and myself are very pleased that after 30 months of intensive campaigning we have persuaded the government to take action against these horrific internet sites, which can have such a corrupting influence and glorify extreme sexual violence."The new law, when passed, will apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish executive is likely to bring in a similar offence.However, the new legislation is likely to face problems similar to other internet issues if the sites are based abroad.
