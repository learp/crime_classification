A driving instructor who hid her drinking problem was banned from the roads for three years today, after falling off her motorbike three times during a lesson.Sandra Kenyon was unable to get up after the final spill and was found by police to have two bottles of French brandy, one empty and the other three-quarters full, in her jacket.She was ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid community service by magistrates in Bingley, West Yorkshire, after admitting riding the bike while nearly four times over the legal alcohol limit. The court heard that she had 131 micrograms of alcohol in 100 mililitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.Kenyon, of Hipperholme, near Halifax, said at an earlier hearing that she had "made a terrible mistake" in going ahead with the lesson in March last year.She told police after the debacle that she had drunk one bottle the day before and had only a mouthful on the day she was arrested.The court heard that she had difficulty from the start as she took a learner biker round local roads.The motorcycle lesson started with her sliding off her bike and struggling to get back on, and ended with a group of concerned passersby gathering as she lay helpless beside the machine after her third fall.She had worked without problem for nine years as a contract instructor for the Ridesafe Motorcycle School, whose spokesman, Roger Stanley, described the episode as a big shock. Speaking after the earlier hearing, he said that Kenyon had been dismissed on the day of the offence."We have very high standards and I was disgusted with what happened," he said. "I didn't know she had a problem, neither did any of the instructors."The court heard that Kenyon had not attempted to obtain work as an instructor since the episode.The sentencing hearing was told by Christopher Bird, for the defence, that Kenyon was a mother of two who had been a "competent and popular instructor, well-regarded by her pupils and employers". She had no excuse for what had happened and had expressed shame for what she had done.The chair of the bench, John Parker, who heard how Kenyon's pupil on the day had been baffled when the instructor disappeared during the lesson, said that a prison sentence had been seriously considered. He included alcohol treatment in the community service order and told Kenyon, who was also ordered to pay Â£85 costs, that she could reduce her ban by nine months if she attended a drink-driving course.
