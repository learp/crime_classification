The parents of suspected "honour killing" victim Shafilea Ahmed appeared in court on Tuesday accused of murdering their teenage daughter.Iftikhar Ahmed, 51, a taxi driver, and his wife Farzana, 48, a housewife, were charged earlier this month with the murder of 17-year-old Shafilea.At a bail hearing at Manchester crown court on 15 September, Mr Justice Richard Henriques ruled the press could report that the couple were charged after "a family member" accused them of murdering Shafilea, who was 17 when she disappeared eight years ago.On Tuesday, the couple, of Liverpool Road, Warrington, who are on bail with a number of conditions, appeared at Chester crown court for a preliminary hearing. Ahmed, wearing a grey suit, and his wife, wearing a purple headscarf, spoke only to confirm their names. No pleas were entered.A plea and case management hearing is listed to take place at Manchester crown court on 19 December. The couple will stand trial for murder next year.On 15 September, Mr Justice Henriques granted them bail as they had been bailed previously and not absconded or sought to interfere with witnesses.The couple have always denied any involvement in the death of their daughter and once gatecrashed a police press conference to protest their innocence.Shafilea disappeared after she was taken to Pakistan to meet a potential suitor. During the trip, she drank bleach in an apparent cry for help. Her badly decomposed remains were found by the river Kent in Cumbria in February 2004, five months after she vanished from her home.
