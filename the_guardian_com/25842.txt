Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer jailed for killing a teenage burglar in his home with an illegally held pump-action shotgun, is likely to be freed next week after serving two and a half years in prison.His supporters said last night that he had been contacted by probation officers to discuss details of his release. There may be concerns about his safety: his trial heard he had received deaths threats. Martin's plea - that he opened fire in self-defence - stirred fierce public controversy after he was initially convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Last October, however, three appeal court judges accepted fresh evidence that he had been suffering from a paranoid personality disorder. The original conviction was quashed and his sentence subsequently reduced to five years for the manslaughter of 16-year-old Fred Barras and the wounding of his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, 30. Martin told the court that he had been disturbed in the middle of the night by burglars at his home near Downham Market in 1999. He is currently at Highpoint low security prison in Suffolk. In order to be considered for early release, he must have kept a clean record in prison. A friend, Malcolm Starr, said Martin had received a letter from Norfolk probation service which "clearly stated his application [for parole] had been received and [they] want to speak to him about how they can help him". Mr Starr added: "He would like to have a holiday for perhaps a month away from the pressure. I think his favourite place at the moment would be America... He has had a lot of support from there." Harry Fletcher of the probation union, Napo, said: "These developments would normally indicate that plans are well advanced for a prisoner's release on parole. Probation officers are not normally allowed to visit prisoners other than to discuss release plans, unless there are very exceptional circumstances."
