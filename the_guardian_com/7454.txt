An Italian man has been arrested in Spain in connection with the suspected kidnapping of Madeleine McCann, it was reported today.The Italian citizen was detained near the port of Algeciras, southern Spain, over suspected links to the disappearance of the four-year-old, according to the website of the newspaper El Pais.The man had tried to extort money from Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, in return for information about her disappearance, El Pais reported.A Spanish police spokeswoman confirmed an Italian man had been arrested in Sotogrande, east of Gibraltar on the Andalucian coast, under an international arrest warrant issued by French authorities.She said the arrest warrant had nothing to do with the case of Madeleine McCann, but added police were now looking into possible links between the man and the suspected kidnapping.A local journalist interviewed by Sky News said a Spanish police source had told her a Portuguese woman had been arrested as well.In Lisbon, police chief inspector Olegario de Sousa told Reuters that Portuguese police had been involved in an operation that led to the arrests of two people in Spain today but no connection was found to Madeleine's disappearance.The El Pais report said that the police operation began at 5am this morning with agents from the anti-kidnapping branch of the national police searching a house for several hours.The port of Algeciras, near to Gibraltar, is a three to four hour drive from Praia da Luz in the Algarve, in southern Portugal, where Madeleine went missing from the Mark Warner's Ocean Club resort on May 3.Madeleine's great uncle, Brian Kennedy, told Sky News: "We are trying not to get our hopes up too much because they so frequently get dashed."John McCann, brother of Gerry McCann, added: "We have no comment to make because we know no more than we have seen on the news."Madeleine's parents have launched a high-profile campaign to draw attention to her disappearance, including meeting with the Pope in Rome and winning support from personalities such as football star David Beckham. The news of the Spanish police operation follows possible sightings of Madeleine across Europe and in north Africa.Portuguese police have one formal suspect in the case, British expatriate Robert Murat, 33, who lives 150 metres from the Ocean Club complex where Madeleine went missing. He has protested his innocence and reportedly told police he was at home with his mother, Jenny, that evening.Earlier this month, the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf printed details of a letter sent anonymously which claimed Madeleine was buried in scrubland nine miles from the Praia da Luz. A police search of the area found nothing.The McCanns and their twins, Sean and Amelie, have remained in the resort of Praia da Luz since Madeleine's disappearance, other than for trips around Europe and to north Africa to appeal for news about their daughter.Earlier today, Portuguese police said they had questioned a Spanish journalist who claimed that the disappearance of Madeleine was linked to an international paedophile ring.A Portuguese police spokesman said Antonio Toscano, 36, was interviewed by police for two hours yesterday but added that they were "cautious" about treating the information as a new lead.
