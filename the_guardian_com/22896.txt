Detectives are today hunting three robbers in Edinburgh who stole £10,000 in a raid on a security van, after an attempted robbery of another security van failed hours earlier.Lothian and Borders police said they believed the failed robbery and the successful raid - which both took place yesterday evening - were linked. No one was injured in either incident, but "an element of violence" was involved, Inspector Brian Stuart said.In the first incident, at 8.15pm, a Securicor van was targeted outside a Barclays Bank in St Andrews Square in the city centre."A 40-year-old security guard who was delivering a quantity of money was approached by two males who attempted to rob him," Mr Stuart said. No money was taken and three males were seen running off.Then at 11.35pm three men targeted a Brinks van outside a Bank of Scotland branch in Morningside Road, in the south side of the Scottish capital, and ran away with £10,000."The guard was assaulted and a five-figure sum was stolen," Mr Stuart said. "The three men were seen to get into a dark-coloured Volkswagen Golf in Merchiston Avenue and make off in it."Due to the similar nature of the crimes we suspect the same persons are responsible for both."Mr Stuart appealed for anyone who had witnessed the incidents or seen anyone acting suspiciously to contact police on 0131 311 3131.The men are all white and estimated to be aged between 18 and 30. The first was described as of slim build, 1.75m (5ft 9in) to 1.83m (6ft) and wearing a black hooded jacket. The second was athletic, 1.77m (5ft 10) to 1.83m and in a dark jacket and trousers, while the third was described as being of heavy build and wearing dark clothing.Last week, eight men were jailed for a total of more than 66 years after police foiled a raid on a warehouse near Heathrow airport in May 2004. The men were part of a gang who intended to steal more than £33m in diamonds, gold and cash.
