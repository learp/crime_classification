An armed siege, involving a six-year-old girl being held hostage for almost 40 hours, ended today when a man was arrested. The 32-year-old man was taken into police custody this afternoon after he had barricaded himself and the girl into a home in the Eastfield area of the Yorkshire resort of Scarborough.North Yorkshire police said the young girl was being cared for in a safe place.Police were called to the property on Monday night in response to an alert of a domestic disturbance. It was reported that the man telephoned a TV station claiming to have stabbed the girl's mother.Earlier armed police had surrounded the house as negotiators tried to persuade the man to surrender.His parents had made an emotional appeal for him to give himself up on Yorkshire Television's Calendar news programme.Last night, the man could be heard shouting to police officers in the garden. At one point, he was heard to say: "I'm going to die tonight."
