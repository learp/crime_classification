A teenage boy died today after he was stabbed outside a pub in the King's Cross area of north London. The victim, named locally as Ben Kinsella, is the 17th teenager to die as a result of violence in London this year.Kinsella, believed to be 16, is thought to have been at a party in Shillibeers, a local pub off York Way, when a row broke out with several other youths.Police said two youths were arrested nearby and were taken to a north London police station where they remain.Kinsella's head teacher Bob Hamlyn, from Holloway school, paid tribute to the murdered teenager."He was a bright kid, very high achieving academically and would have had some very good results to look forward to this summer. He was also very sporty and had everything to live for but that has been taken away from him now," Hamlyn said.He appealed for an end to such violent attacks."They say there have been 17 teenagers killed this year and it's 17 too many. People know what they have to do, they have to stop carrying the knives and put them away."More than 50 people, many of them teenagers, had gathered at the crime scene with flowers.One witness, who did not want to be named, said he had seen the boy lying in the street.He said: "His shirt had been pulled up and I could see red marks all over his stomach and then what looked like a wound and there was a pool of blood next to him."There were ambulance men putting an oxygen mask on him and trying to help him. Somebody told me they resuscitated him a couple of times while he was lying on the floor."Forensic officers are at the scene and searching for the murder weapon which has not been found.
