Uniformed civilian patrol officers will be given powers to use "reasonable force" to detain suspected criminals, under radical police reforms to be pushed through parliament by the home secretary, David Blunkett.Under the police reform bill, published today, private security guards and traffic wardens will also be able to detain suspects, although they will not be allowed to use force.The bill is part of a programme of government reforms to the police service in England and Wales, intended to improve performance, increase accountability and reduce crime."Community support officers (CSOs) and the "police family" of accredited community safety officers will be able to make a real difference in tackling antisocial behaviour," Mr Blunkett said."The new power for police officers and CSOs to seize vehicles from those who create misery in parks, public spaces and on the roads will be an effective power and a deterrent."The CSOs will be paid, but their salary will be less than that of regular police officers.But many police constables are opposed to the measures.Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents 126,000 frontline police, said officers were opposed to giving CSOs powers to stop and use force against the public."Modernisation cannot be an excuse for policing on the cheap. Employing lesser-trained and lesser-paid civilians to perform police duties will undermine policing by consent and could create more problems than it solves," he said.The bill also gives the government stronger powers to make police forces accountable, including giving Mr Blunkett the power to sack chief constables whose forces are underperforming. A new, Independent Police Complaints Commission will also be established, with the power to launch its own investigations into complaints against officers.The bill includes the following measures:· Home Office to draw up annual national policing plan;· government can remove chief officer, "in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness";· government intervention when forces are underperforming;· civilians to become CSOs and gain limited powers after training, including power to demand suspects' details and award fixed penalties for littering, disorder and cycling offences;· CSOs gain power to use "reasonable force" to detain suspect for 30 minutes, pending arrival of police;· locally agreed powers for accredited community safety officers, made up of traffic wardens, security officers and others, including power to request details and award fixed penalties. Power to detain, but without force;· assaulting a police officer, driving while disqualified, failing to stop when requested and making off without payment become arrestable offences;· police officers and CSOs can seize vehicles causing a nuisance;· police can take blood sample from drivers badly injured after an accident. Other police reforms being pursued by the Home Office, which do not require legislation, include overhauling police pay and conditions, an occupational health scheme for police to help drive down sick days, and introducing a new, non-emergency police contact number.Mr Blunkett has said it is unacceptable that only 24% of recorded crimes are detected by officers and just 9% result in a conviction. He has already set up a Police Standards Unit to push up detection and conviction rates, with the power to send "hit squads" into failing police stations.Chief police officers backed the thrust of the reforms but said they wanted more time to consider the bill's detail. The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Sir David Phillips, said: "We have consistently supported the case for the modernisation of the police service and many of the measures contained in the bill are the product of several months of discussion between ourselves and ministers."The bill is expected to have an easy route through parliament, although the shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, said he was worried about the extent to which the home secretary might be able to interfere with the operational independence of chief constables.
