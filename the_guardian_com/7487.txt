Housing charity Shelter has accused a local authority of ignoring the law and drawing up its own rules after it refused to accept an ex-offender onto its housing register.Despite legislation brought in last year which ruled that local authorities could no longer implement blanket housing bans, Chester-le-Street district council barred a former prisoner from its list. Councils had been allowed to under a 1996 housing act.And although this is the first factual case to come to the attention of the housing charity since the change in the rules, Shelter said it believed that councils other than the County Durham authority were still operating blanket bans on ex-offenders.The case in Chester-le-Street involved a 35-year-old man who is believed to have applied for a flat with the council when he was released from a north-east prison in April.He is understood to have served four years for wounding and GBH with intent, committed not in County Durham but in Ipswich, Suffolk.He needed a permanent address on his release to gain access to his young daughter, who still lived with his ex-wife in Ipswich, but claimed he was turned down on the grounds of antisocial behaviour because he was an ex-offender.However Shelter said the authority can no longer impose a blanket ban on groups when accessing social housing. Instead, councils had to take individual decisions on individual applicants.A council spokesman said: "Assessments are not solely made on the basis of a criminal past." He added that views of other agencies would normally be also sought before a decision was taken. But the council's housing allocations policy document said unacceptable behaviour would disqualify someone from the housing register and being convicted of an offence within the past three years was deemed unacceptable behaviour.And Chester-le-Street's interim director of housing, Bernadette Marjoram, later said: "It is a matter of policy that they [ex-offenders] can't be considered through the housing register."She said the authority was not the only one adopting this policy. She could not name other councils, but was "reliably advised" that it was widely used elsewhere.Shelter condemned the housing department's policy."We suspected there were isolated cases, but this is the first one to come to our attention," a spokesman said."It flies in the face of legislation brought in last year which stipulated that all blanket bans should be removed. It is bad practice by a local authority."He added that Shelter's local campaign offices were investigating other councils.The Howard league for Penal Reform, was also critical. "If councils are serious about taking crime off the streets then they should support these people," a spokeswoman said."There is a clear link between re-offending and the lack of decent housing and therefore to deny these people the right to a decent home is ludicrous."
