One in seven Britons arrested abroad is held over drug allegations, government statistics reveal today.In the year to March, 991 out of almost 7,000 arrests of UK citizens around the world were for drug offences, the Foreign Office said in its annual "British Behaviour Abroad" assessment.Some 180 Britons were held in Spain over drugs, 148 in the US, 63 in France and 54 in Thailand. The figures also show there are 22 British nationals worldwide facing criminal charges that carry the death penalty. Twelve are in Pakistan, four in Thailand, three in the US, two in Bangladesh and one in the United Arab Emirates.The country with the most arrests overall, by a significant margin, was Spain, where 2,290 Britons fell foul of the law. But as a proportion of the number of visitors, Britons were most likely to be arrested in the UAE, where 294 were held, followed by Thailand with 202 arrests and the US with 1,534.Alcohol consumption is also a major factor in the number of Britons being arrested or needing hospital treatment abroad, the Foreign Office said.It identified topless sunbathing, swearing and public displays of affection as other causes of arrests, saying Britons should carefully research the area they are visiting to avoid breaching local laws and customs. Overstaying visas also contributed to a high number of offences.There were 116 reported cases of Britons being raped abroad, including 28 in Greece, and 154 sexual assaults.Spain is the country where Britons are most likely to have to go to hospital, followed by Greece and France. Feedback from Foreign Office staff, who dealt with 2.1 million consular inquiries worldwide, revealed that a high number of hospital cases were due to moped and motorbike accidents and drink-related incidents such as falls from balconies. There were 5,629 reported deaths of UK citizens abroad.Earlier this month a British woman narrowly escaped the death penalty in Laos after being convicted of smuggling heroin at a trial described by the legal human rights charity Reprieve as a "total sham". Samantha Orobator, from Peckham in south London, was transferred to British custody to serve a life sentence because she became pregnant.Reprieve said that in her year in prison she was never permitted to meet lawyers in private and had been told she would not receive a trial unless she signed "ridiculous" documents about the paternity of her baby.At her trial she was not permitted to enter a plea, was questioned only by the prosecution, was unable to call witnesses, and was sentenced in just half an hour.In 2007 two teenage girls from London, Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, were jailed in Ghana after being arrested at the airport in the capital, Accra, with 6kg (13lb) of cocaine in two laptop computer bags in their luggage. They claimed they did not know about the drugs, but were convicted of attempting to traffic cocaine and given a one-year sentence.The Foreign Office minister Chris Bryant said: "Helping those who do get into trouble is a vital part of our job, but so many of the problems we deal with can be avoided with a little bit of preparation. Researching the local laws and customs before you travel could help avoid time in a foreign jail."
