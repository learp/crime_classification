Only the shallow, as Oscar Wilde once said, do not judge by appearances. So hats off to the police, who have been investigating whether oversized limousines, those outlaw status symbols from old-time gangster movies to modern gangsta videos, actually are dodgy. And, happily, it turns out that many of them are. Stretch limos imported from the US have become a familiar weekend sight on Britain's streets. But a month of checks turned up "some pretty unsavoury people" behind the blacked-out windows, police told BBC news - and we're not talking about mooning stag parties. Officers warn that some stretch limo businesses are often a front for organised crime, including drug dealing, money laundering and car ringing. Gangstas, rejoice: your limo's iconic status is assured for a little while yet.
