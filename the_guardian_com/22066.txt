Detectives investigating the death of 11-year-old Rhys Jones today said they had found a gun they believe is the murder weapon, as the schoolboy's parents said the past six months had been "a living nightmare".Rhys, a keen Everton supporter, was shot dead a few hundred metres from his family home in Croxteth park, Croxteth, Merseyside, as he returned from football practice last August.Merseyside police said the gun was one of 108 removed from the streets since the schoolboy was murdered. Forensic tests on the weapon linked it with the killing and further inquiries about the gun's history were continuing.Detective Superintendent Dave Kelly, leading the inquiry, said police were "confident", given the way the inquiry was proceeding, they would be able to charge and secure a "successful prosecution" of the killer.He also commented on the prime suspect, whose name is widely known in Liverpool."I am fully aware that there has been a lot of speculation in the local community and on the internet about the name of a potential offender," he said. "However, we have to deal with fact and require evidence to present any case and progress it through the courts."Again, I would like to thank the public who have come forward for their continued help and support in providing statements or information."Rhys's parents, Stephen, 45, and Melanie, 42, today issued a statement ahead of Friday's six month anniversary of their son's death."Six months on from the death of our beautiful son Rhys we are still struggling to come to terms with our loss."The last six months have been a living nightmare. In that time we have had to face occasions like Rhys's 12th birthday and Christmas."These are normally occasions which are filled with fun and laughter. But instead of celebrating we were left with a completely empty feeling and the pain and loss that we have had to face every day was magnified by the poignancy of the anniversary. "No parent should ever have to go through what we are going through. Our lives will never be the same."Police revealed they had established the exact make of bicycle â€“ a Specialized Hardrock - used by the gunman who left Rhys dying in a pool of blood."Witnesses on the night described the bike as having a silver frame, black forks and a black seat," Kelly said."I am appealing to anyone who may have seen anyone riding this type of bike in the area following Rhys's murder to contact us. I am also appealing to anyone who may know where this bike is now to come forward."Detectives believe the bike was left, along with another, on a football playing field in Parkview Road, Croxteth, at approximately 8.30pm on the night of the murder.In September, police released CCTV footage of a hooded youngster believed to be the murderer who was captured on camera, cycling around the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth moments before and after Rhys was shot.Merseyside police have not ruled out a connection between the shooting and a feud between two local gangs and have previously suggested that the strongest line of inquiry was that the killing was a case of mistaken identity.As part of the investigation, 20 people have been arrested - 17 on suspicion of murder. Four remain on bail and others are police witnesses. Two people have been arrested on suspicion of firearms offences and remain on police bail, while another person remains on bail on suspicion of assisting an offender. The force spokesman added that inquiries continue into those on bail.
