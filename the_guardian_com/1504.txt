A new senior officer will take over the Jersey care home sexual abuse investigation within weeks, police announced today.David Warcup, currently deputy chief constable of Northumbria, will take command of the inquiry when the island's deputy chief officer Lenny Harper retires next month. Warcup, who takes over as the island's deputy chief officer, will be responsible for the strategy, policy and standards of the investigation. A new full-time senior investigating officer - a role also currently allocated to Harper - will be appointed to oversee operations, Jersey police said. The force has advertised the role and said it hopes to make an appointment soon. Jersey's chief officer Graham Power said: "I hope this proposed appointment will be seen as evidence of the island's continued determination to ensure that all of the allegations relating to historic abuse are investigated thoroughly, in a way which will be seen as determined and independent," he added. The force announced in April that the 50-year-old married father-of-two had been approached to replace Harper. Warcup joined Northumbria police in 1976 and has risen steadily through the ranks, becoming deputy chief constable in June 2005. During his career he has undertaken postings that include one with the serious crime squad. He graduated from the strategic command course at the Police Staff College in 2000.He also holds a master's degree in business administration, and a post graduate diploma in management studies and criminology in police studies. Harper, 56, has led the inquiry into Haut de la Garenne since the discovery of what was initially thought to be fragments of a child's skull were discovered under a stairwell in February.
