We will make criminals scared of getting caught and scared of punishment, so they will choose not to commit crime. We will make convicted criminals pay a heavy price for their actions, so that others are scared off following their example. We will give our police force the backing and resources they deserve, so that there is less PC and more PCs. We will wage war against crime like no other government in the history of our country has ever done, and we will win. I say to the law abiding majority: I will give you back your country - I will give you back your streets, and your town centres, and your homes, and your shops.The next Conservative government will need to challenge and replace decades of liberal thinking on crime. Over that 40 years the murder rate doubled, violent crime has risen from 24,000 cases a year to 664,000, and burglaries have gone up more than tenfold to 1m a year. Yet there are some who still deny that crime and disorder are much worse today than they ever were. There is a still more urgent task facing the next Conservative government, and that is restoring police morale which has been collapsed in so many places ever since the publication of the Macpherson report ... the tragedy of the Lawrence murder and the further urgent work that needs to be done building up trust between our ethnic communities and the police, do not excuse the way in which the Macpherson report has been used to brand every officer and every branch of the force as racist, has contributed directly to a collapse of police morale and recruitment, and has led to a crisis on our streets.
