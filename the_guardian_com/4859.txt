Two more men have been arrested by police investigating the murder of Mary-Ann Leneghan, bringing the total arrested to 15. A 21-year-old was arrested in Paddington, west London, last night, after the arrest of an 18-year-old in Battersea, south London, police said last night.The two take the total of people questioned over the 16-year-old's murder earlier this month to 15. Four men have been charged, eight people have been bailed pending further inquiries, and a further man arrested at the weekend remains in custody after magistrates gave police an extra 24 hours to question him. Mary-Ann was stabbed to death in the early hours of May 7 in a park in the Tilehurst area of Reading, after being abducted the previous evening together with an 18-year-old girlfriend, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Her friend was shot in the head but survived and has been helping police while recovering in hospital. Police also said that Mary-Ann's family had learnt that people had been touring clubs and elsewhere in Reading, claiming to be collecting for her funeral. It was not known if the collectors were genuine or bogus, but those wishing to give should wait for an official channel to be organised.
