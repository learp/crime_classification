The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Friday January 16 2004 In the panel below we listed 20 prisoners thought to be serving whole life tariffs for murder including former IRA prisoner Paul Magee, who was in fact released as part of the Good Friday agreement in 2000. The Home Office refuses to confirm the identity of those on such tariffs, arguing that it is the prerogative of the prisoners and their solicitors whether to make the fact public. Information received since the list was published also suggests that Harry Roberts is in the process of appealing to the parole board.According to the Home Office, 20 prisoners face whole-life tariffs.
