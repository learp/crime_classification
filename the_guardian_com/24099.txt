Police are questioning three people about a suspected grudge arson attack which killed three men at a house used by care in the community services.The victims were named today as Barry Nicholson, 67, who had rented a room at the mid-terrace house in Sheffield for several years, and two more recently arrived residents.They were Kane McTell, 53, who died on the ground floor and Trevor Richardson, 37, who jumped from an upstairs window when the house erupted in flames. A fourth man, who has not been named, is critically ill but stable in hospital in Sheffield.One man was arrested later in the evening, a second on Saturday morning and the third on Saturday night.Detectives believe that petrol or a similar accelerant was used in the house in Albert Street, Heeley, because of the rapid spread of the fire. It started in a downstairs room of the terrace which opens straight on to the pavement but has a narrow back garden where forensic teams carried out a detailed search.Neighbours who were evacuated from their nearby homes said firefighters had warned the house might "explode" because of the intense heat. Police are checking a range of possible motives; it emerged that officers had visited the house earlier that day and the day before.Heeley was the scene of a fatal arson attack which killed three people in December 2005. Anthony Brightmore, 68, his wife Patricia, 65, and their blind son Stephen, 35, died after a blazing rubbish bin was jammed against the door of their home. An arson reduction team set up by South Yorkshire fire and rescue has since won praise, although it has tackled vandalism and dangerous rubbish piles, rather than apparently targeted attacks.Police appealed for more information after sealing off the street for nearly two days. Forensic specialists carried bags of potential evidence away on Sunday while detectives made house-to-house inquiries.The gutted house had regularly changing occupants but neighbours described the road as quiet and were aghast at the tragedy. The alarm was raised by residents in a top flat next door, but the building was well ablaze when fire crews arrived, with flames reaching 30ft above the roof.It took over two hours for 25 firefighters to bring the fire under control. Two of the victims were brought out of the house by crews in breathing apparatus while the two who jumped, one with his clothing on fire, were carried to ambulances.
