The government today unveiled plans to address jurors' misconceptions about rape in the courtroom, in a bid to boost conviction rates.The solicitor general, Vera Baird, said that an expert panel of academics, doctors and judges would meet next month to discuss how to tackle "myths" about rape in an "even-handed and non-partisan" way, with victim responses a particular focus."Juries can think that she will be upset and very emotionally raw when she relives the episode for the court when, in fact, post-traumatic stress makes people seem unemotional and almost matter-of-fact," Baird said."Someone who doesn't know about this thinks the person hasn't been moved and it was not the traumatic experience that it was," she added. But the government paper said there were concerns that a previous proposal to have psychiatrists or other experts give evidence in court about the behaviour of a victim could detract from the core issues of a case. Baird said she hoped to find "a controlled and consistent way" of briefing jurors.Jury members are thought to be sceptical of victims who do not behave as they expect. Fewer than 6% of reported rapes currently result in a conviction, down from 33% in 1977. The solicitor general also said she was concerned that judges were still dismissing rape cases on ground of consent when the complainant was extremely intoxicated by drink or drugs. The court of appeal made a crucial ruling in March that a person may be incapable of consenting to sex when intoxicated even if they are still conscious.But Baird said that the decision was clear and that she did not think a new legal definition of capacity was not necessary at the moment. A spokesman for the attorney general said that judges would receive more guidance on the court of appeal ruling.The government also said it would create legislation to allow people to testify that a rape victim had told them they had been raped, regardless of the length of time passed since the alleged crime took place."Hearsay" evidence such as this is not currently admissible in court.The paper included proposals to help victims in the courts by allowing video statements made by victims soon after an attack to become automatically admissible in court.The victim would still have to appear in court to answer defence questions, and possibly more questions from prosecutors.Katherine Rake, the director of the Fawcett Society, the gender-equality lobby group, said that briefing juries was "necessary" but that the change would not greatly improve the conviction rate. "These changes will not by themselves lead to a significant improvement in the conviction rate as most cases fail long before they get to court," she said. "Responses to allegations of rape need to improve across the whole criminal justice system and wholesale reform is needed to tackle the failures in the investigation and prosecution of rape cases."
