A 63-year-old man who murdered a former police officer and burned his body after becoming obsessed with his wife has been jailed for a minimum of 22 years.Kenneth Bill lured builder John Hay to an industrial unit in Meltham, near Huddersfield, with the promise of work before repeatedly battering him and then disposing of his body on a bonfire.Bill had been having an affair with Hay's wife, Carol, and decided to murder the former traffic officer after she ended their relationship, telling him she would not leave her husband. Bill showed no emotion as he was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 22 years at Bradford crown court.Judge Peter Benson said: "It seems to me that you were obsessed with Mrs Hay and you ruthlessly, in a detailed way, carried out this murder and then ruthlessly and cold-bloodedly disposed of your victim's body."Benson described Hay, 61, as a hard-working family man who was a loving husband, father and grandfather."That man you had never met. He had done you not the slightest scrap of harm," he told Bill."You were so keen to indulge your own emotions that you carried out this wicked murder. Not only did you murder him but by disposing of his body in the cold-hearted way you did, you have robbed his family of the chance of giving him a decent burial."Bill and Carol Hay, 62, had a five-year relationship around 40 years ago and rekindled their affair after getting back in contact in October last year.
