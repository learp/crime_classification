Police carrying out raids in connection with looting during the London riots have recovered cash tills taken from a shop during the disorder.Two cash registers were found by officers on the Denton estate in Camden, north London, on Saturday, along with weapons, car keys, a satnav and a mobile phone, the Metropolitan police said.They said the tills were taken from the Evans Cycle Shop in Chalk Farm Road, which was looted during disorder in Camden last Monday.Officers working as part of Operation Withern also conducted a weapons search in the Queens Crescent area. They discovered 12 knives, metal chains and bars, a hammer and a small amount of what is believed to be class C drugs in flower beds.Seven officers spent 10 hours scouring the area with metal detectors during the search, the Met said.Detective Chief Inspector Eric Phelps, from Camden police, said: "This is an amazing result. Several knives which could have been used as lethal weapons have been taken off the streets, clearly making it safer for everyone."We are now in the process of organising further searches. The next phase will include warrants being sought accordingly, to bring those intent on causing misery and harm to the vast majority of law-abiding citizens to justice."Police have appealed for the owner of a Bulgari ring seized during a raid in Notting Hill, west London, to come forward. The designer jewellery is believed to have been looted as criminals targeted restaurants and pubs during rioting in the area.Ten people were arrested during raids in the area on Sunday, Scotland Yard said.
