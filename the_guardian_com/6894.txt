Primrose Shipman did not say a word when the jury foreman read out the verdicts. She looked up, eyes unblinking, her stern face staring forwards.She had been the epitome of the loyal wife throughout the trial, sitting in the front row of the public gallery in court one of Preston crown court. And at this crucial moment she was not going to betray whatever feelings of torment she has suffered since her husband was arrested. The 52-year-old made it clear then that she would stand by her husband come what may, and she is unlikely to leave him now, especially as his legal team is likely to appeal. Her trademarks, friends say, are calmness and self-assurance. Although she has refused to talk to the press, referring all inquiries about the case to the Medical Defence Union, she chatted with people when she bought coffee at the court kiosk, and handed round chocolates to those sitting beside her. Mrs Shipman's impassive expression changed only once in the minutes after the verdicts - when her mobile phone rang as the judge addressed the jury. The daughter of a council worker from Wetherby in Yorkshire, Primrose Oxtoby married Harold Shipman on November 5 1966, while she was pregnant.She brought up the couple's four children - Sarah, Christopher, David and Sam - and acted as assistant at the surgery in Hyde. Those who know here expect her to return home and continue to fight for her husband.
