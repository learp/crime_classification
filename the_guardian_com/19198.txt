The legal authority for a judge-only trial stems from David Blunkett's 足Criminal Justice Act of 2003 which allows the jury to be dispensed with in serious or complex fraud cases and cases where there is a danger of jury tampering.Passage of the legislation was marked by stormy debates, amid claims of the erosion of the principle of jury trial. It only reached the statute book after ministers agreed to certain safeguards, including that the defence be given an opportunity to make 足representations before a "judge only" direction is given.The Home Office minister involved in the legislation was Baroness 足Scotland QC, who is now the attorney general. A leading critic at the time was Vera Baird QC, who is now the solicitor general. Scotland will now be pressed to explain why 足the safeguards agreed by parliament appear to have been ignored in John Twomey's case.
