More than half of young offenders had been threatened themselves with a gun or knife in the past year and felt that the police were powerless to protect them from violent crime, a study will reveal this week.The research, for the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange, suggests that young offenders are arming themselves with weapons for their own protection. Males aged 10 to 25 are the most likely perpetrators of violent crime, but the most likely victims of violent crime are males aged 16 to 24. Dr Bob Golding, one of the authors of the report, said: 'We are placing a huge reliance on recorded crime, rather than the reality of what is happening in the communities. Our feeling is that far more must be done in preventive work, by identifying children who are at risk of turning to crime later on in life, and working with their families.'
