A man was arrested a short time later on suspicion of murder. A postmortem revealed the cause of death to be drowning."Detective Inspector Jo Miller said the incident, on St Helens Canal, took place while amateur footballers played in an adjacent park. She said: "The area is also popular with joggers and dogwalkers, so we would appeal to anyone who may have been around the park at this time and witnessed an altercation between two men to contact us."The brother of the dead man, Louis Morris, said the family was devastated. He said: "Harry was a normal, lovely guy who loved his fishing. He has been going fishing for 30 years and never missed a competition."
