If the colonel-in chief of the Coldstream Guards was obliged to remind his men not to shoot women and children in the back, or if Ruth Rogers had to tell her River Cafe chefs that cannibalism was a food fad too far (even for west London), you might conclude that both regiment and restaurant were staggering on the edge of barbarism.Martin Narey is director general of a more significant institution - the Prison Service. Last week, Narey felt compelled to explain to staff controlling a disproportionately large number of black inmates that they could not actually be Nazis and expect to enjoy a career in the Home Office. Membership of the British National Party would result in dismissal, he said. 'We have to own up that racism is a big problem for the prison service. This is one of a raft of measures needed to get it right.' A raft will be too small a vessel. Recent years have seen Alton Manning unlawfully killed in Blakenhurst jail and the Prison Service trying to stop an inquest's investigation into his murder or manslaughter. Meanwhile, a culture of 'sustained and promoted overtly racist behaviour' was revealed in Brixton prison. And, at the atrocious Feltham Young Offenders Institution, Zahid Mubarek was banged up with and murdered by Robert Stewart, a deranged bigot who had sent hundreds of letters from prison praising the killers of Stephen Lawrence and predicting the death of his luckless cell mate. There is a quick explanation for the violence - prison officers are attacked everywhere as white, working-class dinosaurs who frustrate the good intentions of their superiors...Yet what is striking about the toleration of the murders - and the suicides and the beatings - in the Prison Service is that the rot starts, and often stops, at the top; it breeds among well-bred politicians and senior civil servants who would be appalled if they were suspected of any bigotry in their private lives. The failed attempt to stop an inquest jury returning a true verdict of unlawful killing after it had heard how Alton Manning was dragged through a private jail by a posse of guards was planned at the highest levels of the Home Office. Mubarek's death was the result of the insouciance of its mandarins. In 1996, they gave themselves the easy target of providing racial and sexual awareness training to all employees by 2000. Result: 19 per cent of managers and 9 per cent of staff have been educated to date. In 1998, the service promised that inmates would not be forced to share a cell unless a rigorous risk-assessment had been completed. (Its incentive was the murder of Christopher Edwards. He was incarcerated with a psychopath who jumped on his face until his skull was so crushed dental records were needed to identify him.) Again, urgency descended into indolence. Paul Boateng, the Prisons Minister, admitted to the Commons this year that risk-assessments had yet to come to Feltham for all the bold commitments. If Whitehall had required officers to understand racism or judge dangers to inmates then Mubarek would not have been confined with Stewart, a man who sang the praises of the Ku Klux Klan. Boateng is the most senior black politician in British history and might be expected to care about such matters. But just as the first Labour Ministers in 1924 displayed a laughable deference to the monarchy and the first woman Prime Minister was, well, Margaret Thatcher, so the highest-flying black Minister is something of a disappointment all round. His career has followed a tired trajectory. He was an ultra-leftist on the Greater London Council in the Seventies who mellowed into a mainstream Kinnockite when the fashion changed. He is now a Third Way hard man, applauded by the Daily Mail for his harshness towards convicts, derision of social workers and love of the sacred vows of marriage. The dilemma such friends bring is made manifest by the deaths in his slum prisons. You cannot keep the patronage of Lord Rothermere and run a civilised justice system. It is simply impossible and only a fool would try. There are many reports that the strain is taking his toll. 'I must have known 35 to 40 Ministers in my time,' one union leader told me, 'and they would all be polite, whatever they thought of you - even Michael Howard. Boateng just yells.' The Prison Governors Association alleges that when it told him sickness levels among senior staff were at record levels as jails tried to cope with an ever-increasing population, Boateng replied: 'If they can't hack it, let's get rid of them.' When Boateng visited Brixton, a woman officer who was white but, along with the majority of staff, was not a racist, complained of years of underinvestment. Boateng bellowed in reply: 'That's exactly what I would expect from someone like you to say. It's people like you who are part of the problem.' She burst into tears. Her union has since complained about Boateng's boorishness. 'Whenever he runs into a problem his only answer is to threaten privatisation,' said Harry Fletcher, of the probation workers' union, Napo. The bombastic style was displayed last week when Boateng had to deal with the Commons Home Affairs Committee report on the disastrous raid on Blantyre House. As this notebook has reported, the prison had the highest success rate for reforming criminals of all jails in the country. It had a liberal regime which prepared inmates for a straight life outside by allowing them to take jobs with charities and Kent employers. Inevitably, its triumphs produced many enemies in the zero-tolerance Home Office. The prison was trashed and governor forced out as 80 officers in full riot gear stormed in. The committee of MPs from all parties vigorously condemned the wreckers. Narey had 'misled' them when he justified the assault by saying 'a quite frightening amount of contraband had been found'. In fact, the 'contraband' was the prisoners' legally held wages, bank cards and tools for charity work. All the prisoners were tested for drugs. Not one sample was positive. Boateng, who had also told MPs about stashes of imaginary contraband, could have admitted his error and promised to reform his department. Instead, as Clare Checksfield from the Prison Service Secretariat revealed, the Home Office decided to bluff it out. A memo to him, passed to me by a helpful mole, suggests he should 'stand by the operational decision' to destroy the governor's career and wreck the jail and say there were no 'grounds for disciplinary action against Prison Service managers'. He did as he was told as he blustered his way round the TV studios on Thursday. There is a price to be paid for his machismo. You may not care greatly about feeble prisoners who are bullied or murdered. But anyone who is genuinely tough on crime, rather than a poseur, should worry that Boateng would rather save his face than save the Blantyre Houses which do what he can never do: protect the public. Â• This week Fraser Kemp, a loyal and sweet-tempered Blairite MP, will propose a modest reform. He will ask Parliament to abolish the British Empire gongs which pepper the biannual honours list. Kemp has two arguments. First, it is no great honour to be acclaimed by an empire which does not exist and, second, he is fed up with his working-class constituents being patronised with the lesser prizes - Member of the British Empire - while the Commanders are always the aristocrats of the bureaucracy. You may believe that this is mere gesture politics, but symbolism matters. Australia displayed an energetic egalitarianism when it renounced MBEs, OBEs and CBEs for the one-size-fits-all Order of Australia. I think I can predict with certainty that his proposal to create an Order of the United Kingdom will be flattened. It is a familiar complaint that the great, modernising Blair Government which promised to democratise the land lost its radicalism with the first whiff of power. Freedom of information has become a bleak joke, the House of Lords remains unelected, local democracy in England is dying... I'm sure you know the litany by now. So comfortable with the status quo has the inner-circle become that many MPs wonder how on earth the Government will fill its days if it wins the next election. Such cynicism is appaling. New Labour has not stood still. It has dropped the task of turning Britain into a democracy for the far more radical undertaking of transforming the country into a corporation. As I noted a few weeks back, the 2,000 punters who have asked to be 'independent' legislators in the Lords will have their applications vetted by a panel chosen by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Government's faith in the accountancy firm too muddled to spell its own name has gone further. Its Executive Resourcing Department has now been asked to find a chairperson and board members for the Committee on Standards in Public Life. The watchdog that guards against conflicts of interest between political parties and public bodies on one hand and commercial interests on the other will be picked by big business's management consultants. If America is a country that was once a democracy and is now run by lawyers, we are a country that was never a democracy and is now run by accountants.
