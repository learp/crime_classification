A judge yesterday called for tougher laws governing illegal motorists after being forced to reduce the sentence on an uninsured driver who ran over and killed a nine-year-old boy.Judge Anthony Thorpe said the public was incredulous at the sentence imposed on Kamel Kadri, whose car collided with Callum Oakford on New Year's Day. Judge Thorpe yesterday cut Kadri's sentence from eight months to six - the maximum for summary motoring offences. On Thursday, Kadri, an Algerian illegal immigrant, was sentenced by Judge Thorpe at Chichester crown court to a total of 24 months in jail, made up of eight months for failing to stop after an accident, driving with no insurance, licence and MoT, and 16 months for using a false passport. The following day, the Crown Prosecution Service said the judge had exceeded his powers on the motoring offences, and that the sentence would have to be cut. The total sentence was cut yesterday to 22 months. Kadri left Callum dying at the side of the A259 in Ferring, West Sussex. He was arrested for causing death by dangerous driving but the CPS later said there was not enough evidence to prosecute him. Judge Thorpe said: "In effect parliament has decided that the result of the accident, which may be a fatality, should be ignored. If the offence of failing to stop after an accident was reclassified as an offence triable either way with a suitable increased maximum penalty, then crown court judges could pass sentences of appropriate length."
