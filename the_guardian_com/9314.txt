Super secure vehicles are defeating car thieves, who now find it almost impossible to break in to a new car, "hot wire" it and drive it away.A convicted car thief attended today's British Insurance Car Security Awards at the Thatcham Research Centre in Berkshire to explain how he was forced to give up and go straight after stealing more than 100 vehicles in south-east London and Kent since 1990."Paul" said: "It just became too hard. Ten or 15 years ago I could break in to a car, attack the electrics to start the engine and then drive it off in under a minute. The immobilisers and alarms got better and better - now it is too difficult to bother."You need to have it towed away - or be in the possession of the key - to steal a new car now," he said.Mike Briggs, vehicle security manager at the Thatchan centre, said: "The theft of new vehicles without the key, or physically towing it away, is near nigh impossible. Now we would like to see further improvements on stopping criminals stealing valuables from vehicles."We are helping manufacturers to continue to make improvements to the security of their vehicles. Manufacturers should be proud of what has been achieved in recent years."Vernon Coaker, Home Office minister, said: "I praise those manufacturers that have made significant improvements to security which has helped see a massive reduction in vehicle crime."Today's awards are an important event that highlight and reward those manufacturers who continue to improve the security of their cars and I congratulate the winners and all those considered for an award."The winner of the most secure car in each category were:City car/supermini: Citroen C3 Exclusive Small family car: Citroen C4 ExclusiveFamily car: Peugeot 407 ExecutiveCompact executive car: Lexus ISCompact MPV: Mazda 5Large MPV: Renault Espace Convertible/roadster: Volvo C70 Performance car: Peugeot 407 Coupe Compact 4x4: Nissan X-Trail Large 4x4: Volkswagen Touareg Executive car: Audi A6 saloon Luxury Car: Mercedes-Benz S-Class Manufacturer: Audi
