HMV have announced that they will no longer sell releases by Lostprophets. The high-street retailer has vowed to remove the band's past music from all 140 of their stores after frontman Ian Watkins admitted to 11 sex abuse charges, including the attempted rape of a baby.Speaking to NME, a spokesperson for HMV confirmed that their staff have been instructed to remove all Lostprophets albums, singles and EPs from their shelves. Although the Welsh group's music is still available via the HMV website, the company apparently plans to end online sales.HMV's decision reflects the gravity of Watkins' crimes. It is unusual for a major retailer to entirely remove an artist's catalogue, even after a major conviction: HMV continue to sell records by Gary Glitter, Burzum and Charles Manson. At the time of writing, other major retailers, including Amazon and the iTunes Music Store, continue to sell Lostprophets albums.Lostprophets released five albums, including four top ten hits, before announcing their split last month. Following Watkins' arrest, the remaining five members said they could "no longer continue making or performing music as Lostprophets". "We look forward to the next phase of our lives." They have not responded to HMV's announcement.
