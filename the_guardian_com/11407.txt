According to locals, Brian Hagan's pigs were causing havoc in his home village of Briston, Norfolk. It was claimed that the farmer's animals were constantly escaping, chasing residents and digging up people's gardens.'There was a clear problem of these pigs running loose over the village and an irresponsible landowner who couldn't care less and was doing nothing to help,' said Norman Lamb, the local MP. 'We looked at all the ways to resolve it, but eventually started thinking about Asbos.''I tried to stop the pigs, but they just kept getting out under the electric fences,' said Hagan. He was subjected to an Asbo because of the antisocial behaviour of his 100 pigs and six geese. In December he was instructed to keep them under control or face up to five years in prison, leading critics to compain that his case was an example of the definition of antisocial behaviour being too broad. 'I thought Asbos were meant to be used on hooligans,' said Hagan, 63. Then, the morning after the Asbo was imposed, a neighbour noticed that some of the offending pigs had escaped, and by 8.30am Hagan had been arrested for breaching his order. 'They never gave me a chance to put the fencing up,' he said. 'I was treated like a criminal. They took me to the police station, searched me and put me in a cell for three hours.' Hagan went to court and pleaded not guilty, and the case collapsed. 'It probably cost thousands,' he said. 'A waste of public money.' Hagan returned to his farm and put up a 'stop fence' that 'cost no end of money' but succeeded in keeping the pigs in. As such, said Lamb, the Asbo did help solve the village's problem. 'At least it brought it to a head,' he said.
