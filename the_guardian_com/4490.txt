Motorists who cause death on the roads could avoid jail under draft sentencing guidelines published today.A committee headed by the most senior judge in England and Wales - Lord Phillips, the lord chief justice - has proposed a new schedule of punishments for drivers convicted of the new offence of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.Even in cases of medium seriousness, judges should be able to impose a community order, the Sentencing Guidelines Council said.Cases leading to death after a driver's "momentary inattention" could even be dealt with by low-level community order, the council said.The normal maximum sentence for causing death by careless driving should be three years in jail, the council said, even though the maximum allowed under the law is five years.The new category of offence has not yet been introduced.Today's consultation paper said: "Where the level of carelessness is low and there are no aggravating factors, even the fact that death was caused is not sufficient to justify a prison sentence."It proposes new sentencing structures for the offences of causing death by dangerous driving, by being under the influence of drink or drugs, or by driving illegally.For dangerous driving, the council said the most serious offenders should receive between seven and 14 years in prison.Angela Smith, 47, whose son Kyle, 16, was killed in a car crash in 2005, said today: "Death-crash legislation should be seen as a deterrent, not a soft option."The 19-year-old driver in my son's crash was banned for two and a half years and fined Â£1,000."People who cause death on the roads should never drive again. They should have to live with what they have done for the rest of their lives."The council has proposed that uninsured or unlicensed drivers who kill on the roads escape a jail term if there are no aggravating factors, or a single aggravating factor. Jail would be avoided even if the offender had previous motoring convictions or more than one person died.Disqualified drivers who kill on the roads would face between 36 weeks' and two years' jail, as would uninsured or unlicensed drivers who killed in cases with two or more aggravating factors.Research conducted for the SGC found that in a poll of 1,031 people the two-year maximum jail term for this offence was "generally seen as far too low".SGC member and chief executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency, Peter Neyroud, said: "I don't know whether that will be looked at again."As this is a new offence, I think the sensible thing to do is to allow it to come in and the criminal justice system and the SGC to review where we have got to after a period of time."It would be premature to start reviewing a tariff before we have started operating the offence."He said there should be a distinction between an offender who had forgotten to renew their car insurance and someone who persistently drove uninsured."If you are talking about drivers who drive uninsured and without a licence, they tend to be the more difficult offenders," he said."They will rapidly move up the tariff and their previous offending record will also take them into the higher tariff."Today's document - which will now go to the justice secretary, Jack Straw, and MPs for consultation - also suggests how the courts should treat drivers who kill because they have been distracted by a mobile phone, lighting a cigarette, reading a map, adjusting the car radio or setting satellite navigation equipment.It is suggested that reading or composing text messages at the wheel should lead to killer drivers facing more serious punishment than making a phone call. Texting while driving "over a period of time" should lead to a jail term of between four and seven years' imprisonment if someone was killed, with the same range of punishment imposed on speeding drivers or those racing other cars on the roads, the council said.Between two and five years' imprisonment should be imposed on motorists who drive while "avoidably distracted" - which the document said could include briefly reading a text message, adjusting a hands-free mobile, map reading or operating other in-car equipment. Such offences would normally be prosecuted as causing death by dangerous driving, the paper said.The worst examples, carrying a punishment of between seven and 14 years' imprisonment, would include cases of a "prolonged, persistent and deliberate course of very bad driving", or where substantial amounts of drink or drugs had been consumed.
