A 21-year-old man has been arrested after a white teenager was chased and assaulted by a group of young Asian men, in what police have described as a hate crime.Dan Stringer-Prince and his friend Kevan Brown, both 17, were walking past a takeaway in Hyde, Greater Manchester, on Saturday night when one of the Asian men inside the shop produced a knife and made a threatening gesture towards the pair, before the men gave chase.Stringer-Prince fell to the ground and suffered a fractured skull and two broken eye sockets in the attack, and will need a metal plate in his right cheek. He has been released from hospital following treatment.Greater Manchester police said a 21-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of a section 18 assault. He remains in custody for questioning.Detective Inspector Dave Moores, of Tameside CID, said: "The community in the Hyde area is in shock at what has happened and thanks to information that they have passed to us, we have arrested a man in relation to this incident."Attacks such as this are extremely rare in Hyde and we have a team of officers who are continuing to investigate this crime to establish the circumstances leading up to it, and identify all of those who were involved."He said police were looking into reports that a number of youths were throwing snowballs in the area shortly before the attack. He added: "I would like to thank the community for their support so far and would urge anyone else who has information in relation to this incident to come forward."Police said about seven or eight men in their late teens or early 20s were involved in the attack. Three girls are believed to have been with the group but were not involved in the attack.In an interview, Stringer-Prince said: "One of them grabbed me, so I grabbed him back. He hit me in the face and that's about all I can remember." He said the next thing he could recall was Brown assuring him he was all right.His mother, Cheryl Stringer, described the attackers as "evil thugs who picked on two innocent lads". She said her son would need to see a specialist to assess the damage to his right eye. "Thankfully, he is able to open his left one a little," she said.
