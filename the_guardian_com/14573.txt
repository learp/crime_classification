Nine men, a woman, and two teenagers face possible jail sentences after pleading guilty to affray in Oldham, Lancashire, two years ago.But the judge at Manchester Minshull crown court yesterday told the jury he would direct them to acquit them of a charge of rioting, because the five week trial had presented insufficient evidence to convict. They will be sentenced next month. They took part in violence that led to three nights of serious street disturbances. The trial heard that gangs had sat outside pubs chanting slogans like "If you all hate Pakis, clap your hands" and "Keep me English", and anti-IRA slogans. Police filmed a group singing "Keep St George in My Heart". A man nicknamed "The General" had "given the nod" to members of the group, the prosecution alleged, and they took taxis to Oldham's Roundthorn area to attack and abuse local Asians. Two admitting affray were from outside Oldham: Mark Priestley, 32, of Glossop, and Paul Brockway, 39, of Manchester. The others were Sharon Hoy, 38, Darren Hoy, 27, James Clift, 24, Alan Daley, 38, Matthew Berry, 25, David Bourne, 35, Steven Rhodes, 30, Stephen Walsh, 22, and two teenagers.
