A former Bay City Roller accused of conspiring to supply cocaine told jurors today that he was a user of the drug, but not a dealer.Singer Les McKeown, 50, of Hackney, east London, told Basildon crown court he had not been involved in any agreement to supply or deal in cocaine. Mr McKeown and the band's former guitarist, 47-year-old Patrick McGlynn, of Liberton Brae, Edinburgh, along with financial systems analyst Alistair Murray, 36, of Somerset Place, Edinburgh, deny conspiracy to supply cocaine.Jurors were told Mr McGlynn, Mr Murray and Tony Burt, a car dealer of Woodford, Essex, were arrested in a hotel car park in nearby Waltham Abbey in May last year. Detectives and customs officers found more than £16,000 in folded bundles of notes in a washbag in Mr McGlynn and Mr Murray's black Renault Clio, and a CD with a line of cocaine on it. In another car, in which Mr Burt was sitting, police found £16,000 of 80% pure cocaine. The drug would have had a street value of around £50,000 once processed, jurors were told. Mr Burt had admitted conspiring to supply cocaine, jurors heard, and prosecutors alleged Mr McKeown had arranged the deal. The court was told that Mr McKeown, Mr McGlynn and Mr Burt contacted each other by mobile phone more than 30 times on the day police swooped.However, Mr McKeown told jurors he believed the former Bay City Rollers guitarist was meeting Mr Burt in order to buy a car. He said he had put the two men in touch and contacted them by phone in order to give Mr McGlynn directions to the hotel, discuss music with him and let Mr Burt know his former bandmate was running late. Mr McKeown denied having "anything to do with supplying cocaine" and added: "I have taken it - maybe two or three times a year." Jurors were told that Mr McKeown had a small amount of cocaine wrapped in a till receipt in his wallet and a small piece of the anti-impotence drug Viagra when he was arrested in June. The hearing continues.
