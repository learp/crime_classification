New measures to strengthen the government's controversial antisocial behaviour orders were announced today.The news came as Home Office figures showed that the number of antisocial behaviour orders handed out had doubled year-on-year.From the end of this week, the new measures mean that witnesses in Asbo cases will be able to give evidence from behind screens or by video link, and reporting restrictions on culprits who breach the terms of their orders will be eased.The Home Office minister Hazel Blears hailed the orders as a way of "bringing the selfish minority to task", and said witness protection measures would help victims to come forward to give evidence.From Friday, measures in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 to give extra protection to vulnerable witnesses in Asbo cases will come into force.The witnesses will become eligible for so-called "special measures" in court, allowing them to give evidence from behind screens or by video links, while the lifting of automatic reporting restrictions will enable local media to give details of people who breach their Asbos.Funding for individual support orders for young people between the ages of 10 and 17 - which can be attached to Asbos to combat the causes of their behaviour - will be increased by £500,000. Today's Home Office figures revealed that 823 Asbos had been handed out in the final three months of last year - more than double the 364 given out in the same period of 2003.A total of 4,649 Asbos were handed out by courts in England and Wales by the end of December 2004, compared with 3,826 at the end of September. The figure included 2,057 imposed on children aged between 10 and 17.Over the entire year, Greater Manchester had the highest number of Asbos (710), followed by London (448), West Yorkshire (361) and the West Midlands (342). Today's data did not include details of how many Asbos had been breached."What these figures don't show are that 40% of Asbos are broken. Victims of crime and antisocial behaviour deserve policies which offer long-term solutions, not quick fixes," the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said."Asbos are an important tool in cutting crime and tackling antisocial behaviour, but they can only be truly effective if they are matched by long-term measures to change behaviour and stop re-offending.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, today described the orders as "a sticking plaster over an amputation". "The government should pursue alternative punishments to custody for breaching an Asbo, such as reparation orders for parents or taking away a driving licence to address the appalling failure rates that undermine the whole scheme," he said.Although the types of behaviour banned by an Asbo are not usually illegal in themselves, breaching an order is a criminal offence and can lead to five years in prison a fine of up to £5,000. "The statistics published today show that local authorities are responding enthusiastically to the powers available to them," Ms Blears said.She said that when an Asbo was breached, it was important "that it is reported, the court take it seriously and there is a sanction". However, Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo, warned that the orders were being misused. "There is now overwhelming evidence that Asbos are being used inappropriately in many parts of the country," he said. "Asbos are being used against people who are mentally ill, against children with autism and on individuals like beggars and prostitutes, whose behaviour is not criminal. The doubling of the number of Asbos made is deeply worrying."
