Two parents were jailed today for a total of 22 years for physical abuse of their disabled three-year-old daughter that included kicking her "like a football".The case has alarming echoes of the death of Victoria Climbie, and there have been calls for an independent inquiry into Westminster council's handling of it.A 53-page "serious case review" by the authority's Local Safeguarding Children Board has acknowledged that failures occurred.The girl's mother, Kimberly Harte, 23, was jailed for 11 and a half years at London's Middlesex Guildhall crown court, where the judge said the abuse had amounted to torture.Samuel Duncan, 27, the girl's father and Harte's partner, was jailed for 10 and a half years for his part in the "systematic abuse", which left his daughter "scarred for life".The girl, known in court only as Child B, had boiling water poured over her hands and large clumps of hair ripped from her scalp. She was kicked repeatedly in the groin, locked naked in the toilet each night and forced to eat her own faeces.The violence against the girl, who has cerebral palsy, began a few weeks after she was returned to the couple after being temporarily taken into the care of social services following domestic violence between her parents. She was returned to the couple even though her foster carers had voiced concerns.The court heard the youngster was regularly left in terrible pain until her grandmother began to suspect she was being abused and called in social services and the police.When social services intervened at that stage, the girl had such "horrific injuries", the court heard, that she would almost certainly have died without treatment. After she was rescued, the child was in such pain that she had to be examined under general anaesthetic.Duncan and Harte, of Maida Vale, west London, first admitted three counts of child cruelty late last year on the basis that they failed to seek medical treatment for their daughter.Then, after blaming each other for their daughter's injuries, Harte was unanimously convicted of three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent between February 1 and March 18 last year; Duncan, a chef, was convicted of two counts of the same offence.Judge Paul Worsley QC told the pair today: "You stand convicted by the jury of repeatedly injuring your child ... That child was loving and affectionate. That child had cerebral palsy. That child was your daughter."You harmed her in ways which, in my judgment, amount to torture of that little girl. Your responsibility as parents was to protect, not harm her."The judge said the case had been made worse by the fact both knew they were "under the eye of social services and had every reason to show more, not less, affection to that little girl".However, within four weeks of having been returned to them and "entrusted" into their care, Duncan broke her arm.The court heard Harte had deceived medical staff by claiming that her arm had been broken in an accident. Later, however, she said Duncan was to blame.Running through their offences, the judge continued: "On count two: you, Duncan, and you, Harte, scalped her."On count three: you, Duncan, and you, Harte, kicked her like a football so repeatedly and so severely in the groin that she had appalling bruising, internal bleeding, permanent liver damage."On count one: you, Harte, took her little hands and held them under the hot tap as you poured scalding water over them."Each of those injuries must have caused her excruciating pain and she must have shown her terror and agony at the time. And, having witnessed that agony, both of you failed to secure for her the medical attention she so desperately needed."You failed to do so because, in my judgment, you feared discovery."
