Immigration officials have arrested the suspected ringleader of a gang behind what they believe was the UK's biggest sham marriage racket, it emerged today.Wedding ceremonies at Wandsworth register office, south-west London, were this weekend interrupted by immigration officers, leading to the arrest of the suspected ringleader and a couple taking part in a wedding. The gang is believed to have arranged up to 300 ceremonies, charging would-be husbands £10,000 to find a bride who could enable them to stay in the UK."We can confirm that, following reports from intelligence sources, the immigration service disrupted a number of weddings at a register office in south-west London this weekend," a Home Office spokesman said."As a result of this enforcement action, a man believed to have been involved in the facilitation of numerous sham marriages in the UK was arrested by the immigration service at an address in east London on Saturday."Subsequent action in London and the surrounding area on Sunday and Monday led to the arrest of a further four individuals in connection with taking part in, or the facilitation of, suspect marriages. Inquiries are ongoing and we cannot comment further at this stage," the spokesman added.The scam is understood to have involved flying women from the Netherlands - who claimed to be working in the UK - into Britain to marry west African men. The women were paid between £1,000 and £2,000 to take part in the marriages. Foreign nationals who are married to EU citizens working in the UK are currently entitled to remain here without showing an intention to live together.Immigration officials became suspicious after noticing a pattern of women flying on single airline tickets from the Netherlands. They initially believed the women were drugs mules, but further investigations unearthed the marriage scam.The home secretary, David Blunkett, today welcomed the arrests. "These operations are testament to the enormous effort and hard work by the immigration service to protect the UK's immigration and marriage laws from abuse by determined criminals," he said.With the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, today calling for a limit to be set on immigration, the Home Office said it remained determined to protect the UK's immigration system and marriage laws from abuse. A spokesman said the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004, to be implemented this week, contained new measures designed to combat suspicious marriages."The legislation will require non-European economic area foreign nationals who wish to marry to produce a certificate of approval or proof of entry clearance as a spouse or marriage tourist, and give notice of intended marriage at a designated register office," he said.The immigration service is already working alongside registrars to target sham marriages. Home Office officials are to explore the possibility of giving registrars the power to refuse to carry out a marriage they suspect is being carried out for the purposes of illegal immigration, or with the use of false documents.
