Local communities are to be given new "people power orders" under Home Office plans to tackle antisocial behaviour which will be announced later today.The plan, part of a new "community-focused" approach to justice, will provide residents with incentives to combat local tearaways and nuisance neighbours.Under the Home Office's five-year plan, the details of which will be unveiled later today by the home secretary, David Blunkett, new neighbourhood action teams will be set up to take a proactive role in fighting low-level crime in their patch.They will have the power to trigger imposition curfews, antisocial behaviour orders and to set the priorities for local policing.The teams will also be given targets for reducing crime in their areas. The move is designed to help cut offending by 15% by 2008. The government's 'trailblazer' programme, which is conducting research into tackling antisocial behaviour in run-down areas, will also be expanded from 10 to 50 neighbourhoods. As part of the package, a Â£36m witness care unit will be set up to offer support to witnesses and victims of crime, and designed to encourage more people to come forward with information. A dedicated witness officer will also appointed in every court.Previewing the plan, Mr Blunkett said: "If we can give power to local people to trigger these interventions when nothing is happening we will not only get respect, will get morale back and build confidence in these communities."Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, the home secretary said: "I want to empower people to be able firstly to ask for information, second to meet, and third to act."
