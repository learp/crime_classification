A £10m architectural centre dedicated to the memory of the murdered student Stephen Lawrence remains unrepaired a year after it was extensively vandalised.Centre bosses blame the recession for the failure to raise £160,000 to install additional security before eight windows designed by the Turner prizewinning artist Chris Ofili are replaced.Vandals targeted the Stephen Lawrence centre, in Deptford, south London, on St Valentine's day last year, a week after it opened to the public, causing £70,000 of damage.The centre's insurers are refusing to cover the replacement glass unless a near-invisible polycarbonate protective screen is installed in front of the five-metre (16ft) high windows."It is Chris Ofili's largest work of public art. It is a massive piece of public art," said Karin Woodley, the chief executive. "The recession has affected our income-generation programme to the tune of about one-third of our budget."She said the centre faced a £500,000 shortfall in this year's £1.6m budget as private sponsors, many of whom operate in the building industry, have been hit by the economic climate.The centre, which aims to offer thousands of young people from deprived backgrounds the chance to begin careers in architecture, urban design and building, is searching for alternative funding.Woodley is considering approaching private art collectors and raising revenue from opening the building, designed by David Adjaye, for conference or other events.Stephen, 18, who wanted to be an architect, was stabbed to death in an unprovoked racist attack by a gang at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.The failure of the Metropolitan police to bring his killers to justice led to the Macpherson inquiry, which found the force to be institutionally racist in a report published in February 1999.Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man, all from south-east London, were arrested in connection with the vandalism of the centre, but proceedings were halted due to a lack of evidence. A Met police spokeswoman said the inquiry was ongoing.More than 5,000 children and young adults have attended courses at the centre since last April.In 1999 Stephen's memorial plaque was defiled by paint. It was attacked again the following year, despite 24-hour camera surveillance.
