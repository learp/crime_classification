A police officer is facing jail after admitting that he lied about witnessing the Plebgate row that triggered the resignation of the former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell.Constable Keith Wallis, 53, pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office at the Old Bailey .Wallis falsely claimed in an email to his MP, the Conservative deputy chief whip John Randall, that he had witnessed a confrontation between the then chief whip Mitchell and diplomatic protection officers at the gates of Downing Street on 19 September 2012.David Cameron issued a strongly worded statement as MPs from across the Commons called for Mitchell to be brought back to the cabinet. The prime minister said: "It is completely unacceptable for a serving police officer to falsify an account of any incident. Andrew Mitchell has consistently denied the version of events presented in the email and I welcome the fact that the officer concerned has now pleaded guilty."Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, tweeted: "Delighted Andrew Mitchell vindicated after long and tough time fighting against system. Must never again – to cab minister or anyone."In the email, Wallis purported to be a member of the public and arranged for his nephew to support the false claim that he saw the row in which Mitchell was alleged to have used the word "pleb". In fact, he was not at Downing Street or at work that day.Wallis sat in the dock of the oak-panelled court for a short hearing and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth, before pleading guilty. Asked by the court clerk for his plea, Wallis stood and answered: "Guilty, your honour."Wallis, a former diplomatic protection officer, could be jailed when he is sentenced on 6 February. He is the only police officer to have faced criminal charges over the Plebgate incident, which prompted a huge row and resulted in Mitchell's losing his role in David Cameron's cabinet.A further seven Metropolitan police officers are facing disciplinary action over the affair, including four who will be subject to gross misconduct hearings in March over claims that they leaked information to the media.Mitchell, MP for Sutton Coldfield, welcomed the guilty plea and pledged to continue the fight to clear his name. "It is very sad and worrying for all of us that a serving police officer should have behaved in this way," he said. "There remain many questions unanswered, in particular why PC Wallis wrote this email and who else was involved in this process. I am looking forward to seeing justice done in the up to 10 other related disciplinary cases involving police officers so that I can focus all my energy on delivering for my constituents and help David Cameron win a Conservative majority at the 2015 election."Wallis's barrister, Patrick Gibbs QC, told Mr Justice Sweeney at the Old Bailey that the officer had offered his resignation to the Metropolitan police and pleaded guilty "at the first opportunity" in court.Gibbs said that to understand the plea it was important to take into account the psychiatric state Wallis "is in now and has been in for many months" as well as his state of mind at the time he sent the email.The row erupted when Mitchell became involved in a heated confrontation with another officer, Toby Rowland, after he was refused permission to cycle through the main gate of Downing Street. Mitchell admitted swearing but has strenuously denied Rowland's claim that he used the word "pleb".Immediately after the guilty plea, Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe issued his first personal apology to Mitchell. Hogan-Howe said the Plebgate investigation had exposed evidence that damaged public trust in the police force and that a number of other officers still had "very important questions to answer"."I expect my officers to serve the public without fear or favour. Where officers break the law they must expect to be held to account and answer for what they have done."Tory MP Richard Ottaway and prominent Labour MP Tom Watson were among those calling on Cameron to invite Mitchell back into the government, while home affairs select committee chair Keith Vaz said the plea appeared to be a complete vindication of the former cabinet minister's reputation."Now is the time to turn the page on this whole unfortunate incident, which took only 45 seconds, but has cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds, Mr Mitchell his job and damaged the reputation of the police," Vaz said.Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the case risked casting a shadow over the excellent work of police officers every day. She added: "Democracy depends on the idea that everyone can rely on the police to treat them with honesty and fairness, without fear or favour – from cabinet ministers to teenagers in the street or victims of crime."As the Stevens commission made clear, we need new reforms to keep raising standards in policing, to make sure there is swift action when policing goes wrong, to ensure that unethical or criminal behaviour by individual officers is caught and stopped – and to make sure it doesn't taint the vital work the rest of the police do each day."Sweeney released Wallis on bail, saying: "In granting your bail, I am giving you no indication whatsoever as to what the eventual sentence will be."Scotland Yard said that Wallis would face a misconduct hearing at the conclusion of the legal proceedings.
