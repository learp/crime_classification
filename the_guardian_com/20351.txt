Aminah Carter, 15 If a kid's parents are debating with their friends and they talk about 'big lips and chicken' stereotypes of black people, then the kid picks up on it and when they get to school they use the same thing. I've even had a teacher who cracked a racist joke about French people. I didn't laugh but everyone else did.  Darell Philip, 17 About four or five years ago I was walking down the street to the post office to get some money. There was this police van going around and around. There was a white policewoman and a black policeman. They were looking at me. They both jumped out of the van to stop me. I was wearing a ripped jacket and I was pushing up my sleeve. They said, 'what were you doing with your hand?' They asked me to take off my coat and looked at it. They took my post office book. I was going there for my mum. They said, 'where are your friends?' I asked what they were talking about. They just jumped back in the van and that was it. I think maybe it was racism. They were looking for a black person. They never said sorry or nothing. My mum made a phone call to the police to say what had happened. They were meant to come to see us but they didn't. They weren't really interested. I forgot to take their number at the time because I was intimidated. Jay Servin, 18 I've had several run-ins with the police. I was called 'nigger' by officers up in Richmond. I didn't feel anything. I was shocked. Another time, me and my cousin were stopped by two police officers. They asked us what our relationship was with each other. We said we were cousins. One said to the other, 'didn't you know they're all cousins?'. Then we gave bad abuse back. We retaliated badly. They said they'd nick us for swearing but we just walked off. Policemen are cocky and arrogant. I think they were bullied in school because they don't care what they say, they are going to do it their way. They pick on you because you remind them of someone who picked on them in school. I'm not hopeful about the future. Carlene Thomas-Bailey, 14 In 1976 the Race Relations Act came out. That was ages ago, but even now as you walk down the street, people still judge you for your colour. Being so small-minded is defying the whole course of the act. It's important to see colour but to respect it. We can live in peace but when you cuss what people believe in or their religion, you're stepping over the mark. Like when my mum's friend said, 'I don't like black people, but I like you'. You've got to be aware of the racism. There's certain things you don't say. When I went to the Trinidad carnival, I travelled back with a black male friend and my family. When we got into London, everyone was let through but he got stopped and searched because they thought he had illegal substances. It was such a bad end to the holiday. My dad also got stopped because of the colour of his skin. This means something to you, it's not just a petty thing. When we came out of the airport it really hit me. Mehrak Golestani, 15 When you hear in the news about any trouble, it's always: 'he was a member of an Asian street gang'. A group of white people hanging out together doesn't constitute a gang but with blacks and Asians it does. When you're describing someone, a lot of people fail to mention that someone's white but they have to mention they're black. My friend was walking home from school on his own. He noticed that two men were following him. He knew they didn't live there but he didn't want to be too suspicious for no reason. He went into his house and they came up to the same floor and knocked at the door. They were policemen. They said someone had robbed the off-licence. The police didn't arrest him, they just said they wanted him to come with them. He asked why and they said he fitted the description. He asked what it was and they said 'an Asian youth'. He said 'what if I don't come?', and they said they would arrest him on suspicion. His mum wasn't there, he was on his own so he went with them to the shop. The shopkeeper said it wasn't him but the police didn't say sorry or offer to take him back. Daniel Blackwood, 17 There's a fruit stall on the end of my road and they are so blatantly racist. When they see me walk past they say, 'are you off with the rest of the brothers, going to rape someone?'. When you go into a shop, security guards will always give you a look. I've walked in to a shop and felt like I'm being watched. You see the guy following you around. Young black boys are watched a lot. You want to walk in the shop and feel free. Police are there to do their job - but they are doing it wrong. Stopping and searching young ethnic youths is causing us distress. It's annoying, but the police don't seem to care. They need to think of a new way to sort out their stop and search policy. Senab Adekunle, 16  You believe a bus conductor when he says the bus is too full. But I remember a time when all my family were waiting to get on this bus and the conductor said there was no space. Then he let all these white people on. There were only four of us and about seven of them. We were left out in the cold. There were hardly any black people on that bus. My whole family just flipped. Policemen are always sarcastic, feisty, usually ugly. They always look like they own everywhere, like they have the right to ask you what you've been doing since you were born. I hate policeman. The more mature ones listen, but the younger ones think they can treat you like shit. Amina Kibria, 17On programmes like 'The Bill' they have two Asian police women, but I've never seen an Asian police woman. It brings that question, is there something holding them back, or is it their colour? You start to wonder. Before the Stephen Lawrence thing, I never really wondered what colour police were. Then you suddenly realise they are all white. Now, every time you see a police person you wonder whether they're racist or not, whether you can trust them or not.Â• Children's Express is a programme of learning through journalism for children aged eight to 18.
