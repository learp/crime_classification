There is something suitably Orwellian about the discovery that Maya Evans, who was convicted this week of standing in Whitehall and reading out the names of British soldiers who have died in Iraq since 2003, committed her so-called offence under something called the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The less alarming truth, as it turns out, is that this clumsily titled law is a Home Office omnium gatherum, covering everything from the setting up of the Serious Organised Crime Agency to the policing of the Royal Parks. Nevertheless, sections 132-138 do indeed reimpose strict regulations over "demonstrations in the vicinity of parliament" and it is under these provisions that Ms Evans was convicted by Bow Street magistrates this week (she was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay Â£100 costs).It should be admitted that laws restricting demonstrations in the vicinity of parliament are neither new nor unnecessary in all circumstances. But the use of this law in this way is a tyranny and an ass. Yes, there's a case for saying that Ms Evans should have given notice of what she did, but hers was hardly a demonstration in the normal meaning of the term. And anyway, what if it was? What she did falls so clearly within the right of free speech as most reasonable people would understand it that to prosecute her was silly and shameful. "I don't think it's a criminal offence and I don't think I should have been arrested," Ms Evans told the magistrates this week. We agree.
