A police officer who came under machine-gun fire in east London has urged the Metropolitan commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to arm all specialist units.Constable Jason Murphy was one of six officers caught up in a drive-by shooting in Leytonstone in January. His female colleague, who was in a police van at the time, was wounded in the shoulder, but her body armour deflected the bullet, saving her from more serious injury or death. PC Murphy and four other officers were outside the vehicle which was riddled with bullets from a machine gun. Yesterday, he used the open forum of the Metropolitan Police Federation conference to raise the controversial issue of arming more police with his Scotland Yard boss. "I have been a police officer for 12 years, and for 10 of them I would not have thought I needed to be armed," he told the Guardian. "But for the past two years, on duty in Hackney, Waltham Forest, Newham and Tower Hamlets, I and my colleagues regularly encounter people with guns and knives. "Although I'm back at work now, I don't feel safe with the equipment we have, which is just handcuffs, a baton and CS gas ... I don't think all officers should be armed but there is a good case for arming specialist units, such as the territorial support groups ... in the front line against violent crime." Sir John said: "Full arming of the police is something officers don't want, either in the Met or nationally, and it's something we've got to be very cautious about as it would take us away from the British way of policing, which is policing by consent. But if individual officers need more protection then that is something we have to respond to." Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, agreed that most officers did not want to be armed, but said that most would accept being armed if they thought it was necessary. But he warned: "Many officers who have shot someone have told me sometimes they wish someone had shot them, rather than what they're going through."
