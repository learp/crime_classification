Almost 50,000 Londoners are addicted to crack cocaine, according to research published yesterday.The estimate suggests that 46,000 15 to 44-year-olds in the capital are injecting or smoking the drug. That amounts to more than 1% of the age group. Previous estimates had put the level of addiction at almost a quarter that number.The re-evaluation of the prevalence of crack addiction in London carries serious implications for crime and health. Offenders are known to spend as much as Â£500 a week on the habit, while in some police stations up to one in five arrests are said to relate to crack use.There are also increased risks among users of psychiatric problems, such as paranoia and depression, and links to violent behaviour.Injecting the drug exposes users to the threat of blood-borne infections such as HIV and hepatitis C. An estimated three in five users also take opiates such as heroin, according to the authors of a report published online by the Society for the Study of Addiction.The figures, from researchers at Imperial College London and Bristol University, are far higher than previously suggested. The 2001-02 British Crime Survey, based on 40,000 interviews, concluded that there were 13,600 users in London, 0.3% of the relevant population, and 58,000 (0.2%) in England and Wales.In the new research, figures were compiled from several sources for 12 London boroughs, including the numbers of people in specialist drug treatment, those arrested or using accident and emergency services and population surveys.The researchers also sought to assess the scale of the problem among drug users who inject. They multiplied the figures to cover the whole capital, suggesting 1.3% of the age group used crack, although the problem was twice as bad in the inner city as in outer London.Matthew Hickman of Imperial College London said: "Although crack cocaine has been a cause of concern in many countries since the 1980s, there has not been the predicted epidemic across the UK until now.""We must be cautious but the analysis suggests there is a substantial problem."He warned against extrapolating the findings of the new research to apply across Britain. Different cities had different profiles of drug taking. Bristol, for instance, had significant levels of crack cocaine use whereas Middlesbrough - where there were a large number of heroin users - did not appear to have a widespread crack problem.Martin Barnes, the chief executive of the charity DrugScope, also advised that the latest estimates should be interpreted with caution, but said the evidence of a greater crack problem in London than compared with the national picture supported the experience of some local communities and drug agencies."Since the survey was carried out, there has been a significant increase in the number of people accessing drug treatment services, and more problem drug users are being identified through drug testing on arrest and arrest referral [to specialist services]," he said."Crack use and dealing can be localised in poorer, more deprived communities and general drug use overall is higher among younger people. Because of the drug's potency there is a greater link with criminal behaviour than other class A drugs, but thankfully we do not have the levels of use or crime seen in the United States."Mr Barnes said there was no hard and fast evidence that he was aware of to suggest that there had been a significant increase in crack cocaine use since the 2000-2001 period.The police had been given significant powers to close down crack houses and this was also likely to be a catalyst for getting more people into treatment for crack addiction.The Home Office said: "We do not consider there has been a fourfold increase in crack cocaine use."The latest British Crime Survey figures for 2003 to 2004 provide a long-term picture of drug use trends and show that class A drug use among young people is stable and that the numbers that have ever taken class A drugs have fallen by some 24% since 1998."
