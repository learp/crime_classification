The education secretary, Alan Johnson, today unveiled a new initiative to cut crime by getting offenders into training and jobs.In a speech at a government conference in London, Mr Johnson announced Â£500,000 funding for pilot schemes in two regions to drive forward ambitious reforms to improve offenders' skills and job prospects to stop them reoffending.Mr Johnson said punishing offenders and protecting the public were the primary aims of the criminal justice system, but rehabilitation was also vital.Under the proposals, more help will be given to offenders who show they are prepared to take action to turn away from crime, and employers will be encouraged to start offender job schemes.Launching the action plan, Mr Johnson said: "Repeat offending carries an enormous cost, socially as well as economically. Skills and employment programmes can turn offenders away from crime and into meaningful work, encouraging them to lead productive lives in their communities."At the heart of our reform is the need to tackle the obstacles of low skills and lack of employment opportunities that prevent offenders living crime-free lives. By joining up training and labour market needs more closely, we can create a win-win situation for employers and offenders while also protecting the public by cutting crime."Baroness Scotland, minister of state for criminal justice and offender management, said: "Our first duty is to protect the public, reduce crime and protect victims. In order to do this, we have to reduce the level of offending and reoffending in smarter and innovative ways."This document builds on the cross-government work on education, training and the Reducing Re-offending Pathways and Corporate Alliance launched in 2005. Crime affects us all and we need to work together to make a difference and to build a net which will jointly support offenders and protect our communities."Employment minister Jim Murphy said: "My visit to Wandsworth prison last week highlighted the importance of improving skills provision for offenders so they can re-enter the workforce upon release."Work is the best way of reducing reoffending and it is essential that we ensure offenders have the skills employers require. We are looking at how we can improve the provision of skills by Jobcentre Plus to help ex-offenders return to the labour market quickly and turn their back on crime."
