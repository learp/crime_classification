CCTV footage of one of the five prostitutes murdered in Ipswich getting into a car thought to belong to suspect Steve Wright has been shown to jurors.As the murder trial entered its third week at Ipswich crown court today, jurors watched footage showing a Ford Mondeo pulling up near Tania Nicol in the red light district of the Suffolk town.The CCTV film showed the dark-coloured car stopping and then reversing to allow the 19-year-old to walk around and climb inside. The camera then panned away, and what happened next was not filmed. The footage of the Mondeo was taken late on October 30 2006, the night Nicol vanished. PC Craig Adamberry - who was part of a police team set up to examine closed circuit television footage - said he believed the woman was Nicol and added that the car matched Wright's.Police suspect the teenager got into a car with 49-year-old Wright, a forklift truck driver, on the night she vanished, the jury heard. Wright, of Ipswich, denies murdering Nicol, 25-year-old Gemma Adams, Anneli Alderton, 24, Paula Clennell, also 24, and 29-year-old Annette Nicholls. Prosecutor Peter Wright QC has told the court that the naked bodies of the five women, who all worked as prostitutes in the town, were found at remote locations around it during a 10-day period in December 2006. Jurors also saw CCTV footage of Anneli Alderton apparently fixing her hair in the reflection of a train window on the night she is believed to have vanished. They were shown film of a woman matching her description travelling on the 5.33pm train from Harwich, Essex, to Manningtree, also in Essex, on December 3. Police said they were sure the woman - who is seen touching her dyed blonde hair with her hands - was Alderton.Separate footage showed her entering an underpass at Manningtree station, and police believe she was on her way to catch a connecting train to Ipswich.The trial, expected to last another month, continues.
