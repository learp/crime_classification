A man arrested on suspicion of the murder of his disabled stepson has been released without charge.Brian Kirby, 36, had been named locally as the man arrested yesterday over the death of James Hughes, 22, whose body was found on Wednesday hidden at the family home.West Mercia police confirmed that Hughes's body was found in a suitcase in the garden. "Contrary to some reports in the media, the suitcase was not found in or under a shed or buried," said Superintendent Jane Horwood. "It was concealed among other items in the garden. The body was in a decomposed condition."She said police were awaiting tests results that they hoped would show long Hughes had been dead and how he died.Hughes's father today spoke of his devastation at the death of his son, whom he described as "the most beautiful of mother Earth's creations that I have had the privilege to meet".Paul Hughes, 42, said: "His aura of happiness and mischief was plain for all to see. He taught us that the strong should look after the weak and so much about what was important and what was not important in life."Hughes's body was found two days after his mother, Heather Wardle, was found dead with a ligature around her neck. They were reported missing at the weekend and a police search began.Officers are treating Wardle's death as "unexplained" but are understood to suspect she took her own life.Police have refused to confirm Brian Kirby's arrest and release, or the name of a youth also arrested but let out today without charge.A postmortem examination of Hughes's body was inconclusive, police said today. Detectives said they had identified the body using dental records and are trying to establish when and where Hughes, who had the mental age of a toddler, was last seen.Some neighbours have said Hughes was not seen for days before he and his mother were reported missing.The Guardian revealed yesterday that Wardle cut off contact with social services several weeks ago.Hughes lived at the terrace house in the Church Hill area of Redditch with his mother, stepfather and three stepbrothers, Daniel, 17, Callum, eight, and Luke, six.After Wardle's body was found, Kirby paid tribute to a "brilliant mother" who doted on her children.
