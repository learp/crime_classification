A policeman has been jailed for at least 18 years for murdering his police constable fiancee and trying to hide the act with a staged car accident.As his trial was due to start at Manchester crown court today, Martin Forshaw, 27, of Tottington, Bury, changed his plea to guilty. Forshaw used a lump hammer to bludgeon his girlfriend, Claire Howarth, 31, at least five times a few hours before they were due to fly to St Lucia for their wedding five days later. He carried her downstairs at their home in Tottington and put her in her BMW car.Prosecuting, Ray Wigglesworth QC said Forshaw drove around secluded country lanes in the area before staging a fake road accident and dialling 999.Forshaw placed Howarth, who was still alive, in the driver's seat. He sat beside her with his foot on the accelerator and crashed the vehicle into a hedge.When police and paramedics arrived at the scene Forshaw, known to friends and family as Alex, told them his fiancee had not been wearing a seatbelt.She was taken to Royal Bolton hospital where she was pronounced dead.Forshaw had been a serving police office with Cheshire constabulary since November 2003 and was an expert in self-defence and violent persons training. Howarth had joined Greater Manchester police in March 2007 and had just completed two years' probation with the force. She had been appointed as a community beat manager in Rochdale.The couple had been in a relationship for 10 months and were set to fly to London Gatwick airport on the day of Howarth's death for a connecting flight to the Caribbean island where they were to be joined by family and friends.Wigglesworth said there was evidence that Forshaw had still been seeing the mother of his four-year-old son and had kept the pending wedding a secret from some of his colleagues.A postmortem examination showed that Howarth suffered multiple injuries including 14 separate injuries to her head and neck.Forshaw told detectives that Howarth had attacked him with the mallet and was struck while he tried to defend himself. Pathologists ruled that account "totally implausible".
