A police officer that made monkey noises at a mixed race suspect in custody was today ordered to resign.PC Wayne Bell also told Anthony Houlsden he was behaving like a badly behaved chimp as he stood in a holding cage in Plumstead police station, south-east London, the same station where the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry was based.The Metropolitan police has reprimanded a second officer, PC Neil Wakeling, who witnessed the July 2005 incident but failed to report it.In April last year, Bow Street magistrates acquitted PC Bell of racially aggravated behaviour after he claimed he could not tell Mr Houlsden's skin colour because he was too far away.But today the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Mr Bell had been "required to resign" after it took the case to the high court.A judge quashed an earlier decision by Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman to overturn an internal misconduct panel ruling and save Mr Bell's job.The IPCC commissioner, Mehmuda Mian Pritchard, said: "We welcome the decision. There is no place for racism in the police service."The police service has clearly taken on board the seriousness of the case and imposed an appropriate penalty."
