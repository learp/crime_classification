The Press Complaints Commission has censured the Voice, Britain's best-known black newspaper, after it reported as fact rumours that 19 Asian men had raped a 14-year-old black girl in Birmingham.One reader complained to the press watchdog that the newspaper's inaccurate reporting of the story had contributed to tensions that sparked a riot in the city.But the newspaper said the violence occurred before it went on sale.The front-page article, headlined "Gang of 19 rape teen", was published in its October 24-30 edition reporting the alleged rape of a 14-year-old black girl by 19 men in an Asian-owned shop. The word "alleged" was only used once on the front page, while inside pages of the newspaper referred to the "alleged rape".The PCC said "sufficient care" had not been taken to present the story accurately."The facts of matter had not been established, but the headline and parts of the front page article had unequivocally stated that there had been an attack," the watchdog's ruling said."In the PCC's opinion, there was insufficient qualification to enable people reading the front page article to realise that the story related only to allegations of an attack."· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
