Four men have been arrested over a multiple shooting at an inner-city pub that left two men dead, police said today.Residents described how a large gang of "hoodies" attacked the Brass Handles pub in the Langworthy area of Salford yesterday afternoon.A Greater Manchester police spokeswoman said four men, believed to be in their early 20s, had been arrested overnight in connection with the incident. They are being questioned by detectives.Locals said the mob attack on the pub was carried out at about 2.20pm, when it was filled with customers watching the Manchester United match.Two men are thought to have entered the pub, firing shots, before being chased out and shot by locals who were also carrying guns.The bodies of the victims could be seen on waste ground outside the pub. Two other men who suffered gunshot wounds were taken to Hope hospital where they remain, under police guard, with serious injuries.Langworthy is a mix of high-rise flats and derelict terrace housing. Police said they believed the shooting could be part of a gangland feud and extra patrols were sent on to streets in the area last night.Gangs from Salford have clashed with rivals from parts of Manchester in the past, but Superintendent Leor Giladi said gun crime in Greater Manchester had been falling recently.Manchester earned the title "Gunchester" in the Nineties after a series of gangland murders and shootings.Witnesses of the attack described a group of young men in hoods running towards the pub before the shooting.Afterwards, the body of one victim could be seen covered by a white tarpaulin on a grassed area 100 metres across the road from the pub.A second body, also behind the police cordon but out of sight, was also believed to be on the waste ground.One local resident said: "I saw one young lad on the ground and another older man in bushes on the ground with his arms outstretched like he had fell over backwards. It's a very rough pub - there is always something going on around here with police involved."Police said the dead men were of mixed race, while the two injured men were white.Last night officers were carrying out door-to-door inquiries and examining CCTV footage.Detectives and forensic experts were also carrying out a detailed search of the crime scene, both inside the pub and on the waste ground outside.
