Three violent drug dealers have each been jailed for a minimum of 37 years for murdering a nursery school teacher, Sabrina Moss, who was gunned down in the street while celebrating her 24th birthday after being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.Hassan Hussain, Yasin James and Martell Warren were found guilty of murdering Moss and the attempted murder of her friend Sabrina Gachette, 25, at a trial at the Old Bailey.The young women were shot outside a fast food restaurant by two hooded men armed with a machine gun and a shotgun in the early hours of 23 August last year. Moss was shot in the heart and died in hospital. Gachette was hit in the back by more than 50 pellets and was lucky to survive.They were not the intended targets but were simply sheltering from the rain with a group of about 15 others in Kilburn High Road, north-west London, during a night out.During the 10-week trial jurors were told how Moss, who had recently moved into a new flat in Neasden with her partner and their four-year-old son, had taken 23 August off work to get ready for her birthday party, meeting friends at home.That evening they went to the Love & Liquor nightclub in Kilburn High Road, and throughout the night others joined their group.Meanwhile, Warren, Hussain and James planned the shooting, carrying out surveillance on their targets before launching their attack an hour before dawn outside the Woody Grill.The women were thrown together with the targets – members of the South Kilburn Gang – because they had taken shelter from the rain under a shop awning by the Woody Grill.The gunmen, Hussain and James, could not have failed to spot the young women in their party clothes amid the rest of the group dressed in casual streetwear, the court heard.Dressed in a bright red dress and high heels, Moss would have stood out from the crowd like a beacon in the night, the Old Bailey was told.Regardless, Hussain discharged a Mac-10 "spray and pray" machine gun six times and James fired both barrels of a shotgun at near point-blank range before fleeing in a car driven by Warren. The exact reason for the shooting was unclear, but it was connected to a drug-dealing turf war and deep-seated animosity with members of the South Kilburn Gang.The court heard that Warren was a convicted drug dealer and member of the Kensal Green Boys or Bloods, known as the KGB. During the trial, Warren implicated Hussain and James in the shooting but denied his own involvement, saying he was just there to do a drug deal.In turn, Hussain and James said Warren was a "dirty lying scumbag" who had only named them to protect the real killers.Hussain, 29, of Willesden, Warren, 23, from Kensal Green, and James, 20, from Wembley, were also found guilty of the attempted murder of Mahad Ahmed and Edson Da'Silva, possession of a Mac-10 machine gun with intent to endanger life, and possession of a shotgun with intent to endanger life. They were found guilty with a fourth defendant – Simon Baptiste, 29, from Cricklewood – of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm between 22 August and 25 August last year.
