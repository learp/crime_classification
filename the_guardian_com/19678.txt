The government's antisocial behaviour tsar Louise Casey is this morning facing an investigation by the Home Office following allegations that she delivered a foul-mouthed after-dinner speech to an audience of chief police officers.The Home Office confirmed that Ms Casey, who has a reputation for being outspoken, is subject to the same code of conduct that applies to all civil servants.Clauses in the code stipulate that civil servants must act with "integrity" and "should act in such a way as to deserve and retain" the confidence of ministers.Ms Casey's controversial remarks were understood to have been made last month at a private event organised by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers.In what was claimed to be a recording of her after-dinner speech, Ms Casey is alleged to have said that government ministers might perform better if they turned up in the morning "pissed" and that "doing things sober is no way to get things done." She is also alleged to have said that she would "deck" Downing Street policy advisers if they kept spouting jargon at her.Ms Casey, who has been a key figure in getting the government's antisocial behaviour message across to the public, also allegedly defended binge drinking.She is understood to have said: "I suppose you can't binge drink anymore because lots of people have said you can't do it. I don't know who bloody made that up - it's nonsense." A Home Office spokesman confirmed that her alleged comments were being looked into, but said that "it was business as usual", and that Ms Casey was working as normal this morning and had no public engagements.In a statement the Home Office said it was looking into her reported remarks, but added: "She is achieving a great deal in the campaign to tackle antisocial behaviour."Ms Casey was appointed head of the government's antisocial behaviour unit two years ago and has a reputation for being blunt both in her current role and previously when she was head of the government's homelessness unit.She is one of Tony Blair's favoured top civil servants and last week the prime minister, unhappy with progress being made on yob culture by the home secretary, Charles Clarke, announced that in future she should report direct to him instead.
