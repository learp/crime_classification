Boris Johnson, the London mayor, today defended the use of stop and search powers in London as it emerged that the capital's police stop someone every three minutes.Johnson, who is also chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, was challenged as figures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act show the Metropolitan police used section 44 of the Terrorism Act – allowing them to search any person or vehicle without the need for suspicion – more than 170,000 times in 2008, a rise from 72,000 in 2007. Of those stops, only 65 led to arrests for terror offences.The Conservative mayor revealed today that an issue was arising over the same people being searched "again and again". But he said he believed that stop and search powers had contributed to a successful reduction in knife crime in the capital, which has dropped 13% in the last year.Johnson said on the Vanessa Feltz radio show on BBC London: "Of course there are issues around stop and search; everyone knows that. Everybody involved in that understands you can't endlessly search the same people over and over again as is now starting to happen."However, asked if the Met were overzealous, Johnson said: "If you talk to people who worry about knife crimes, if you talk to the families of victims of knife crime, I think people will broadly support the idea that if you go out on the streets of London carrying a knife then you have to face the fact you may very well be stopped and searched and you may very well face serious consequences. It's vital that we get that message across to people if we are going to bear down on knife crime as we are."Figures published last week by the justice ministry showed the Metropolitan police were responsible for most of the increase in the use of counterterrorism stop and search powers in 2008, with black and Asian people disproportionately targeted.The number of black people being stopped and searched under counterterrorism laws rose by 322%, compared with 277% for Asian people and 185% for white people.The figures also revealed a 19% increase in the use of "section 60 powers", which give police the right to stop and search anybody for 24 hours in a designated area where serious violence may take place. The power allows police to carry out the searches without needing to have grounds to suspect that the person is carrying a knife or a weapon.The figures showed there were 53,000 section 60 searches in 2007-08, with most of them in London, Birmingham and Liverpool.
