Britain's first black Chief Constable is to be Mike Fuller, who will lead the Kent force.Currently a Deputy Assistant Commissioner with Scotland Yard, Fuller has been outspoken on drugs and the glamorising of guns through music, film and TV adverts. A Kent police spokesman said that his appointment to the Â£120,000-a-year post would be announced tomorrow. Fuller, 44 and a married father of two, began his career as a Met cadet in 1975 before joining the Special Branch as a uniformed officer. He later became a detective chief inspector and was credited with an innovative scheme to combat burglary. Softly spoken and popular with both civilian and uniformed staff, Fuller went on to join the Met's racist and violent crime offences force after the Macpherson report accused the Met of 'institutional racism' over the Stephen Lawrence case. In May 2001 he was promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner, the fourth highest rank in the Met. At the time he said: 'I think it is a brave step by the Met. It is breaking new ground. The perception of the glass ceiling is finally being broken.' He was then made head of Operation Trident, the squad set up to target Yardie-style gunmen. He pioneered the use of adverts on flyers handed out at clubs and broadcasts on pirate radio stations to get the message across. 'There is little point in us going on the Today programme and talking about guns if the people we are trying to get through to never listen to it,' he said. Fuller was highly critical over the Lambeth cannabis experiment which saw those caught with small amounts of the drug let off with a simple warning. He described the scheme as having 'significant flaws' and wrote in Police Review: 'Our school officers report that children feel that the police are sending mixed messages to young people by on the one hand trying to deter young people from abusing and experimenting with drugs, and yet appearing hypocritical by not strictly enforcing the drug laws.'
