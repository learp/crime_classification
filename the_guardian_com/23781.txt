A 15-year-old girl who used a mobile phone to film a man being punched and kicked to death is thought to have become the first person in England and Wales to have been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter by filming the attack, a "happy slapping" incident. At a hearing on Wednesday the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted recording part of the violent attack last September which killed Gavin Waterhouse. Leeds crown court was told how Mark Masters, 19, and a 17-year-old youth, who cannot be named, set upon Waterhouse, 29, in Keighley, West Yorkshire.Although Waterhouse managed to get back to his flat after the beating, his injuries proved fatal. A postmortem examination found that he suffered a ruptured spleen and had died of internal injuries.Both men had admitted manslaughter at a previous hearing. The girl yesterday pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter.According to the Crown Prosecution Service, the girl was handed a mobile phone by one of the attackers and told to "video this". She approached Waterhouse and asked him for money before recording the attack.Witnesses for the prosecution said they had seen and heard the attackers boasting about the assault and saying that it was not the first time that they had attacked the victim. The assailants also shared video footage of the incident with friends after the attack.Judith Naylor, of CPS West Yorkshire, said: "As far as I am aware, this is the first time a suspect in England and Wales has been successfully prosecuted for aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter, for the filming of an inaptly called 'happy slapping' incident."We have seen and heard of many instances in recent months and years where youths have been encouraged by their peers to attack innocent people, without words ever having been used."The message is this: if you stand by and watch your friends committing brutal crimes and video record their acts for your, or for others', amusement, your actions will not be ignored by the law enforcement agencies, and prosecution may follow."James Stewart, the judge, had heard how the defendant claimed she had not known Masters before he passed her the phone and asked her to video the attack.She said she had even asked him how to use the camera before she recorded about 15 seconds of the violence.The girl will be sentenced at a date to be fixed, along with Masters, of Parkwood Rise, Keighley, and the other youth. The judge remanded the girl to a secure unit while reports are prepared on her.After the hearing the officer leading the investigation, Detective Superintendent Paul Kennedy, said: "We are pleased with the outcome of this investigation following [this] unprovoked and cowardly attack. Our thoughts are with Gavin's family."
