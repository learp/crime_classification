The government today moved to block a legal loophole that has prevented people from being prosecuted for reprogramming stolen mobile phones.An amendment to the Reprogramming Act (2002), which comes into force tomorrow, will make it an offence both to offer or to agree to reprogramme a mobile phone. Under current law police must catch someone in the act of reprogramming a mobile before they can arrest them. Jack Wraith, of the Mobile Phone Industry Crime Forum, said the amendment would reduce the burden of proof in such cases.Mr Wraith said the measure should significantly increase the number of successful prosecutions. He said: "In the past 12 months there have been only 40 prosecutions because police have found it difficult to prove who actually reprogrammed the phone. This move should close that loophole."The Home Office also today said tests had confirmed that most phones were barred on their home network within the first day of being reported stolen.Mr Wraith said that, within 24 hours of a phone theft being reported, the unique 14-17 digit number known as the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) could be used to block most phone handsets from their owner's network. Within another 24 hours the IMEI was blocked from all the main domestic networks: 3, O2, Orange, T-mobile and Vodaphone.It is estimated that some 700,000 mobile phones are stolen in the UK every year. Unblocking software is available on the internet.The technology works by reprogramming the phone's IMEI number. It is the same technology used to "unlock" a phone from one network for use on others, which is legal and advertised freely on the high street. In phones produced in the past year, the IMEI number has been encrypted and made harder to reprogramme.The home secretary, John Reid, said anyone found to have tried to reprogramme a phone or to sell it for reprogramming could face "up to five years in prison or an unlimited fine".
