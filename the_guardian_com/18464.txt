The murder of a commuter at rush hour in south London on Tuesday may be linked to another stabbing that took place less than an hour earlier.Police are examining the possibility of a connection between the killing of Daniel Young, 30, and a non-fatal attack just over a mile away.A 23-year-old man was taken to hospital after he was stabbed in the buttocks at around 7.25am on Tuesday in Lewis Road, Mitcham.Police were called just over 40 minutes later, at 8.07am, to Kendor Gardens where Young had been stabbed in what investigators described as “an unprovoked attack on a man simply going about his daily business”.The incident took place in a park used by commuters as a shortcut to Morden tube station and Morden Road tram stop.A 26-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of wasting police time and subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder. He has been released on bail. He has been questioned in relation to Young’s murder although officers have declined to say whether he has now been ruled out as a suspect in that investigation.On Thursday, a 35-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the murder and was taken into custody at a south London police station. Extra police patrols have been put in place in the area to address concerns on the part of residents following the stabbings.Detective Superintendent Paul Monk from Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Major Crime Command told the Guardian that he shared the public’s concerns, adding: “I am equally concerned and I am looking to find, as quickly as possible, the person who was responsible for the attack, or both.”“Random stranger attacks, murders, in London are extremely rare. Whilst I can’t preclude that this isn’t such an attack, I would ask people to be no more diligent or vigilant than they already are in everyday life in terms of their own personal safety. Extensive searches of the park where Young was stabbed have recovered a number of things, said Monk, who reiterated an appeal by the police for witnesses to come forward.“We know that there was a number of members of the public who tried to help Daniel, so we are speaking with those people,” he added.“There may be other people that are not known to our enquiry team who may have information. I would like them to come forward.”Tributes have meanwhile been paid to Young, who died at the scene despite receiving treatment from paramedics and air ambulance medics.The 30-year-old, who was originally from Torquay, Devon, had been on his way to work during his first week of a new job as a teaching fellow at Coventry University’s London campus on Tuesday morning.Dr Janet Hannah, chief executive officer of the campus, said the university was saddened to hear of his death.“Daniel was at the start of what would undoubtedly have been a very successful academic career,” she said. “It is a tragedy that he never got the opportunity to fulfil his potential. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”The police are continuing to appeal for information about the attacks, particularly from commuters who may have witnessed events during the rush-hour period.Police believe that the suspect in Young’s killing would have entered and exited Kendor Gardens via Dorset Road and Kenley Road. From which direction they entered and exited has yet to be established.Investigators want to hear from anyone who was in or around the Kendor Gardens area between 7.50am and 8.15am and who could help with establishing the movements of the suspect.Anyone with information can call police on 020 8721 4961 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
