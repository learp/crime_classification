North Wales police say remains found in a shallow pool in a field in Flintshire last week have been identified as being those of the vet Catherine Gowing, who disappeared three weeks ago.The 37-year-old, originally from County Offaly in Ireland, was last spotted on a CCTV camera as she left a branch of Asda in Queensferry on the evening of Friday 12 October. She was reported missing the following Monday when she failed to arrive for work at the veterinary practice in Mold, Flintshire, where she had worked for 18 months. Her car was found burned out near a disused quarry.A postmortem confirmed that the remains were Gowing's, said Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pierce, who is leading the case. "The postmortem confirmed our fears and the results have been passed to Catherine's family," he said."We are also awaiting identification of further remains found on the banks of the river Dee in Ferry Lane, Higher Ferry, Chester, on Friday 2 November. The search continues for further remains and any other evidence which will assist this investigation."Clive Sharp, 46, of no fixed address, was charged with Gowing's murder last month. At a court appearance in which he appeared by video link, he was remanded in custody until 7 January, when he is due to enter his plea. A three-week trial was provisionally fixed to start in early April.Police have reiterated an appeal for sightings of Gowing's Irish-registered Renault Clio, or Sharp's Volvo S40, registration number AG58 JHE, following her disappearance, particularly in the Sealand area of Flintshire. Detectives are also seeking information about any suspicious activity in the fields where the remains were found.
