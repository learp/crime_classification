A businessman was today found guilty of murder after stabbing to death his former girlfriend, Karen Brown, and her partner, Kenneth Snell, in a fit of "rage and revenge" last Halloween as they each made 999 calls. As he stabbed his 39-year-old ex-girlfriend, John Moody, 45, shouted "Why did you lie?" and "Tell me why you lied?" more than 50 times, Norwich crown court heard. Moody drove to Snell's house in Cringleford, near Norwich, after a friend told him of the relationship. His violent 12-year relationship with Brown ended in August 2008. Moody will be sentenced tomorrow.
