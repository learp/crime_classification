A British schoolboy has been jailed for two years after being found guilty of compiling information likely to be useful in terrorism.Hammaad Munshi was just 15 when he was recruited into an international group plotting to kill "kuffar" or non-believers.Blackfriars crown court in London heard how the grandson of a leading Islamic scholar, now 18, downloaded files about making napalm, detonators and grenades.Sentencing him at the Old Bailey today to two years in a young offenders' institution, Judge Timothy Pontius said that he "fell under the spell of fanatical extremists". He added: "There is no doubt that you knew what you were doing."During his trial, the court heard how al-Qaida propaganda material was stored on his PC and notes on martyrdom hidden under his bed.Munshi, who is the grandson of Sheikh Yakub Munshi, president of the Islamic Research Institute of Great Britain, ran a website selling hunting knives and Islamic flags. He had the online profile "fidadee", meaning a "person ready to sacrifice themself".He was arrested on his way home from school one day and was found carrying ball-bearings, often used as shrapnel in suicide bombs, in his pockets.The judge said the nature of the material Munshi downloaded, including a document called How to Make Napalm, made it a "particularly serious offence".He told Munshi: "You have brought very great shame upon yourself, your family and your religion."However, in the light of the evidence, I have no doubt at all that you, amongst other of similar immaturity and vulnerability, fell under the spell of fanatical extremists. They took advantage of your youthful naivety in order to indoctrinate you with pernicious and warped ideas masquerading as altruistic religious zeal."The judge said he had taken Munshi's age into account, but added: "It is plainly a case where deterrence must be in the forefront of the court's mind."Harendra de Silva QC, Munshi's lawyer, said the schoolboy had been subjected to "grooming and manipulation" by others who were "more criminally inclined".He said Munshi's relatives were "devastated" by what had happened "not least because of the shame that it has brought upon this very upstanding family".Munshi's mentor Aabid Khan, described as a "Mr Fixit" of the terrorist world who had links to a number of proscribed organisations, was arrested in June 2006 at Manchester airport on his way back from Pakistan.He was found carrying articles promoting terrorism, as well as the personal information and addresses of 15 members of the royal family, among them the Queen and the Prince of Wales.Khan, 23, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was jailed for 12 years after being convicted last month of three counts of possessing articles for terrorism.Munshi's cousin, Sultan Muhammad, also from Bradford, was found guilty of three similar charges and one of compiling information for terror. He was jailed for 10 years.Shahid Malik, Munshi's local MP, said the case was a "wake-up call" to parents and urged mosques to take further action to combat extremism.Malik, who wrote a letter to the court on behalf of the teenager's family, said they had been left "shocked and bewildered" by what had happened.He said Munshi's grandfather was a respected religious leader committed to "rooting out" terrorism, and had supported the police investigation.
