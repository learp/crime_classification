The boss of 21 Chinese cockle pickers who drowned in Morecambe Bay told a court today that he made £100 a day profit from the gang.On his first day on the stand at Preston crown court, Lin Liang Ren admitted that he had organised the equipment, recruited the workers, and shared the profits from cockling gangs. Speaking through an interpreter, he said he paid his workers £8 for a bag, which he would then sold them for £20. Typical profits were £100 a day, he said.Mr Lin, 29, is charged with 21 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, and prosecution lawyers have told the court that the cocklers, all of them illegal immigrants aged between 18 and 45, died because he "completely failed" to look after them. Mr Lin told the court that he had arrived in the UK in September 2000 and moved to Liverpool to attend an English language school. He said he made his living doing washing up in Chinese restaurants before he began cockling in Aldingham, Barrow-in-Furness, in 2003. He also admitted using a fabricated course at another English language school as a means of extending his visa. He said the man running the TTI College in London, where he registered but never attended any classes, told him he should familiarise himself with the buildings in case he was investigated by the immigration authorities. Mr Lin is the first of five defendants to give evidence in the trial into the deaths of the cocklers, who drowned in February 2004 after being cut off from the shore by a rapidly rising tide. Twenty-one bodies were recovered from the water, and two cocklers are still listed as missing. He denies manslaughter, and further charges of perverting the course of justice and facilitation - helping people breach immigration law - along with his 21-year-old girlfriend, Zhao Xiao Qing.Mr Ren's cousin, Lin Mu Yong, denies facilitation, as do father and son David Anthony Eden senior and junior. The trial continues.
