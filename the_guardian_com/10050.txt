Observing disorderly behaviour at the January sales a few years ago, I described it as "looting with credit cards". Whatever else may have triggered them, the weekend riots in parts of London represented the same idea in reverse – midsummer bargains being snapped up during 24/7 shopping with not a credit card in sight.People who live relatively comfortable lives far from Tottenham should probably ponder before rushing to condemn the kids who ran amok on Saturday night and the copycat reprises in Enfield, Brixton etc on Sunday (teenagers are very conformist), if only to consider mitigating circumstances. After all, that's what plenty of respectable folk did for Charlie Gilmour after the gilded youth swung off a Cenotaph flagduring a student riot and got sent to jail.But, after a quick ponder, condemnation is the correct response – as it was for young Charlie, the lout. This was a consumerist riot by kids who used their disdain for the "feds" (copycat language from the TV – do they even know what it means?) to justify an opportunity to steal stuff.Bystanders who told reporters it was "inevitable", justifiable by virtue of high local unemployment or the ineptitude of the police are just being what Lenin would have called useful idiots.As so often, Ken Livingstone couldn't resist jumping in with an attack on coalition spending cuts. Truly, he is the Boris Johnson of politics, opportunist to a fault.But the Police Federation matched him by making a similar complaint about low police morale. Actually, it's the quality of the Met's leadership structure that should cause the federation (it's not the same as the "feds") more concern than coalition plans to cut police overtime, plans it won't succeed in achieving if this weekend is any guide (and it is).For what it's worth, my political contacts tell me that police relations with what we always called "the community" in Tottenham are much better than they were before and after the Broadwater Farm riot in October 1985, but that the neighbourhood has suffered far worse damage this weekend than in 1985. It was still poor before the 2011 riot: it is much poorer now.By chance, I had lunch yesterday with a young friend who works at the sharp end of life in Haringey, the north London borough that includes Tottenham.She reported that Mark Duggan, the man whose death at the hands of a police shooter on Thursday evening triggered the disturbance, was known to be a toughie since his schooldays (a friend of hers was at school with him).The Guardian's account is characteristically gentle and generous about Duggan's personal CV. His fiancee, the mother of three of his four children, admits he was "known to the police" but says he would not have fired his gun.Equally typically, the Mail paints a harsher picture of a young man who revelled in being part of the Star Gang, well known in N17, and had links to the drugs trade.Be that as it may – or may not. Good or bad, a man has friends and a large extended ("fragmented" was one word I heard) family. So it is more to the point that what we laughingly call "social media" – shouldn't that be antisocial media? – was already rife with threats of weekend violence on Friday, with gruesome supportive imagery provided, and that the local police should have been more prepared for it, my young friend reported.Instead, they left a couple of squad cars on Tottenham High Road, handy for anyone wanting to get a party started by setting fire to them.All right, it's easy to be smart after the event. But political contacts tell me that the basic problem was not that the local police chief went on holiday on Friday – everyone needs a holiday – but that the police pursuit of Duggan was being run from the Met's HQ at Scotland Yard as part of Operation Trident (black-on-black crime), so the pursuing officers were outsiders. They often keep the local force in the dark – it's how hierarchical organisations often work, isn't it?That's often a recipe for trouble and grief to local police, who work hard to improve relations with minority communities. So it was on this occasion. The fact that a death at the hands of the police immediately meant that the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) took over the investigation didn't help.The standard IPCC procedure is to set up a local "reference group" to stay in touch with the family and friends of the deceased – feelings often run high when the police kill anyone – but I am told this did not happen here.That must explain why the Duggan family's peaceful protest in search of information 48 hours after the shooting met with frustration (as the Guardian reports here), which gave some young hotheads the excuse for some aggro – trouble that quickly spread via Twitter and drew in outsiders keen on a bit of "fun" and a spot of early Christmas shopping.David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, a local boy who escaped via a scholarship and was at Harvard Law School with Barack Obama, has condemned the violence while expressing doubts about police tactics.Up the road in Enfield, the local Tory MP, Nick Du Bois, told Radio 4's Today how looters were using mobile phones and behaving as though they were out on a shopping trip – "women filling up trolleys with TVs, clothes, trainers, passing it out to their husbands round the corner". Others reported seeing kids trying on shoes to find the right size.It reminds me of something else I heard at the weekend, that thieving got so bad at the London docks in the good old days – it was actually Danny Baker reminiscing on Desert Island Discs, now I come to think of it – that the authorities were forced to export right foot shoes from a different port than the left foot shoes.Obviously this sort of thieving would never happen in the nearby City of London, which investment bankers nearly burned to the ground in an extended riot for which the rest of us are still paying.As in Tottenham, many of the guilty parties were outsiders who have not been brought to justice. But the failures of the regulatory authorities, be they Tottenham nick or the Bank of England, is no excuse.In both instances, the riot and the boom and bust, the sheer speed of modern technologies appears to have played an important role: those automatic trades, the globally-hooked-up financial markets which have been panicking in unison these past few days as well as the mindless Twitter feed across the capital.Yet riots have occurred before. So have insane bull/bear markets. It's what people do with their fancy new technologies that makes the difference.What is more striking is another feature of modern speed – the need for instant gratification. That includes not just the consumerist rioters but the posse who couldn't wait for accurate answers to their legitimate questions about how Duggan met his end.In the next few days, we should monitor how the police struggle to get their story straight about what did, and didn't, happen. But also look out for the addresses of those appearing in court, as well as whether or not they have jobs. It's tempting to blame poverty for looting, but – as with football hooliganism – it ain't necessarily so.One other thought. This trouble erupted a few miles from Fleet Street, quite early on Saturday evening. Yet, with the honourable exception of the Observer, which carried a decent page report, albeit on an inside page – very little of it appeared in later editions of the Sunday papers I read at home.That's a dispiriting dereliction of civic duty, I'd say – further evidence that sitting behind terminals in the office, along with dirty phone hacking habits, has undermined the better instincts of Fleet Street to get out and get the story.If a major riot just down the road isn't deemed to be a better story than Jude Law's love life, heaven help us all – rioters included.
