Jurors in the Stephen Lawrence murder trial have been warned not to bow under the emotional pressure to return guilty verdicts.A barrister representing one of the two men accused of stabbing the black teenager to death in a racist attack in 1993 said Britain had changed since then.Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, both of south London, deny murder and claim forensic evidence on clothing is the result of contamination.They told the Old Bailey that racist rants secretly filmed by police in 1994 contained the type of language common in their circle at the time.In his closing speech, Stephen Batten QC, for Norris, told the four women and eight men to keep their objectivity in the five-week case.He said the defendants had undergone a prosecution outside court from the media and well-meaning people since 1993.Batten asked: "Do you have a sense that the well meaning still feel, unless there is a conviction some time in the case of Stephen Lawrence and his senseless death, that somehow racism would have won?"Racism has long since lost any shred of respect, even one might say, in football. The last 18 years since Stephen Lawrence's death has been an enormous help in getting rid of racism. The country has come a long way since 1993."He asked the jurors whether, when they retired to decide the verdicts, they would feel "some extra weight of responsibility" than other juries.He said they should ask for a tour of the historic building when it was over. "It may be some compensation for having been through the rack here," he said.Batten said they should pay particular attention to a plaque put up to two Quaker jurors who were jailed in 1670 for not returning a verdict they were told to. That had led to the right of jurors to return verdicts in accordance to their consciences."They kept their oath and we encourage you to keep yours," he said.Batten also cast doubt on scientific evidence linking his client to the murder.He said key prosecution evidence that a 2mm hair from Lawrence had been found on Norris's jeans was "not safe". He said one scientist who testified, Dr Terry Melton, had spoken "like a politician" by avoiding straight answers.On Wednesday, Dobson's barrister told the jury that scientific findings presented by the prosecution in the trial did not "fit with the wider picture given by the rest of the evidence".Tim Roberts QC said traces of blood and fibres found on his client's clothing were the result of police contamination.No eyewitness had placed Dobson at the scene of the attack, he added.The trial was adjourned to Wednesday when Mr Justice Treacy will sum up the case.
