A mother has been jailed for a minimum of 14 years for murdering her 11-month-old son.Callum Wilson was taken to hospital in a "collapsed state" with a brain injury and multiple fractures on 18 March 2011, and died two days later.Emma Wilson, 25, from Windsor, blamed Callum's then 23-month-old brother, claiming that "constant pushing and rolling" may have been to blame, the Old Bailey trial was told.But after a five-week trial the jury unanimously found her guilty in December, and on Friday she was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 14 years.The trial heard that Wilson kept Callum's birth a secret from her parents, and her then partner insisted the child be put up for adoption. Callum was put into foster care but returned to his mother's home in November 2010.Paul Dunkels, prosecuting, said health and social workers spotted scratches on Callum during visits to the flat over the next few months, but Wilson blamed them on the "boisterous" brother.Wilson told staff and parents at a playgroup that Callum was her cousin's son, and claimed on one occasion that bruising on Callum's face had been caused by an older sister, who did not exist, Dunkels said. Staff at the playgroup noticed Callum change from a "happy, smiling baby" to "emotionless and listless".Dunkels said Callum's fatal brain injury was caused by a direct blow or by striking his head against something, and a leg fracture may have been the result of "banging against a hard surface". He said it was not the crown's case that Wilson intended to kill her son, but that she carried out a violent act against a vulnerable child.Following the sentencing, DS Ian Hunter, of Thames Valley police, said: "The sentence today is a reflection of the abuse Callum suffered at the hands of someone entrusted to care for him and the pain he must have felt during his short life. Of course, sadly it does not bring Callum back and our thoughts will always remain with him."Adrian Foster, the chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern, said: "This was an extremely difficult and complex case to prosecute. Without any witnesses, we needed lengthy and highly technical evidence from top medical experts to help provide an explanation as to why this baby died. This evidence enabled the prosecution to piece together what had happened and exclude any possible innocent explanation for the baby's death."We have worked closely with Thames Valley police since this investigation was launched and as a result of the hard work and diligence of the prosecution team, a just outcome has been achieved for baby Callum. We hope that the conviction and sentence will in some way help his extended family come to terms with this tragic event."
