Scotland Yard stopped attacks by rioters on sites across London hours before they had been due to take place after managing to "break into" encrypted social messaging sites, it has emerged.Attacks on the Olympics site, stores in Oxford Circus and the two Westfield shopping centres, in east and west London, had been plotted using BlackBerry Messenger (BBM).Detectives made the breakthrough shortly before the planned attacks after scouring the mobile phones of people who had been arrested during the riots.It gave them access to messages, planning riots and looting, which were bouncing around the heavily encrypted BBM service.But it also gave the Met other information, meaning they were able to use details gained from the seized phones to give officers "live time monitoring" of BBM and also Twitter.By last Monday afternoon, they were able to monitor BlackBerry messaging and send extra officers to disrupt the planned attacks, which might have heightened the sense of danger felt by Londoners.This Tuesday, police revealed they had considered switching off social messaging sites including BBM and Twitter.Testifying before MPs on the home affairs committee, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner, Tim Godwin, said police discovered they did not have the legal powers to do so, adding: "We did consider seeking the legal authority to switch it off. The legality is questionable, very questionable."He said that as well as social messaging sites being used to plan riots, they were a useful "intelligence asset" for police who were able to monitor them.Last Monday, police chiefs sent officers to thwart the planned attacks on the Olympic site in Stratford, east London. Shops in the area also closed after "intelligence" obtained from social messaging sites of conspiracies to riot.He said police were not "at this moment of time" asking the government for new powers to turn off social messaging sites during outbreaks of extreme disorder.This week, the Guardian revealed that the government had drafted in the MI5 security service and the eavesdropping centre at GCHQ to join the hunt for those using social messaging to plot riots and work out how BlackBerry messaging could be "cracked" in future, and in real time if need be.Godwin told MPs beginning their investigation into the riots that David Cameron had been wrong to tell the Commons last week that his officers had been too timid when faced with rioters and looters.Confirming that he would apply to be the next commissioner of the Met, he said: "I do not believe that the men and the women of the Met were timid, which is an accusation that has been levelled at us."Sir Hugh Orde, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said during his evidence that the police had no inkling the riots would erupt."What we saw, fundamentally different in my assessment, was almost nonexistent pre-intelligence. This was spontaneous rather than organised," he said.The police chiefs again rejected the government's claims that it had quelled the rioting by ordering a huge surge of officers on to the street.Godwin said he took the decision last Monday evening after it became clear officers were still being overrun as riots hit 22 of the 32 boroughs in London. The Met, Britain's biggest force, needed help from 30 other forces.Orde told politicians they legally had no role in setting tactics. "If politicians want to make tactical decisions, they must take the responsibility and change the law to make that happen," he added.
