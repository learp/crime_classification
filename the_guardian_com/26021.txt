One of the country's most senior counter-terrorism officers is being forced out of his job as part of government funding cuts to the police service.The head of the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit, Detective Chief Superintendent Matt Sawers, will leave in two weeks' time as part of a £40m cut from the force's budget this year.A source said: "He was angry and he was saddened by this, but he has come to terms with it and moved on now."His departure comes despite a coalition pledge that frontline policing would not be affected by its 20% reduction in policing budgets and despite Home Office promises that counter-terrorism funding would be protected.Sawers is an experienced counter-terrorism officer who has run the West Midlands unit since it was launched seven years ago. He was at its helm during one of the unit's most high-profile investigations to foil a plot to kidnap and behead a British soldier.He also ran an operation which led to nine men being charged six months ago with conspiracy to cause explosions and engage in acts of terrorism. The trial is due later this year.Sawers is among 175 officers made to leave the West Midlands force this year as it attempts to make budget cuts of £125m over four years.The chief constable, Chris Sims, and the police authority invoked regulation A19, requiring officers with 30 years' service to retire even if they were well under the usual retirement age.A senior intelligence source said: "We are obviously concerned. We don't want to be losing some of the country's most experienced people."Like all the officers made to retire, Sawers was asked if he would like to return to provide his expertise not as a salaried senior officer but as a special. It is understood he has turned down the offer and is looking elsewhere for opportunities.Another 177 officers will be made to retire by next March and, in total, 1,000 police officers and 1,200 police staff will be cut over the next four years.Sawers was allowed to stay on nearly two months longer than the other officers – most of whom left the force a month ago – in order to hand over to a less experienced replacement.The news that such a senior counter-terrorism officer has fallen victim to the cuts comes after police chiefs revealed that 28,000 jobs would be lost from the 43 forces as a result of the 20% reduction in government grants.The Association of Chief Police Officers has predicted that the number of officers will fall by 12,000 while civilian staff will have to be cut by 16,000.Derek Webley, chairman of the West Midlands police authority, said: "We didn't want to take police officers away from the key areas of frontline policing and it was the view of the authority having had a thorough discussion that A19 was an opportunity to deal with officers who had reached 30 years of service. The head of counter-terrorism was one of these officers but his role was thought to be integral to major investigations so he was allowed to stay on longer to hand over."He denied that public security would be affected by the decision to remove the force's most senior anti-terrorism officer. "There is no way that the authority or the force would jeopardise its counter-terrorism capability," he said.The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: "To lose the most experienced officers including counter-terror experts shows the damage 20% cuts to the police are doing and the risks the government is taking with public safety."David Cameron and Theresa May told the public that police cuts would all be efficiency savings and would protect the frontline, yet what could be more frontline than this?"In a recent article, the force's chief constable said reducing officer numbers was "painful and difficult". But he said: "Meeting the financial challenges facing the police service is tough... the harsh reality is that only a reduction in the number of employees can meet the challenge."
