Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were probably smothered or suffocated by Ian Huntley before their bodies were dumped in a remote ditch, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.Mr Huntley allegedly returned three days later to the ditch after asking the police about DNA, cut the Soham schoolgirls' clothes from them, and set fire to their bodies. Prosecutor Richard Latham QC also told the court that sexual assault of the girls by school caretaker Mr Huntley, 29, could not be ruled out. Mr Latham said the cause of death was impossible to establish, but Home Office pathologist Nat Carey concluded it was probably asphyxia. Mr Huntley denies murdering the 10-year-old friends. Mr Huntley's ex-girlfriend Maxine Carr, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and assisting an offender.
