A woman was tonight being questioned by police on suspicion of murdering her teenage daughters after two bodies were found at the family's home.Police said they were called to a house in Stretham, near Ely, Cambridgeshire, this morning, and found the bodies of two teenage girls. A 39-year-old woman was arrested at the scene.Detective superintendent Jeff Hill, leading the investigation, said a phone call was made from the house to a member of the public, who in turn called an off-duty police officer.The cause of death was still being investigated and a post mortem on the bodies of the two girls was likely to take place tomorrow, he added.According to reports, the woman being questioned is 39-year-old Rekha Kumari-Baker, and the bodies were those of her daughters, Jasmine, 13, and Davina, 16.The phone call from the house came from Mrs Kumari-Baker, the Press Association reported.Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the girls' deaths.According to reports, Jasmine lived with her mother and Davina with her father, who is separated from Mrs Kumari-Baker.A next-door neighbour, 67-year-old Abraham Narimissa, said he had seen Davina and her mother yesterday afternoon, adding: "There didn't seem to be any problem ... everything seemed fine."Other neighbours said they knew little about the family, who had lived at the house for several years.
