In April we reported the story of Paul Kelly, who was murdered outside a Bath pub on New Year's Eve in front of 20 revellers, and whose killer was named in a poem posted in locations around the town.Now Kelly's mother Allison has urged witnesses to come forward. The 32-year-old was stabbed repeatedly outside the city's Longacre Tavern following an argument. Although police say they know the identity of the murderer, no one has yet been prepared to testify against him. Allison said: 'To have witnessed such a horrific attack is mind-blowing. You need to tell the police because this will eat away at you. Justice needs to be done.'She added: 'The people of Bath know who killed my son; we didn't expect witnesses to keep quiet and cause us such pain.'Allison, from Glasgow, said: 'The investigation is now into its sixth month, but it hurts just as much today as it did when we first heard of Paul's death.'Police have taken more than 500 statements and interviewed nearly 1,100 individuals as part of the investigation. In addition, 1,003 exhibits have been seized. Last month, poems appeared around Bath naming the killer, creating a surreal situation where Kelly's killer walks freely in a city whose residents know that he is the murderer.
