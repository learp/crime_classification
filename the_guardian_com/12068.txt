The father who was jailed last week for murdering his two young sons was found hanged in his prison cell yesterday.Steven Wilson, 44, was five days into his life sentence after being convicted at Birmingham crown court of stabbing to death Brad, seven, and Brett, eight.The court heard that he had wanted to take his revenge on their 26-year-old mother, who had fled nine years of violence at his hands.A fellow prisoner, thought to be his cellmate, found him hanged by shoelaces from an upturned bed at Blakenhurst prison in Redditch, Worcestershire, at 12.10pm.Officers tried to resuscitate Wilson, of Great Barr, Birmingham, but he was pronounced dead by a doctor at the jail an hour later.Wilson had attacked Brad with such force that his knife broke, and stabbed Brett in the neck with a screwdriver, before phoning his wife, eldest son and the emergency services to tell them what he had done.But he lied about his whereabouts to ensure that no one could save the children and, by the time police tracked him to a remote golf course in Handsworth, they were already dead.When the case came to court he changed his story and tried to blame his wife, Denise Williams, for their murders. He wept and clung to the large crucifix around his neck as he described the deaths, saying he believed she had set gangsters on to him and that they had stabbed the boys.But Mr Justice Hughes told him that no one could believe his "patently dishonest" story and the jury took 50 minutes to reach unanimous guilty verdicts on both charges of murder and a further charge of assaulting Ms Williams on the same night in February last year.The judge gave him two life sentences for his "dreadful and wicked" crime with a concurrent 12-month sentence for attacking his wife.The 18-stone former soldier, who married Ms Williams when she was 16, assaulted her about 100 times over the course of their marriage and forced her into prostitution so he did not have to work. He threatened to kill her and the children every time she tried to leave him.Stacey Banner, his daughter by his first marriage, told reporters that he should never be allowed to walk the streets again and his parents said in a statement after the verdict: "We are disgusted, appalled and very ashamed of Steven. But not surprised. He is an evil, lying, controlling, manipulative, devious bully and also power and money mad."Last night Wilson's relatives and neighbours said they were relieved by the news of his death. "At least now there is no way he can ever hurt again the people he has caused so much pain to over the years," said his daughter-in-law Gemma."I am delighted that he is no longer able to intimidate, manipulate or bully anyone. It is the best thing that could have happened. The rest of his family can at last sleep easy."A former friend of Wilson's, who gave his name only as Pele, said he was not surprised to hear of the death."Steve liked to portray that he was a hard man, but he was a chicken," he said."He wouldn't have been able to hack prison life; it would have been too much for him given the time he would have to spend there. I fully expected him to commit suicide."Police and the prison service said investigations were under way and an inquest would be held. power and money mad."
