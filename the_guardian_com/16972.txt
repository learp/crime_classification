England and Wales have more prisoners serving life than the rest of the European Union put together, according to official figures today.The Prison Reform Trust said yesterday that the most recent figures show 5,445 lifers in prisons in England and Wales, including 172 women. Council of Europe figures show that this outstrips the combined lifer total of 5,046 in the rest of the EU - and is three times higher than the next highest in the list, Turkey, with 1,746 lifers. Britain's nearest neighbour, France, has 556 lifer prisoners. Ten years ago the lifer population in England and Wales was 3,000; five years ago it was 4,000. The rise has not been matched by a similar increase in the murder rate - up from 630 a year to about 800. Each lifer will spend an average of 13 to 14 years in prison. Juliet Lyon, of the trust, said that the dramatic rise had everything to do with the increased use of mandatory penalties and an emphasis on retribution by the courts. "Locking up more people for longer in our overcrowded prisons reduces constructive activity and extends aimless periods behind bars." Part of the explanation lies in the fact that since the abolition of the death penalty, England - with Wales - has been one of the few European countries which has a mandatory life sentence for murder. The definition of murder in English law is also much wider than across the rest of Europe. Spain has only three offences that attract a life sentence, while there are nearly 70 on the English statute book, including discretionary life sentences for crimes such as failing in the duty to assist a police officer, and aggravated burglary. The new figures on lifer population were released as the Home Office published revised guidance to the Parole Board, requiring it to consider the impact of an offence on the victim's family when assessing suitability for early release.
