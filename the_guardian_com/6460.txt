A mother whose ex-husband is accused of murdering their son by jumping off a Crete hotel balcony with him told a court that their make-or-break holiday had been plagued by rows, but said: "He didn't mean to kill my children."John Hogan fell 15 metres from the fourth floor of the Petra Mare hotel with his son Liam, six, and daughter, Mia, then two, during a family holiday in August 2006.Liam, who fell first, died from head injuries despite his mother's attempts to resuscitate him. Mia was being held by her father, then 32, when they hit the ground and survived with a broken arm.Natasha Hogan, 35, told the court that the holiday was make-or-break for their marriage, which had not been working "for a long time", but was plagued by rows.She said her ex-husband's "family history contributed to his problems" - his brothers Stephen and Paul had both killed themselves - and "he should not have taken my children".She told the court in the port town of Chania, Crete, that Hogan had suffered panic attacks when she was pregnant with Liam and had "become increasingly depressed and unhelpful since the birth of their two children", so the holiday was intended as "a break away from the stress"."I realised I did not love him any more but I wanted to try," Natasha Hogan said."He didn't mean to kill my children but I do know with his history of suicide that he should not have taken my children."He is a selfish man."A psychiatry professor, Joannis Nestoris, said Natasha Hogan did not have the "emotional intelligence" to realise she was provoking her husband on the night and "should not have said the things she said".Nestoris, from Crete University, conducted a series of interviews with Hogan and said the prospect of divorce "sent him crazy". "It was not his intention to harm the children," he said."He thought he would be able to take his children to heaven. This was not logical."Hogan "doesn't even remember the incident", said Nestoris, describing how he had suffered from "heavy illusions" and schizophrenic symptoms when under pressure.Natasha Hogan said her then husband's mood had worsened before the incident and he had asked to be left alone.She left the room but later returned to pack, having decided to take the children home early because she was "unhappy". She said: "He stared at me with a crazed look and started shouting."He said: 'My packing is crap' ... I had my back to him and when I turned around no one was there."Hogan is charged with the premeditated murder of his son and the attempted premeditated murder of his daughter, which carry maximum sentences of life imprisonment and 12 years respectively.Earlier, he told the court: "I do not accept the charge that I planned to kill my children. I did not plan it."Natasha Hogan divorced him last year. In a statement read out by a police officer outside court, she said the past few months had been "trying"."I am able to say that Mia is much better now and has made a full recovery from the injuries sustained that day," she said. "She is in regular contact with John's side of the family and enjoys a loving and caring relationship."In a television interview with ITV1's Tonight show, filmed last year and to be broadcast tonight, she describes the moment her family disappeared over the edge of the balcony.She says she will "never forgive" her ex-husband and lives with the image of her dying son "every minute" of the day.Speaking to Sir Trevor McDonald about her anguish at facing Hogan again in court, she says he had been her "best friend" but that "he's going to be a different man and that scares me the most about the trial, actually seeing him".Natasha Hogan now lives with her boyfriend, Richard Visser, in Newport. She tells the programme that she does not care about the outcome of the trial because "his sentence is inside his own head and I know until that man dies he will hate himself for what he's done".
