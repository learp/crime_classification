Police were yesterday questioning a man after thieves broke into the home of the England and Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard and then escaped in two of his luxury cars.The 26-year-old midfielder, who was sleeping in the house with his pregnant fiancee, Elen Rives, was woken by the the noise of the cars being driven away and raised the alarm.The two cars were found soon afterwards.A Scotland Yard spokesman said police were called to Lampard's house at West Brompton, south-west London, at 4am and found a door had been forced."The vehicles were subsequently driven away and a TV and a computer were also reported stolen," he said. "One of the vehicles was later found in Chelsea and the other, containing a television, was discovered in Battersea."He said a man arrested in Battersea at about 5am yesterday was being questioned. He would not comment on the make of the cars or the value of the stolen property.Lampard, who moved from West Ham to Stamford Bridge for £11m in 2001, has lived with Ms Rives in central London for more than a year. The couple also have a £4m home in Blackhills, Surrey.In a statement yesterday, his management company said: "We can confirm that in the early hours of this morning Frank Lampard's private residence was the subject of a burglary."A small number of items were taken from Frank's house, along with two motor vehicles."Frank was disturbed by the sounds of the cars leaving his property and we immediately contacted the police and activated his Trakker system."Both cars and his property have been recovered undamaged. Neither Frank nor his fiancee, Elen, who were asleep in the house at the time, were harmed in any way, and neither was his house ransacked or damaged."
