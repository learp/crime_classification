Reassuring noises from Chris Grayling at last night's Centre for Social Justice fringe meeting in Manchester for those who fear that his time in the home affairs job will be spent demanding ever-tougher law and order policies.While he confirmed that Conservative policy is to pledge to build 5,000 more prison places than whatever Labour goes into the election promising, the shadow home secretary also stressed that simply arresting, and by implication, locking up more people will not solve anything."We have a long history of being considered robust on law and order, but we need a broad-based strategy … There are some things that we can do relatively quickly – but turning this around is the work of a generation," he said at the meeting, which had heard from an ex-offender who had got himself out of Birmingham's burgeoning inner city gang culture.Grayling talked of developing a politically consensual approach to problems of teenage violent crime and praised the work that former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has done with Labour's Graham Allen on an early intervention approach.The shadow home secretary even impressed penal reformers by declaring that if there were more young people in jail in 10 years time than there are today, then the Conservatives would have failed.But as he outlined the education, tax and benefits and health policies needed to tackle the roots of juvenile crime, it all proved too much for one Tory representative who demanded to know whether he had any Home Office policies to tackle the problems of youth gang culture.His claim that reinforcing family life by scrapping the tax and benefit incentives that mean it makes more sense for parents to separate rather than stay together was an anti-crime measure that tested the patience of some of his audience.The shadow home secretary insisted that simply being tough on criminal justice enforcement wouldn't deal with it: "This will not be solved by a single policy in a single department," Grayling said.Labour famously started out in 1997 promising to be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. By the 2005 general election this had been reduced to the simple campaign slogan of "more police". Let's hope Grayling's conference speech tomorrow doesn't disappoint.
