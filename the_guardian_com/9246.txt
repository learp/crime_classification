The attackersOlder brother: Still just 12, he is already the possessor of a long criminal and police record, including violent assaults on children, a teacher and a mother out shopping with young children. He began the Edlington attack by, without warning, starting to choke and punch one of the victims. It was he who smashed the sink section against the older victim's head, almost killing him. Of relatively low IQ, he appeared to find the court proceedings hard to follow, shifting constantly in his seat.Younger brother: Now 11, he had previously been in trouble for punching a female teacher and head-butting her male colleague. A leading child psychiatrist told the court that the boy showed almost no remorse or empathy and, if left untreated, could become psychopathic as an adult. He paid closer attention to the case, at times reading his social worker's court notes. He started weeping when the brothers' violent home background was described, the only show of emotion by either boy.The victimsOlder boy: Aged 11 at the time, he suffered considerably worse injuries, notably to his head, leaving him semi-conscious. Police believe it was simply good fortune that he was found so soon and did not die. He has been left with some scarring but the court heard he has recovered relatively well mentally.Younger boy: The nine-year-old had to run, covered in blood and barefoot, to get help after being unable to move the older victim. While he was less seriously hurt, the court was told that the boy suffered great guilt from leaving his close friend. Previously well-behaved, he has now become disruptive in school and may need psychiatric help.
