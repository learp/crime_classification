Charlie Gilmour, the son of Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour, was arrested today on suspicion of violent disorder and attempted criminal damage following his involvement in the student protests in central London on Thursday.Gilmour, 21, was seen swinging from a Union flag attached to the Cenotaph war memorial as he took part in a march demonstrating against increases in tuition fees. He later apologised for the "terrible insult", saying he had been "caught up in the spirit of the moment"."On the morning of Sunday 12 December, a 21-year-old man was arrested at his home address in Sussex," said a spokesman for the Metropolitan police. "He was arrested by officers from Operation Malone on suspicion of violent disorder, and attempted criminal damage of the Union flag on the Cenotaph on 9 December. He was taken to a Sussex police station where he has been further arrested on suspicion of theft."Gilmour, who remains in custody at the police station, is the 35th person to have been arrested following involvement in Thursday's protest. Some 176 people have been arrested in the four protests so far.Earlier police released pictures of 14 people wanted in connection with committing violent offences during the tuition fee protests last Thursday.The demonstration against a proposed rise in university fees sparked violent exchanges between police and protesters after MPs voted in favour of the move.Police said they had reviewed hours of CCTV footage to identify people responsible for offences committed during the protest, in which some police officers were attacked and buildings, including the Treasury, were vandalised.Detective Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne, head of the police investigation, said: "We want the public to help us identify these people who may have been involved in violent disorder, attacking police officers and smashing buildings, shops and windows. The vast majority of the people we are seeking are suspected of committing serious offences of violent disorder and criminal damage."
