They waited nine years for justice for their "happy and vivacious" daughter Milly. But when it came, her family said it shouldn't have come at such a high price.One by one, each member of Milly Dowler's family stood outside the Old Bailey after their daughter's killer was given a second whole-life sentence, to launch a scathing attack on the justice system that has left them feeling angry and let down.They were also critical of initial Surrey police investigation during which chances were missed to catch Levi Bellfield, who went on to murder two more victims.Milly's father, Robert, 59, said: "The pain and agony that we have endured as a family since 21 March 2002 has been compounded by the devastating effects of this trial."Describing it as a "truly mental scarring experience on an unimaginable scale", and the questioning of his wife as "particularly cruel and inhuman" he said they felt as if it had been they who had been on trial.He said: "We despair of a justice system that is so loaded in favour of the perpetrator of the crime. It has often appeared as almost incidental that this is a trial concerning the murder of our daughter."Her mother, Sally, described the four-week trial as an "awful experience" in which her "happy vivacious, fun-loving girl" had been defamed.She said: "Our family life has been scrutinised and laid open for everyone to inspect and comment upon. We have had to lose our right to privacy and sit through day after harrowing day of the trial in order to get a man convicted of a brutal murder."She added: "The length the system goes to protect his human rights seems so unfair compared to what we as a family have had to endure.I hope whilst he is in prison he is treated with the same brutality he dealt out to his victims and that his life is a living hell."The experience of the Dowler family has raised "fundamental questions" about the treatment of victims and witnesses in the courts system, according to Keir Starmer the director of public prosecutions.Both Robert, an IT management consultant, and his wife, a teacher, broke down while giving evidence after forensic questioning of their lives by the defence and suggestions that Milly may have run away because she was unhappy. Her father also had an additional ordeal as details of his sexual proclivities were examined after it emerged Milly had found a pornographic magazine belonging to him and had felt let down because of it. This led to police considering Dowler as a suspect â€“ the first of 54 checked out by Surrey police over the nine years since Milly's death.Milly's sister, Gemma, 25, said: "I can honestly say that the day my mother and father were questioned by the defence QC was the worst day of my life. It is hard to believe, but it was worse than when I heard the news that the remains were that of my sister Milly."In a poignant account of how the family had tried to move forward in the years since "the best sister anyone could ask for" was murdered, she spoke of how they had managed good days."Sadly it is those good days when we realise that there is somebody missing and then I will spend the next day feeling guilty for enjoying myself."She went on: "It had taken me a long time to get to some kind of normal life for a 25-year-old but I felt I was getting there; however now I feel like all my hard work has been undone."Louise Casey, the commissioner for victims and witnesses, has said the Dowlers were far from an isolated case and victims and witnesses were sometimes "treated as if they were an inconvenience in some legal game being played out in the court room".She said: "We can't let this continue."Roger Coe-Salazar, the CPS chief crown prosecutor in the south-east, added that "no amount of general foresight can ever prepare someone for" certain aspects of the trial process, such as the cross-examination which Milly's family found "extremely distressing".But he said that while prosecutors objected to the questioning by Bellfield's defence team "wherever we legitimately could", the defendant must always be able to "advance his defence before a jury".
