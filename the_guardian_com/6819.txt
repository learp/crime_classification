In the vital moments following the 7/7 terrorist attacks "precious time" could have been "wasted" because medical teams waited above ground for an update on casualties in one of the bombed tube trains, a paramedic admitted today.The first two paramedics at the scene of the wrecked carriage at Aldgate station in London carried no medical equipment because they did not want to be distracted from assessing the situation, the inquest for the 52 victims was told.When their radios did not work below ground, both were forced to return to the surface to request life-saving supplies.In the bombed carriage, paramedics David Parnell and Steve Jones found six dead bodies and seven or eight seriously wounded survivors they classed as "priority one", meaning they needed immediate medical help.Parnell returned to the surface to tell waiting medics what was needed to treat the injured on the train and was still talking to his colleagues when Jones came up from the tunnel to ask what had happened to the medical team and the extra equipment they had demanded.During the aftermath of the bomb, Parnell went between the surface and the bombed carriage three or four times, a journey that took three to four minutes each way.While he and Jones came to the surface to request more assistance, only one paramedic - Craig Cassidy - was left in the bombed carriage with the dying and injured. "According to records, I now know that Mr Cassidy was there," he said.Parnell, who at the time of the attacks was part of a doctor and paramedic emergency team based at the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel, east London, was designated "bronze medic" on arriving at Aldgate. His responsibility was to assess the situation and work with the other emergency services to save as many lives as possible, which is why he did not take medical supplies down to the train in the first instance."As a bronze medic, if you take medical kit with you, you start treating people," he said. "So my experience is from listening to other medical personnel who have done major incidents and have actually done a role of bronze medic, the best thing to do is take a pen and a pad."On arriving at Aldgate, Parnell told other paramedics to stay at the surface to ensure that the ambulance "silver commander" in charge of the incident knew where all medics were in case another bomb went off on the train, the inquest heard.He explained: "It is standard practice that silver knows exactly how many have gone down to the incident site, and should there be a secondary device he or she would know how many resources are at that site."Coroner Lady Justice Hallett asked about the apparent delay in treating the wounded on board the train. "Did you know, Mr Parnell, why the medical teams weren't immediately behind you?," she asked.The paramedic replied: "At this stage we didn't know what we were dealing with. It is standard procedure that a bronze medic would give a full report and state what's required and what kind of equipment is required before a medical team is committed."The coroner went on: "Here you have to run back. If you're waiting for that, isn't there the possibility that precious time could be wasted?" He replied: "That is a possibility."The inquest also heard that there was confusion about who was in charge of the emergency medical response at Aldgate with three ambulance officials separately calling their control room to declare the bombing a "major incident".The coroner remarked: "If you weren't careful, you would find everybody arriving would be trying to ascertain the situation and there wouldn't be anybody attending to casualties."
