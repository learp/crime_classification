Jack Straw, the justice secretary, today signalled a more punitive approach to prisons by attacking the "criminal justice lobby" for putting the needs of offenders before those of victims.In a speech on prison policy to the Royal Society of Arts, Straw said it was time to reclaim the "unfashionable" language of punishment and reform and make clear that the justice system is there to serve victims and the law-abiding majority first.Straw said that ditching jargon in favour of terms in plain English - offenders, sentencers, victims and communities - "did not mean a return to the Victorian notions of dealing with crime, nor did it mean treating offenders inhumanely".The government had a duty to reform as well as punish offenders, he said. This included providing the drug-treatment support and education programmes needed by many of those who ended up in prison either on drugs or without basic literacy skills."A just and civilised society is one where criminals both pay their debt to society and are given the chance to change," Straw said. "Offenders must take their responsibility for their choice to commit a crime, they must be held to account for their actions, and challenged to make a better choice in the future."Straw's comments come at a time when prison chiefs are trying to cope with an inmate population of 83,383 in England and Wales. A recent fall in the use of short-term sentences by the courts means no prisoners are now being held in emergency police cells.Straw said the problem was that penal reformers had retreated into a "fog of platitudes" about offenders and had forgotten about victims.Just last month, Gordon Brown promised to appoint a victims' commissioner to give those who suffer from crime a stronger voice in government and in the community.Straw said that the "criminal justice lobby" needed to do more to put victims at the heart of their work and recognise that being a victim of crime is very traumatic.The justice minister said that phrases such as the "criminogenic needs of offenders" drove him nuts because the jargon created a barrier with the public and also because he profoundly disagreed with the idea that someone's amoral desire to steal should be seen as a "need", equivalent to those of victims.He said he had been "appalled" to read about a Halloween party, which took place in one prison, and vowed that no such event would ever take place again. "I cannot imagine the offence which must have been caused to victims and their families, to see those images splashed across the paper," he said.Highlighting the modernisation of the prison system, such as ending the "slopping out" system, Straw said prisons nevertheless remained the harshest punishment the courts could hand down.Straw said a decent prison regime should not forget or ignore the fact that prisoners had committed offences, but should also give prisoners the chance to reform.The government has worked over the past 11 years on getting the balance "right" between the needs of the accused for reform and those of the victims and communities.The justice secretary said that custody ought to be reserved for the most violent, dangerous and prolific offenders, with a stronger focus on prevention and punishment in the community for the less serious offenders.And he defended the new "titan" prisons, which he insisted would not be "large warehouses"."The truth of the matter is that it is much easier to find three sites for 2,500-place prison complexes than five times that number for 500-place prisons," he said."We have a duty to provide sufficient prison places, and to provide best value for money."Straw's comments on the use of language by criminal justice groups drew criticism from prison campaigners. Juliet Lyon , the director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "If you want to cut crime and prevent the next victim it's what you do, not what you say that counts," she said. The shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, said Straw's insistence on simple language did not detract from the fact that the government had failed on both "punishment and reform"."Prisoners who serve less than half of their sentence are not being punished and there is no reform in overcrowded jails where reoffending rates have risen. "Protesting about the interests of victims and posturing about punishment rings hollow from the minister who has just released over 30,000 prisoners early in a single year, and whose failure as home secretary to provide adequate jail capacity continues to disable the criminal justice system today."The Liberal Democrats said victims did not benefit from prisons "bursting at the seams".Lib Dem justice spokesman David Howarth said: "The government's obsession with punishment for its own sake, regardless of the consequences for future victims of crime, proves that ministers care more about getting a few easy headlines than they do about actually reducing crime. "The best thing Jack Straw can do is to try to ensure there are fewer victims, which is achieved through catching criminals, not posturing on penalties."
