A pilot suspected of being drunk was arrested on board a passenger jet at London's Heathrow's airport moments before he was due to fly hundreds of people to San Francisco, police confirmed today.The 44-year-old was breath-tested then escorted off the waiting plane by officers at terminal one at 9am yesterday.The first officer for United Airlines was arrested after a tip-off from ground staff, according to the Sun newspaper. He has been bailed to return to Heathrow police station on January 16.A police source said the man had been arrested on suspicion of "performing an aviation function whilst exceeding the prescribed alcohol limit".The legal limit for pilots is nine micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. This is almost four times stricter than the drink-drive limit of 35mcg in 100ml of breath.In a statement, United Airlines said: "United's alcohol policy is among the strictest in the industry and we have no tolerance for abuse of violation of this well-established policy."Safety is our No 1 priority and the pilot has been removed from service while we are cooperating with authorities and conducting a full investigation."
