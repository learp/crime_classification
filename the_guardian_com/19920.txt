A teenager has admitted making nearly 800 "malicious" hoax calls to police on Christmas Day and Boxing Day.Kerry Ann Moate made 756 bogus 999 calls on those two days alone, and a further 44 between 11 and 13 December.The 18-year-old, of Little Paxton, Cambridgeshire, was charged with two counts of persistently making use of public communication networks to cause annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety and is due to be sentenced next month.Cambridgeshire police said Moate was arrested during the early hours of Tuesday. She appeared at Huntingdon magistrates court on Thursday.Superintendent Paul Fullwood said: "The sheer volume of malicious calls was extremely disruptive to the force at a time of year that is always busy for police."Every time someone misuses the 999 they are potentially putting others lives at risk. This is especially true when we receive a large number of nuisance calls as it impacts on how quickly other emergency calls are answered."This behaviour is completely unacceptable and we will continue to actively pursue those who make malicious calls."
