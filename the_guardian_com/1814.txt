The prison population in England and Wales has hit an all-time high, new figures from the Home Office show.Yesterday, the number of people held in 139 prisons reached 75,550 - six more than the previous high in April last year - and Home Office estimates suggest this figure could reach 76,5000 to 84,000 by 2009.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, deemed the figures "very disappointing" and said the weight of public opinion may be pushing some judges into continuing to use custodial punishments.She said the public doubts the efficacy of community punishments, while judges, who can be swayed by public opinion, are passing harsher and longer sentences. Stressing the importance of improving knowledge of community penalties among judges, magistrates and the public, Ms Lyon said 58% of prisoners reoffend within two years of release.She called for a greater commitment from judges to diverting offenders into mental health or drug treatment programmes.Imprisonment rates in England and Wales have risen sharply over the past five years, from 125 per 100,000 of the population in 1999 to 141 currently. In comparison, Germany has 98 prisoners per 100,000 and France 93, according to figures from the Prison Reform Trust. Sentence lengths have increased, with the average length for burglaries rising to 18 months from 16, the number of lifers increasing sharply since 1998 and the number of prisoners serving short sentences also up. However, Home Office minister Paul Goggins has stated that as a result of the creation of the National Offender Management System, prisons should hold fewer than 80,000 inmates by 2009, though in the interim period this figure may be higher.Currently, England and Wales have space for 77,000 prisoners, a figure that has increased by 16,000 since 1997.
