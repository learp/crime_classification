Tough measures to combat touts profiteering from music and sports events will be unveiled today by the government, in a move that could see people needing photo ID to get into venues.Ministers want music and sports promoters to make greater use of measures that have successfully prevented touts from buying up tickets for high-profile events to sell on.In a consultation document launched today, they will cite measures at concerts by the singer Tom Waits in Edinburgh and Dublin last July where fans were allowed to buy only two tickets each. The holders' names were printed on the tickets and corresponding photo ID was needed for fans to gain access to venues.Ministers will also highlight the example set by the England and Wales Cricket Board, which has already cancelled thousands of tickets for this summer's Ashes and 20/20 tournaments after some buyers tried to get around rules preventing individuals buying up large numbers.They will encourage more football clubs to follow the example of Chelsea and Manchester United and adopt exchange schemes for fans who want to sell tickets they can no longer use.Many in the entertainment and sports industries will be disappointed that ministers are not considering more stringent measures, such as a ban on the resale of tickets, which would effectively kill touting.In recent years, the emergence of eBay and the burgeoning popularity of live music, has led to an increase in the number of "bedroom touts", who buy up tickets in bulk and sell them off at hugely inflated prices online. Resale websites such as Seatwave and Viagogo have also, according to some critics, exacerbated the problem. Meanwhile, a number of websites selling fraudulent ticket have been shut down by the authorities, though not before they have left many people out of pocket. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport will announce a package of measures to help consumers, including a proposal for the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers (Star) trade body to oversee a voluntary "code of principles" for ticketing. The aim would be that customers buying tickets from outlets displaying the Star logo would know they were dealing with reputable sellers.The sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, will say: "Real efforts are being made by some event organisers to thwart the touts and ensure as many tickets as possible go straight to real fans. But most of the time, tickets go to whoever is quickest online on the day they go on sale - and too much of the time, that is touts who simply want to resell at a profit. The industry now needs to quickly build on these successful new approaches and ensure they become much more widespread."
