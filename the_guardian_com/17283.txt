A police force plans to use corporate sponsorship to finance more officers, it was revealed today.Avon and Somerset constabulary aims to get 20 extra officers patrolling rural communities, hospitals and villages by the end of the year through sponsorship deals. But the chief constable, Steve Pilkington, stressed that police would only be sponsored in areas where there was a benefit to the wider community, and officers would not be providing private policing or security cover to sponsors. He said: "I am comfortable with sponsorship but it must be for the wider benefit of the community. If you were offered an additional teacher, doctor or nurse, would you have these anxieties? I think the answer would be no." Mr Pilkington stressed that the move would not lead to private organisations and communities getting extra police officers according to their ability to pay. He also said that no firm would be able to display corporate logos on police uniforms. Mr Pilkington said the scheme was to complement existing policing and not replace it. "Where there is a need for policing we will continue to meet the need from its budget," he said. Avon and Somerset police have been approached by local firms interested in sponsoring police. It already has two sponsored officers. Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton pays for an officer to patrol the hospital site, and in August this year local firm Thomson Racal Defence agreed to pay Â£35,000 to cover the cost of PC Phil Hutchings's wages and car so he could patrol Wells.
