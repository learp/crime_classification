The other day I reported that video viewing on the Telegraph Media Group's website had enjoyed a 108% year-on-year increase.But an intrusive video put up on the site yesterday suggests that the hunger to obtain and post footage has warped the Telegraph's editorial judgment.It concerned the murder of the two British tourists, David Miller and Hannah Witheridge, on the Thai island of Koh Tao.The 1m 15sec film shows a Telegraph reporter, Tom Phillips, being guided around the hotel where the pair had been staying.It did not add anything to our knowledge of the tragedy. Nor, given that the murders took place elsewhere, on the beach, could I see the pertinence of mentioning "some bloodied bandages in a dustbin." It was a wholly pointless, tasteless and irrelevant exercise to show the rooms where two murder victims had stayed, and it could not be justified as being in the public interest. I would complain if a tabloid did it, but this was a broadsheet.
