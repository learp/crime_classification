Prison sentences are to be reserved for violent and dangerous offenders only  as part of the biggest shakeup of criminal sentencing for a generation, to be announced on Wednesday.In a break with the "prison works" rhetoric of some previous home secretaries, David Blunkett is to unveil a series of "new and innovative sentences" which will mean that most of the 45,000 adults sentenced to less than 12 months each year will no longer go to prison.A leaked draft of the overview of the criminal justice white paper, called Justice For All, says that short prison sentences for a further 15,000 young offenders will be replaced with intensive supervision and surveillance programmes in the community."The radical reform of sentencing policy should mean fewer people in prison, and more time to rehabilitate those that are," says the draft white paper, which acknowledges that Britain has one of the highest prison populations in western Europe.The draft white paper argues that change is essential: "Too many people are in overcrowded prisons where the prison service has insufficient time to effect behavioural change, and too many custodial sentences are too short to make a difference. Prisoners who emerge from short-term sentences are reconvicted at a higher rate than those who serve longer sentences." This neither protects the public nor contributes enough to reducing crime.It says that "the punishment must fit the crime, and be fit for the purpose for which sentencing is intended. This means that sentences have to be tailored to the offender and the offence, and prison must be reserved for violent and dangerous offenders, with effective alternative options for the rest".The range of "new and innovative sentences" are designed to tackle the causes of criminal behaviour as well as punishing the offender. They are: "Custody plus" for adults, a short sentence of between 14 days and three months, followed by a community programme of at least six months. "Custody minus" that combines a suspended prison sentence with a community programme "Intermittent custody" that denies liberty through a custodial sentence, for example at the weekend, but allows the offender to continue working and maintain family ties. A new special sentence for dangerous, sexual and violent offenders.Tony Blair ordered a leak inquiry on Saturday after reports appeared claiming that the draft white paper would involve an overhaul of the right to choose jury trial. But the white paper draft seen by the Guardian shows that the jury reform contemplated is more limited, and does not include previous plans to abolish the right to choose jury trial.The package will cut the number of jury trials, but only a few defendants will lose the right to a jury trial if they want it. Judges will be able to try complex frauds without a jury, but the serious fraud office completed only eight such trials in 1999-2000.Defendants charged with middle-ranking offences will keep their right to elect trial by jury rather than by magistrates.Magistrates' sentencing powers will be increased from six to 12 months, to encourage them to keep more of the cases they now send for jury trial, but defendants will still be able to insist on a crown court jury trial if they want.Apart from complex fraud, legislation will allow the handful of cases "where the jury actually is being intimidated" to be tried by judge alone.Consideration will be given to extending judge-alone trials to other complex cases, but no legislation is promised.A formal US-style plea bargaining system, with the defendant being told in advance the sentence discount for pleading guilty, is also expected to produce more guilty pleas and reduce the number of cases which go for jury trial. But there will not be compulsion.Pilot schemes in which police and crown prosecutors work together to prepare a case are to be extended nationwide, with crown prosecutors taking over from police the role of charging suspects.
