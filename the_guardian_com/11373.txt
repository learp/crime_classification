Legislation to give new rights to victims of forced marriage in England and Wales received cross-party backing in the Lords today - but not crucial government support.The Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Bill, introduced by Liberal Democrat human rights lawyer Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC, aims to protect victims by civil remedies in the family courts following the government's refusal to make forced marriage a criminal offence.About 300 cases of forced marriage are reported each year, primarily among the Muslim and Sikh communities, but many go unreported. Ministers believe victims would be unlikely to take parents to a criminal court that could imprison them.Lord Lester's bill would make it unlawful for people outside the immediate family to "aid and abet" forced marriage. Injunctions could also be sought by third parties acting on victims' behalf.The bill, which is co-authored by the Southall Black Sisters pressure group, also allows civil proceedings to be brought to obtain compensation when an injunction proves ineffective.Lord Lester, opening today's debate, said: "The serious social evil which this bill seeks to combat and remedy is the forcing of children and young adults to marry against their will."It is a form of domestic violence, and there is a direct link between forced marriages and honour killings," he added.Lord Lester warned: "It is a form of sexual enslavement, sometimes amounting to domestic slavery. A dowry is often paid, and women are bought and sold in the process of being forced into a so-called marriage. Cultural tolerance must not be a cloak for oppression or injustice within the immigrant communities themselves."The bill was backed by leading Muslim peers Baroness Uddin and Lord Ahmed, who co-chaired a government task force on the issue in 1999-2000, and by Tory Lord Sheikh, chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum.Human rights minister Baroness Ashton supported the aims of the bill but made it clear that the government remained to be convinced of its practicality."I don't know yet if this bill is the right answer," she said. "These young, vulnerable people need protection and the law should ensure that they are protected. It is a combination of the law, education and empowerment that we are looking for."Ministers would also consider whether existing law could be improved in different ways and whether the bill's provision for awarding compensation was right, said Baroness Ashton.
