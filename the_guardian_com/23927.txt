The disclosure that senior police officers want to see the introduction of "instant justice" powers, including town centre banning orders, sparked a barrage of criticism, including from rank-and-file police constables.The proposals for an extension in police summary powers, revealed by the Guardian yesterday, included three-month bans on gang members mixing with each other and powers to seize and crush the cars of "yob drivers" who persistently drive without insurance, tax or a licence.The proposals have been put forward by Mark Rowley, Surrey's assistant chief constable, as part of an internal debate within the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) over how the expansion in neighbourhood policing would meet public expectations at a time when the criminal justice system is "slow and inaccessible".But Alan Gordon, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, said yesterday he was concerned that the proposals would allow the police in some instances to become judge and jury, and while some powers had credibility others were flawed.He said there were problems with the idea of giving a police constable the power to exclude individuals from a town centre at night for "an appropriate period", saying it was difficult to identify their age so their parents could be informed if they were juveniles.There were difficulties with the fact that the technology did not exist to allow one police officer to know that a person had already been banned.The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were also alarmed at the possible extension of summary justice. David Davis, the shadow home secretary, said: "We cannot bypass the court system. It is up to the justice system to scrutinise and take judicial decisions, not the police."He said it was the underlying problem of the "slow and inaccessible criminal justice system" that needed to be addressed rather than dispensing new "instant justice" powers.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, also warned against trying to short circuit the court system."While the fight against crime and antisocial behaviour is of paramount importance, the answer is not to bypass due process," he said. "The vital role of the police will be compromised if we also ask them to act as judge and jury."The Local Government Association warned the police about going down this road. "The police already have powers to deal quickly and decisively with rowdy behaviour in many areas," said Graham Brown, deputy chairman of the LGA. "The courts may be relatively slow but equally local people may question extra powers that would allow the police to dispatch justice in this way."But Bob Quick, Surrey's chief constable, who sits on Acpo's workforce modernisation committee with Mr Rowley, defended the proposals, saying that there was a professional debate going on within the police over how to deal with people who were "impervious to the current criminal justice system" and the need to speed up the process.He said there would be "checks and balances" alongside the powers which were needed to meet the concerns of communities blighted by antisocial behaviour.Mr Quick said that at present the victims of crime had to wait months for a solution to be provided by the criminal justice system.An Acpo spokesman said yesterday the association would finalise its proposals before putting them to ministers. The government is to publish its proposals to extend summary justice powers of the police later this year.
