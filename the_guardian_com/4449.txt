Men and women who abuse their partners should be identified on a domestic violence register, the Association of Chief Police Officers said today.Chief Constable Brian Moore, ACPO's spokesman on domestic violence, said dozens of lives could be saved if the perpetrators of domestic violence were tracked in the same way as sex offenders.He told MPs that, while the charity Victim Support helped more than 400,000 victims of domestic violence a year, research indicated that the true level of abuse amounted to a "huge" 13m incidents a year.In 2006/07, 142 people were killed in domestic violence attacks - including 38 men.Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee, which is carrying out an inquiry into domestic violence, Moore said: "There is no domestic violence abuse register on which perpetrators should be placed."I think it should be given considerable extra thought by virtue of the marked correlation between domestic violence and homicide or serious violence."Those who go from relationship to relationship across boundaries should be subject to amenable and proportionate tracking."Moore said that, without a register, sharing between agencies was "inadequate"."Each agency may have part of the picture. But it is only when all these pieces of information come together from police, education, social services and from housing authorities that we have the clearest picture of those at risk."The law in this regard is inadequate. The law on information sharing is passive - there is no obligation to share when someone is at risk."We have to act now because year on year other people are losing their lives because of this gap in the law."Moore said the Home Office was adopting a wait-and-see policy and that ministers did not seem to want to change the law."I wish I could share their optimism," he said."There are thousands of protocols about sharing information. Thousands of protocols must tell you that there is no clear system."We are not optimistic that, given the number of people who die each year as a result of domestic abuse, we can wait for some undefined period." After the hearing, Moore told journalists he believed the number of deaths from domestic violence each year could be halved by adopting better data-sharing methods."The Crown Prosecution Service's domestic violence implementation manager, June Watson, told the committee that latest figures showed specialist courts set up to deal with domestic violence were achieving "successful outcomes" in 70% of cases, a better result than other courts.
