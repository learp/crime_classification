Richard Latham, for the prosecution, claimed that Ian Huntley made two "slips of the tongue" in the days after the disappearance of Holly and Jessica:· On Thursday, August 8, the police announced they were to hold a press conference to announce a "very important piece of information". It turned out that they were going to reveal they had discovered CCTV footage of the girls. But on hearing of the press conference Mr Huntley asked a journalist: "Have they found the girls' clothes?" Mr Latham said: "He has given something away. How did he know on Thursday 8 August that the girls' clothing had been parted from their bodies?" The bodies were not found until nine days later. · Two days after the girls disappeared Mr Huntley was talking about a sighting of the girls the day after they disappeared, some miles from Soham. It turned out to be false. Mr Huntley said the woman had "supposedly" seen the girls, implying he knew she must have been mistaken. Mr Latham said: "An innocent man could not have known that."
