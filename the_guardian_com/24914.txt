Amy Winehouse will not face charges over an alleged conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Police yesterday cleared the Grammy winner of any involvement in a case for which her husband Blake Fielder-Civil has been on remand in jail since November. Winehouse was arrested last December, but released on police bail. A Scotland Yard spokesman said that following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service "no further action will be taken".Fielder-Civil appeared at Snaresbrook crown court in east London yesterday and pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He is accused along with a friend, Michael Brown, of assaulting the landlord of a Hoxton pub on June 20 last year. A spokesman for Winehouse said: "Amy thanks the police for their professionalism."
