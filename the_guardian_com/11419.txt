An airline worker who killed his wife then forced her body into a suitcase before dumping it in the Thames was jailed for life yesterday. Zaheer Ahmed, 28, must serve at least 15 years for murdering Adeeba Ahmed before he can be considered eligible for parole.Judge Peter Rook said at the Old Bailey that Ahmed had strangled his wife, a check-in assistant, before "callously and calculatedly" trying to dispose of her body. "She was a fine young woman who was loved by her family and friends," he told Ahmed. "She had developed into an intelligent, articulate and lively person. Everyone loved Adeeba. She adored you and was utterly loyal to you. You had priority, she considered you before her family and friends."Ahmed, from Langley, Berkshire, reported his 27-year-old wife missing on Valentine's Day 2004, a day after the murder. He told police he had dropped her off to go to the hairdresser before they went out for a meal that evening, according to Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting. But police found his Valentine cards to her unopened at their home. The two she had bought for him had not been written. Two days later, a passerby found a suitcase by the Thames at Barnes, south-west London.Mr Laidlaw said the couple had appeared to be devoted to one another but his family had felt she was not good enough for him. Zaheer denied murder.
