A governor brought in to sort out problems at Liverpool's troubled Walton prison has resigned to join the private sector after six months.John Smith, formerly at Strangeways in Manchester, went to Walton in April just before a report which described the prison as failing. The prison was then threatened with privatisation and staff are due to report to the Home Office next week on how the prison meets security and safety targets and how offenders are resettled after release. Mr Smith has moved to another job within the prison service before joining the board of Premier Prisons. Staff heard that he was leaving only last Friday. He has been replaced at Walton by Catherine James, who previously headed health care at the jail and took up her new post on Monday. "Because of the importance of performance testing, we wanted to get a new governor in place as quickly as possible," said a prison service spokesman. "There is no suggestion that Mr Smith has behaved improperly."
