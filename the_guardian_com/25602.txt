The case of two men accused of a Â£50,000 blackmail plot against a royal family member was "a joke" and "a farce", the jury was told today.Ronald Thwaites QC, described the evidence against Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan as "insubstantial, insignificant, and incomplete".The pair's attempts to sell a tape featuring comments about the unnamed royal were no more than "buying and selling in the real world", Thwaites told the Old Bailey.He claimed jurors were being asked to convict on the basis of a "shrug of the shoulders" during a police sting operation at a London hotel.Strachan and McGuigan were arrested following a meeting in September last year with a man they thought was a royal aide, but who was in fact an undercover police officer.The men were trying to sell eight hours of recordings featuring claims about the royal, known as witness A throughout the trial, by an employee, witness D, the court heard. Strachan had previously failed in his attempts to sell the material to newspapers.Strachan, 31, of Fulham, south-west London, and McGuigan, 41, of Battersea, south London, both deny demanding money with menaces.In his closing speech to jurors, Thwaites, defending McGuigan, said Strachan was a "Walter Mitty" type fantasist who believed he was close to the royals.McGuigan, he said, was merely "unwise in his friendships". He argued that attempts to sell the tapes by claiming newspapers had already made offers was no more than "buying and selling in the real world".Thwaites said: "It may be a dirty business; it may not be a very moral business; it may be despicable." But it was not criminal, he told the court.He said officers had failed "abysmally" to gather evidence against the defendants and claimed that jurors were being invited to "fill the gap with a shrug".Thwaites was referring to Strachan's body language during the sting meeting when he was asked by police whether publicist Max Clifford would get the tapes if he did not pay. Strachan never completed his answer.Thwaites said that if the prosecution were right, "a shrug of the shoulders is all that you need to be found guilty at the Old Bailey".He added: "This is a joke. This whole case is a farce from beginning to end. You cannot convict people on evidence as poor as this - as insubstantial, as insignificant, as incomplete as this."The trial continues.
