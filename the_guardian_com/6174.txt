Harold Shipman was allowed to handle drugs despite a conviction for forging prescriptions, the public inquiry into the deaths of his patients was told as it sat for the first time today.Police, the Home Office and medical authorities all failed to stop GP Harold Shipman handling drugs despite the conviction.Caroline Swift QC told the hearing in Manchester that Shipman had been fined after he became addicted to a painkiller, pethidine, in his first practice in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, in 1975. But a committee of the General Medical Council decided that no further action should be taken against him, a view also adopted by the Home Office.Ms Swift was opening the inquiry into the career of the family doctor who was jailed in January last year for the murders of 15 elderly women patients.The first phase of the two-year inquiry is to examine at least 466 deaths among the doctor's patients and former patients in Todmorden and Hyde over a period of 25 years.An interim report, expected by the end of this year, could reveal the true death toll of the GP.Dame Janet Smith, the High Court judge leading the inquiry said the death toll could increase, but stressed that this should not yet be seen as an estimate of the number of victims Shipman might have claimed. "I anticipate there will be many cases in which I will be able to say there is no cause for suspicion," she said."However, it will not be possible in every case for me to say one way or the other," she added. She said that she hoped to be able to reach definite conclusions in "hundreds" of cases.The second phase of the inquiry will examine how Shipman was able to continue killing for so long without being found out. A third phase will look at possible changes in procedures before the judge issues her final report, expected in spring 2003.Trained counsellors were on hand at the opening of the inquiry, expected to be attended by dozens of victims' relatives. Others were watching a broadcast at Hyde library seven miles away via a live television link.Hi-tech computer equipment, capable of scanning a million pages of documents, has been installed and remote-controlled cameras will relay images and documents onto four giant screens in the chamber where the inquiry is being held.Photo gallery The story in picturesAudio Harold Shipman is questioned by the police Read the transcriptGovernment audit Download the report Extracts from the reportThe trial Complete case reportsRelated articles 11.01.01: Police investigate deaths of more Shipman victims 08.01.01: Minister admits watchdog is not Shipman-proof 05.01.01: Safeguards were not tough enough, admits department of healthUseful links The Shipman inquiry Greater Manchester police General Medical Council Department of health.
