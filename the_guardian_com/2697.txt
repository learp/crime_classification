The peer and furniture tycoon Lord Kirkham was cleared by a jury yesterday of a road rage attack on a driver who had allegedly called him "fattie" and a "git".The founder and head of DFS praised the jury system after a three-day hearing which heard accounts of the two men fighting in a South Yorkshire road.Kirkham, who was adopted by a miner's family when he was three months old, left the dock at Doncaster crown court to thank individually the seven men and five women who had tried the case after he was found not guilty of assault occasioning bodily harm. "To be found not guilty by 12 people is absolutely magnificent," he said, before wishing everyone in the courtroom a merry Christmas. "I have always believed in the British justice system and the idea of the jury."Kirkham was on the way to catch a helicopter flight to London when the altercation with Keith Pearce, a Doncaster council engineer, took place. The two men told contradictory stories about who had cut up whom.Two witnesses in the village of Sprotbrough, near Doncaster, where Kirkham has one of his two homes, told the court he had apparently gone for Pearce in a fury. But Kirkham said he had been harassed and abused by Pearce, who had driven his Ford Punto in front of the peer's Mercedes and braked abruptly.Kirkham, 64, is a generous donor to charity and is known in the region for his irreverent approach to establishment figures. When he floated DFS (Direct Furniture Sales) on the stock exchange in 1998, he celebrated by buying Thomas Gainsborough's Peasants Going to Market.
