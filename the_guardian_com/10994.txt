Police in Northern Ireland have revealed that a bomb left in the centre of Derry was a "substantial viable device" with the potential to cause large numbers of casualties.Dissident republicans opposed to the peace process are thought to have been behind the bomb attack on Sunday evening.The PSNI district commander in Derry, Stephen Martin, said he believed it could have caused death or serious injury.Dozens of elderly residents were moved from a sheltered housing development due to the alert, and 15 choirboys were told to get out of the nearby St Columb's Church of Ireland cathedral.The alert followed a telephone bomb warning which was received at about 6.45pm on Sunday evening.Martin said he expected a dissident republican group to claim it had carried out the attack."In my view it will be either the Real IRA or Óglaigh na hÉireann," he said.The police, he said, would try to return the area to normal as soon as possible, but they would be cautious.He added: "If a bomb such as this had gone off it would have killed or seriously injured people," he said."It would have caused substantial damage to nearby property; to the courthouse, to the Masonic hall, to the Deanery, to other residents."It would have probably damaged the residential home, Alexander House."It's just a highly built up residential part of the city within the walls and a device this size would have caused considerable devastation."He also said that police patrols had been increased in response to a perceived increase in the risk of violence."It's two years since the threat in Northern Ireland has been escalated to severe and acts like this are a strong possibility," he said.Dean William Morton of St Columb's cathedral described the incident as a "logistical nightmare".He contacted parents of choirboys, some of them as young as seven, who were at the cathedral rehearsing for the opera, Tosca."It's achieving absolutely nothing other than galvanising the resolve on the part of the huge majority of people here to move ahead," he said."I am sure it will all be cleared and life will continue."Sinn Fein's assemblywoman for Derry, Martina Anderson, said the device was out of step with the views of the vast majority of the people of the city."We are all of the view that an attack on any place in this city is an attack on us all."The SDLP representative, Pat Ramsey, said the residents who had to leave Alexander House, were "distressed, angry and frustrated" at what had happened.Meanwhile, the Garda Síochána in Dublin are linking a shooting incident in the city on Sunday to dissident republicans. They believe the incident was a so-called punishment shooting against three men in their 20s in the Blanchardstown area of west Dublin.The trio are still being treated in hospital. Two were admitted to Connolly hospital in Blanchardstown. One remains in the intensive care unit while the other is stable.The third man was admitted to the Mater Misericordiae University hospital, where his condition is described as stable. Gardaí are treating the attack as attempted murder.The men, two cousins and their friend, were drinking vodka at 11.15am in Corduff Park when two gunmen walked up and shot them. The gunmen escaped in the direction of Edgewood Lawns.Two were hit several times in the body but managed to run to a nearby house to raise the alarm. The third was shot in the head – a bullet lodged just below his eye.The three were known to gardaí for violent and anti-social behaviour. One served time in prison for an assault on a teacher eight years ago.
