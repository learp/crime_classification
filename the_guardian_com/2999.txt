The campaign to free a teenage Liverpool fan from jail in Bulgaria suffered a setback yesterday when the man he was convicted of wounding in a street fight said he was certain that police had got the right man.Martin Georgiev, a barman who suffered a fractured skull in the attack in Golden Sands, Varna, dismissed a signed confession by another Liverpool man, Graham Sankey, which claims responsibility for the assault. Mr Georgiev, 25, who is married with two children, was shown a photograph by Sky News of the convicted fan, 18-year-old Michael Shields, and asked if it showed the man who hit him with paving slab. He replied: "Yes. I remember very clearly his face." The news was relayed last night to hundreds of people attending a candlelight vigil in Liverpool for Shields, who was sentenced last week to 15 years' imprisonment, and fines and compensation totalling Â£70,000. The teenager was staying in Golden Sands after Liverpool's European Champions' League triumph in nearby Istanbul at the end of May. He insists that he was asleep in his hotel at the time, but a copy of Mr Sankey's confession, which was faxed to the court, was rejected because it was unsigned and had not been the subject of a British police inquiry. Mr Sankey has since signed a copy but legal problems delay further legal moves in the case. Mr Georgiev said: "I am not revengeful but the man who has done it, he must bear the consequences. I feel handicapped for my family ... I can't take care of them." He faces months of neurological treatment and may never make a full recovery, or even carry out simple routines such as lifting heavy objects or going outside in hot weather. In response to the campaign supporting Shields, Varna's district judge, Angelina Lazarova, pointed to the lack of any supporting evidence for Mr Sankey's confession, and the court has issued a statement emphasising that Shields's trial lasted three days and was public and transparent.
