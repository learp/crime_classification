Police have promised a higher profile on the streets of north east England following a spate of knife attacks that have left three young people dead.A man in his twenties became the second person to be knifed to death in less than a month after an apparently unprovoked altercation with a group of youths outside his home in Sunderland yesterday morning.Police are investigating possible links to a further knife attack in a neighbouring street three minutes later, when a man was stabbed in his stomach.Detective Chief Inspector Roger Ford, who is leading the inquiry into yesterday's murder, tried to reassure the public by promising a greater police presence on the streets until the perpetrators were caught. 'There were a number of incidents in a relatively short space of time and we are appealing for anyone who saw or heard anything or has any information to come forward,' he said.The incidents follow the fatal stabbing of 15-year-old Shane Jackson in Newcastle upon Tyne earlier last week and the murder of Mark Smith, 16, on 3 May, also in Newcastle.But Northumbria police insisted the region did not have a specific problem with knife crime, pointing out that of 20 woundings in Sunderland since January, three involved knives.'There isn't a knife culture in Northumbria,' said Superintendent Kay Blyth, area commander for Sunderland. 'The region remains a safe place to live and work.' Attacks on strangers were rare.
