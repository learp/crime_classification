   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest A man was arrested and then released on police bail in Cambridgeshire yesterday by officers hunting for the protester who threw a fire extinguisher from a roof at Wednesday's anti-tuition fees demonstration.The fire extinguisher was thrown after protesters swarmed into Millbank Tower, the Westminster building that houses the Conservative party's headquarters. The incident, which police say could have led to the death of an officer, was caught on video.The man, 23, understood to be from Reading and studying at Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, was arrested by Cambridgeshire police at the request of the Metropolitan police. He was held at Parkside police station in Cambridge, the police said.In a statement, the Met said: "Police in Cambridgeshire, on behalf of the Metropolitan police service, arrested a 23-year-old man on suspicion of violent disorder. This arrest follows an investigation into public disorder on Wednesday 10 November where a fire extinguisher was thrown from the roof of Millbank Tower."Last night Scotland Yard said another teenager had been arrested in Folkestone, Kent, in connection with the disturbances. He is not suspected of being involved in throwing the fire extinguisher. The student, thought to attend university locally, was the 56th person to be arrested.Yesterday a man claiming to be a territorial support group officer told the BBC how the metal object narrowly missed him: "It landed right behind me â€“ literally no more than six inches," he said."I think somebody would have been visiting my wife and children and saying I was either dead or very seriously injured, the height that it was dropped from."After seeing the extinguisher land, the crowd turned against those on the roof, shouting: "Stop throwing shit".Chris Allison, Met police assistant commissioner, said: "Clearly that is a very serious offence and we are attempting to bring the person who did that to justice."Paul McKeever, the chairman of the Police Federation, said that whoever threw the fire extinguisher should be charged with attempted murder.Yesterday the Met revealed that 10 of the 56 people arrested during the disorder were under 18 and most of the others were students aged between 18 and 26.An Anglia Ruskin spokesman said: "We understand that one of our students was arrested earlier today in connection with the incident at Millbank Tower. We are co-operating fully with the police in their inquiries."Activist websites have published instructions for those worried they may be identified and arrested in the aftermath of the violence.
