A British Airways captain who believed he was "stitched up" by a prenuptial agreement has been jailed for 26 years for killing his estranged wife and burying her body in a pre-prepared grave.Robert Brown, 47, killed millionaire Joanna with a claw hammer in their large family home in Ascot, Berkshire as their two young children cowered in a playroom. He then bundled her body into the boot of his car and later dumped it in a makeshift coffin in Windsor Great Park.He killed her on 31 October last year, just days after a ruling at the supreme court in which judges decided a "marriage contract" was binding. Brown and his 46-year-old wife were due to attend the high court in November 2010 for a final hearing to resolve their own financial disputes.A jury at Reading crown court acquitted him of murder but convicted him of obstructing a coroner from holding an inquest. Brown of Winkfield, Berkshire had previously admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.Passing sentence, judge Mr Justice Cooke told him: "You intended to kill, you intended to conceal the body and to hide the evidence of the killing."Brown looked skywards as sentence was passed and his wife's relatives broke down in tears in the public gallery.The judge said: "You never called an ambulance or took her to hospital and in my judgment you never had any intention to do so. Indeed, you took her body to a remote part of Windsor Great Park in the car and then carried her body and put it into a garden box in a hole that you had dug previously, having left a spade nearby wrapped in tarpaulin."He added: "You took extensive steps to ensure that her body would never be found but when it became plain that the evidence was so strong, you directed the police to the site."
