A thief who took part in a raid on a petrol station that led to a cash machine being blown to pieces, causing £165,000 of damage, has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.Damien Limb, 27, was the driver for the bungled heist at a Texaco station that completely destroyed the ATM, scattered £20,000 of cash across the forecourt as well as damaging petrol pumps and the station's canopy.The heavy door of the ATM, at a filling station in Weyhill, Hampshire, was blown 25 metres away and a canopy stanchion was sliced through "like a knife through butter". The cash machine contained £20,000 but the gang only managed to scoop up £3,400, with more than £16,000 recovered.Police said the thieves had been lucky they had not killed themselves or others, from pumping oxygen and propane gas into the cash machine, as they had no control over the blast.The masked gang prised open the machine using a crowbar and then pumped the gases into it through hoses. They sealed the hole with paper, Winchester crown court heard. After 40 seconds the mixture ignited, probably due to an electrical circuit inside or heat from the machine, and it blew up.Residents nearby heard a "huge explosion" at 3.15am on 31 March this year as debris was hurled 38 metres (124ft) away.The incident, including the explosion, was captured on CCTV, which showed the ATM being completely destroyed before three men dressed in black started scrambling about trying to pick up £20 notes.The damage to the garage was £150,000 and the ATM cost £15,000, the court heard.Limb, from Lichfield Road, Bristol, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to cause criminal damage with unknown persons. The others in the gang have not been caught.Limb was traced because police followed a trail of cash and wheel tracks from the canisters' trolley from the scene, under a bridge where a receipt for water and a small amount of petrol from a garage in Bristol was found. CCTV from that garage identified Limb.The drug user said he had not realised the other gang members would cause so much damage and he was not present when they tried to steal the cash because he had stayed in the van.Michael Warren, prosecuting, said: "As a result of that explosion police were called and were quickly on the scene and the equipment used to blow the ATM was found."Two canisters of oxygen and propane gas were around the corner and also against a wall was a 5ft wrecking bar, a Volvic bottle with petrol in it, and a wick, and by that a bottle top that had the defendant's DNA and a partial match for two other people. It is not a particularly well known method of attacking an ATM machine and it had devastating results."In mitigation, Richard Onslow said Limb, who has a string of previous convictions for burglary and attacking cash machines, had fallen in with the wrong crowd but that he was no mastermind. "He was asked to provide transport, which he did for this enterprise," he said.
