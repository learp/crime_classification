A couple who were jailed for killing a three-year-old boy by force-feeding him salt were today released on bail by the court of appeal.In January, Ian Gay, 39, and his 45-year-old wife Angela were sentenced to five years for manslaughter over the death of Christian Blewitt. They now face a retrial later in the year.The couple had been planning to adopt the child along with his two brothers, who were removed from their care after Christian's death.He was found unconscious in his room at their Â£500,000 house in Halesowen, West Midlands, in December 2002.In their original trial, the Gays were accused of force-feeding him with salt as a punishment, but the jury was not presented with evidence that he could have suffered from a type of "salt diabetes".At a hearing last month, the chemical pathologist Dr Glyn Walters said Christian could have been suffering from "osmostat resetting", an extremely rare condition that allows the body to build up salt deposits.Michael Mansfield QC, for the defence, said the jury had not been presented with Dr Walters' evidence at the original trial. "It is a case based in the realms of speculation," he added.Lord Justice Richards ruled that the medical testimony only formed part of the evidence in the case, and said the withheld evidence could have altered the outcome of the trial.He said the couple had taken on the "immense burden" of looking after the three children and had been "in a position of considerable stress". Their situation has been compared to that of Angela Cannings, whose conviction for killing her two children was overturned in 2003. It came after doubt was cast on expert evidence claiming she suffered from Munchausen's by proxy syndrome.Medical experts at the Gays' original trial were unable to agree on the amount of salt Christian had in his body, with estimates ranging from one to six teaspoons.The withholding of evidence about osmostat resetting meant the couple could only have been convicted of murder over the alleged force-feeding of salt or manslaughter in relation to an injury to Christian's head, Mr Mansfield said.Peter Gooderham, a former GP and tutor at Cardiff Law School, who specialises in the role of expert witnesses, said expert evidence in medical cases should be more carefully scrutinised."Inevitably, there will be times where the court relies on expert evidence - but that's but that's not to say that, in effect, the experts should make the decision," he said. "Evidence should be very carefully tested in the courts, and the court must make the final decision."
