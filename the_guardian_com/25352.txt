A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a frenzied knife attack on a schoolgirl in a Lancashire park.Lancashire police have also released CCTV images of the moments before 14-year-old Jessica Knight was "left for dead" in Astley Park, Chorley.She collapsed from the multiple knife wounds and was found unconscious and covered in blood by a passing cyclist.Detective Superintendent Steve Brunskill, who is leading the investigation, said: "The CCTV images were captured just five minutes before Jessica was attacked and I would urge anyone who thinks they may have seen her in that time to contact us."If you were in the area at that time it may also be possible that you could have seen the person responsible for this nasty attack, and we would really like to speak to you."Jessica's parents, Jill and Richard Knight, said: "Our 14-year-old daughter was walking through the local public park when she was subjected to a senseless attack."She has been stabbed and left for dead. Please contact the local police with any information to bring the person responsible to justice."Last night Jessica remained in a critical condition in Chorley hospital after undergoing surgery. "This is a particularly nasty assault on a defenceless young girl," Brunskill said yesterday.Extra police, included mounted officers and neighbourhood teams, were on patrol in the village, an affluent semi-rural district of Chorley where police said such attacks were very rare. Officers were also visiting schools, while a mobile police station was due to be set up.Police said it was quite normal for the teenager to visit local shops and go with her friends to the park, which is known as a meeting place for youngsters. Minutes after Jessica entered the park, screams were heard. She was wearing a black fur-lined hooded jacket, blue jeans and white trainers.Police were with her family at the hospital last night and were waiting to speak to her in an attempt to piece together what happened.Anybody with information should contact the incident room at Chorley on 01257 246272 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
