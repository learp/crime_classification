A man has been charged with aggravated burglary following a raid in which a homeowner allegedly stabbed a man, causing fatal injuries.Michael Anthony Thorpe, 33, of Heald Green, Manchester, has been charged with aggravated burglary and will appear at Stockport magistrates court on Tuesday.He was arrested after two men allegedly forced their way into the home of Vincent Cooke in Bramhall, Stockport, on Saturday evening. One of the intruders, Raymond Jacob, 37, from Wythenshawe, south Manchester, suffered fatal stab wounds in the struggle.Cooke, 39, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and was questioned by detectives. He is now on bail until next month.Chief Superintendent Tim Forber of Greater Manchester police said: "We believe the dead man was one of two men who were attempting to carry out a burglary at the house." He would not comment on whether the other raider was injured during the burglary.Chief Superintendent Rebekah Sutcliffe said on Monday: "This is clearly a distressing incident for all concerned â€“ Raymond's family, the occupants of the house and the wider community in Bramhall. We understand that people will have strong opinions on this subject and this remains a matter of national debate."However, I want to stress that my officers have to operate within the law and our primary aim is to establish exactly what happened that night."I also understand that residents in Bramhall will be concerned about their safety. I can reassure them now that we have a mobile police station in the area and will have extra dedicated patrols on the streets to provide an obvious presence."I want to stress that tackling burglary is a priority for police in Stockport and offences have fallen consistently over the last three years. This year so far there have been 55 fewer victims of domestic burglary in Stockport and 17 fewer in Stockport West, which incorporates Bramhall."It is the third time in six months that intruders have been killed in Greater Manchester. In June this year, Peter Flanagan, 59, was not charged after being arrested on suspicion of murder when an intruder was stabbed to death in his house in Salford.Cecil Coley, 72, was freed without charge after he fatally stabbed an armed raider when a gang smashed their way into his florist's shop in Old Trafford, Manchester, in July.
