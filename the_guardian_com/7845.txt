Two hundred fraudulent auctions happen every day on the eBay website in Britain, a consumer group claimed yesterday, as it warned the millions of Britons who use internet auction sites to beware.Sarah Kidner, of Which? Computing magazine, told the Evening Standard: "That figure will only get higher as more and more people use the site." Examples of fraud include the sale of counterfeit items and the attempted theft of personal details. The Metropolitan police warned auction site users to pay for goods on delivery, rather than send cash in advance. Ms Kidner said: "We are not telling people to avoid these websites, but what we are say ing is read the guidelines and make sure you are covered if something goes wrong." eBay said just 0.01% of transactions ended in confirmed fraud. Gareth Griffiths, the head of trust and safety at eBay UK, said: "We have lots of systems in place to drive the number of fraudulent transactions down. "We try to solve the problem at source, but [are] constantly telling people to use the same common sense they would use in any other environment." The site, which has 9 million registered UK users, advises buyers to read feedback from other buyers about sellers, and to contact them through the site with any questions. It also has compensation arrangements for users who are left out-of-pocket because of fraud.
