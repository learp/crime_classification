Tony Blair today condemned violence against England supporters in Scotland after incidents at the weekend in which a boy and a disabled driver were assaulted for wearing England shirts.The driver, Ian Smith, was dragged from his car in Aberdeen and punched in the face because of his England shirt and the St George's cross on his car."I am sure everybody condemns what was an appalling and totally unjustifiable attack," the prime minister told the House of Commons during Question Time. In Edinburgh Hugo Clapshaw, 7, was playing football in a park with his father, Damon, 34, when a man in a Rangers shirt hit Hugo on the head and said: "This is Scotland, not fucking England". When Mr Clapshaw intervened the man knocked him down and kicked him. Lothian and Borders police said they were still looking for the man, and described the incident as "horrible for the family". The First Minister, Jack McConnell, also criticised the attackers, describing them as "mindless thugs".Hugo told the Scottish Sun newspaper that he would continue to wear his shirt. "The man whacked me very hard. He was a lot bigger than me. I am still going to wear the top. My mum bought it for me because I'm supporting England," he said.The SNP shadow justice minister, Kenny MacAskill, called the reported attacks "appalling". "This is a football tournament, not a re-run of the Battle of Bannockburn or a battle of tribal warfare," he told BBC Radio Scotland.
