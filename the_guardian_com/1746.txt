A teenager who raped a woman in her 90s has been jailed for 16 years.Lee-Joseph Dixon forced his way into his victim's house in Cardiff after making his way home from an all-night party.The 18-year-old ignored the frail pensioner's plea to leave her alone, and a court heard he "had not one ounce of pity" for his victim.DI Stuart Wells of South Wales police's specialist crime investigations squad said the incident was one of the most distressing cases he had ever worked on."This was a very serious incident, which understandably caused a lot of public concern â€¦ an elderly lady suffered a dreadful attack in her own home."This has been a life-altering experience but one where the victim and her family have shown remarkable emotional strength in dealing with what happened to her."Newport crown court heard Dixon began randomly knocking on doors at 4am on 24 May as he walked home from a party.When a woman in her dressing gown opened her front door, Dixon forced his way into her home.After the attack, the woman, 91, was found by police shaking in the hallway and still clutching her telephone. She stayed in hospital for two weeks before being transferred to a care home. The woman was later unable to return to her home, which she had lived in since she was a child.In a statement, her son told the court he was surprised the attack had not killed his mother. "We are struggling to come to terms with how a young man can do such an horrific violating act to an old woman in her own home where she is meant to feel safest," he added.Dixon had pleaded guilty to rape, but said he had no memory of the attack. Judge Hale jailed the defendant for 16 years. Dixon will also be on the sex offenders register for life.Kelly Huggins, a senior crown prosecutor, said Dixon was responsible for a particularly brutal and abhorrent attack on an elderly and extremely vulnerable victim.She said: "The Crown Prosecution Service worked alongside South Wales police from an early stage in their investigation. Together, we were able to swiftly build a strong prosecution case against Dixon, leading to his guilty plea."While it is right that Dixon has had to face up to his actions in a criminal court, we should not forget that his reprehensible behaviour has had a devastating effect on his victim."She has understandably found it hard to return to the relatively independent life she had enjoyed prior to this horrific incident and our thoughts are with her."
