A British man who masterminded a scam in which people were charged thousands of pounds for American work visas was sentenced to 15 months in jail today.Michael Leggett, a former double-glazing salesman, told his victims his firm would secure the necessary paperwork to allow them to emigrate legally to the US.Leggett used forged signatures along with fake addresses and phone numbers to try to secure visas for at least 12 Britons through his company, Royal Development.But the US embassy in London became suspicious and the clients, most of whom said they had paid Â£75,000, never received their documents or the coveted E-2 work visa.The 52-year-old admitted two counts of conspiracy to commit visa fraud at the US district court in Florida after striking a plea deal with prosecutors earlier this year.Leggett, originally from Norwich but who was living in Florida, must also serve three months in community detention and three months in home detention upon his release before being deported back to the UK.Leggett was also ordered to return the money made in the scam. The exact amount will be set at a hearing in Orlando, Florida, on February 28. He told investigators he came up with the idea for the scam in January 2003, at the same time that his Norfolk business, Farmhouse Windows and Conservatories, went into liquidation leaving customers and suppliers claiming they were owed thousands of pounds.The Florida plan involved selling his clients construction companies with which they could erect houses for themselves as a licensed builder for Royal Development."During the interview, Leggett admitted that most of the investors would not have gotten involved with Royal Development but for the possibility of a visa," the criminal complaint said.Between September 2003 and October 2004, at least 12 companies were sold to UK investors.Prosecutors said Leggett had agreed to "make full restitution to any victims identified in the pre-sentence report" as part of his plea deal.He also agreed to "co-operate fully" with the US "in the investigation and prosecution of other persons".
