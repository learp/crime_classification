The owners of Anne the (now retired) circus elephant are to go on trial charged with causing her unnecessary suffering.Bobby and Moira Roberts, from Oundle in Northamptonshire, are also accused of failing to take reasonable steps to prevent an employee from causing unnecessary suffering to the animal, and failing to ensure that its needs were met.The couple did not attend a preliminary hearing at Corby magistrates court on Thursday, but their solicitor, John Whiston, indicated they would plead not guilty. The trial is due to begin on 18 June next year.Earlier this month it emerged that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had taken over the prosecution from the charity Animal Defenders International (ADI).The charges have been brought under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The pair are accused of keeping the elephant, who was brought from Sri Lanka to the Roberts Brothers Circus (now the Bobby Roberts Super Circus) in the 1950s, chained to the ground at all times.They are also accused of failing to prevent an employee from repeatedly beating Anne, who is about 58 years old.Speaking at the time the pair were charged last month, a CPS spokesman said: "Given the public concern over the case, the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, has now agreed that the CPS take over and continue the legal proceedings against the Robertses."They were originally the focus of a private prosecution by ADI, a worldwide animal welfare organisation, following an undercover investigation.Anne is now living, with her owners' consent, at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire.Speaking outside court, Jan Creamer, ADI's chief executive, said it would be a landmark test case.
