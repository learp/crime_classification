Dr Aisha Gill (Letters, 12 March) creates the impression that the criminal justice system is the only way to reduce domestic violence and protect women. As Trevor Phillips has pointed out, there is huge variation in the provision of independent advice and support to domestic violence victims, and poor provision of refuges. In many cases the civil justice system can provide greater protection through the use of civil injunctions, but access is still poor, particularly for minority communities. The public is largely unaware of the huge number of incidents police deal with related to the break-up of relationships. In the criminal justice system we have to prove individual incidents to a very high evidential standard, while this is often about a long-term pattern of abuse and intimidation. More specialist domestic violence courts would help and a greater willingness to impose stringent bail conditions or custody on offenders. We find that neighbours and members of extended families who would not hesitate to contact us if a woman was being attacked by a stranger, see violence in a relationship as something to stay out of - we need to change that attitude. Specialist police units, improved training, proactive arrest policies and many other initiatives are reducing domestic violence but it's not enough. The toll of women being killed is appalling and the review announced by the home secretary needs to ask some fundamental questions. Peter Fahy Chief constable, Greater Manchester police
