Recorded crime in England and Wales fell by 6% last year, despite a rise in sexual offences and robberies involving knives.The latest statistics from police records and the British Crime Survey – which is based on interviews with thousands of people – both show an overall drop in crime in the 12 months to December 2010, although the BCS puts it at 3% to the police's 6%.According to the BCS, the number of crimes fell from 9.8m to 9.5m last year compared with 2009.The number of sexual offences recorded by police rose from 53,091 in 2009 to 54,602 last year, up 3%, with a 6% increase in the number of most serious sexual crimes – up to 44,693 last year, compared with 42,187 in 2009.But other sexual offences fell by 9% to 9,909, from 10,904 in 2009.The Home Office said that while the latest figures showed a sixth consecutive quarterly rise in sexual offences, "there were signs this rise may be slowing". It added a double caveat, pointing out that while "the police have reported improving their reporting of sexual offences … it is known that a high proportion of sexual offences are not reported to the police".Rob Garnham, the chairman of the Association of Police Authorities, said: "Whilst the police have made significant improvements to how they respond to sexual offences in recent years, we are concerned to note a rise in the recording of such offences for a sixth consecutive quarter."Although the BCS showed that burglaries rose by 14% and bicycle thefts were up 12%, the number of domestic burglaries and other burglaries recorded by police were both down by 7%.Overall, household crime showed no change in the British Crime Survey, along with the levels of violent crime and personal crimes.And the risk of being a victim of crime remained about the same as the previous year at 21.4%, the BCS showed.Today's figures also showed the largest falls in crime recorded by the police were for criminal damage and offences against vehicles, down 17% and 12% respectively.The number of firearms offences recorded by police also fell 7% in 2010 compared with the previous year.Knife crime fell by 4% last year, from 30,560 to 29,259, largely due to falls in the number of assaults involving knives or sharp instruments.The number of assaults causing grievous bodily harm or actual bodily harm fell by 11%, from 14,660 to 12,998.But the number of robberies involving knives increased by 3%, from 13,908 to 14,279.Knives were also used in 237 rapes, compared with 213 in 2009, 1,454 threats to kill, compared with 1,419 in 2009, and 200 killings, compared with 197 in 2009.The number of attempted murders involving knives fell from 263 to 206.All the knife crime figures exclude data from the West Midlands force, due to the way they are collected.The BCS figures showed the proportion of adults with a high level of worry about burglary, car crime and violent crime remained the same in 2010 at 10%, 10% and 13% respectively.And the proportion who thought there was a high level of anti-social behaviour in their area also remained largely the same, at 14% compared with 15% in 2009.Both the BCS statistics and the recorded crime figures showed falls in the number of violent crimes resulting in injury – down 2% and 9% respectively.Chief constable Jon Murphy, the head of crime for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: "The official crime statistics are showing that the risk of being a victim of crime remains at a 30-year low, and downward trends continue for most offence categories."Increases in sex offences, following efforts nationally to improve all areas of sex offence investigation, are also showing signs of slowing."Nick Herbert, the policing and criminal justice minister, said that while the drops were welcome, there was no room for complacency."The public rightly remain concerned about levels of crime and particularly antisocial behaviour, and we are determined to ensure that the police have the right powers to do the job," he said."We have also commissioned an independent review of crime statistics which will report in due course."
