A police officer co-ordinating negotiations with Mark Saunders, the barrister shot dead by police, has said it did not cross his mind that his wife should be allowed to go to him.Saunders was killed during a police siege of his Â£2.2m home in Markham Square, Chelsea, on 6 May 2008 after firing shots from a window of his house. The inquest into the 32-year-old's death has heard that his family criticised police for blocking his wife Elizabeth despite her husband's repeated requests to speak to her.Detective Inspector Steve Wagstaff was asked today if it had crossed his mind at the beginning of the incident that Mrs Saunders or his close friend Michael Bradley should be allowed to attend. The officer, who was co-ordinating hostage negotiators at the scene, said: "Not in the circumstances."Asked why not, he said: "We had somebody in a flat, armed with a gun, shots had been discharged, our duty is to protect the public."Asked about a suggestion that conversations between someone in his role and his senior officer should be recorded, he said he agreed with the Metropolitan police commissioner that this could restrict free thinking in tense situations.But asked for exact details of what he had passed on about Saunders's drunken condition, he said he could not remember. "I would have summarised Mark's demeanour at every practical opportunity," he said.Saunders's family yesterday watched harrowing footage that showed the moment he was shot dead.His sister Charlotte wept as a two and a half hour film was shown to the inquest jury.His widow walked out of Westminster coroner's court as footage shot by a police helicopter and an audio recording of negotiations was played.The inquest, sitting in Marylebone, has heard how the legal high-flyer waved a shotgun from his smashed kitchen window before pointing it towards armed officers.Saunders sparked a five-hour siege when he fired his legally held shotgun while on the phone to a friend at 4.40pm after a lone afternoon drinking binge.Highly trained negotiators started trying to open a dialogue by calling his mobile phone at about 7pm.The inquest has heard how they were hampered by a power cut at their temporary operations base, a disconnected landline and the noise of the helicopter hovering overhead.Saunders played music loudly as he staggered around swigging wine, falling down the stairs and repeatedly vomiting violently.The inquest has heard he texted a friend with a line from the song by The Doors, The End, used in the soundtrack to Apocalypse Now, saying: "This is the end my only friend, the end."Tense discussions entered a final terrifying phase when Saunders blasted the weapon a second time through the window at 9.09pm, provoking two police shots that hit no one.At about 9.31pm he brought the shotgun out of the window and waved it erratically in the air as a police officer shouted "Put the gun down" through a loud hailer.One minute later Saunders, illuminated by a spotlight from a police helicopter, slowly lowered the barrel before being hit in the head and chest by five police shots.
