The millionaire Christopher Foster murdered his wife and teenage daughter before setting the family's Shropshire mansion on fire and killing himself, police said today.Detectives investigating the case confirmed they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the killings and that Christopher Foster's body has been identified, along with the earlier identification of his wife, Jill Foster, 49, who had been shot in the head.A third body is almost certainly that of their daughter, Kirstie, 15, but further tests are pending, police say.The precise cause of death has also yet to be established for Foster and his daughter.Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, the senior investigating officer in the case, said a .22 rifle discovered near the bodies on Friday has been positively identified as belonging to Foster."We believe that Mr Foster killed his wife and daughter before setting the fires which destroyed his home and many of its outbuildings in the early hours of Tuesday,'' he told a press conference in Shrewsbury this afternoon."We believe Mr Foster took his own life after setting the house alight."Police said that a substantial amount of footage from CCTV at the property will prove crucial to the investigation. The footage shows Foster carrying a gun from a stablehouse which then went up in flames and he is also seen driving a horsebox up to barricade the front gates, before getting out and shooting out two tyres.The Fosters were last seen returning to the six-hectare (15-acre) estate after a barbecue at a Shropshire car dealer's home on August 25, a week ago last night.Afterwards, the family returned to Osbaston House in Maesbrook and Kirstie is thought to have stayed up talking to friends online until about 1am the next day. Friends of Kirstie described how she abruptly left an internet chat in the early hours of the morning.West Mercia police said the blaze at the mansion was started deliberately three hours later.Investigators had to wait three days to get into the house because of falling debris.Once inside, they found spent and unspent gun cartridges and three horses and four dogs which had been shot dead.Martin Timmis, the head of operational response for Shropshire fire and rescue service, said today that an investigation was still being carried out to establish exactly how the fires were started.It is thought that Foster used an accelerant although inquiries are continuing into the exact nature of the substance.Foster, 50, became a millionaire by developing insulation technology for oil rigs.However, earlier this year a high court judge said he was someone "not to be trusted" and "bereft of the basic instincts of commercial morality".His company Ulva, which had gone into liquidation, faced legal action from one of its suppliers for thousands of pounds and owed about £800,000 in tax.Terence Baines, an accountant and former director of Ulva, said he worried the millionaire might have "just flipped because the pressure of it was too much for him".Groves said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on various other aspects of the inquiry, including the financial affairs of Foster and his state of mind at the time of the killings."Clearly there is still a lot of work to do on this murder and arson inquiry so we can establish exactly what happened on the morning of the fire," he said."This is a very complex and unusual case and around 100 officers and staff have been working hard to establish the circumstances leading up to the fire."We are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths at this stage — this was a terrible tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families of the Fosters at this time."
