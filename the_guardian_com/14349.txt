People are more likely to fear crime if they are worried about social change and their community breaking down, a study reveals today.Although there is wide variation in the crime rate across the country, fear of crime was not solely related to the risk of being targeted, researchers for the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) found.People in high crime areas suffered a daily fear of crime directly related to the higher risks they faced, but many people in relatively safe areas worried disproportionately too.Across Britain, researchers found areas with a similar crime rate had very different levels of fear. Where people were concerned about social change and declining morality, they were more likely to also fear crime."People do not separate out the issue of crime from issues of cohesion, collective efficacy, social change and tension," researchers concluded."Rather than being about an irrational sense of crime, fear expresses and distils lay diagnoses about neighbourhood breakdowns and stability and the violation of social rules."Interviewees said a clean and tidy environment was important to their sense of safety. Persistent graffiti, vandalism and youths destroying property were listed as unpleasant and unsettling features that affected how safe people felt.Stephen Farrall, of Sheffield University, co-authored the report, Experience and Expression in the Fear of Crime. He said it showed fear of crime was an important indicator of any societies' wellbeing.His co-author, Jonathan Jackson, of the London School of Economics, added: "Fear of crime is more often a broader anxiety than a concrete worry about the threat of victimisation â€“ but in any case, these emotions are all bound up in public concerns about social change and the health of the norms and values that underpin our society."
