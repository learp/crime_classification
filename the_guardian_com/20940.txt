The playwright Alan Bennett had revealed his experience of losing £1,500 in a pickpocket scam has left him "less ready to believe in the kindness of strangers".Writing publicly about the June incident for the first time, he describes how he was targeted by thieves who took money he had just withdrawn from the bank.Describing it in the diary he writes annually in The London Review of Books, Bennett, 76, told how he walked from the bank in Camden Town, having withdrawn the cash to pay builders, and he was approached by two women – "Italian by the look and sound of them" – in a branch of Marks & Spencer. They told him he had ice cream spilt down the back of his coat and tried to help him clean it off."I take off my coat and they very kindly help me to clean it up with tissues from one of their handbags and another man, English, I think, big and in his 50s, goes away and comes back with more tissues."The ice-cream (coffee flavoured) seems to have got everywhere and they keep finding fresh smears of it so that I take my jacket off too to clean it up.""No more being found, I put my jacket on again, thanking the women profusely, though they brush off my gratitude and abruptly disappear."I go back to the car, thinking how good it is that there are still people who, though total strangers, can be so selflessly helpful, and it's only when I'm about to get into the car that I remember the money, look in my inside pocket to find, of course, that the envelope is missing," he writes.After reporting the incident to the police, he was informed that the pickpockets were probably Romanian and that the con, called "mustard squirter" is common. It is thought he was spotted at the bank and followed into the shop."Quite hard to bear is that I have to go back to the bank to draw out another £1,500 or the builders will go unpaid."He adds: "The casualty, though, is trust, so that I am now less ready to believe in the kindness of strangers."He continues that an incident, three months later in September, had reminded him just how vulnerable he remained to such scams. He had come across an old lady acting oddly, and offered to help and assist her to a bench, whereupon the "woman" stood up and was revealed as a male actor for a BBC3 programme.He recognised "had this been a similiar scam it would have been just as easy to pick my pocket again as I'd helped this 'old lady' to the seat."This had never occurred to me. Streetwise I am not," he concludes.
