Detectives investigating the disappearance of the businesswoman Carole Waugh confirmed that a body found in a car in a lock-up garage in south-west London was that of Waugh.A postmortem on the body which had a single stab wound was due to take place later to help establish an exact cause of death .Waugh, who had worked in the oil industry in Libya, has not been seen since mid-April when she spent the weekend with her family in Durham. She last contacted them on her arrival home in London.Detectives from the homicide and serious crime command took over the missing persons investigation two weeks ago, after Waugh's bank accounts became the target of significant fraudulent activity.They said several individuals – women and men – had posed as Waugh to defraud her of hundreds of thousands of pounds. One man had impersonated her brother Chris Waugh to try to sell her Marylebone flat.The body was discovered in a VW Golf at the garage in New Malden, at 7pm on Thursday.Det Chief Insp John McFarlane, who is leading the investigation, said: "The vehicle is a blue VW Golf, registration number W466 NHL. We need to hear from anyone with information on the car, particularly since April this year. Anyone who can assist us on where it has been since then, or can advise on anyone with a connection to it, should come forward."The lock-up is in a row of garages behind two detached 1930s houses in a quiet street.The garages were cordoned off this morning and a police community support officer stood guard.A with a white and a blue forensic tent was erected outside a garage at the end of the row.McFarlane said: "We now believe Carole has not been seen alive since 16 April. Since that time significant plundering of her estate has taken place to the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds."Personal items, including Cartier jewellery, had gone missing from her flat. Police have released images of a Cartier ring, a white gold bracelet, a yellow gold bracelet and a yellow gold necklace."Carole wore the jewellery regularly," McFarlane said. "I appeal to anyone who may have been offered such jewellery or has any knowledge of its whereabouts to contact us with information."One line of police inquiry has been into suspicions that Waugh led a double life. While her family believed she was a successful businesswoman, officers were investigating evidence that she worked as an escort in London.Ten people have been arrested concerning Waugh's disappearance, which became a murder hunt this week.A 47-year-old man is in custody, being questioned on suspicion of murder, kidnap and conspiracy to defraud.A warrant for further detention was granted at Croydon magistrates court on Thursday.
