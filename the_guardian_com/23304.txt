The government has been criticised after move to merge the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) with other crime agencies led to the resignation of its chief executive.One child protection campaigner described the news as "absolutely appalling".Jim Gamble resigned yesterday over the home secretary's plans to subsume Ceop into a new National Crime Agency. He had previously warned Theresa May that her plans to merge his unit with the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the UK Border Agency would undermine attempts to keep children safe from paedophiles and other abusers on the internet.Since 2006, Ceop claims to have disrupted or dismantled 262 sex-offender networks, and it says inquiries by its online investigators have led to more than 1,000 arrests."I'm appalled. Disgusted," said Shy Keenan, who works at The Phoenix Chief Advocates, which represents victims of paedophilia."Jim Gamble is an outstanding child protector," she said. "May doesn't like him. It's a clash of personalities, and as far as we're concerned, because she has decided she doesn't like his particular personality, every child in the country has to suffer."Earlier this year, May described Ceop, which has a Â£11m annual budget, as vital and "a centre of excellence in protecting children online that the UK can be proud of". But relations between Gamble and May appear to have soured over the issue of merging Ceop with other agencies into a new super-organisation announced as part of a policing review in July.The National Crime Agency is due to be launched by 2013, but Ceop sources said there were growing fears that child safety would be a low priority next to organised crime and border policing.Keenan echoed those concerns, saying Ceop's services would be diluted under the new agency."Everyone will suffer tremendously as a result," she said. "Most police stations have child protection police units within them, but they don't do what we call proactive child protection, they only do reactive child protection."When a child screams out, they react, whereas Ceop has been doing proactive child protection work."Last night Ceop released a statement expressing solidarity with Gamble, and saying the move to assimilate it into the National Crime Agency was not in the best interests of children and young people.But Peter Saunders, from the National Association for People Abused in Childhood charity, said Ceop could have performed better."I can only say it's a loss to child protection that Jim Gamble has resigned," he said. "But there has been an enormous amount of money spent on Ceop that would have been better spent elsewhere."Saunders said he would like to see a government ministry devoted only to child safety, backed by an advisory board or committee comprising child protection experts and survivors of abuse."Survivors of child abuse feel that we've got lots of structures and procedures in place in this country, but so often they're not used," he said. "Ceop have had some great results, but so they should have done with all the resources that they've had pumped into them."Keenan said May should have refused Gamble's resignation. A Home Office spokesman confirmed that May had accepted his letter.In a statement, May said: "The government recognises the importance of child protection and wants to build upon the work of Ceop, but does not necessarily feel this is best done by creating a new quango."As chief executive, Jim Gamble has done a great job at Ceop and made a huge contribution to protecting children. I wish him all the best for the future and arrangements for his successor will be outlined in due course."
