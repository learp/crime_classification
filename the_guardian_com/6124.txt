Scotland Yard has appointed a woman for the first time to lead police intelligence operations on terrorism in London.Commander Janet Williams has become head of Special Branch in the capital at a time of heightened security alertMrs Williams heads a team of 560 officers whose job it is to gather information on terrorist suspects, protect the prime minister and fight espionage. The unit runs about 90 anti-terrorist operations a month.Mrs Williams joins MI5 boss Eliza Manningham-Buller at the forefront of anti-terrorism intelligence.Ms Manningham-Buller took up the top post just over a year ago when she replaced Sir Stephen Lander who left after six years in charge.Dame Stella Rimington, former director general of MI5, was the first woman to head the security service. MI5 has been criticised in the past for failing to penetrate groups such as al-Qaida. However, counter-terrorism is Ms Manningham-Buller's field of expertise.She and Mrs Williams will now work side-by-side in the fight against terrorism.Although Mrs Williams has not worked in Special Branch until now, in the 1990s she was with Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist unit investigating IRA and Middle Eastern terrorism.She is an experienced counter-terrorism detective who has been with the police service for more than 20 years.Mrs Williams, now in her early 40s, who is married with children, joined the Metropolitan police in 1982. She was chief superintendent in charge of Enfield, north London, until earlier this year when she left to attend a course for potential chief constables.Two other women head Scotland Yard's front line units - Commander Cressida Dick, who is head of Operation Trident which works against gun crime in the black community and Detective Chief Superintendent Sharon Kerr, who runs the Flying Squad.A report two years ago showed that 95% of Special Branch detectives were male.Special Branch was formed in 1883 as the Special Irish Branch and was renamed in 1888. Officers in the unit have helped to spy on Lenin. They have also protected the former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill and interrogated cold war spies during its 120-year history.In the past Mrs Williams has said that being a good officer was not simply a matter of physical strength.She added: "We need to encourage and recognise people's diverse skills. In my experience, some of the most effective officers are those gifted with communication skills; it has nothing whatsoever to do with physical attributes."
