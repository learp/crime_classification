In an unprecedented outpouring of anger, 42 of the UK's most celebrated writers will each publish a short story, essay or poem tomorrow attacking the government's determination to proceed with legislation to hold terrorist suspects without charge for 42 days. The list of writers taking part reads like a literary 'Who's Who' of modern Britain. They include Philip Pullman, Julian Barnes, Monica Ali, Ian Rankin, Alain de Botton, Ali Smith and AL Kennedy. The writers' decision to speak out comes on the eve of a House of Lords vote on the legislation tomorrow night. The government managed to push the legislation through the Commons in June by only nine votes - secured with support from the Democratic Unionist Party. But it is widely believed that the government would lose a subsequent vote on the bill if it were rejected by the Lords and returned to the Commons for further amendments, as a number of Labour backbenchers have recently withdrawn their support. Both Gordon Brown and the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, strongly support the measure, and there was little sign of the government backing down this weekend. 'We are resolute in our determination to put our arguments to the Lords and we are hoping they will listen,' said a source close to Smith.But what has until now largely been a political row is fast becoming a cause célèbre for Britain's literary establishment, who are flexing their intellectual muscles in a manner not seen since leading figures in the arts world regularly clashed with the Thatcher government in the Eighties. Pullman, the author of the trilogy His Dark Materials, uses his essay to launch a sarcastic diatribe against the government. 'We don't know how lucky we are to live in a nation where police officers have all of six weeks to discover why they've locked us up,' Pullman writes. 'Ask them after 41 days why a prisoner is still behind bars and they can honestly and innocently say, "No idea, mate." But give them that extra day, and they'll crack it.'Kennedy, the winner of the Costa Book of the Year Award, argues that the legislation will transform every suspect's life for the worse. 'In 42 days we will have made you different,' she writes. 'You may be charged, you may be released. You will always be different.'And Barnes, who has been shortlisted three times for the Man Booker Prize, writes of the urgent necessity to reject the legislation. 'Claiming to defend British liberty by diminishing British liberty has become a political norm over the last 30 years or so,' he claims. 'Digging in the heels and shouting is now more important than ever.'The highly public attack on the government, co-ordinated by the campaign group Liberty, will crystallise the long-running debate surrounding detention without trial. 'It is so heartening to see Britain's finest writers joining Liberty's campaign against extending detention without charge,' said Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty. 'Not a single writer that was approached turned down the opportunity to register their opposition to this divisive policy. Tomorrow the House of Lords will speak and we urge the government to listen.'Crossbenchers including Baron Dear, a former Inspector of Constabulary, and Lady Manningham-Buller, former head of MI5, have already expressed their opposition to any extension beyond the current 28 days. A number of high-ranking police officers, including Andy Hayman, the Met's former head of counter-terrorism, and Sir Ken Macdonald, Director of Public Prosecutions, have also attacked the plan, while international figures such as Noam Chomsky and Desmond Tutu have voiced their concerns. Opposition parties have attacked the bill, which the government claims is necessary to give police sufficient time to investigate complex and often international terror plots. 'These proposals are unnecessary, unjustified and unworkable, as well as counter-productive, and now a distraction when the world is facing an economic crisis,' said the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve.Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said: 'The government managed to bully and bribe this legislation through the Commons, but fortunately it has much less leverage over the Lords. I hope they will do their worst.'The 42 who put pen to paperMonica AliYasmin Alibhai-BrownTahmima AnamLisa AppignanesiNadeem AslamJulian BarnesJohn BergerTerence BlackerAlain de BottonShami ChakrabartiJenny DiskiAnne DonovanStella DuffyJoe DunthorneBernadine EvaristoMichael FaberEsther FreudLinda GrantJay GriffithsMohsin HamidTom HodgkinsonMaria HylandSadie JonesJackie KayAL KennedyHari KunzruNick LairdNikita LalwaniDarian LeaderAnn LeslieToby LittAlexander MastersHisham MatarDaljit NagraRachel NorthAndrew O'HaganPhilip PullmanIan RankinKamila ShamsieHardeep Singh KohliAli SmithCraig TaylorSally Vickers
