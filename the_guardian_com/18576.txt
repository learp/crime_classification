The quiz show cheat Charles Ingram was convicted yesterday of assaulting a 13-year-old boy, even though the victim admitted he made up much of his evidence.Convicted of deception in 2003 for cheating on the TV show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? after he used coughing signals from an accomplice in the audience to help him with answers, the 43-year-old former army officer found himself in the dock again yesterday."We do not accept the defence of self-defence and find you guilty beyond reasonable doubt," magistrate Marilyn Perry told Ingram. She imposed an absolute discharge and made no order for costs or compensation.Colin Meeke, prosecuting, had told Salisbury magistrates court that Ingram, from Easterton, Wiltshire, had been jogging towards the boy and his friends in the nearby village of Urchfont when the youth recognised him "and delivered, as he passed, at least one rather loud cough"."Your worships may find that was a somewhat cheeky act, and deliberately so, but that's what life does sometimes," Mr Meeke told the bench."What happened thereafter was wholly unacceptable. Mr Ingram jogged on by, stopped, jogged back and seized hold of the boy by the clothing in the region of his neck and remonstrated with him."Under cross-examination the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted he had exaggerated Ingram's reaction because he feared he might get himself in trouble. He also conceded that he had "coughed right in his face" and it was "possible" spit may have hit Ingram, who denied one charge of assault by battery.Ingram told the court that the boy "deliberately and quite disgustingly" coughed into his face. "It was a spit, frankly, into my face."He said he was coughed at every time he went out and had been made the target of jokes in parliament, a claim that led the prosecutor to suggest he had a "persecution complex"."Every time I go out someone coughs in my vicinity. It happens hundreds if not thousands of times," Ingram said.
