A dispute erupted today over who could have stepped in to deal with poor management at the nursery where worker Vanessa George abused children in her care.A serious case review on the George case concluded that poor regulation, inadequate training and a lack of supervision at Little Ted's nursery in Plymouth created an "ideal environment" within which she could sexually assault infants.Members of the Plymouth Safeguarding Children Board, which carried out the review, strongly criticised the regulator Ofsted for not picking up concerns about how the nursery was being run. It claimed there was no mechanism for city council officials to tell Ofsted about the concerns it had about Little Ted's. But Ofsted hit back, claiming anybody, including parents, staff and local authority employees, could have flagged up concerns.George, 40, from Plymouth, was jailed last year for abusing toddlers. Using her mobile phone, she photographed children in her care as she abused them and shared the images with her accomplice, Manchester businessmen Colin Blanchard.The board revealed that George had been guilty of "inappropriate behaviour" before she was caught, including showing members of staff adult pornography and boasting about her sexual exploits. But she was not challenged by staff, partly because she was seen as a figure of authority at the privately run nursery, the board concluded. And while the city council's early years advisory service, which had regular contact with Little Ted's, was concerned about management there, Ofsted gave it decent reports when it was inspected.No parents were present when an executive summary of the serious case review was published today, but they were shown the details and were said to be "angry and frustrated" that the inspection regime did not appear to be adequate.Jim Gould, chair of the Plymouth Safeguarding Children Board, called the case "unprecedented and shocking". Gould said the board would send its findings and recommendations to the Department for Education and would try to ensure they were acted on.As well as concerns about inspections, the board will suggest that the government ought to take a wider look at how private community nurseries like Little Ted's are set up and run.Another board member, Bronwen Lacey, director for children and young people at Plymouth city council, said the inspection regime appeared to be "more of a tick-box exercise than getting to the heart of what was the day-to-day management practice".Lacey added: "Ofsted are very independent; their mode of operation is to come and make judgment independently of anyone else to report what they see. That is flawed. There is good local knowledge and intelligence that will add to the picture."Ofsted promised to study the report and its recommendation for closer cooperation between itself and local bodies.But Patrick Leeson, development director (education and care) at Ofsted, added: "Our staff will always seek to get an accurate picture of what is happening. Ofsted will always investigate concerns raised about the quality of provision and safety of children.Â Anyone can raise concerns including local authorities, parents and staff."Chief Superintendent Andy Bickley, of Devon and Cornwall police, revealed that police still did not have sufficient evidence to be able to say which of the children at Little Ted's had been abused by George, who is serving and indeterminate prison term.
