Jacqui Smith delivered a withering assault on Tory opportunism on terror laws yesterday, describing the shadow home secretary, David Davis, as "a man that has shown no interest in seeking a political agreement", and accusing him of ignoring personal assurances by senior police officers that they supported the reforms being proposed by the government.Speaking to the Guardian, the home secretary insisted her measures for 42-day maximum pre-charge detention, subject to retrospective parliamentary scrutiny, had been structured to build on Tory proposals, and were more liberal than those advanced by the Conservatives.She was also sceptical about making intercept evidence admissible in terrorism cases, saying it was not a coincidence that no previous home secretary or foreign secretary had supported the idea.The requirements for full disclosure would "mean a very different way of working in terms of intercept. The need to transcribe the evidence would also have very big resource implications for the intelligence services, and then you would have to ask whether it is worth it."A government review of the use of intercept evidence in control order cases showed it would have had no impact in bringing prosecutions, she disclosed.The home secretary insisted she was not disturbed by the refusal of the director of public prosecutions to support an extended period of detention, saying that was not the role of the DPP. She also described the former attorney general Lord Goldsmith as "wrong" in opposing an extension, adding acidly: "I think it is always a bit weird to rewrite history from when you were a minister."Smith reserved her strongest criticism for the Tories, saying the party's position "contains no policy logic. The only logic is Davis has reverted to political opportunism, and he is not interested in an agreement."She insisted her plans had been built on the Tory proposal that if a suspected terrorist needed to be detained for more than 28 days, the Civil Contingencies Act could be invoked, allowing a further 30 days' detention."We have genuinely looked at the civil contingencies proposition, put forward by the Conservatives, especially the fact that it is time limited, triggered by a specific set of operational circumstances. We have recognised that is a reasonable architecture for what we should do. We have really thought how close can we get to their proposals."We have moved an immense distance to meet them, but there is a question as to whether the Tories were ever serious about seeking a consensus or not."She urged the Tory leader to rein in his shadow home secretary. "I think when David Cameron focuses his attention on this, he will find it hard to discern the difference between what Davis has proposed and what we have come up with.""There is a political opportunity for him. He could say, 'Look we have taken this seriously, we have made some suggestions, the government has moved, between us we have been serious politicians and together we have solved a terrorism problem', or he could be in a different position."She said that an agreement at Westminster would help to reassure Muslim communities.She added it might take a decade to end the terrorist threat: " There is a still a growing threat from terrorism. It is not a spike, it is well organised in terms of the networks, which is part of the reason for its complexity. It is technologically sophisticated and it is not going away."Smith was speaking before meeting potential Labour rebels last night, but claimed growing support for her proposals on Labour benches. The home affairs select committee will publish its report on detention tomorrow.
