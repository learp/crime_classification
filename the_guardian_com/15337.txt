Fees for staff vetting checks by the crisis-hit Criminal Records Bureau are to rise again just five months after they doubled, Home Office ministers announced yesterday.The £4 rise, which will come into effect in April, is part of a revenue-raising package designed to make the public-private partnership between the Home Office and the public services provider Capita self-financing within two years. The checks are compulsory for many staff working with children and vulnerable adults in schools, hospitals, care homes, charities and across the criminal justice system. The fees have risen from £12 to £28 for a standard level disclosure and £33 for a more complex "enhanced" check - an increase of 133% since the CRB was established last year. This move is expected to raise an extra £8m a year. Ministers have also proposed that the 10,000 registered organisations who use the service, including companies and charities, pay an annual fee of £300 to raise a further net £2.4m. At present they pay a one-off fee of £300 on registration. The CRB's new chief execu tive, Vince Gaskell - who has been brought in after being the "recovery director" at the Child Support Agency - said yesterday the increases were needed to make up for a 50% reduction in the Home Office subsidy from £18m a year to £9m and to support a rise in free checks carried out for voluntary workers, which now make up 17% of the total.He said the backlog of applications had been reduced from a high of 76,000 to 1,000 more than six weeks old.It was currently processing 50,000 applications a week - meeting its target of completing 90% within two weeks for standard checks and four weeks for enhanced checks.He blamed most of the delays on applicants not completing forms properly.The Home Office minister Hazel Blears supported the increase, saying the absence of problems at the start of the school year was evidence that the CRB was no longer suffering from "breakdowns".But the Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow said that the government, having made a mess of the CRB, was now forcing its customers to pay huge increases that would hit schools and charities hardest.
