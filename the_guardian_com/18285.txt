A would-be rap musician who arranged for a friend to try and kill his pregnant 15-year-old girlfriend by drowning her in a canal because he feared parenthood could harm his career was today jailed for 14 years.Brandon Jolie, whose then-girlfriend was the victim of the brutal attack beside Regent's Canal in Islington, north London, last November, was sentenced at the Old Bailey.Kingsley Ogundele, who carried out the attack, beating the girl over the head repeatedly with a metal pole before pushing her into the water and holding her down, was given 18 years.The court heard how the pair, both 19, discussed the idea in a webchat a month before the attack.Jolie had feared fatherhood could harm his chances of success on the grime music scene.The judge, Paul Worsley, told him: "When you discovered that your 15-year-old girlfriend was pregnant and she was going to tell your mother, you decided that she should abort that child."When she refused, you, together with Ogundele, decided that she should be eliminated."You feared that your mother would cut off your student allowance, that your blossoming music producing ambitions would be frustrated and that your lifestyle would be severely disrupted."Jolie wrote: "I don't care if she lives or dies because the consequences of her having a child are too big for me too handle." His friend responded: "I will fucking kill her."Jolie lured the girl, who was six months pregnant, to an isolated section of the canal, where Ogundele was waiting.After hitting her over the head with the pole he pushed her into the water, despite her cries of: "Please don't, I'm pregnant," and held her under the water, the court was told.The judge told Ogundele: "You held her head under the water. She felt she was going to die. One of her last memories as she went under was the grin on your face as you pushed her under."She was saved when a passerby, Andrew Hall, saw what was happening and chased Ogundele away before pulling the girl – who has since given birth to a healthy boy – from the water. The judge awarded Hall £500.Ogundele, of Romford, Essex, was convicted of conspiracy to murder by an Old Bailey jury. Jolie, from Bow, east London, admitted the charge.The court was told that Jolie, a student at Bedfordshire University, in Luton, claimed to have recorded a track for Nike and that his music had featured in films.
