Detectives are preparing to interview a mother over the murder of her two children amid reports that her estranged husband had told police he feared for their safety in her care.Fiona Donnison, 43, was arrested on Wednesday after arriving at Heathfield police station in East Sussex with "apparent self-harm injuries".Police said Donnison was in a distressed state and told officers to search her car.Police broke into the silver Nissan, parked near the former family home in Heathfield, and found the bodies of Harry Donnison, three, and his two-year-old sister, Elise, in holdalls in the boot.Postmortem examinations carried out at King's College hospital in London yesterday showed that the children died of asphyxiation and had been dead for less than 24 hours when found.The mother, a former City worker, was in a stable condition at Eastbourne District general hospital last night.A spokesman for Sussex police said officers were hoping to speak to Donnison today but the matter was "in the hands of medical experts".A family friend said the children's father, Paul Donnison, had expressed concerns to police before the deaths. The friend, who declined to be named, said she had "demonstrated personal traits" that alarmed Mr Donnison."He said to my husband and I that he was very concerned about the safety of the children in her hands," said the friend, who declined to be named."I think she had probably demonstrated personal traits that gave him cause to be concerned. He did say to me that he told police about the children's safety but I don't know under what circumstances he told them."The friend, who had known the Donnisons for five years as a close neighbour, said the couple had marital difficulties. Other neighbours said the couple separated just before Christmas when they put their three-storey detached house up for sale.Sussex police admitted there had been "previous contact with police in relation to this family" but refused to confirm whether Mr Donnison had spoken to officers about his wife's care of the children."This will be reviewed, in liaison with appropriate agencies, as a matter of standard procedure and also in order to help inform the current police inquiry," said a spokesman."We cannot release further information at this time as it could prejudice the investigation."A house in Lightwater, Surrey, where Mrs Donnison moved after her separation has been cordoned off by police.The children's great-aunt, Ivy Donnison, 78, from Newmarket, Suffolk, said they were "really beautiful children"."Paul informed me of the tragedy yesterday. We haven't seen any of them for over a year. They just live so far away from us," she said."You couldn't fault the way they had been brought up. Paul loved those children."
