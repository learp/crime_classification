The DNA fingerprinting pioneer Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys today condemned government plans to keep the genetic details of hundreds of thousands of innocent people for up to 12 years.Jeffreys – whose discoveries have been used to establish what has become the world's largest national DNA database – said he was "disappointed" with the proposals, which came after a European court ruled that the current policy breaches people's right to privacy."It seems to be as about as minimal a response to the European court of human rights judgment as one could conceive. There is a presumption not of innocence but of future guilt here … which I find very disturbing indeed."I do not see this as balanced and proportionate. It still places England, Wales and Northern Ireland as the only jurisdictions in the world, to my knowledge, to retain such large amounts of innocent DNA information."The proposed new rules include keeping the DNA profiles of innocent people who are arrested for serious offences, but not convicted, for 12 years and those arrested for minor offences for six years. Innocent people's profiles are currently kept until their 100th birthday.Jeffreys dismissed a Home Office prediction that 4,500 fewer crimes will be detected if the proposals go ahead."There is an unspoken assumption in here that these thousands of crimes that will not be detected by not having the DNA will remain undetected and that simply isn't the case. A significant number of these will be detectable through conventional police work, including the obtaining of fresh police DNA samples."He demanded that the government release further details of its concerns about poorer detection rates."We have been told some very cursory figures. One would like to know a great deal more. Are these serious crimes? Are they a relatively small number of individuals, for example serial burglars? We don't have that information at all. And we need that information to be able to balance the improved ability to detect these crimes against the right to a private life."Jeffreys's genetic discoveries at Leicester University in the mid-1980s enabled the establishment of the national DNA database 10 years later. It is now the largest in the world, storing details on more than 5 million people.Jeffreys said he supported the plan to dispose of the original hair, blood or other sample once the DNA profile had been obtained."I absolutely welcome that because the original samples contain all the information embodied in the DNA profile plus the rest of your genetic information. Now the police have no particular plans to go into that but there is always concern that access to those original DNA samples could lay bare far greater amounts of genetic information than is exploited in DNA profiling."This is all part of a right to a private life and retention by the state of genetic samples of innocent people is not appropriate."The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said the new proposals, which are out to public consultation, would ensure that the right people were on the database, as well as considering when people should come off it."We will ensure that the most serious offenders are added to the database, no matter when or where they were convicted," she said. The proposals come after the ECHR found that the current legal framework amounted to a violation of human rights.In one of the harshest ever condemnations of UK law, the court's grand chamber of 17 judges said it had been "struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature" of the government's powers to take and keep DNA samples.The ruling came after two innocent people from Sheffield, Michael Marper and a boy known in court as S, complained that their human rights were being violated by the government keeping their DNA profiles.Their solicitor, Peter Mahy, today described the Home Office plans as "a let-down for the hundreds of thousands of people who are innocent but remain on the database"."We fought a long, hard legal battle on this issue for over seven years which resulted in the spectacular 17-0 victory in European court of human rights. Unfortunately the government is still not proposing to destroy DNA profiles of innocent people when they have been cleared of any crime but instead keep them for up to 12 years," Mahy said."Innocent people should be treated as if they are innocent, not as suspects for years after they have been cleared. Innocent should mean innocent. If the proposals do not change there will undoubtedly be more cases brought by innocent people arguing that keeping their DNA profiles is disproportional and a breach of their human rights."I believe that the European court ruling and the change in UK policy will be looked at in years to come as truly defining moments in the UK's history of human rights. The judgment and policy change will not only affect hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the UK but millions of citizens worldwide. It is important that people respond to the consultation."Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the human rights group Liberty, said the new proposals were disproportionate and could lead to abuses of the system."These proposals are not quite two fingers to the European court of human rights but they come pretty close," she said."They don't distinguish between people who are under suspicion, people who are wholly innocent and those who are guilty."The government is still trying to get away with the largest database possible, including holding the details of people who are wholly innocent of anything."If they do not budge in consultation, then we will see them in court."Last month, Jeffreys told the Guardian that the current system left innocent people "branded as criminals".The proposals contrast sharply with the situation in Scotland, where only the DNA profiles of suspects arrested for serious violent and sexual offences are retained, and for a maximum of five years.
