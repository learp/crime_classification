Detectives were today hoping for a fresh breakthrough in the investigation into the attempted murder of Abigail Witchalls as a new witness came forward.The development came as it was announced that the 26-year-old mother, who was left paralysed after being stabbed in the neck, had failed to pick out suspect Richard Cazaly in a photo identity parade.Police said a witness who was in area shortly before the attack on April 20 had come forward to take part in a similar identification process.Cazaly apparently killed himself in Scotland days after the stabbing took place in the village of Little Bookham, Surrey. He and a 25-year-old Surrey man are the main suspects, but DNA tests have so far failed to link either to the attack on Ms Witchalls, whose 21-month-old son, Joseph, had a knife held to his throat.Ms Witchalls, who was left for dead by her attacker, was this week moved out of intensive care into a spinal injuries unit, and can now breathe without the aid of a ventilator. In a statement released today, the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital said it was a "positive move" towards her longer term progress, but added that it could be some months until doctors would know the extent of her likely recovery."Abigail is making significant progress. She is now breathing without the aid of a ventilator during the daytime and can talk to her family and the hospital staff, but it is quite a physical effort and she gets rather tired at times," the statement said.Ms Witchalls was shown the photographs in hospital yesterday, and was said to be "disappointed" that she had been unable to identify her attacker.Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper, who is leading the investigation, said: "Forensic results to date have not provided any evidence linking a suspect to the attack on Abigail. However, there are still a number of exhibits which may provide further forensic opportunities."We will continue to submit items to the laboratory on an intelligence-led basis. Richard Cazaly remains a suspect in this investigation."
