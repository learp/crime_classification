Five fraudsters who pretended to be making a Hollywood blockbuster as part of a £2.8m VAT and film tax credits scam have been jailed.Tax inspectors were told that A-listers from Hollywood were starring in a £19.6m production that would be shot in the UK.But the film, Landscape of Lies, was never made and the only footage shot was seven minutes of "completely unusable quality" filmed in a flat and costing just £5,000.Bashar al-Issa, 34, a former Iraqi national who is now British, of Maida Vale, London, was described as the orchestrator of the fraud. He was jailed for six and a half years by Judge Juliet May, sitting at Southwark crown court in London.Aoife Madden, 31, an actor of British and Irish nationality from west London, was sentenced to four years and eight months. She was said to have submitted a "pack of lies" to inspectors about the project.Two other defendants in the scam - Tariq Hassan, 52, a Pakistani national from Loughton in Essex, and Osama al-Baghdady, 51, an Iraqi national from Crumpsall in Manchester, each received four-year prison sentences.A fifth defendant, Ian Sherwood, 53, an architect from Sale, Manchester, who allowed his offices to be used for the fraud, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison.May said the fraud had been based on an "entirely bogus film project".
