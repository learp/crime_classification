With his pale, angular child-like features and dark hair, the gunman, Sean Mercer, acquired the nickname "Beaver" on the north Liverpool estate where he lived. Although only 16 at the time of the murder of Rhys Jones, he had already gained a reputation for hooliganism and casual violence, as a would-be gangster with the Crocky Crew.In 2006 he was given a three-month referral order for possession of a CS gas canister, and in February 2007 he was given an antisocial behaviour order for being part of a group terrorising security staff at Croxteth sports centre.Magistrates were told Mercer and others, including his co-defendant Dean Kelly, were having a snowball fight in the centre in February last year and refused to leave when asked. They threatened a security guard, attempted to set light to his jacket and told him they would get a knife to cut him.Two months before the murder he rode into Norris Green, enemy territory, on a motorbike chasing rival gang members and waving a handgun in a "territorial and threatening fashion".His father, Joe McCormick, a heavily built ex-doorman, regularly attended court during the trial. Although separated from Mercer's mother, Janette, he was involved in his son's life.Mercer left De La Salle school, near his home, aged 16 without any qualifications. Between 2004 and 2008 he was stop-checked on the street by officers on more than 80 occasions. In the month before he was charged with Rhys's murder he was before a youth court for cannabis possession.Detective superintendent Dave Kelly, the officer who led the inquiry, said: "Three shots were fired. It was the second that struck Rhys. "He knew what he had done and he knew he had hit and injured Rhys, yet he still aimed and fired again."
