A flamboyant patriot has ended up with a criminal record and bill for court costs after firing a set of ornamental cannons to celebrate Lord Nelson's birthday.Peter Budd, who has run a gift shop in the port of Whitby for 30 years, is considering leaving the town because his conviction has "wrecked" his plans to stand for the local council and do charity work. He admitted three firearms offences before Scarborough magistrates, after getting carried away with the fun of firing the bronze replicas, which make a loud bang but discharge only smoke. The court heard that his firearms certificate limited the guns' use to a battery in Henrietta Street, where Budd, 53, exchanged welcoming salutes with the tall ships Endeavour and Grand Turk on their visits to the town. But police discovered he had taken the 23in-long weapons on board the Grand Turk. He had then fired them three times off Whitby and Great Yarmouth, once on the admiral's birthday. He was given a year's conditional discharge and ordered to pay Â£50 costs. Magistrates cleared him of failing to store the cannons securely. Budd said: "I am now a criminal who misuses firearms. This has destroyed every aspiration I have for this life." The cannons are in the care of North Yorkshire police, who seized them six months ago when Budd was arrested. He said he would be writing to the chief constable, Della Cannings, to ask for them back.
