The government is proposing to let the public vote for what form of punishment convicted criminals in their neighbourhood should receive.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, favours local people being given a clearer choice on so-called "community payback" for low-level crimes â€“ for example, the public could vote on whether someone convicted for disorderly behaviour should carry out a punishment of clearing graffiti. Smith points to research carried out by the Home Office that argues it would not encourage excessive punishments.Do you think the government's plans to revive the respect agenda in this way are a good idea or do they risk vigilante activity?
