The government has won the support of the TUC and the CBI for its drive to reduce the isolation of women experiencing domestic violence, by persuading employers and co-workers that they should not stand idly by. With the consequences of such attacks costing up to £1 bn a year in police and NHS bills and lost working time, the TUC and the CBI are to draw up guidelines to encourage wider awareness and activism. Barbara Roche, the junior womens' minister, has even recruited the black cab drivers' trade union to provide advice - including helpline numbers - to women fleeing abusive relationships in the home. Digby Jones, CBI director general, said: "Domestic violence can have a devastating impact on people and it is my belief that it can also harm business as the victims often suffer from stress and low self- esteem." John Monks, outgoing general secretary of the TUC, said: "We are drawing up guidance for union negotiators and a code of practice for work places so that unions and employees can help employers deal with problems sensitively and promptly." The initiative is aimed at the 17.5m women - half the UK workforce - who may spot a colleague in distress. Research suggests the cost of domestic violence is £278m a year in London alone - home to 8m of Britain's 60m citizens. Mrs Roche, a former barrister working in this field, said: "Domestic violence is acrime which the government is committed to tackling. One in four women will experience domestic violence at some point."
