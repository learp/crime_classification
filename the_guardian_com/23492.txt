The hunt for missing five-year-old April Jones has intensified as police charge a former lifeguard, Mark Bridger, with her abduction and murder.Ten specialist police teams were conducting a "systematic and methodical search" in and around the Welsh market town of Machynlleth, where April was abducted on Monday evening as she was seen willingly to get into what is believed to have been a Land Rover Discovery.At a press conference in Aberystwyth, the Dyfed-Powys chief constable, Jackie Roberts, said it had been "one of the most complex and fast-moving inquiries" the force had faced. She said officers would "exhaust all options" in the bid to find April.Bridger, a local man known to the girl's family, was arrested on suspicion of abduction on Tuesday afternoon and rearrested on Friday on suspicion of murder. The charges against Bridger, which include perverting the course of justice, came an hour shy of the maximum 96 hours for which police were allowed to question him. Bridger will appear at Aberystwyth magistrates' court on Sunday.Superintendent Ian John promised that the "momentum" of the search would remain unaffected by the development and that they remained "totally focused" on finding April. "We will be keeping April's family fully updated on progress of this investigation," he said.Many of the local community said they had clung to the possibility that April, who suffers from cerebral palsy, might still be found safe and well.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Wales said that they had decided the police had gathered "sufficient evidence" to bring charges.Friends of April had told officers they saw her get into the vehicle at around 7.30pm on Monday.Since then, the town's surrounding area has been the focus of a huge search operation that continued to intensify with hundreds of mountain rescue personnel, potholers and police officers appearing to narrow their focus on the River Dyfi, particularly on a stretch upstream of Machynlleth to the home of Bridger.Bridger's property, called Mount Pleasant and sited in the hamlet of Ceinws, north of Machynlleth, was also the subject of further searches by forensic teams in white boiler suits.Meanwhile, mountain rescue reinforcements arrived in mid-Wales from the Pennines and Peak District as police revealed they had decided to increase the number of separate police search teams from eight to ten.April has not been seen since she climbed into the vehicle six days ago despite a search that has been described by police as "unprecedented" in scale.At daybreak a steady stream of volunteers arrived at Machynlleth leisure centre, the ad hoc headquarters for the missing persons inquiry carrying provisions to feed "April's Army", the local term for the hundreds involved in the escalating search operation to find the child.By 9am, long before the morning mist had risen, vans from Newport, Bristol, Swansea, London and Landudno had arrived with food parcels.Roberts said that the family of April had been "overwhelmed" by the reaction of the community in attempting to find the missing child.Close to 300 mountain rescue, cavers, dogs and their handlers were understood to be scouring the river system and steep sided valleys around Machynlleth along with an unidentified quarry. Simon Woodhead, a spokesman for Mountain Rescue England and Wales, said: "We'll search for as long as there is something to search for."Among the Machynlleth community, a shared refusal to believe April might be dead was evident among many of those who had gathered at the leisure centre before lunch. Reverend Kathleen Rogers of the town's St Peter's church said until there is definitive proof, hope the child might be found alive will prevail."This little child is one of us, she belongs to this community. Unless anybody tells us different we will have this hope that she will be brought back safe." A "book of hope" in the church contains hundreds of messages. Pink ribbons, symbolising the optimism April might be found alive, flutter from trees and hedges across the valley.Right reverend Andrew John, the Bishop of Bangor, who will lead a prayer service on Sunday at St Peter's, admitted the community found it difficult to accept April might be dead. He believes that many had chosen not to countenance the worst-case scenario in order to keep focused on the search operation. He said: "People don't want to touch it [the fact April might have been murdered].One of the many arriving with food at Machynlleth's Bro Ddyfi leisure centre was mother Laura Garrett, 24, from Tredegar, south Wales, who had brought eight huge vats of soup. Their sell by date she said pointedly was October 22, encapsulating the mood that few involved are prepared to surrender hope until they know April's fate for sure.Elsewhere, locals wandered around the small Welsh market town handing out pink ribbons. Student Kirsty Jones, 16, said: "I don't think anyone will give up 100 percent hope until we know something."Carl Jones, volunteer co-ordinator for the search, is another who publicly refuses to believe the child has been murdered, batting away suggestions that April's body may have been washed out to sea. But the 47-year-old admits he is exasperated her whereabouts remain a mystery."We've looked everywhere. But we've got to keep believing," he said, saying the search might have to be extended further afield at some point.However, Woodhead, 38, explained that the science behind a search entailed that even if a particular location has already been examined it doesn't mean the search has concluded. He said repeat inspections might be necessary to "reduce the likelihood of someone being in there."Certainly, the hunt for April is blessed with some of the best tools available. Among them, three-year-old border collie Isla who last year was judged the most gifted canine in the UK for tracking missing people.Isla, brought down from Wearside by owner Tony High, 40, is able to track "human air scent" from a dead or alive person from a quarter of a mile away. "She's outstanding at picking up a trail of skin cells," he said.But even as the search grows, concerns are already evident over the sustainability of the operation. Although Dyfed Powys police have insisted the huge efforts would continue until at least Wednesday, the strain among many is evident, particularly the mountain rescue teams who are not paid and receive no expenses.Roberts said: "Now that Mark Bridger has been charged with this horrific crime it is time to let the judicial process take its course and time to let the family come to terms with what has happened over the last week."
