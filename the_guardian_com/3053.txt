The investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann appeared to face a further setback yesterday after the deputy to Goncalo Amaral, who was removed from the case on Tuesday, was reported to have requested a leave of absence.Chief inspector Tavares Almeida, 48, was reported by the Portuguese newspaper 24 Horas to have asked for an extended period of unpaid absence usually used by police officers for studying or training. The reports emerged two days after Mr Amaral was taken off the case following an attack he made on his British counterparts in a Portuguese newspaper. Mr Amaral claimed that the British police were being manipulated by Gerry and Kate McCann, and had forgotten that Madeleine's parents remain suspects.It appears that Mr Almeida put in his request for leave before the removal of Mr Amaral, with whom he reportedly did not see eye to eye over his handling of the case. It is believed that, following Mr Amaral's demotion, the national director of the Policia Judiciaria, Alipio Ribeiro, may be able to convince Mr Almeida to remain on the case.The McCanns' family spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said: "Officially, as with [the removal of] Mr Amaral, we simply will not comment on any decisions taken by the Portuguese. Kate and Gerry will cooperate fully with the Portuguese investigation and that will continue irrespective of who is leading the inquiry."
