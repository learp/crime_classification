A woman who was beaten up in front of her son by a gang of youths died six weeks after the attack, police said yesterday.Tracey Cullum, 31, was confirmed dead at Birmingham's Selly Oak hospital last Friday after falling ill at her home in nearby Minden Grove.She had challenged the group of four teenagers more than a month ago for being rude while waiting for a bus in Birmingham city centre.One of them, said to be aged between 16 and 18, punched her as she stood in the bus queue with her 12-year-old son, a female friend and three other children. She suffered a broken ankle in the attack and was also treated for minor injuries which happened just before 10pm on Saturday July 2.Detectives said yesterday they were linking Ms Cullum's death with the attack.An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned at Birmingham coroner's court yesterday. Ms Cullum's partner, Mark Holliday, 37, an engineer, and two West Midlands police officers had attended the hearing. Mr Holliday confirmed his partner's identity and details.The Birmingham coroner, Aidan Cotter, told Mr Holliday that a postmortem examination had been carried out but that he did not have the full report. Ms Cullum is thought to have suffered a blood clot to the heart."There is a strong suggestion her death may have been caused or contributed to by the assault which was carried out on her," Mr Cotter said. "If that turns out to be the case, then anybody who is charged with an offence of causing or contributing to your partner's death by a criminal act is entitled to an independent postmortem examination by a pathologist."The court heard that no arrests had been made following the attack and that Ms Cullum's body could not be released for the funeral.The inquest was adjourned for a review hearing on September 8.
