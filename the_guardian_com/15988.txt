The press watchdog has rejected a complaint from the mother of Levi Bellfield, jailed last year for murdering two women, that the Daily Mirror used subterfuge to get information about his whereabouts on the day schoolgirl Milly Dowler was killed.Bellfield, also the prime suspect in the murder of 13-year-year old schoolgirl Dowler in 2002, was jailed in 2008 for killing Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell.On 22 April this year the Daily Mirror ran a story based on an interview with Bellfield with the headline "Hammer killer Levi Bellfield in new link to Milly Dowler murder".Jean Bellfield lodged a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission that the Mirror article on her son was inaccurate and that the information had been obtained through subterfuge. She also complained that an article printed the next day was an invasion of her family's privacy.The Daily Mirror said that Levi Bellfield had answered several questions through correspondence about his movements on the day Dowler disappeared and the reporter subsequently sought a full telephone interview.This was arranged on the condition that the reporter signed an agreement that he was "only acting in Bellfield's best interest" to help him answer "false allegations in the media", the paper added.However, in the interview he admitted for the first time that he had been driving a red car captured on CCTV about the time that Dowler disappeared. Bellfield had previously refused to answer police questions on the subject.The newspaper said that it was necessary for the reporter to sign the legally unenforceable document to get the interview and that the use of "relatively low-grade subterfuge" was justified because the story was in the public interest.In its ruling today the PCC agreed and also dismissed the complaints about invasion of privacy and inaccuracy in the second story."In this case, the journalist had not concealed his identity and had uncovered significant new details about the Milly Dowler case," said the PCC. "His actions in obtaining the information were justified".• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
