Councils and the voluntary sector could have headed off the more draconian aspects of the government's approach to antisocial behaviour if they had worked together more effectively to tackle the problem, the homelessness charity Shelter said today.The director of Shelter, Adam Sampson, told councils that they should not see the voluntary sector as a threat to their role but should work together more proactively to tackle problems like nuisance neighbours.He pointed out that both the local government association and Shelter were now opposed to government plans to dock housing benefit from antisocial tenants. But he claimed the proposals could have been avoided altogether by more proactive local partnerships to tackle the problem, such as Shelter's initiative with Rochdale council to work with antisocial tenants to change their behaviour. "We are on the back foot on antisocial behaviour. If we had worked together better we could have headed off some of the more serious proposals; we did not act fast enough. We could have been a more powerful voice for change."He called for a more "mature" relationship between councils and charities."We have no desire to usurp your roles or powers - our roles are complementary not competitive. We are primarily single issue organisations, you have broader responsibilities and experience."He said that Shelter was no longer seeking to "beat up" councils but was keen to work with them as the charity had on the implementation of the new homelessness act. But he warned that if the government granted councils more power, campaigning charities like Shelter would shift their attention from the central to the local level.
