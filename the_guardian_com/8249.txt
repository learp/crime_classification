The courts should be just as tough on date rape and rape within marriage as sexual attacks by strangers, according to official sentencing guidelines proposed yesterday. The guidelines say that the minimum starting point for judges considering sentences in rape cases should be five years' imprisonment in cases where the victim is over 16.Much tougher sentences are recommended in rape cases involving children under 13 and elderly victims.A spokesman for the sentencing guidelines council, chaired by Lord Phillips, the lord chief justice, said the new guidelines will not lead to a reduction in the average sentence of 7Â½ years for rape. Currently 98% of those convicted of rape receive a prison sentence, with 72% jailed for five years or more.The guidelines set out detailed sentencing instructions for the courts in 50 types of sex crimes, including new offences such as exposure, which is likely to attract a 12-week sentence for a repeat offender, and voyeurism, likely to lead to a 12-month sentence if images are posted on a website. The guidelines also stress the need for the court to consider the new public protection sentences, under which offenders are sent down for an indefinite period and not released if they present a significant risk of harm to the community.The guidelines also remind the courts to consider a sexual offences prevention order if there is any danger of reoffending, and an order banning offenders from working with children.The council's decision to reject calls for the different treatment of date rape endorses existing case law, which says "acquaintance rape" should be treated no less seriously than attacks by strangers. The calls for a lesser sentence were based on hopes it would boost the very low conviction rate in such cases. But the council does suggest that where the victim engaged in consensual sexual activity with the offender immediately before the offence it should be considered as a mitigating factor which could lead to a small discount on the sentence.A council spokesman said the decision to set the five-year minimum starting point for rape took account of the 15% reduction in sentences recommended in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and there would be no reduction in the average sentence for rape as a result.The guidelines recommend that where there are no aggravating or mitigating factors the starting point for sentences should be five years if the victim is over 16, eight years if the victim is aged 13 to 16, and 10 years if the victim is under 13.Sir Igor Judge, the council deputy chairman, said the guidelines emphasised the seriousness with which sexual offences should be treated by judges. "Sentencers are particularly aware of the psychological as well as the physical impact of these offences on victims."The director of public prosecutions, Ken McDonald, who is also on the council, said the guidelines should not lead to any reduction in the average length of sentences imposed. "Indeed they recommend higher sentences if aggravating circumstances - such as extreme youth or age of victim - apply."
