The company that operates trains on Merseyside said yesterday that, despite criticism from magistrates, it will continue to prosecute people for resting their feet on train seats. Merseyrail was supported by the region's rail authority, Merseytravel, which said the absolute discharge given to a student was "short-sighted and ill-advised." About 240 people have been dealt with in courts across the region for the same offence and more than 600 others are to face magistrates.On Tuesday, Chester magistrates said Merseyrail should have been "less draconian" in dealing with student Kathleen Jennings, 19. Christine Abrams, the chairman of the bench, said: "A fixed penalty system may be more appropriate."But yesterday Mark Dowd, the chair of Merseytravel, said: "In describing the action as 'draconian', the magistrates showed a complete lack of understanding of what we are trying to achieve, which is a world-class public transport network, free from antisocial behaviour." A Merseyrail spokeswoman said there would be no change in its policy.
