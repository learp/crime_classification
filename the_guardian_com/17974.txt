Twelve men and two youths have been sentenced for their part in riots during which a police station was firebombed during the disorder last summer.The 14 were sentenced at Nottingham crown court for the roles they played in the disturbances in Nottingham city centre during which Canning Circus police station was firebombed last August.Three police officers and three PCSOs were inside during the attack when nine lighted petrol bombs were thrown at the station.On Friday, 10 of the men were sentenced for riot while four others – including the two youths whom the judge allowed to be named by the media – were sentenced for violent disorder.Sentencing the 14, Judge Michael Stoke QC, recorder of Nottingham, said: "There can be no doubt about it: this was a mob violence of an extreme nature. In short, a calculated defiance of the criminal law and a deliberate attack on the police."The numbers involved, far more numerous than those apprehended, must have caused real fear to decent citizens who witnessed these events or whose property sustained damage during the course of them."He paid tribute to the police officers involved in the disturbances on 9 August last year and also to one of the force's dogs, called Richie.He also commended members of the public for reporting the disturbances and to those who provided witness statements during the case.The six-week trial at Nottingham crown court heard witnesses describe the scene as a "war zone", seeing petrol bombs thrown at the police station during an "organised and planned attack".Petrol bombs were thrown at other passing vehicles, including a bus. A number of vehicles, some parked and others stationary at traffic lights, were also damaged by the group.The group planned to meet up with armed weapons, sticks and bottles filled with petrol, with the intent of setting the police station alight.Commenting on the use of petrol bombs, Stokes said: "The use of such unstable weapons in a riot situation, aimed as they were principally at a police station and those inside it, created a substantial risk to life and limb."Lance Francis, 25, who shook his head and looked tearful as his sentence was read out, received the longest term of 14 years in jail after being convicted by a jury of riot, arson with intent to endanger life and attempting to pervert the course of justice earlier this week.Sentencing him, Stokes said: "The attitude you have shown during this trial and your appalling attitude to other people, particularly young women and the police, when placed alongside your considerable record for serious offending requires that you should be out of circulation for many years. That is the least your many victims and potential victims are entitled to expect of the court."Reiss Wilson, who the judge said "played a leading role" in the events and acted as a recruiter to get people to join the disorder, was jailed for 12 years in total. He had admitted riot, reckless arson and attempting to pervert the course of justice.The 21-year-old was "closely linked" to Curtis Dejean, 19, who was detained in a young offender institute for 10 years after admitting possessing explosives with intent, riot and arson being reckless as to the endangerment of life.Many of the firebombs used during the attack were prepared at Dejean's home.The judge commended the witnesses who gave evidence in court or provided written statements.One witness was Kaye Challinor, whose police statement was read out in court during the trial. She described one of the rioters as launching a firebomb straight at the bus she was sat on.The judge said: "She was absolutely petrified by what she saw and experienced. Fortunately the petrol bomb bounced off the window and smashed harmlessly on the road. Had it broken the bus window the consequences would have been horrific."Sentencing the 14, the judge said: "Those who deliberately participate in disturbances of this magnitude, causing injury and damage and fear to even the most stout-hearted of citizens, and who individually commit further crimes during the course of the riots are committing aggravated crimes."They must be punished accordingly and the sentences must be designed to deter others from similar criminal activity."Callum Powell, 20, was detained for five and a half years after being found guilty of riot by the jury, while Gregory Coleman, 20, was detained for five years on the same charge after being found guilty by the jury.Shaudrie Robinson, 22, was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of riot. Antany Edwards, 24, was sentenced to three years and nine months after admitting riot, and Ashton Alexander, 19, was detained for four years after admitting the same charge.Harrison McCalla, 21, was jailed for four and a half years after admitting riot. Lucas Stapleton, 18, was detained for two years and nine months on the same charge.Ricardo Cotteral, 23, Bobby Muers, 18, and Kaiden Howell and Marcus Wynter, both 16, all admitted violent disorder. Cotterall was jailed for three years, Muers was detained for 15 months in youth custody, Wynter was detained for six months and Howell for four months.Two other youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will be sentenced at a later date for their role in the disorder.Commenting after the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Rob Griffin, who led the investigation, said: "The sentences handed out to these individuals reflect the severity of what they did last August."They joined together, armed with weapons, sticks and petrol bombs, with the common intention of targeting Canning Circus police station."They spared no thought for the officers inside or the potentially fatal consequences that could have occurred if the fire had taken hold."Fortunately many of those responsible were arrested nearby following a prompt response by officers and the fire was quickly extinguished, despite items continuing to be thrown."Several factors have contributed to the success of this investigation and prosecution."Many members of the public phoned the police on the night, some went on to make witness statements and even give evidence in the trial."Secondly, the quick police response on the night and the bravery those officers showed resulted in the arrest of many of the defendants close to the scene very soon after."Finally, the investigation that followed was thorough and meticulous and resulted in the evidence being presented in a way that compelled the jury to convict these individuals."I am pleased to see that justice has been served and I hope that the sentences issued today will give those who were intent on being part of the riot plenty of time to think about what they did."
