There is a gold-framed photograph of Fred Barras on the mantelpiece of his mother's home in Newark, Nottinghamshire. It is a picture taken by police just two days before the teenager was shot dead by Tony Martin last August.Barras had been arrested for the theft of garden furniture and the picture taken down at the station is the only image Ellen Barras has to remember her son by. Fred Barras was a petty thief, one of a number of little criminals rolling around Newark's notorious Howtonville estate. He had a series of convictions, with 29 offences to his name, and had served time in a young offenders institute for car theft. Barras grew up the youngest and only boy among six children. His parents - who both came from travelling families - met when they were 15 and married at 18, but after 10 years Fred Sr and Ellen went their separate ways. Mrs Barras returned to her mother, living in caravans, then a council house with her children. Mr Barras never saw his son again. By the time he was 12, Fred had been expelled from Sconce Hills school. Instead of trying to go to another school, he worked on market stalls and let his literacy slip. At night he hung around the estate's parade of shops and, as his mother says, "got in with the wrong people". The night before he died, he had boasted to friends that he was going off to do his first "big job". His mother bought him chicken and chips for dinner and he told her he would be staying the night with his mates. Instead, he hung around waiting to be picked up by his accomplices, Brendon Fearon and Darren Bark. Fearon told the court he took Fred along for the ride just to keep him out of trouble. Sadly for the 16-year-old, the target of the "big job" was Bleak House. His mother did not know until later on Saturday that her son had travelled to Norfolk and was now dead. Her son, she said, was just a lovable rogue. "I don't think I shall ever be happy again," she said.
