A big expansion of compulsory unpaid community work by offenders, including helping to prepare the site for the 2012 Olympics, lies at the core of the government's five-year plan published yesterday to curb crime and the rise in the prison population.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, also announced that a new sentence of "custody plus" will be introduced which will see most of the 61,000 offenders a year who are sent down for 12 months or less spending less time inside and more outside on community punishments."Unpaid work is at the core of it," said Mr Clarke. "If you have to work rather than hang around in a prison cell I think that is tougher."He conceded that in the wake of cases such as the recent Monkton murder, where there were failures in probation supervision, it would be difficult to change the public's view on community sentences, but he said the idea that "prison works" in stopping reoffending was demonstrably wrong.Ministers want to see the 5m hours of unpaid work done by offenders last year as part of the "community payback" scheme doubled to 10m hours within five years. The government's strategy rests on a new sentencing menu for the courts which is designed to restore their confidence and that of the public in low-level fines and community punishments.The five-year plan says that short prison sentences given to petty offenders are not effective at preventing reoffending. Ministers hope the courts will give many of these minor offenders new, tougher community sentences, and that those they do jail will be given only "a short exposure" to prison, followed by a longer period under probation. Mr Clarke confirmed that he hopes to develop a new network of community prisons, with modest levels of security, for those on "custody plus". He has yet to win the Treasury cash to finance this network.He insisted he had not dropped his plans for a "vibrant mixed economy" in the criminal justice system and would publish a detailed prospectus shortly, followed by a draft bill this summer to hand over some probation work to private companies and to the voluntary sector.Juliet Lyons, of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "Not before time a home secretary has had the courage to admit that prison often fails to prevent reoffending."But the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said it was only the latest initiative in eight years of similar plans and the prison population had carried on rocketing.
