Black and minority ethnic (BME) prison staff are more likely to experience racial abuse and discrimination from their colleagues than from prisoners, according to a Prison Reform Trust (PRT) report.Of the BME prison staff interviewed, 61% say they have experienced racial discrimination while employed in prisons - in the forms of verbal abuse, isolation, harassment, and a lack of equal opportunities - and 43% say this abuse came from fellow prison officers.The report says "covert and structural" racism has replaced blatant discrimination, making it more difficult to stamp out. "While the recent actions of the prison service have helped eradicate overt racism in our jails, this report shows it has merely been pushed underground," says Geoff Dobson, deputy director of the PRT. "The prison service needs to take action to protect all its staff from racist discrimination."The report reveals that half of BME prison officers who have experienced racial abuse chose not to report it. Many say they are reluctant to speak out when there are so few other BME staff to provide support.BME prison officers make up less than 6% of UK prison staff, and most official investigations into the cases of racial discrimination that are reported to senior prison management are handled by white staff, leaving BME staff feeling isolated and distrustful.The charity also criticises the official investigation processes for denying the victim a choice about how cases of discrimination should be handled.In the report, a BME officer describes an incident where another officer apologised for a racist comment and was then faced with dismissal. The BME officer is quoted as saying: "I was not happy with the management's response in wanting to sack the officer. I believe that we had both been arguing and the incident had been resolved."The PRT is calling for consultation about ways of increasing the confidence of BME prison officers. It is demanding that employers offer equal opportunities and make a renewed commitment to banish racism from the prison system.Â· Experiences of Minority Ethnic Employees in Prisons is available at www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk
