We hope that the failure of police officers to listen to the repeated cries for help from Banaz Mahmod will not happen to another woman or girl (Met let down victim killed by her family, April 3). The fact that this deadly failure has received such widespread attention and is hopefully being addressed by the police is entirely due to the campaigning efforts of a number of specialist black and minority ethnic women's organisations. It is just such organisations which have over the years effected change leading to better protection for women and girls. Why is it then that minority ethnic women's organisations are under threat of closure due to the hostile environment created by the community cohesion agenda? What kind of community cohesion is this creating - one where the lives and safety of women and girls counts for nothing?
