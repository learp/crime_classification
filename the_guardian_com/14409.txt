Until 14 May, when she became the first British person inspired by al-Qaida to try to assassinate a prominent figure on UK soil, Roshonara Choudhry was everything a society could want a citizen to be.She was studying English and communications at King's College, London, and in her first two years had been a prize-winning student predicted to get a first. Choudhry was also a gifted linguist who was fluent in Arabic, French and her parents' mother tongue of Bengali.On weekends she volunteered for an east London Islamic school, helping Muslim pupils to overcome educational disadvantages they faced in the UK. It is believed she wanted to become a teacher, helping to bring the best out of the young people in her charge.Her glittering academic career came despite humble beginnings in East Ham, London. Through education she had bettered her family and was overcoming the barriers of racism, Islamophobia, sexism and poverty.The eldest of five children from a Bangladeshi heritage, Choudhry's mother was born in the UK. Her father had worked as a tailor but by the time of the attack he was unemployed and the family were reliant on benefits and help from the children.On the morning and early afternoon of 14 May, Choudhry did two things which showed her values and love of family; they also showed her disdain for Britain, which she had come to believe persecuted her fellow Muslims.She used academic prizemoney and savings accrued from her frugal lifestyle to pay off her student loan. Friends say she feared that once caught for the murder she intended to carry out, her family would be liable for the debt.She also emptied her bank accounts, leaving the balances at zero, in case the British state she so detested would take the money after she was arrested.After leaving home in East Ham at 1.45pm, she took the 101 bus to a NatWest bank, where she set straight her financial affairs.She was going to murder MP Stephen Timms as "punishment" for voting for the Iraq war, which killed tens of thousands of people.Choudhry is known to have met Timms once before. As a student at Newham sixth form college she had met her local MP on an outing to the House of Commons.The strongest evidence of the ideological change in Choudhry's beliefs and her journey towards an adherence to violent jihad, starts to appear in late 2009.After her arrest police seized and scoured her computers for contacts with jihadists, of which none were found, and for details of websites she had visited. She had no known connection to any Islamist groups, and there was no evidence she had attended meetings or owned any potentially extremist literature.The police investigation found that in the last quarter of 2009 Choudhry began downloading from the internet sermons and material from Anwar al-Awlaki, the Islamist cleric who western officials say is the spiritual leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. He preached the need for violent action to combat the atrocities of the west against Muslims around the world, and urged followers to do what they could, when they could, no matter how small.There is a big gap between this and the attack on Timms, but both friends and police who spoke to the Guardian, said they believed Choudhry had decided to put this commandment into action by murdering Timms over his vote in favour of the Iraq war.By the start of 2010 she had dropped out of her studies, and by the end of April she had bought two knives specifically for the purpose of murdering Timms.Choudhry's family are devastated by what happened to their daughter and what she did. She is now to all intents and purposes lost to them while she serves a long prison sentence, while a successful future is lost to the gifted student.Since her arrest Choudhry has declined to see her family or any visitors, including her lawyers. She is held as a category A prisoner, making her subject to strip searches before and after any visits. Because she feels this demeans her dignity and religious beliefs she has instead opted for solitude.
