The Moors murderer Ian Brady has seldom been far from the headlines since he was convicted of luring five children to their death with his then partner Myra Hindley 46 years ago.In November 1985, he was transferred from a prison to the high-security Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, after he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act following his diagnosis as a psychopath. Since then, he has challenged the authorities with a long-running campaign to be allowed to starve himself to death, but has so far been unsuccessful.He began a hunger strike in 1999 and has been force-fed, against his will, every day, via a tube.Brady has a reputation as a prolific letter writer. In recent years, the 74-year-old has suffered from ill-health. A heavy smoker, until smoking was banned at the high-security hospital, he suffers from the debilitating spine condition spondylitis, which is degenerative.As he is sectioned under the Mental Health Act, he is not allowed to take his own life. Last month, he was due to attend a public mental health tribunal hearing about his legal move to be declared sane and transferred to a Scottish prison, where he could potentially starve himself to death. But he had a seizure while speaking to his solicitor at the high-security hospital, and was taken amid tight security to an NHS hospital for treatment.Had he appeared at the tribunal, it would have been the first time Brady would have been seen in public since 1966.Judge Robert Atherton, who had been due to preside over the tribunal, said it had received information about Brady's health that made a delay necessary. It has been adjourned to an unspecified date.He has publicly stated he would never apply for parole, but has repeatedly campaigned for voluntary euthanasia for UK patients in special hospitals.Brady has never expressed any remorse for his crimes or empathy for his victims and psychiatrists have concluded he has an overwhelming need for control, played out repeatedly during the course of his life – evident in his constant refusal to reveal the location of Keith Bennett's remains.But his attempts to force the authorities to allow him to starve himself to death have failed. In March 2000, a judge described his hunger strike as part of his "obsessive need to exercise control". The ruling said he lacked the ability to make rational decisions involving food.Brady and Myra Hindley were convicted at Chester assizes of murdering five children, whose bodies were concealed on Saddleworth moor in Greater Manchester.The victims of the Moors murderers were Pauline Reade, 16, who disappeared on her way to a party on 12 July 1963; John Kilbride, 12, snatched in November the same year; Keith Bennett, snatched on 16 June 1964, after he left home to visit his grandmother; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, who was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964; and Edward Evans, 17, who was killed in October 1965.In 1987, Hindley and Brady were taken back to the moors in an attempt to find the remains of Keith Bennett and Pauline Reade, but only Pauline's remains were discovered. Hindley died in prison in November 2002, aged 60.Four years ago, in an eight-page letter to his MP and solicitor, which was made public, Brady complained about low wages and poor treatment at Ashworth hospital.He criticised the then government, accusing it of undermining civil liberties by playing on people's security fears. Brady bemoaned that he only received a £25-a-week allowance, while others at the hospital got £100.
