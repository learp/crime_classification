The government should abolish the system under which 95% of criminal cases in England and Wales are dealt with by legally untrained lay magistrates, the Institute for Public Policy research urges today.The think tank calls for replacement of the panels of three lay magistrates which now hear most criminal cases with panels composed of a legally qualified paid magistrate - recently renamed district judge - and two lay magistrates. The lay magistrates would need less training and would need to sit less often, says the IPPR report, Community Justice. The author, Andrew Sanders, professor of law at Manchester University, said: "These proposals would increase public confidence, and they would enhance the contribution ordinary members of the public make to our justice system." The future of the lay magistracy is uncertain, though ministers have assured magistrates they have no intention of abolishing their role. The recommendation for mixed panels ties in with a proposal expected to be made by Lord Justice Auld, whose blueprint for changes to the criminal justice system is due to be published soon.
