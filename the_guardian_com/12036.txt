We write with great concern following the Daily Mail’s front page of 2 November. Texting while driving has been one of the biggest causes of car-related deaths in the UK and it is important that in the case described in the Mail’s report, justice was served for the victims of this appalling tragedy caused by the dangerous driving of the driver.Daily Mail draws criticism over front page story targeting foreign drivers Yet almost 100,000 people were caught by police last year for using a mobile phone behind the wheel, the vast majority of whom were almost certainly not foreign. By highlighting the unlawful use of mobile phones by foreign truck drivers alone, the Mail propagates the idea that foreign truckers are more likely to engage in this behaviour.This is an unjustifiable slur with no evidence that incites hatred and ill-feeling towards the “other”, while doing little to advance the Mail’s goal of toughening law enforcement, or supporting the families of those killed in this incident. In a climate where hate crime against minority communities is on the rise, many have already publicly commented on how they believe such a front page article to be wholly irresponsible.There is no doubt in our minds that reporting the news is a force for good, as it uncovers the truth and informs our society. We only hope that the Mail is able to reflect on whether its coverage of minority groups in our society does indeed uphold the highest professional standards of responsible journalism, or rather fuels divisions with real-life consequences.Harun Khan Secretary general, Muslim Council of BritainDavid Walker Bishop of Manchester, Church of EnglandRichard Baker Head of campaigns, Christian AidRabbi Danny Rich Liberal JudaismRabbi Janner-Klausner, Senior Rabbi, Reform JudaismSir Peter Fahy Former chief constable, Greater Manchester PoliceIan Hopkins Chief constable, Greater Manchester PoliceKevin Courtney General secretary, National Union of TeachersMalia Bouattia President, National Union of StudentsDon Flynn Director, Migrant Rights’ NetworkStephen Hale Chief executive, Refugee ActionSarah Crowther Director, Refugees in Effective & Active PartnershipJosie O’Driscoll Chair, Gypsy & Traveller EmpowermentSherrie Smith Project co-ordinator, Report Racism Gypsy Roma TravellerJoanna Mludzinska Chair, Polish Social and Cultural AssociationLinda Burnip Disabled People Against CutsTracey Lazard Chief executive officer, Inclusion LondonChris Whitwell Director, Friends, Families and TravellersJennie Kermode Chair, Trans Media WatchRagih Muflihi Chief executive officer, Yemeni Communities Coordinating CommitteeMostafa Rajaai International Students Officer, National Union of StudentsDiana Holland Assistant general secretary, UniteRobert Monks General secretary, United Road Transport UnionSamayya Afzal Students not SuspectsSimon Woolley Director, Operation Black VoteAlicja Kaczmarek Director, Polish Expats AssociationNeil Jameson Executive director, Citizens UKNick Lowles Chief executive, Hope Not HateYasmin Qureshi MP LabourBrian Paddick Liberal Democrat, House of LordsJoanna Cherry MP Scottish National PartyBaroness Hussein-EceLaurence Hillel Co-director, London Interfaith NetworkMia Hasenson-Gross Director, René CassinDr Edie Friedman Executive director, Jewish Council for Racial EqualityShaykh Ibrahim Mogra Office of British Imams and ScholarsShaykh Arif Abdul Hussain Al-Mahdi InstituteIain Stewart General secretary, Edinburgh Interfaith AssociationRichard Wilson Stop Funding HateNik Noone Chief executive, GalopRobert Behrens Visiting Professor, UCL Institute of EducationPaul Bowen QC Brick Court ChambersHugh Tomlinson QC Matrix Law ChambersDr Omar Khan Director, Runnymede TrustDr Salman al-Azami Liverpool Hope UniversityDr Judith Townend University of SussexDr Kasia Narkowicz University of YorkProfessor Francis Davis University of BirminghamSaleem Kidwai Muslim Council of WalesDr Javed Gill Convenor, Muslim Council of ScotlandHayyan Bhabha Secretary, APPG on IslamophobiaWeyman Bennett & Sabby Dhalu Co-convenors, Stand up to RacismRobin Richardson Insted Consultancy• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
