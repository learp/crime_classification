A patient of Harold Shipman described yesterday how he broke down in tears when he talked about the death of Kathleen Grundy - one of his 15 alleged murder victims.Shipman, 53, of Mottram, Greater Manchester, confided in his patient Lesley Pulford at his surgery in nearby Hyde, a month before his arrest for murder last year. He faces 15 murder charges and one of forging Mrs Grundy's will, which made him the sole beneficiary of her estate worth almost Â£400,000. "He was very emotional and his eyes were welling up with tears at times," Mrs Pulford said in a statement read to Preston crown court yesterday." Dr Shipman told Mrs Pulford that after all the trouble Mrs Grundy had put him through he deserved her money, the court was told. Shipman also claimed that surgery staff would be given some of the money, and had met to decide what to do with it. They had agreed to spend it on a week's holiday each. Part of the inheritance would also be given to an old people's home and shared among new mothers who had babies on the anniversary of Mrs Grundy's death, Dr Shipman maintained. At the time of the alleged conversation, detectives had already begun an investigation into Mrs Grundy's death - but had not arrested Shipman. Earlier Marion Gilchrist, a district nurse and colleague of the doctor, said Shipman had admitted to her that the evidence collected by police pointed to his guilt. Mrs Gilchrist told the court that Shipman said the only thing he had done wrong was not having had Mrs Grundy cremated. "If I'd had her cremated then I wouldn't have all this trouble." The prosecution claimed Shipman altered Mrs Grundy's medical records and gave her a lethal dose of diamorphine or morphine. The case continues today.
