The Conservatives today pledged a tenfold increase in the number of drug treatment centres as part of "tough measures" to reduce violent crime.Theresa May, the party's shadow spokeswoman for families, said an extra 22,500 residential drug rehabilitation places would be created to reduce drug-related crime as part of a six-point law and order action plan.Other proposed measures include increasing police numbers by 5,000 a year, an extra 20,000 prison places, and an end to the early release prison scheme. Ms May said the Conservatives would tackle "dealers and junkies" by giving them the opportunity to undergo a six-month rehabilitation programme - or face the prospect of jail. "Those who accept treatment will face a fresh start," she said. "They will not be sent to prison and they will not have a criminal record. "The Tories would also "send a clear message" on the reclassifying of cannabis, which Ms May described as a "dangerous drug".Meanwhile, the shadow home secretary, David Davis, today showcased Conservative proposals for curbing crime.He said a new kind of local police commissioner would be appointed to increase police autonomy and accountability and respond to the priorities of local communities. "It will allow us to stop the perennial target-setting [for police] by government", he added.Mr Davis cited Home Office figures showing a 9% rise in violent crime, published yesterday, rather than British Crime Survey data published on the same day - which showed an 11% fall.He said the Conservatives' law and order proposals offered voters an alternative to what he called Tony Blair's "complacent" approach. "The violence and lawlessness of some of Britain's inner cities is already spreading to suburbs and market towns across the country," he said. "Let me tell Mr Blair straight. Life in Britain today is very different outside your security bubble."The decline of individual responsibility, the proliferation of so-called human rights, and this government's failure to draw a clear distinction between right and wrong have left Britain powerless in the face of rising crime and disorder."
