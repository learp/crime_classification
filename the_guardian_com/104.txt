Armed police arrested a 20-year-old man today in connection with the murder of teenager Billy Cox.The man was arrested during a raid at a property near Clapham High Street and he is being held at a south London police station.Billy was shot in the chest on the doorstep of his home near Clapham North tube station on Valentine's Day. His death came amid a spate of teenage shootings in London, which helped trigger a summit about gun crime in the capital.Today's arrest was part of an early morning raid by Metropolitan police officers, part of Operation Trident, which investigates deaths among the black community, and was supported by firearms specialists from CO19, a Met spokesman said. "One man, aged 20, was arrested on suspicion of murdering Billy Cox. Four others were arrested on suspicion of possession of controlled drugs with intent to supply," he said.Police said there were no signs of forced entry to the house and it is possible Billy knew his attackers. The back door was also open. His younger sister Elizabeth heard the fatal gunshot and saw her brother injured close to the front door.The teenager was serving a supervision order for a burglary offence and was tagged and restricted to a curfew from 7pm to 7am.Neighbours said they did not believe he was involved in gangs although there were suggestions he may have fallen out with local gang members.Five murders in two weeks led to Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, taking personal overall command of the joint inquiries, and the force's attempts to reassure the public.In response to the killing, officers began armed patrols in south London. Billy's father, Tommy, urged the community to "get behind the police 100%".
