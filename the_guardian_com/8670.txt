The headline crime rate for England and Wales is expected to rise by up to 40% when the latest official figures are published on Thursday.The surge stems from a decision to include an estimate of the scale of online fraud and cybercrime in the headline rate of the Crime Survey for England and Wales for the first time.The Office for National Statistics has said the inclusion of cybercrime, including bank and building society fraud, could add as many as 3.8m incidents to the headline crime survey estimate.The last published results of the quarterly crime survey estimated that there were 6.8m offences experienced by victims in England and Wales in the 12 months to March this year.Figures on online fraud and cybercrime as reported to the police and banks have been published before but have not been included in the headline figures and have not been based on an estimate of the number of victims. The new estimate will include offences such as phishing scams, malware and other attacks on electronic networks.The apparent surge in the crime rate is likely to reignite the debate over whether a long-term decline in crime has taken place in England and Wales over the past 20 years – as the official figures have indicated – or whether criminals have simply given up burgling homes and breaking into cars and moved online.The ONS warning of the expected rise in the official crime rate has been reinforced by the police. The City of London police commissioner, Adrian Leppard, has told colleagues to expect that the changes “will add an extra three million fraud and cyber incidents to the overall level of crime in the UK – an increase of up to 40%”.Labour’s policing spokesman, Jack Dromey, said the figures would undermine the government’s claim that cutting 17,000 police officers was justified by the fall in crime.“Labour have long said that crime is not falling, it is changing. Now we know the truth. The Office of National Statistics are forcing the government’s hand and making them come clean about the new wave of crime hitting the British public – rapidly growing online fraud and cybercrime,” Dromey said.He said there were also increased demands on a depleted police force to tackle child sex exploitation, respond to rising levels of sexual and violent crime and keep Britain safe from terrorism. “Now more than ever we need a police workforce fit for the 21st century. The truth about crime is finally being told and I urge Theresa May to stop putting the public at risk,” Dromey said.
