A senior judge was today found not guilty of exposing himself to a woman on a busy commuter train.Sir Stephen Richards, a court of appeal judge, was cleared after City of Westminster magistrates concluded that the case came down to his word against that of the woman.The senior district judge, Timothy Workman, criticised the British Transport police for failing to properly investigate the matter by obtaining CCTV footage from the train and said it meant today's ruling was inevitable."That evidence may well have supported her identification and, equally, may have exonerated Sir Stephen," he told the court.The judge said the lack of any supporting evidence meant identification - the key element of the case - could not be confirmed, and that Sir Stephen should be cleared.He also praised the "clear, dignified and truthful evidence" of the woman, a City worker in her 20s.Sir Stephen - who always insisted he was not the man in question - said after the case he was looking forward to resuming a "normal life" and his full judicial duties."Throughout the trial I have put my trust in the legal process, and I am delighted that it has enabled me to clear my name," he said as he stood next to his wife of 31 years."Lucy and I would like to express our deep gratitude to our family and friends for their tremendous kindness and support over the last few months."Sir Stephen, a father of three, had denied two counts of "intentionally exposing his genitals, intending that someone would see them and would be caused alarm or distress". He had been accused of exposing himself to the woman on a train between Wimbledon, south-west London, and Waterloo on October 16 and October 24 last year.Sir Stephen, who has overseen a number of high-profile hearings, told the court it would have been entirely out of character for him to do such a thing."I am a happily married family man and I cannot perceive deriving any form of gratification from exposing my penis," he said. "I value greatly the attributes of courtesy and respect other people and I hope that I have held those attributes throughout my personal life."At one point yesterday, when asked about the type of underwear he normally uses, Sir Stephen held up a pair of black Calvin Klein briefs and showed them to the court.The woman told the court how she had been on the rush hour train on October 16 when she saw that a "very kind-looking" gentleman was exposing himself to her.She told magistrates that the well-dressed, grey-haired man, aged between 55 and 60, had "boxed" her into a corner against glass panels so no other passenger could see."Because I was embarrassed and nothing like this had happened to me before, I assumed this was an accident," she said. "I did not want to draw attention to the situation, to me or to the gentleman, so I carried on reading my paper." She said she saw the same man on the same journey eight days later, and noticed that his flies were undone and he appeared to be moving into a similar position.After taking two photos of the man using her mobile phone as he left Waterloo, she reported the matter the next day.In January, she returned to the same train route, accompanied by a police officer, and identified the man she said had exposed himself as Sir Stephen.
