New York-style policing could come to Britain's streets under plans launched by the Conservative party today.Oliver Letwin, the shadow home secretary, is to propose "neighbourhood policing" based on policies that he says have helped drive down crime in New York by 60% over the last decade. Under the policy, individual police officers would be allocated to small neighbourhoods in the cities of England and Wales and focus constantly on reducing crime on their beat. Mr Letwin said that murder rates in the city, which once had a reputation as one of the world's most dangerous places, were now down to levels last seen in the 1890s, while violent crime had reduced by 75%.  "I don't think there is any miracle about it," he said this morning. "It's not just New York - in Philadelphia, San Diego, Boston and many other American cities, the same pattern has been followed." He said the neighbourhood police strategy involved "getting the police back on to the streets, making the neighbourhood cop be someone who regards himself or herself as the custodian of the neighbourhood, constantly patrolling". He added: "The government is moving in this general direction sporadically, with quick fixes. The difference is I am saying we need to do it full-scale, right the way across the country and quickly, rather than in bits and pieces," he added.However Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman, attacked the plans. "A radical blueprint for modern policing this is not. I hear no answers to the difficult questions of police retention, police pensions and the low clear-up rates that most communities complain about," he said. "Today's Tory announcement is a discovery of the obvious. Liberal Democrats have been calling for police officers in every community, serving every community, for years."Mr Letwin will set out his plan in a speech tonight.
