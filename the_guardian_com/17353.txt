Amy Winehouse's former husband has been jailed for two years and eight months for a burglary carried out to pay for his drug addiction.Blake Fielder-Civil, 29, admitted the theft and carrying an imitation firearm, allegedly because he was scared of reprisals from drug-trafficking gangs.He smiled briefly at the public gallery and thanked Judge Scott Wolstenholme, who had told a sentencing hearing at Leeds crown court: "This illustrates how low drug users will stoop when in the grip of heroin addiction."The judge added that the case, which saw Fielder-Civil's accomplice Christopher Sylvester, 29, jailed for a similar period, would bring "no comfort to the people preyed on by drug addicts".The two men had ransacked a house in the Leeds suburb of Rawdon and would have got away with it had police not spotted their car's stolen number plates.The court heard that the fake gun was found with a hammer and a balaclava made from tracksuit bottoms when the car was stopped in February. Jewellery and TV equipment worth Â£4,000 stolen in the burglary were then found in the boot.Fielder-Civil, of Sleaford, Lincolnshire, went into the music trade as a video production assistant after leaving Bourne grammar school to try his luck in London. He married Winehouse in Miami in 2007 but the couple were divorced two years later after a troubled and sometimes violent relationship. An attempted reconciliation after the divorce failed.He was jailed for 27 months in 2008 for drug offences, but his lawyer Richard Reed said in mitigation that he was full of regret and remorse and was now drug-free. He had "done his best" for his current partner Sarah Aspin and their recently-born child.Both men will serve half their sentences before being considered for parole. Fielder-Civil also faces court proceedings over confiscation under proceeds-from-crime legislation.
