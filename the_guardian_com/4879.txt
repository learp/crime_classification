The victimsâ€™ commissioner is right that too often victims of crime do not get what they need from the justice system (Victims of crime let down by criminal justice system, report finds, theguardian.com, 27 January). Efforts to address this are welcome. But the best way to engage and empower victims is to increase the availability of restorative justice, which enables victims to meet the offender, explain the impact that the offence had on them, and potentially receive an explanation and an apology. It can also help offenders to understand the impact of their actions, take responsibility and make amends.There is widespread political and public support for greater use of this approach, which both improves victim satisfaction and reduces reoffending. Restorative justice should be made available to every victim of crime who wants it, wherever they live and at any stage of the criminal justice process.Jon CollinsChief executive officer, Restorative Justice Council
