A mother began a 28-day jail sentence yesterday after her daughter repeatedly played truant from school.The girl, a year 10 pupil at a community college in Devon, had attended just seven times in the last 195 school days.Plymouth magistrates heard that the Devon education welfare service had been involved in the case since 2004. It was the mother's fourth time in court.The mother, 46, was convicted for failing to ensure her daughter went to school after a trial, and jailed for 14 days for the latest offence and a further 14 days for breaching a conditional discharge.Devon's principal education welfare officer, Beverley Dubash, said: "In cases where parents do not take their parental responsibilities seriously we will take legal action to ensure children go to school."The girl was described as a "bright and capable student".Teachers had tried to encourage her with "imaginative timetables and alternative provision including work experience".In 2002 mother of five Patricia Amos became Britain's first person to be jailed for failing to send her children to school.
