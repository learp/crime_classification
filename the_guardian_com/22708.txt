The fall in crime in England and Wales is accelerating, with a 9% drop recorded by the police, according to Home Office quarterly crime figures published today.But the sharp drop is marred by a 4% rise in gun crime and a 21% rise in recorded drug offences.Gun crime is up by 427 offences, to 10,182. However, the rise mainly involves incidents in which no one was injured and the number of gun-related deaths has actually fallen from 55 to 49 in the 12 months to September 2007.Home Office statisticians said the rise in recorded drug offences coincided with the reclassification of cannabis, which allowed officers to issue on-the-spot cautions instead of arresting and prosecuting offenders.Overall, today's two separate sets of crime figures - those recorded by the police and by the British Crime Survey which measures people's experience of crime - both show sharp falls. The police figures record a drop from 1,359,000 offences to 1,240,800, and the BCS estimate a 4% fall over the same period.The police figures show violent crime falling by 8%, including a 17% drop in robbery, and falls of 12% in car crime and 11% in criminal damage.The BCS also shows slightly fewer people have high levels of worry about violent crime. But public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability in dealing with youth crime is eroding.The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, described them as excellent results. "I am particularly pleased that the risk of being a victim of crime is now at a historically low level. Enforcement is a key part of our approach to tackling drug harm and I welcome further evidence that police are maintaining a tight grip on drug offending," she said.Smith has been defending the government record on crime this week after she told a newspaper at the weekend that she would not feel safe walking the streets late at night in parts of London that she did not know.The Tories, who have criticised Labour's record on gun crime and violent crime, seized on the comments, describing them as "shameful" and an "astonishing admission"; Smith argued it was not unusual for women to be cautious about being out alone at night in areas they did not know.
