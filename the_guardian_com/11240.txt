The parents of Rhys Jones today came face to face with the teenager accused of killing their 11-year-old son.Stephen and Melanie Jones, who wore a purple ribbon as part of a campaign against gun crime in Liverpool, looked on at the city's magistrates court as the 17-year-old defendant was charged with the schoolboy's murder.Wearing a black hooded tracksuit top, the teenager - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - spoke only to confirm his name and address.He did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody to reappear at the court next Friday.As the details of the charge were read out, Rhys's mother broke into tears, dabbing her eyes with a white handkerchief.Rhys was walking home from football practice on August 22 last year when he was hit in the neck by a bullet. He died in his mother's arms at the scene.Five other defendants will appear in court today. Melvyn Coy, 24, Gary Kayes, 25, and three teenagers, aged 15, 16 and 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will all face charges of assisting an offender.The 16-year-old will face an extra charge of possessing a firearm.Security at the court was increased for today's hearing.

Four adults, aged 54, 50, 49, and 22, and a 16-year-old youth, have already been released on bail.A 21-year-old woman was released without charge, and a 20-year old man remains in custody but has not yet been charged since his arrest yesterday.The arrests followed one of the biggest murder inquiries carried out by Merseyside police in recent years.Yesterday, Detective Superintendent Dave Kelly thanked Rhys's parents for their "support and patience"."They have shown courage, strength and dignity during what must have been a truly terrible time for them," he said.
