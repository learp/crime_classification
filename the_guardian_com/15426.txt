The celebrity publicist Max Clifford is facing up to two years in jail after becoming the first public figure to be convicted of sexual offences under Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree inquiry.Clifford, 71, was convicted of sexually abusing four girls following an eight-week trial at Southwark crown court in London, which heard how the PR guru used his celebrity connections to bully starstruck teenagers into performing sex acts over a period of 10 years.After deliberating for around 37 hours, the jury convicted Clifford on eight counts of indecent assault and cleared him of two further counts. Jurors could not reach a verdict on one additional charge of indecent assault.The guilty verdicts make Clifford the first conviction under Operation Yewtree, the £2.7m investigation into historical sex offences triggered by the Jimmy Savile scandal in 2012. His conviction will also lift the pressure on the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) following the recent acquittals of Tory MP Nigel Evans and Coronation Street actor William Roache.Dressed in a blue blazer and listening to proceedings with the aid of a hearing loop, Clifford showed little emotion as the guilty verdicts were returned. He was bailed and will be sentenced on Friday.Outside court, he refused to apologise to his victims, whom he labelled throughout the trial as fantasists and liars."I've been told by my lawyers to say nothing at all," he said, before being ushered past a battery of camera lenses into a waiting car. His daughter Louise, who was by her father's side during the eight days of jury deliberations, was comforted by several of Clifford's supporters, including one friend who nodded his head when asked whether the PR man was the victim of a witch hunt.

He saw a vulnerable person and took advantage of someone who was a child and it was awful. It was a nightmare."It had huge implications for me as a young person. To see him then become very high profile, to speak openly about others ... and damn them, and create a persona of a respectable high-profile man who was lauded by the media was sickening to say the least."Another woman, who told the trial how she was humiliated by Clifford when she went to his office to audition for a film role, told ITV News: "If you've done something wrong like that, and you've upset and hurt people and maybe affected their lives, you could say sorry, instead of calling them liars, opportunists and all this horrible stuff."One of the women abused by Clifford told the trial she wanted to kill herself after being repeatedly sexually abused by him in 1977. Speaking from behind a screen, the woman told how Clifford promised her a modelling career and impressed her family with his A-list connections, while secretly taking her on long drives and bullying her into performing sex acts.The court heard how the millionaire publicist, who has represented a string of stars in his 50-year career, used his office in New Bond Street, London, as his own "sexual fiefdom" and impersonated Hollywood icons to lure girls into his grasp. He convinced one 19-year-old she could land a role in a film starring American actor Charles Bronson, before pinning her down and groping her in his office.In another alleged assault, which was not a charge on the indictment because it took place abroad, Clifford is said to have forced a 12-year-old girl to masturbate him in a jacuzzi while on holiday in Spain after befriending her parents.Clifford has repeatedly denied the claims since his arrest in December 2012, describing them as the lies of women seeking compensation following the Jimmy Savile revelations.He remained defiant to the end, posing each day for photographs outside court and being surrounded by a dozen of his supporters, including his daughter and several employees of his PR agency, Max Clifford Associates.In one unguarded moment during the jury's deliberations, Clifford compared the agony of the trial to the emotional turmoil of caring for his first wife, Elizabeth Porter, who died of lung cancer in 2003, and his own battle with prostate cancer in 2007. The trial had cost him £1m in lost business, he said, and his legal costs amounted to about £250,000.After the verdicts, Jenny Hopkins, of the CPS, said: "Today's verdicts provide a long-denied justice to the victims of serious sexual offences. I would like to thank these victims for having had the courage to come forward and give evidence."The victims of sexual abuse, whenever it may have taken place, should know that police and prosecutors will listen. It is only right that we now take some time to consider our position on the hung count and we will update the court accordingly."Speaking outside court, DCI Michael Orchard, from Operation Yewtree, said: "I would like to thank the victims for their courage and strength in coming forward to speak to us. I hope they feel and know that they were listened to."While this was a high profile trial, officers work tirelessly to bring offenders of sexual abuse to justice on a daily basis."
