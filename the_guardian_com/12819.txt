Two 10-year-old boys today appeared in court charged with raping a girl under the age of 13.The boys – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were accompanied by their mothers at the hearing, which took place at Uxbridge magistrates court, in west London.Each of them faces two charges of rape in connection with an attack alleged to have taken place in a park in Hayes, also in west London, on 27 October this year.They were charged under section five of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.The boys spoke in the youth court only to confirm their names and dates of birth and to show that they understood their bail conditions.They did not appear in the dock, but instead sat next to their solicitors and mothers on a bench opposite the magistrates.The prosecutor, Aalapi Mehta, sat nearby. Two rows of lawyers and police, as well as press officers from the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan police, sat behind them.Media admission to the courtroom was strictly limited, with only six members of the print and broadcast media allowed in.The boys were released on conditional bail, with instructions not to contact the alleged victim, her family, or each other.They were also told they could only visit certain parts of Hayes if they were accompanied by their mothers.After establishing that the defendants both understood the bail conditions imposed on them, the magistrates, chaired by Linda Paterson, adjourned the case until 28 January.It will then be sent for trial at crown court.
