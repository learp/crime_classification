Suppose the appeal court had found no extenuating circumstances yesterday. If that had happened, Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who shot dead a 16-year-old burglar who had broken into his remote farmhouse, would still have been serving a life sentence today. There would have been no other option. Life remains the mandatory sentence for murder, even though a succession of five different advisory groups since 1975 have called for it to be made the maximum, rather than the mandatory, sentence.The main challenge posed by this case is not, as Mr Martin's defenders assert, the need to introduce a new presumption of reasonable force when a victim of burglary ends up killing the burglar. Victims already have more than an adequate protection in this respect. The judge in the original trial specifically directed the jury that they could return a verdict of manslaughter over the killing if they found Mr Martin "did not intend to kill or cause serious bodily harm". They rightly decided his actions went beyond appropriate self-defence: hence the murder verdict. Yesterday the appeal court concurred with this decision declaring there was no justification for Mr Martin to take the law into his own hands. The uncle of the dead boy put it in poignant language: "You can replace possessions but you can't replace a son's life." Burglary is a serious anti-social activity, but even the organiser of the Norfolk farmwatch scheme conceded "no one could suggest death is an appropriate punishment for burglary". New evidence by a psychiatrist on the farmer's paranoid personality disorder saved him. It persuaded the appeal judges to replace murder with a manslaughter conviction on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The life sentence was thus quashed. But it should never have been imposed even under the murder conviction. It now rests with politicians to allow more proportionate sentences than just life for murder.
