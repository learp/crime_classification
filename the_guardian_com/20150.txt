Detectives investigating the stabbing of nurse Cheryl Moss were last night questioning an 18-year-old man in connection with her death.The man was arrested after police found a blue bag in a road close to St George's hospital in Hornchurch, Essex, where the 33-year-old auxiliary nurse was stabbed to death on Thursday morning.Mrs Moss was murdered in what was described as a "frenzied attack" while taking a cigarette break in a woodland area known as Tobacco Alley behind her workplace.Her body was found at about 11am by a woman who was walking her dog in the area.Police appealed for witnesses yesterday as scores of officers scoured the murder site for forensic science evidence. Another man was arrested and interviewed earlier in the day, although the arrest was not believed to be significant.Police said yesterday that early indications suggested Mrs Moss had been attacked by a stranger, and added that they were not ruling out a link to the murder of the American artist Margaret Muller, who was killed in a similar attack in Victoria Park, Hackney, three years ago. That murder remains unsolved.Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald, who is leading the murder inquiry, said: "We would urge anybody who was visiting the hospital or in the area on Thursday morning who may have seen anything, or anyone acting suspiciously, to get in touch with us."Speaking at the scene, Detective Superintendent Dick Langley said police had no eyewitnesses and no CCTV footage that covered the actual area of the attack."The chances are this person was hanging around for some time," he said. The hospital catered mostly for elderly patients, and it was unlikely any of them would be capable of such a violent attack, he said.Extra police were patrolling the hospital and there were plans to step up security in the area, following three murders in the last two weeks.Mr Langley added: "The obvious thing is to take care and not go out alone."Yesterday afternoon Mrs Moss's family paid a visit to the spot where the nurse was murdered and spoke to her colleagues and police officers.They also examined floral tributes which have been attached to the entrance gates of the hospital. They were too upset to speak to the press.Ralph McCormack, chief executive of Havering primary care trust, which oversees the hospital, said some staff who were close to Mrs Moss could not face coming into work.He added: "We are doing what we can to support them and a number of them have not come into work today. They will need some time to recover and personal space to do that." They would be offered counselling.
