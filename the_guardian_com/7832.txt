A photograph of a blonde girl in Morocco is not of Madeleine McCann, it was reported today.British media said the picture was of the three-year-old daughter of a local family.Journalists had flocked to Morocco after the picture, showing a small girl being carried in a sling on the back of a woman in traditional dress, was published.The photo, which was passed to Interpol, is likely to be examined by experts from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) using facial recognition software.However, reporters tracked down the family in the photo, who lived a mile away from where it was taken by a Spanish tourist three weeks ago.Clarence Mitchell, the McCanns' spokesman, said: "Clearly, if these reports that the girl in the photograph isn't Madeleine are true, it is disappointing news."This is why Gerry and Kate refused to comment on individual sightings, and why I was advising caution overnight."Clearly, the search for Madeleine will continue, and I would appeal for everyone to refocus their efforts to achieve her safe return." Although there have been numerous reported sightings of Madeleine, who disappeared from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, this is the first time a photograph has come to light.The picture was taken on August 31 in Zinat, in the north of Morocco, by Clara Torres. The woman, from Albacete, was around 200 metres away from the girl when she took the photo.She told the Spanish radio station Cope that she had called police in Spain on Monday after hearing about possible sightings of Madeleine in Morocco. Officers passed on the photograph to Interpol.A Ceop spokesman could not confirm that it had been given the photo, but said: "We do have experts who are specialists at analysing photographs and video material."In May, Ceop appealed for holidaymakers staying at Praia da Luz at the time of Madeleine's disappearance to send them photos - which could be analysed at a rate of up to 1,000 images per hour - in the hope they could shed light on what happened.There were two sightings of a blonde girl matching Madeleine's description in Marrakech on May 9, and it was reported yesterday that there had been a third potential sighting in northern Morocco later that month.Another Spanish woman is convinced she saw Madeleine in the town of Zaio, being led across a street by a Moroccan woman in Muslim dress.In August, Belgium police examined DNA from a soft drink bottle after a girl bearing a resemblance to Madeleine was spotted in a Belgian restaurant. The results proved negative.
