I’d like people to remember Lee as his family and friends do – as a son, brother, father, partner, uncle and comrade.“That’s why we’ve decided to release this footage of Lee filmed by his family, including clips of him smiling and trying to dance with his sister Sara, at his passing out parade and drumming in full ceremonial gear in Windsor. Watching it makes me so proud of him.” Last year, a memorial was set up for the drummer in Woolwich at the military barracks to which he was returning when he was attacked.The two men convicted of his murder, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, are thought to have targeted Rigby because of his connection with the armed forces.

I’d like to use my son’s name for good. No one should have to go through what my family has suffered.”
