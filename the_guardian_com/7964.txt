Plainclothes police in the West Midlands may be routinely issued with body armour in the wake of the fatal stabbing of Detective Constable Michael Swindells.The father-of-one was attacked in broad daylight on a towpath in Birmingham on Friday after confronting a man wielding a machete with an eight-inch blade. He was unarmed and not wearing body armour. As officers yesterday paid tribute to a 'warm, charismatic' colleague, the West Midlands force announced it was reviewing its policy on protective vests. Although they are standard issue among frontline uniformed police officers, experts believe the killing will ensure all plainclothes officers are given similar protection. The 44-year-old bled to death after being stabbed once in the stomach when he ran to the aid of colleagues who had called for back-up, in the Nechells area of Birmingham. His wife Carol and daughter Kelly, 19, were described as going through a 'terrible time'. A 48-year-old man, arrested after police marksmen shot him with baton rounds, was being questioned last night in connection with the attack.
