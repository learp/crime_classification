The Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre said yesterday it had arrested 83 alleged sex offenders over the past 12 months.The agency said it has rescued 76 children from "sexual abuse environments" in its first year of operation, according to an annual review.Ten of those were traced through clues in online pictures of them being abused. Three major international paedophile rings involving up to 800 people were cracked as a result of the agency's work.Officers at the centre work with agencies across the world, posing as children to locate paedophiles using the web.The centre's appeals and inquiries have also led to 12 of the UK's "highest-risk" child sex offenders being located."These figures speak for themselves," said Jim Gamble, the chief executive. "What they mean is that any offender looking to groom a child today online stands a good chance of grooming an undercover officer instead ... now that is a massive deterrent."He said that his officers were dealing with 3,000 cases of child abuse. "We have to look at the scale of this issue, as in one operation alone over 1,000 lines of enquiry relating to UK suspects were passed to us from our US counterparts."He also raised concerns about the tendency for children to post material about themselves on the internet which "pushes the boundaries".Mr Gamble also said that online gaming and social networking websites were being frequented by sex offenders seeking vulnerable children.Ceop, which is affiliated to the Serious Organised Crime Agency, raises awareness about internet grooming among children and parents and encourages members of the public to report abuse. There have been 2,500 reports of suspected child abuse activity online since its launch in April last year.
