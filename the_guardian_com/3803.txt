Members of a gang accused of plotting to blow up transatlantic flights from Heathrow discussed taking their wives and children on missions, a court heard today. Peter Wright QC said that police, who had planted a bug in an east London flat used by the alleged plotters, listened to Abdulla Ahmed Ali and Umar Islam discuss a train bombing in which one participant wanted to take his child. Ali said: "That's why he wanted to take his kid on the train with him — shake them up." Wright said Islam discussed his wife joining the plot if it was a "significant operation". Ali was overheard considering taking his child but said his wife "would not agree to it". The prosecutor said: "Such a sacrifice is beyond contemplation for those who are the targets but not those who participate in activities such as this."The bug was planted in a flat in Forest Road, Walthamstow, purchased for use as a "bomb factory", the court heard. It was bought for £138,000 in cash in July 2006, one month before the alleged conspirators were arrested.Earlier the jury was shown extracts of "martyrdom" videos made by six of the eight men on trial. Prosecutors said videos made by six of the eight accused were found in the boot of a car after a police raid in Walthamstow in August 2006.Islam described his planned actions in the recording as "revenge" for the actions of the United States and its "accomplices such as the British and the Jews".He said most people were "too busy watching Home And Away and EastEnders, complaining about the World Cup, drinking your alcohol, to care about anything".Ali described himself as the leader of the group and said he had aspired to martyrdom since the age of 15 or 16. "Sheikh Osama has warned you many times to leave our lands or you will be destroyed, and now the time has come for you to be destroyed," he said.Ali said he was "over the moon that Allah has given me the opportunity to lead this blessed operation" and warned others to "stop meddling in our affairs"."Otherwise expect floods of martyr operations against you and we will take our revenge and anger, ripping amongst your people and scattering the people and your body parts and your people's body parts responsible for these wars and oppression decorating the streets," he said.In Ibrahim Savant's video he said all Muslims "feel the need to dust their feet in the training camps of jihad where men are made". Tanvir Hussain said "collateral damage" would be inevitable in the struggle against the west and his only wish was that he could "come back and do this again".The men planned to explode bombs hidden in soft-drink bottles aboard planes heading across the Atlantic, the prosecution alleges.More than 1,500 passengers and crew would have been killed on at least seven flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow's Terminal 3.The jury was shown photographs of what the prosecution claimed were bomb making materials, stored in cupboards in the kitchen of the "bomb factory".These included bottles of soft drinks Lucozade and Oasis, AA batteries, wires, syringes, food dye and disposable cameras. Police bugged the flat between July and August 2006. The men deny conspiring to murder between January 1 and August 11 2006, and conspiring to commit an act of violence likely to endanger the safety of an aircraft between the same dates.The jury was told that a computer memory stick found concealed in Assad Sarwar's High Wycombe home contained evidence that the gang considered other "targets of national and regional significance".Wright said these included Canary Wharf, a gas pipeline between Belgium and the UK and various UK airports and power stations, including nuclear facilities.When police searched Sarwar's garage they found 18 litres of hydrogen peroxide, a jar of wires, syringes, a thermometer and latex gloves, the jury was told. Sarwar did not record a video because he was not destined to die in the plot, said Wright.The accused are Ali, aka Ahmed Ali Khan, 27, of Walthamstow; Sarwar, 27, of High Wycombe; Hussain, 27, of no fixed address; Mohammed Gulzar, 26, of Barking; Savant, 27, of Walthamstow; Khan, 26, of Walthamstow; Zaman, 23, of Walthamstow; and Islam, aka Brian Young, 29, of High Wycombe.
