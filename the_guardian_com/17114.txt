  Stephen Lawrence murder: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris are accused of killing the black teenager at a bus stop in Eltham, London, in 1993, Photograph: CPS/PAEighteen years and six months since she lost her first-born child, Doreen Lawrence watched as a jury was asked to convict two men for the murder of her son Stephen.Mark Ellison QC, opening the case for the crown, told the jury of the attack by a gang that claimed the life of Lawrence, then aged 18, on 22 April 1993.As the crown began to detail the attack on Tuesday morning, Lawrence's father Neville left the courtroom.Ellison said Lawrence and a friend, Duwayne Brooks, were set upon as they searched for a bus home in Eltham, south London, at just after 10.35pm.There was a group of about five white men, the jury heard, who approached the two young African-Caribbean men.Ellison said: "One of the group was heard by Duwayne Brooks to say, 'What, what nigger?' and at the same time the white group began to rush towards them."The jury heard that Brooks, who was ahead of Lawrence, urged him to flee, shouting "get up and run Steve". But by then Lawrence had been caught by the white group, which "swallowed" him up through its "weight of numbers".Ellison said "hand and leg movements" were seen by a witness as Lawrence was attacked. He was stabbed twice, in his upper torso.Ellison said: "Stephen Lawrence was likely to have been upright when wound one was inflicted, but may have been lying on the ground by the time he was stabbed in the left shoulder."The group fled, the jury heard, leaving Lawrence dying on the pavement. Despite efforts to save him, he was pronounced dead by around midnight. His death was caused by the loss of blood caused by the stab wounds.Ellison said the crown's case was that Gary Dobson, now 36, and David Norris, now 35, were part of the group that attacked and stabbed Lawrence. The crown will show, said Ellison, that new scientific evidence ties the defendants to the scene.A cold case review, which began in 2007, used new scientific techniques on clothing belonging to Dobson and Norris that was seized by police in 1993.The defendants' clothing, Ellison said, had textile fibres, blood and hair, linked to Stephen, that "they must have been members of the group that attacked Stephen Lawrence that night".The defendants sat in the glass-fronted dock of court 16 of the central criminal court in the City of London flanked by prison guards.The jury has been told that the "reliability and significance" of new scientific evidence will be a central part of the case. The defence will question its reliability.The trial is scheduled to last until just before Christmas, though arrangements have been made in case it runs into the new year.Dobson and Norris have denied involvement in the murder, which took place when they were both teenagers.The case is being heard before Mr Justice Treacy at the Old Bailey.The jury of 12 people, including four women and three ethnic minorities, were sworn in on Tuesday morning. They took an oath to "give true verdicts according to the evidence".The trial continues.
