A human head was found in a bag today by a woman out walking in a residential area of Edinburgh.Detectives said the head was some years old and appears to be mummified."Obviously we are at the very early stages of this investigation and at the moment we are trying to establish the identity of the deceased," said a spokesman for Lothian and Borders police."At this stage it would appear that the remains are a number of years old, although it can't be said for certain how old they are until the necessary tests are carried out."The head was found on a public footpath in the Edinburgh's Newhaven district. The woman who found it called police at around 10.30am.Officers are carrying out forensic examinations at the scene and the area has been cordoned off."Cause of death is unknown, and we will continue our inquiries in order to establish how the remains have came to be on the footpath," said the spokesman.
