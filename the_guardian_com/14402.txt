Police yesterday named an elderly man who could be the first male victim of the serial killer Harold Shipman.Charles Killan, 90, died at home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in February 1997, while being treated by Shipman, who was his family doctor. South Manchester coroner John Pollard will begin holding a series of inquests into a list of 24 suspected victims of the serial killer next month. Mr Killan is the only male patient on the list. It is believed that Shipman, who is serving 15 life sentences in Frankland prison, Durham, for the murder of 15 patients with lethal injections of diamorphine, could have been responsible for the deaths of 200 patients. A full public inquiry will be held into the former GP's activities next year. Earlier this year, the relatives of his victims, and eight national newspapers, made a successful legal challenge to a decision by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, that the hearing should be held in private.
