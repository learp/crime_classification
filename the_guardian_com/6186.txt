The parents of Madeleine McCann will today begin a libel action against a Portuguese newspaper that claimed they were believed by detectives to have killed their own daughter.Lawyers for the family said the claims were defamatory, completely untrue and caused the couple "humiliation and suffering".A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann said: "The McCanns feel these allegations are very serious and highly damaging. They also feel that it is a distraction from the investigation."Last Friday the Tal & Qual newspaper reported that the Policia Judiciaria blamed the parents for the death of four-year-old Madeleine, who vanished almost four months ago. The newspaper's front-page story carried the headline "PJ believe that the parents killed Maddie", while a second report in the same edition read "PJ believe in the fault of the parents".The front-page article said "police believe" the McCanns caused their daughter's death either by accident or with a fatal drug overdose. The allegations were attributed to a source close to the murder inquiry.The McCanns' spokesman said: "The straightforward facts are Madeleine was taken from her bed on May 3 and she is still missing. Police have said time and again that Kate and Gerry McCann are not suspects."Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa, who is leading the investigation, told Sky News he had said nothing to the paper."I don't know where the paper got this information from," he said."Journalists will write anything to sell newspapers. I have been quoted before when I have said nothing."Analysts said the legal action could take months or years to resolve.Lawyers for the McCanns will send legal documents to a court in the northern Portuguese city of Oporto, where the newspaper is based, later today.Madeleine has not been seen since she disappeared from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, southern Portugal, as her parents ate at a nearby restaurant.She had been due to start school in Leicestershire yesterday. A place at Bishop Ellis Catholic primary school in Thurmaston remained empty.
