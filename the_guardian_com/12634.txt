Your article is right to identify the need to do more to tackle sexual harassment and violence in our society (Calls for action by universities on ‘epidemic’ of harassment on campus, 7 March). It omitted, however, to mention the significant amount of work already done in universities to address the issue. We were members of Universities UK’s taskforce that looked at this area last year. Having consulted widely with students, universities and support groups, the taskforce report, Changing the Culture, was clear that universities should adopt a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence and harassment and it made a series of recommendations to universities. This work is ongoing and there is more to come.While the focus on universities’ procedures and reporting systems is important, it is also about promoting a general culture change in relation to sexual harassment and violence. We are pleased that universities are taking a lead role in this area, with a range of innovative campaigns and initiatives to highlight up-front the behaviours that are expected from all students and staff. While this is clearly not an issue isolated to university campuses, the sector is tackling it head-on to help ensure that students and staff can enjoy a safe and positive time at university.Professor David Richardson Vice-chancellor, University of East AngliaProfessor Janet Beer Vice-chancellor, University of Liverpool• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
