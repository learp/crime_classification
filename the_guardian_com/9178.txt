Scotland Yard have suspended one of their highest ranking ethnic minority officers over allegations of misconduct.Superintendent Ali Dizaei faces a "significant number" of allegations that police say cover a range of internal disciplinary and criminal issues.Mr Dizaei is legal advisor to the National Black Police Association and was based at Kensington and Chelsea station in London.This morning's suspension is said by Scotland Yard sources to be one of the most challenging issues to face the force in the post-Macpherson era.A spokesman said that the allegations cover matters of dishonesty, attempting to pervert the course of justice, personal misconduct and integrity.Mr Dizaei was formally suspended this morning, following an eight-month internal investigation.He joined the Met two years ago from the Thames Valley force and is a trained lawyer. Mr Dizaei was unavailable for comment.The Met say that they have voluntarily referred the case to the Police Complaints Authority.Mr Dizaei hit the headlines in 1999 when he accused the police service of "ethnic cleansing" black and Asian candidates.Testing procedures used to pick senior ranks were "culturally biased", he said.The Iranian-born law graduate recently criticised Home Secretary Jack Straw for reinstating a PC who called a teenager a "black bastard" during a struggle to arrest him.Related stories20.12.2000: Sudden care for our morale, by Superintendent Ali Dizaei18.1.2001: Huge rise in race crime, reveals government17.1.2001: Embarrassed Met admits error leave just four ethnic recruits14.1.2001: Now Met's staff say force is racist11.1.2001: Racist firms keep black unemployment highRelated special reportRace in BritainUseful linksHome Office report in full (pdf)Home OfficeEuropean Commission against racism and intoleranceCampaign Against Racism and FascismCommission for Racial EqualitySearchlight
