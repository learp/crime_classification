The mother of Baby Peter, who was jailed indefinitely for her part in her son's brutal death, has dropped a bid to appeal against her sentence.Tracey Connelly, 28, Tottenham, north London, who was jailed at the Old Bailey in May, was expected to have an appeal application heard by senior judges in the court of appeal tomorrow.But it emerged today that Connelly, who was ordered to serve at least five years behind bars before she can apply for parole, has now abandoned her appeal.Connelly was sentenced along with her boyfriend Steven Barker, 33, and lodger Jason Owen, for causing or allowing the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly.Peter died on 3 August 2007 after suffering months of torture and abuse at the home where he lived in north London with Connelly, Barker and Owen.A judge ordered Connelly's acquittal on a murder charge due to insufficient evidence about who had been the perpetrators of the abuse. None of the three has ever admitted which one of them was responsible for abuse which resulted in 50 separate injuries on Peter's body, including a fractured spine.Owen, 37, who had been staying at Peter's home with his 15-year-old girlfriend, is to have a sentence appeal application heard by the court of appeal tomorrow.Owen, of Bromley, Kent, was also given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum term of three years.Peter was on the child protection register of Haringey council and had been seen at least 60 times by professionals, including social workers and doctors, but he was not taken into care.
