A 48-year-old man was today being questioned by police hunting a serial rapist who has attacked 10 girls and women in south-east England.The man, from Ashford, Kent, was arrested at 11.30pm last night near junction 5 of the M20, a spokesman for Kent police said. The search for the so-called "trophy rapist" - he has taken a personal item from each of his victims - has become the biggest manhunt of its kind since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. Operation Orb was set up to investigate nine rapes and one attempted rape on girls and women aged between 10 and 52 in London, Kent, Berkshire, Surrey and Hertfordshire. Police believe the 10 attacks carried out over the last year are linked. The acting head of Operation Orb, Detective Superintendent Mark Warwick of Thames Valley police, described the arrest as a "key, significant event".He told a press conference outside Maidstone police station today: "It is a significant development but obviously we have to treat it as part of an ongoing inquiry. Inquiries are still continuing in Operation Orb." He confirmed that the man arrested was married. The "trophy rapist" is first thought to have struck on November 15 last year when a 10-year-old girl was raped near Ashford, Kent. There was a break of eight months before, on July 1 this year, a 12-year-old girl was raped in Bracknell, Berkshire. On July 11, a 30-year-old woman was raped in Earlswood, Surrey, and on the same day a 26-year-old woman was raped on Putney Common, south London. On July 16, an 18-year-old woman was raped in Woking, Surrey, and on August 6 a 52-year-old woman was raped on Wimbledon Common, south London. The following day, a 26-year-old woman was raped in Epsom, Surrey, and on September 6 a 13-year-old girl was raped near Woking. A 22-year-old woman was attacked in Ripley Green, Surrey, on September 16. The latest attack took place on October 25, when a 14-year-old girl was raped in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
