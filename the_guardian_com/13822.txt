Armed police were sent to a Merseyside school to investigate internet threats of an apparently imminent gun rampage after they received an alert from the FBI.More than 1,000 students, some taking their GCSEs, were said to be in the school, which local media claimed was in virtual "lockdown" during the scare.A 19-year-old man was arrested and later bailed over the incident concerning St Aelred's Catholic Technology College at Newton-le-Willows on Friday. It came after the FBI picked up a menacing posting on Facebook.Headteacher Edward Marr sent parents a letter, saying: "Police officers attended school at 8am on Friday morning. They had a photograph from the internet and asked if I could identify a person on it."It emerged that a threat had been made against the school which had been picked up by the FBI in America and passed eventually, as the school was identified, to Merseyside police.Chief Supt Chris Armitt, of Merseyside police, defended a decision not to close the school immediately.He told BBC Radio Merseyside: "We received some information between 1am and 2am. That information was imprecise and we had to clarify what the information meant and what it related to."The St Helens Star said web users had also alerted police after internet chatroom discussions about apparent threats. It reported there had been an internet image showing a gun-toting man with a hand-written message reading: "Tomorrow last day of school. We gonna fuck up the bullies and leave this world 11/06/2010."Another message said: "Tested it at firing range, we have two shotguns as well, it's locked in but tomorrow I have a key. St Aelred's Catholic Technology College, England, watch BBC."
