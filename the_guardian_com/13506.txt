 Robert Kean , 54, is a builder from Norwich with a string of convictions dating back to 1964. He was hunting a money launderer who, he claimed, owed him more than £600,000. He turned to Morgan for help, describing him as a friend who had "really, really helped me". Carl Wood , 45, from Waltham Cross, Herts, is an associate of Kean's who has also served time in jail. Wood claimed the money launderer owed him £80,000. Wood was recorded as saying that the launderer, Andrew Smith (not his real name) "would not be going home".  Martin Morgan , 39, a detective constable with the crime squad at Barkingside police station, east London, used the police national computer to check a car owned by Smith, found a hotel where Smith was said to be staying, and gave Kean a pair of plastic handcuffs to restrain him.  Declan Costello , 36, also a detective constable working in the crime squad at Barkingside, joined Morgan at the hotel, watching the carpark and the hotel foyer. He admitted to police he had been "a complete fool" to get involved.
