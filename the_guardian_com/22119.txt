A white supremacist was today convicted of planning a terrorist bombing campaign amid warnings against potential attacks by far-right extremists.Neil Lewington, 44, turned his bedroom at his parents' house in Reading into a bomb factory, having been inspired by propaganda from far-right groups.He was on the verge of starting his terrorist campaign and was caught only by chance as he travelled to meet a woman on a date, while carrying two improvised bombs in a holdall.His conviction comes as police strengthen teams countering extremist violence after intelligence assessments told officers the chances of a rightwing attack are increasing.Lewington was found guilty by an Old Bailey jury of seven out of eight charges brought under the Terrorism Act and explosives laws. The judge warned him that he faced a lengthy jail sentence. He was remanded in custody and will return to court on 8 September.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said: "This man, who had strong if not fanatical rightwing leanings and opinions, was on the cusp of embarking on a campaign of terrorism against those he considered non-British."The defendant had in his possession the component parts of two viable improvised incendiary devices."A fortnight ago a senior police officer warned of an increased threat of terrorist attacks from the extreme right.Commander Shaun Sawyer of Scotland Yard's counterterrorism command said: "I fear that they ... will carry out an attack that will lead to a loss of life or injury to a community somewhere. They're not choosy about which community."He said the aim would be to cause a "breakdown in community cohesion".Lewington, an unemployed electrician, was arrested in October last year at Lowerstoft train station, where he had travelled for a date with a woman he met online.During the journey he drank alcohol and became abusive. At the train station he urinated on the platform, leading police to arrest him. There were two homemade bombs in his holdall, which experts judged to be viable.A police raid of his parents' home uncovered 35 boosters, 15 improvised igniters, weed killer and three tennis balls.He also kept racist propaganda and videos of neo-Nazi terrorists including the London nail bomber David Copeland.In 1999, David Copeland struck three targets in London. His attack on a gay pub in Soho killed three people and left scores injured. It followed attacks against Brick Lane, east London, and the bombing of a market in Brixton, south London.The search also found the Waffen SS UK members' handbook, containing his blueprint for a neo-Nazi terror group, and notebooks with details of electronics and chemical mixtures and a book called Counter Bomb. His mobile phone contained hate material from a violent neo-Nazi group called Combat 18 and other material from the Ku Klux Klan was also found.Women Lewington had met on the internet said he had talked openly of his hatred of black and Asian Britons, even fantasising about attacking them with tennis balls filled with explosives. He had also bragged of carrying out racist attacks.Deputy assistant commissioner John McDowall, head of the Metropolitan Police counterterrorism command, said: "Lewington clearly set out to make viable devices which could have seriously injured or possibly killed members of the public going about their daily lives."Whilst our inquiries did not uncover any details about intended targets, we do not underestimate the impact that Lewington's actions and extremist beliefs may have had on communities nationwide."Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, has ordered the counter-terrorism command, SO15, to examine what the economic downturn would mean for far-right violence. The assessment concluded that the recession would increase the possibility of it.Sawyer said that more of his officers needed to be deployed to tackle neo-Nazi-inspired violence. He said the threat posed by al-Qaida remained the unit's priority, but said of its far-right section: "It is a small desk ... we need to grow that unit.""There is an increased possibility of violence from the far right. There is a trend," said one senior source, adding that the ideology of the violent right was driven by "people who don't like immigration, people who don't like Islam. We're seeing a resurgence of anti-semitism as well."Mark Gardner, of the Community Security Trust, which monitors violence against Jews, said there has been a surge in right-wing incidents. The CST says nine white men have been "convicted of offences involving explosives, terrorist plots, violent campaigns or threats to carry them out".Gardner said: "Ten years after the Nazi nail bombings in London, we are seeing increasing numbers of neo-Nazis being arrested in their attempts to start some kind of so-called race war."Last year neo-Nazi Martyn Gilleard was convicted of three terrorism offences and jailed for 16 years.Officers found machetes, swords, bullets, gunpowder, racist literature and four homemade nail bombs stashed under his bed at his home in Goole, east Yorkshire.Officers in West Yorkshire recently foiled an international plot to put guns and explosives in the hands of violent bigots in Britain.At least 32 people were quizzed and 22 addresses searched across the north of England in April and May.
