Vincent Tabak, the man accused of murdering the landscape architect Joanna Yeates, was today remanded in custody by a judge at Bristol crown court.Thirty-two-year-old Tabak's barrister, Paul Cook, made no application for bail.Ann Reddrop, for the crown, asked for the Dutch national to be held in custody.The judge, Mr Justice Treacy, remanded Tabak, an architectural engineer who lived in a flat next to Yeates's, in custody until Monday, when he will appear again for a preliminary hearing.Apparently wearing the same red sweater and dark trousers as yesterday's hearing, bespectacled Tabak arrived in the dock of court one at the crown court clutching a brown file.The judge established that Tabak, who works at an international design company in Bath, did not need an interpreter.Cook then said he would not be making a bail application on behalf of Tabak.Responding to a request by reporters to use Twitter in the court, Cook said the case had created a "considerable amount of media interest" and flagged up concerns that the "detail" of some of the reporting could have an impact on the prospect of Tabak receiving a fair trial.Tabak spoke only to confirm his identity and, at the end of the hearing, to confirm to the judge that he understood what had happened.He is accused of murdering 25-year-old Yeates between 16 December and 26Â December last year.Yeates vanished after drinks with friends in Bristol on Friday 17 December and her body was found on Christmas morning at Failand, three miles from the home she shared in Clifton with her boyfriend, Greg Reardon.Yeates's parents, David and Teresa, did not attend today's hearing. They have said they are focusing on their daughter's funeral.
