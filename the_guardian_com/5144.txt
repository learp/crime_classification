Conservatives on the Greater London assembly have revealed that there are 12,000 more police on patrol in New York than London - despite the two cities having almost identical populations and London enjoying a larger police budget.The disclosure comes at an embarrassing time for the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, and the GLA, as the former New York mayor, Rudolph Guiliani, is in town this week.Mr Guiliani is to meet both Mr Livingstone and the home secretary, David Blunkett, to lecture them on his "zero tolerance" policing policy in New York.But according to Richard Barnes, the Conservative deputy chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, New Yorkers get around 12,000 more officers for their money than their London counterparts.His figures show that there are 39,000 New York Police Department officers, backed up by around 9,000 civilians, while London has just 27,672 uniformed officers, with 10,494 civilian support staff.That's despite the Met's budget being almost £30m more than the NYPD's, at £1.98bn.London's population is 7,375,100, against New York's 7,333,253.Mr Barnes, who is also the Tory's crime spokesman on the GLA, said: "Londoners will quite rightly be appalled by these figures. "New York, with a smaller police budget, manages to put over 12,000 more police on its streets. London, with crime soaring, is used to seeing officer strength slashed by a government who simply doesn't care and a police service that excels in financial mismanagement."Enough is enough. Londoners want to hear less excuses and see more police on our streets."Mr Livingstone is scheduled to have lunch with Mr Guiliani on Thursday, while he is in London to receive an honour from the Queen. Mr Guiliani, who became a hero in the US for his handling of the post-September 11 crisis, will attempt to boost US-UK tourism, which has slumped following the terrorist attacks.But the figures uncovered by Mr Barnes have been disputed by the Metropolitan Police Authority, the body set up to monitor the capital's police.An MPA spokeswoman said: "I don't dispute the numbers, but what you have to take into consideration is that the 19% of the Met budget is taken up by police pensions, which are administered separately in New York."Also, the Met has to take on international security, such as anti-terrorism measures, which in the US is dealt with by the FBI, the CIA or the National Guard."
