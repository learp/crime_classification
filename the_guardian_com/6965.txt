Police investigating the deaths of two people in Ipswich have arrested a schoolgirl on suspicion of murder.The 15-year-old girl was being questioned by detectives today. Because of her age, police officers have to interview her in the presence of a parent, guardian or social worker.The girl was arrested at 8am this morning. Also arrested on suspicion of murder was a 41-year-old man reported to be the teenager's boyfriend. He had been arrested at 5am over a separate allegation and was later rearrested.The deaths being investigated are those of a woman, Rose Hunt, whose body was found at 11am on Sunday at a flat in Victoria Street.A second body of a man believed to be in his forties was found at 4am early in Limerick Close. Both bodies were found by police after calls from members of the public.Police are awaiting the results of postmortem examinations on both bodies.Sources added that police believed "there was an association" between the two people arrested on suspicion of murder and the two found dead.Paul Devereux, 45, who lives near to Limerick Close said he had heard shouting coming from the direction of the flat on Sunday evening.He said that, at 3.45am, he was woken by more shouting and heard a female voice shouting a man's name and then telling him "come on".Devereux says a CCTV camera fixed to the wall of his flat captured the grainy images of two people and a dog walking away from the flat.Another neighbour described the person who lived in the flat as "vulnerable".
