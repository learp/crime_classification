Police investigating the discovery of a burning body of a woman found in woods near Pulborough, West Sussex, said last night it was that of the missing schoolteacher Jane Longhurst.A Sussex police spokesman said dental records were used to identify the body found on a nature reserve at 8.30pm on Saturday evening as the missing woman.A post mortem revealed that Miss Longhurst, who disappeared on March 14 from her home in Brighton, had been strangled and had been dead for some time.The body was discovered after a motorist driving across Wiggonholt Common, near Pulborough, spotted smoke in a wooded area and called the fire brigade.At first firefighters believed they were tackling a rubbish fire but when they doused the flames, they were shocked to discover a body. It was so charred that initially it was not possible to identify the victim's sex or to know if the body was clothed when it was set ablaze.Forensic scientists took a sample of DNA from the remains to compare it with that of Ms Longhurst, 31, a special needs teacher and talented musician who disappeared after telling a friend she was going out to buy some paint to redecorate her flat.Detective Chief Inspector Tony O'Donnell of Sussex police, who is leading the inquiry, codenamed Operation Mystic, had notified Ms Longhurst's family of the discovery of the body, and said he believed the killer was burning the body in an attempt to destroy evidence.A police spokesman said last night: "It is believed she was killed by a depression to the neck or strangulation. Wiggonholt Common was a deposition site for Jane's body and was not where she was killed. Jane had been dead for a long period of time."Mr O'Donnell said: "I would ask anyone who was on the common, whether that be walking a dog, driving through the area or any other reason, to get in touch with us as soon as possible."I would like to hear from anyone who may have seen anybody or anything that they thought was suspicious. In particular I would like to hear from anyone who saw any vehicle or person that they thought was suspiciously parked in the lanes around Wiggonholt Common."Ms Longhurst's disappearance on March 14 was described by police and family as "totally out of character". She vanished after sending a text message to a friend saying she was off to buy some paint.Police have made extensive searches across Sussex but found no clues.Her mother Liz, sister Sue and partner Malcolm Sentance have made several television appeals for help, and a reward of Â£5,000 was offered for information about her.Her body was found around 30 miles from her home.
