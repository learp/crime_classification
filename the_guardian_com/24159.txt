The family of Roger Sylvester, a black man who died in custody six years ago, has condemned yesterday's decision to reinstate seven Metropolitan police officers.Scotland Yard deputy commissioner Sir Ian Blair announced the move after a judicial review last week quashed an inquest verdict. Mr Sylvester, a manic depressive with drug problems, was restrained at his north London home in 1999, and taken to a psychiatric hospital. He died seven days later. The officers were suspended after a jury returned an unanimous verdict of unlawful killing last October. But on Friday, Mr Justice Collins said he intended to overturn this verdict, suggesting the coroner's summing up was inadequate and the jury's reasoning inconsistent. The Independent Police Complaints Commission advised postponing a decision until the judge published his full judgment. But Sir Ian said seven officers would be reinstated immediately "in the interests of the officers and the people of London".
