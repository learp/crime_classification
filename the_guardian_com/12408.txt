An inquiry has been ordered into claims that Brian Paddick, the police commander under investigation for allegedly smoking cannabis, is the victim of a smear campaign by senior colleagues.The Metropolitan police authority has set up the inquiry following a complaint that another commander wrongly claimed Mr Paddick had misused a CID car. Mr Paddick was removed from his duties in the Met's Lambeth division after a former lover accused him of breaking the law. The new inquiry is expected to look at a complaint by Mr Paddick that a fellow police commander repeated a false allegation against him. Last year Scotland Yard exonerated Mr Paddick of an accusation that he had taken a car belonging to the CID and used it to commute to a police college in Hampshire. In fact, he had been given a hire car. Despite being cleared, he became aware that the allegation was being repeated. A friend said: "Brian's view is that he didn't do this and he's not going to sit around and let someone repeat it." It is thought that Mr Paddick, the country's most senior openly gay officer, has been investigated more often than any other senior officer in the Met - mostly following anonymous calls to Crimestoppers - but he has been cleared every time. A spokesman for the police authority confirmed that the complaint involved officers of "Acpo rank" - of the rank of commander and above. "We had a complaint referred to us. The MPA professional standards and performance monitoring committee has appointed a sub-group which has been tasked with considering the matter."
