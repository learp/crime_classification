Police are asking anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident and may have seen something to get in touch.Kym Marshall, who lives in a nearby flat, told the Leicester Mercury that she had been woken up by a "massive bang and a shudder"."It was very scary," said Marshall, 19. "There was debris everywhere, and the building was on fire."There were people running towards the building and others were shouting, 'Get back, there's been an explosion'."Another local resident described the blast as "like an earthquake".Warren Bernstein told the paper: "There was a popping noise coming from it and we weren't sure if it was going to go up again."People were screaming because they thought there might have been people in there. It must have been a powerful explosion because the metal security shutter was thrown across the road."Anyone with any information is asked to contact Leicestershire constabulary on (0116) 222 2222 and quote incident 103 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
