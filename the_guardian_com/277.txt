An 82-year-old puppy farmer has been arrested on suspicion of shooting dead a woman, her daughter and four dogs at his dog breeding farm, police said on Monday.John Lowe, the owner of Keepers Cottage Stud in Farnham, Surrey, is being questioned over the suspected double murder on a leafy suburban street dubbed "Millionaires' Row".Police discovered the bodies of two women, three German shepherd dogs and a labrador after neighbours reported hearing shots at the address on Sunday morning.The identities of the victims – a woman in her 60s and her daughter in her 40s – have not been confirmed but they are believed to have known Lowe, who remained in police custody late Monday.DCI Mark Preston, from Surrey police, said: "It is extremely sad that two people have lost their lives and police family liaison officers are working to support their relatives and friends at this very difficult time."We are conducting a full and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding these two deaths. However, at this time, we believe this is an isolated incident and there is no further risk to the wider community."Officers remain at the scene conducting inquiries and will be on site for some time. This investigation is in its early stages and we will issue updates when we have them."A country lane leading to the dog breeding farm remained sealed off on Monday as detectives continued their investigation.Armed officers arrived at the property within 20 minutes of neighbours raising the alarm and tried unsuccesfully to rescuscitate the women, who were discovered along with a long-barrelled firearm in separate parts of farm.The body of the elder woman was discovered inside the property while her daughter was found outside near animal pens at the back of the house, which is surrounded by dense woodland.The three German shepherd dogs and labrador are believed to have been Lowe's guard dogs. The RSPCA rescued a fifth dog, an old English sheepdog, and a number of other animals found at the property.Lowe is understood to have run Keepers Cottage Stud for at least 10 years, keeping up to 50 dogs in the farm's 20 kennels as recently as last year.However, he is thought to have cut back his involvement in dog breeding in the past year as he coped with the death of his partner and struggled with a knee operation.It is understood that Lowe was convicted several years ago of illegal puppy farming and that last year Surrey police officers searched the property but said there was no evidence of ongoing illegal dog breeding.Detectives confirmed they had previous contact with the suspect and said the matter had been passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).A spokesman for the IPCC said it was considering whether to investigate the matter.An RSPCA spokeswoman said: "We are aware of the situation and working with police to ensure the welfare of the animals involved. We can confirm there are a number of animals at the property and will update people on the situation as soon as we can."Postmortem examinations of the two women were due to take place later on Monday.
