The court of appeal yesterday added two years to the minimum sentence of a babysitter who raped a 12-week-old girl he was looking after.Alan Webster, 40, of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was jailed for life at St Albans crown court in January after admitting rape, indecent assault, permitting indecent images to be taken of a child, and making indecent images.The judge then set a minimum term of six years, but the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, went to the appeal court to argue that the sentence was too short for a man whose crimes had "shocked and outraged public opinion."Yesterday a panel of five senior judges, headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Phillips, ruled that Webster should serve at least eight years. They said he had used the baby as a "sex toy." Lord Phillips said that Webster's life sentence meant he would remain in prison "unless and until the parole board is satisfied that he no longer poses a danger to the public." He added: "The evidence in this case shows that he is so deeply steeped in sexual depravity that it is questionable whether that day will ever be reached."Lord Goldsmith had also asked the court to extend the minimum five-year term given to Webster's girlfriend Tanya French, 20, also from Hatfield, who had admitted the same charges. But the judges, who noted that French had been corrupted by Webster, ruled that her sentence should not be increased. At an earlier hearing, Webster also pleaded guilty to a separate charge of indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl.Lord Goldsmith had asked the appeal court to review sentences imposed for "offences of the gravest depravity against an innocent defenceless baby and another young girl," adding that the cases of Webster and French were "exceptional in the nature of what took place and their depravity. You may think that, having seen the photographs, that what took place was almost beyond comprehension. The acts of those two offenders will have done incalculable damage to the baby and her mother."Lord Phillips said the pair had carried out a course of conduct "of horrifying depravity" in which they "used a baby girl, entrusted to the care of French as a babysitter, as a sex toy."Lord Phillips added: "There is an obvious possibility that, when she grows up, the baby will discover from someone what was done to her in the early months of her life and that this may cause her psychiatric harm ... We have well in mind the effect on the mother of learning of the offences."
