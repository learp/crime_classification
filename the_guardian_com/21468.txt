Michael had been living in west London for three months when he decided to get away for a night to a hotel. What was he doing? Visiting a friend? "Sort of, yes, you could say that," he laughs. The next day he returned home. In the days that followed, Michael got a letter from the Home Office, warning him that his behaviour had been inappropriate. Within a month he had been put in prison, without having committed a crime or appeared before a court. That was in 1995, and he is still in prison. For spending a night in a hotel. This is a somewhat selective telling of the story. Michael has what he admits is "a serious criminal past". In 1982 he was given a life sentence for crimes involving firearms and attempted murder. He served 13 years and was released because he was judged to be rehabilitated; he had been out only a few months when he was hauled back inside, indefinitely. Michael is no hero. Some would argue that he deserves everything he has got. He might even agree with them. But if he has his latest appeal for parole turned down by the Home Office, as he fully expects, he says he will give up trying to get another chance at freedom. He wonders if he will spend the equivalent of another life sentence inside. The prison service has a clearly defined protocol for managing "lifers" - those serving life sentences for murder, manslaughter, rape or a group of other violent offences. In theory at least, it is logical and humane. Inmates move on to more open conditions only after completing a number of courses designed to help them address their offending behaviour and acknowledge their guilt. Those who cannot or will not come to terms with their crime should not be released. Those who do, after they have completed the minimum tariff decreed by their sentencing judge, will be allowed to live in the community, under the supervision of a probation officer. But even when they have been released, lifers are never really free. If you are sent to prison for a set period, once your licence has expired you are free to go, no questions asked. But lifers remain under close supervision for the rest of their lives. At present there are 900 lifers in the community "under licence". They will remain liable for immediate recall to prison until the day they die. The principle behind "recall" may be sound, but the grounds on which lifers can be summarily recalled to custody fall far short of what would be expected at a criminal trial in open court. If you are a lifer, getting drunk might be enough to get you jailed. Michael knows of someone who had a pee on the London underground and was recalled. If we are going to imprison people on a preventive basis, argues Hamish Arnott, a solicitor at the Prisoners' Advice Service, it must at the very least be based on a forensic assessment of risk. Those serving a mandatory life sentence do not even have the right to an oral hearing when they are recalled; the decision is taken in private based on paperwork that, says Mr Arnott, "can be on the basis of very vague allegations, supported by documents that are multiple hearsay". There is no right of appeal. Harry Crook, a probation officer of 30 years' standing in Essex, who deals with many more lifers than most of his colleagues, confesses to disquiet about some of the cases on which he has worked. On one occasion, he says, he was encouraged to recall a lifer who had let his daughter drive his car, believing (wrongly) that she was covered by his insurance. "I felt that was being over cautious, even by my standards, of public safety. But I'm powerless because I can't stand up to the parole board and say that." On that occasion he won the argument. On a bigger scale, he says, his influence is slight. The introduction last year of "national standards" for recall removed much of the remaining room for probation officers' own discretion. A lifer who misses two appointments with his probation worker in a year will automatically be recalled. There is nothing that the probation officer can do to intervene. The job is set to get very much harder for the probation service. The current set-up for managing lifers was designed to deal with less than 1,000 inmates. There are now 4,500 lifers in British prisons, almost 20% more than there were in 1998 and more than in the whole of western Europe put together, according to Prison Reform Trust research. By 2007, according to the chief inspectorate of prisons, there will be more than 6,000 lifers in the UK, all of whom will need to be supervised until the day they die. Billy was recalled four years ago. He was given a life sentence at the age of 21 for manslaughter, and released in 1994. After years coming to terms with what he did, Billy speaks the language of a therapy junkie - he is warm, self-deprecating, disconcertingly self-aware. He blames no one for his circumstances but himself. In the three years that he was out, Billy succeeded in building a new life for himself. He made a point of telling people who he was, because he felt it was important to take responsibility for his past. "I might be standing in a pub having a pint and someone might have said, 'Hello, I haven't seen you before,' and I'd say, 'No, I'm actually on home leave from a life sentence.' It's not much of an opening sentence: 'Hi, I'm a murderer, would you like to come back to my place?' " But Billy made it work. He got a good job, at which he worked hard, and had a couple of successful relationships. Then he made what he describes as a "silly mistake", putting himself in a situation that, he says, was open to misinterpretation because of his history. He was accused of assault and brought to court. A jury took eight minutes to find him not guilty. But he was recalled anyway. Of course, Billy may not be telling the truth. But the fact remains that he would probably be out by now if he had admitted the assault. Instead, he is ruled to be "in denial" and so is ineligible for parole. "I'm going to fight this because I have absolutely nothing to lose. The thing is, nobody has a problem with recall if you are given sufficient evidence for why you have been recalled. What we are complaining about is a system that can accept only the reasons they come up with for the recall." If his latest review fails in June, Billy plans to challenge the terms of his recall under the Human Rights Act. He will argue that he is unlawfully imprisoned, that he presents no risk to the public, that denying him parole on the basis of a crime for which he has been found not guilty is a gross breach of his human rights. It is possible that this could present a real challenge to the current system. Billy insists he does not feel bitter about the recall. "When you have taken somebody's life, people are likely to think you are a risk to the public. I'm trying to look at it from the point of view of Joe Bloggs in the street." But he does not believe he deserves to die in jail. "Those years that I was out, I was doing really well, everyone was very happy for me, I had succeeded in doing everything that I wanted to do. That life I wanted, it was all a hair's breadth away." Â• Some names have been changed.
