The funeral of the murdered landscape architect Joanna Yeates will take place later at a church in her home village.More than 100 relatives and friends are expected to attend the service at St Mark's in Ampfield, Hampshire, which is known as the church in the woods.Yeates's parents, David and Teresa, have said it is bound to be the worst day of their lives but have also insisted they are more fortunate than families whose relatives disappear and can never be given a funeral.Ahead of the funeral they released a new photograph of 25-year-old Yeates, whose body was found on Christmas morning, eight days after she vanished following drinks with friends in Bristol.The photograph was taken in June 2010 and shows Yeates looking at a piece of work she produced for her postgraduate diploma show at the University of Gloucestershire.A tribute from her course tutor, David Booth, postgraduate programme director, landscape and environment, was also issued.Booth said Yeates "made a strong and lasting impression on staff and students".He added: "Jo was one of those students who you can tell would be destined for great things and it almost goes without saying that she graduated at the end of her studies in July 2010 with a distinction."Her death is a huge loss to all, she was very well liked and admired by her peers, she was a very gifted student and a high achiever in all she did. Many of our students have contacted us to say how much of an inspiration she was and that their thoughts are with her family."The university will remember Yeates through an annual landscape design prize sponsored by BDP, the firm she worked for in Bristol.Dutch national Vincent Tabak, 32, has been charged with her murder.
