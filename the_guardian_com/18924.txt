A woman accused of stabbing a grandmother to death with a butcher's knife was unable to attend court because of "extreme" mental health problems.Nicola Edgington is charged with killing Sally Hodkin, 59, in a busy shopping street in Bexleyheath, south-east London, on Monday.Edgington, of Greenwich, is also charged with the attempted murder of 23-year-old Kerry Clark, who was attacked with a knife as she waited at a bus stop.On Tuesday, a psychiatrist said 31-year-old Edgington was unfit to be taken into the courtroom to face charges.Dr Amit Chatterjee told Greenwich magistrates court: "I had the opportunity to meet her this morning. She does have extreme mental health problems. I don't think she is fit to attend court in her mental state."A Serco security guard summoned to describe Edgington's condition said the woman was "agitated". Lisa Moriarty told the court: "At the moment she is in a cell with three officers, but I am a bit reluctant to bring her up with everyone around."She seems to be very agitated with people in the cells, she's getting very agitated and uppity."Hodkin is understood to have been on her way to work at the Cunningham Blake law firm, where she was an accounts manager, when she was apparently stabbed in the neck. She is believed to have lived locally.Edgington was represented in court by her solicitor, Callum Haddow, who was told the case would be heard next at the Old Bailey on Thursday, when a bail application is due to take place.A plea and case management hearing was scheduled for 17 January.
