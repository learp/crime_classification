Illiterate prisoners would be denied early release under plans announced by the Liberal Democrats today.The proposal, which would mean that only inmates able to properly fill in job application forms would be considered for early release, is aimed at improving basic reading and writing skills.The Liberal Democrats want to introduce an element of compulsory skills training into prison education because around 70% of inmates leave jail without basic skills. "If someone was showing zero interest or was really half-hearted we would put the release date back," said a party spokesman.He said that prison education would be deemed a failure if inmates could not even fill out job applications on release. "If they have not even got the skills to fill out a form there is not much hope for them," added the spokesman. But prisoners with learning disabilities would be exempt from the scheme, he said. The idea behind the proposal is to increase the opportunities for prisoners to gain employment, thereby reducing the number of re-offenders. The scheme is part of a 10-point plan to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, also wants more, better-equipped police and neighbourhood wardens, and local hotlines to report noise, graffiti and vandalism with a quick response from officers. Other proposals include letting local people nominate projects for offenders given community sentences; sending "out-of-control" council tenants on treatment courses rather than the current "evict and forget" approach; and making pubs and clubs pay towards the policing of binge drinking hotspots. Mr Oaten said the plans disproved government accusations that the Liberal Democrats were soft on crime. He said: "While Labour concentrates on looking tough on crime, the Liberal Democrats concentrate on being effective on crime. Unlike Labour we are proposing constructive, realistic and workable solutions to anti-social behaviour."
