A couple have been jailed for neglecting five of their children. Nine children lived in bedrooms that smelled of urine and animal faeces, and mattresses were soiled, Gloucester crown court heard.Police photographs of the family home showed the squalor and filth in which the children lived. The mother was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison, and the father was given two years.The couple, who cannot be named, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to neglecting five children between 2007 and 2012.The ages of the children ranged from a baby to a young teenager. Charges relating to the other four children will lie on file.DI Katy Miles, of Gloucestershire police, said: "It's hard to imagine how any parent could just sit back and let their children live in such squalor but that's what happened. When they were challenged they were obstructive and didn't understand what they had done wrong. Now they must live with the consequences."There are no winners, but I'm pleased to say that since the children have moved into a caring and loving environment they have shown encouraging signs of improvement and their future is bright again."
