A former chauffeur and flatmate of the disgraced entertainer Jimmy Savile has been arrested over allegations of sexual abuse.Ray Teret, who later went on to work on radio stations in northern England, was arrested by detectives from Greater Manchester police on Tuesday.The force said two men, aged 71 and 61, had been arrested at an address in Altrincham. Both were being held on suspicion of rape.Police stressed the arrests were not part of the investigation into Savile and allegations of his prolific sexual abuse, which is being led by the Metropolitan police. Teret's arrest was over historic allegations reported to police late last month, when there was prominent media coverage of the scandal surrounding Savile.Detective Inspector Simon Davies, of GMP's serious sexual offences unit, said in a statement: "The arrest follows an investigation by the serious sexual offences unit into three separate allegations of historic sexual abuse which have been reported to Greater Manchester police since 28 October 2012."A 61-year-old man was also arrested at the same address on suspicion of rape in connection with one of the complaints."I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not an investigation into the late Jimmy Savile, nor do any of the allegations relate to any involvement by Savile."The victims who have come forward have shown tremendous courage and our primary focus is to support these victims during what is clearly a very traumatic time for them. We have a duty to investigate their complaints thoroughly."
