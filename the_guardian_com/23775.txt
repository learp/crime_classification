A serial book thief who used a Cambridge degree and a tweed jacket as a "shabby cloak of respectability" to mask his deeds was jailed for three-and-a-half years today for stealing books worth £40,000 from the Royal Horticultural Society's library. There was, as the prosecution pointed out, little sophistication in the strategy employed by William Jacques, who had already been given a four-year sentence for plundering £1m-worth of rare books in the late 1990s.Armed with his scholarly jacket and a pair of glasses, the man dubbed "tome raider" began frequenting the RHS's Lindley library in Vincent Square, central London, and signing in under the false name of Santoro. But his regular visits and limited wardrobe soon caught the eye of staff, who grew suspicious.On one occasion, Southwark crown court heard, the defendant "was seen to place something inside his jacket and walk away with his left arm stiff against his jacket as if holding something"."It was rather crude," noted Gino Connor, prosecuting. "But it was effective."He also told the jury that Jacques always signed in at the library, when he had both arms free. But he never signed out.Over the course of nearly three years, from June 2004 to March 2007, 13 rare volumes of the Nouvelle Iconographie des Camellias by Ambroise Verschaffelt disappeared from the library, which holds books, journals and art on gardening, garden history, plants and design dating back to 1514.On 2 April 2007, however, the police were called and the book thief's luck ran out. When challenged by staff and officers, Jacques replied: "I do not know nothing [sic] about this," adding: "Do you have any evidence?"Unfortunately for Jacques, they did: not only did they find a piece of paper bearing the names of 70 volumes of rare books, all kept at the library, along with their precise locations, there were also notes on the books' valuations and whether they included maps and plates that could be removed and sold separately.They then came across a card for London's Senate House library, also in the name of Santoro."This tends to suggest that there was a great deal of pre-planning," said Connor.Jacques' crime, he said, was a "systematic, carefully planned theft committed by a man who knew precisely what he was doing". He also endeavoured to impress the scale of the theft on the jury of seven women and five men: "We are not dealing with Penguin books. We are dealing with very valuable books."After deliberating for five hours and 40 minutes, the jury found Jacques, who is 41 and of no fixed address, guilty of theft relating to the 13 volumes missing from the library. They also unanimously found him guilty of going equipped with the Senate House card to commit theft.Because he has never revealed his true address, investigators believe he may have stashed the rare books he stole in a secret location.In mitigation, Julia Smart agreed that Jacques had no remorse, but said he had lost his livelihood and reputation following his conviction in 2002. He was in effect an odd-job man who relied on the charity of friends to survive, she said.However, the judge told Jacques there was no excuse for his actions. "You are a Cambridge graduate and should know better, I suppose," said Recorder Michael Holland QC. "This was a systematic and carefully planned theft and you had prepared what, in my view, was a target list, from your research at that library, of books that were worth stealing."This was a theft in progress and the list referred to books worth tens of thousands of pounds more."Jacques' entire motivation, he added, had been perniciously commercial. "The effect of your criminality was to undermine and destroy parts of the cultural heritage that's contained within these libraries and make it more difficult for those who have a legitimate interest in these books to gain access to them, because libraries have to take inconvenient and expensive steps to stop thefts of this kind."The thief, who failed to pay the £56,327 demanded when he was last before the courts, faces confiscation proceedings next January. With interest, the amount outstanding now totals £93,000.Before Jacques's conviction in 2002, his former tutor at Jesus College, Cambridge, remarked: "What he did was equivalent to daubing paint on the Parthenon."Works stolen by Jacques include:• A copy of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius, published in 1610, worth £180,000 • Johannes Kepler's Astronomia Nova published in 1609, worth £75,000• Two copies of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica published in 1687, worth £135,000• 13 volumes of the 19th-century botanical study Nouvelle Iconographies des Camellias by Ambroise ­Verschaffelt, worth £40,000.
