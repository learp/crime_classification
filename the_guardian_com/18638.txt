A woman who exploited vulnerable immigrants to work door to door collecting for a children's charity has been jailed for three years.Jurate Grigelyte, 53, trafficked Lithuanian nationals to the UK with the promise of good employment and accommodation, but the workers, many of whom spoke little or no English, were forced to live in cramped and squalid conditions and often went hungry.They worked illegally for Grigelyte's charity bag business collecting donations from people in the south-west of England for the Dreams Comes True charity, for a salary of as little as £25 a day.Rupert Lowe, prosecuting, told Bristol crown court: "Grigelyte made a profitable business out of coaxing vulnerable Lithuanian adults over to the UK with an offer of work in the charity bag business."Lowe said the 11 victims – two women and nine men – felt "totally dependent" on Grigelyte for accommodation, work and food. "They had no idea how to interact with the UK authorities and this put them in a position where she could exploit them quite ruthlessly," he said.The court heard that Grigelyte charged them £50 a week in rent for a shared room in a house she also lived in, and the Lithuanians worked six or seven days a week. She would also not give them keys to their accommodation and often locked them in. Some were alcoholics and were fined if Grigelyte caught them drinking."The defendant took it upon herself to impose what she called fines on the exploited workers of a further £50 – two full days' earnings – if for any reason they did not work on a particular day," Lowe said. "Many of them were reduced to attending soup kitchens for meals."Grigelyte, of Easton, Bristol, admitted 10 charges of facilitating entry into the UK with a view to exploiting labour, 10 charges of trafficking around the UK and one count of forced labour.Lowe said the charity bag business was a lucrative one, working on behalf of charities collecting donations of old clothing."Very large numbers of charity bags are posted through the doors of householders all over the country with a view a collecting a certain proportion of filled bags some days later," Lowe said. "Householders tend to believe that donations of old clothes and other items are going entirely to charity. In fact the businesses which undertake the distribution and collection bags are commercial companies operating for profit."Nicholas Clough, defending, said Grigelyte had herself been trafficked into the UK from Lithuania to work collecting charity bags for £30 a day in Cambridgeshire before moving to Bristol.Jailing her, the judge Martin Picton told her: "The evidence reveals a depressing picture of vulnerable people coming from Lithuania in the hope of a better life and getting nothing like. Once here, they were trapped, certainly economically trapped. They weren't prisoners, as sometimes features in cases of this kind, but they were certainly isolated in our society and working and living in a way that civilised people should not be required to do."Peter Newman, chief executive of the Dreams Come True charity, said: "We are appalled by the crimes for which Ms Grigelyte has been convicted, which we were made aware of a few weeks ago. Ms Grigelyte was for a time a subcontractor of our contractor, Byronswell Ltd, to whom we outsource our bag collections."We have demanded an immediate check on all Byronswell Ltd's other subcontractors to ensure that there is no possibility of anything like this happening anywhere else either now or in the future. Dreams Come True's whole purpose is to fulfil the dreams of terminally and seriously ill children. The illegal misuse of our bags, and worse the appalling mistreatment of the unfortunate victims, are dreadful acts and we are pleased that the police have secured a conviction."
