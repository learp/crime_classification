Despite several assassination attempts on police officers in Northern Ireland over the past year, last night's killing in Craigavon was the first such death at the hands of republican terrorists for 12 years.The last police to be murdered by republican paramilitaries in Northern Ireland were the RUC community constables Roland Graham and David Johnston.The pair had been on foot patrol in Lurgan in June 1997 when IRA gunmen ran up to them and shot them in the backs of their heads.In 1998, though, a loyalist bomb killed an RUC Constable, Frank O'Reilly, during disturbances linked to a ban on loyalist Orange Order parades through nationalist areas.During the course of the Troubles in Northern Ireland more than 300 police were killed.Despite the long lull, targeted attacks have been slowly resuming. Over the last nine months there have been 18 attempts on police officers. There have been three this year alone, including one on an officer dropping his children at school and a failed car bomb in Castlewellan on 27 January.The officer murdered last night became the first member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) killed by terrorists since the force took over from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in 2001.The RUC was renamed on 4 November 2001 following a policing review carried out by the Patten commission, headed by the former Conservative minister Chris Patten, which had been set up under the Belfast agreement.The commission's 175 recommendations, aimed at "depoliticising" the force of 7,500 police, included a new badge, oath of allegiance, uniform and a positive recruitment policy towards Catholics."The Police Service of Northern Ireland Incorporating the Royal Ulster Constabulary", to give it its full name, eventually won the support of all the major political parties in Northern Ireland, although Sinn Féin only announced its complete acceptance of the PSNI in January 2007 as part of the St Andrew's agreement.Soon after that, Sinn Féin took its place alongside the other major parties in the province on the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which oversees the force.
