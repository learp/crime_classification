Forensic experts have begun reopening a grave in North Lanarkshire in an attempt to solve the mystery of the disappearance of a schoolgirl more than 50 years ago.Detectives believe that the body of Moira Anderson, 11, who vanished on a shopping trip during a severe snowstorm in 1957, could have been secretly buried in Old Monkland cemetery in Coatbridge by her suspected murderer.Her disappearance has been blamed on Alexander Gartshore, a bus driver and convicted child rapist, who hinted strongly to his daughter Sandra Brown before his death in 2006 that he was guilty of her abduction and murder.The exhumation is being overseen by Professor Sue Black, one of the UK's leading forensic anthropologists and head of the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification at Dundee University.Black has played a central role in investigating mass graves in Kosovo and Iraq and the murders by Fred and Rosemary West.Anderson's disappearance, after she boarded a bus to a nearby branch of the Co-op, is one of Scotland's most notorious unsolved murder cases. Over the years other alleged suspects have been named, but the mystery remains.Brown, who has written a book about the case, Where There is Evil, which was made into a play, and received an OBE for services to the victims of child sex abuse, said she was convinced her father was to blame."I originally became involved in the investigation because I had a conversation with my father in 1992 just after his mother's death and he linked himself there to Moira for the first time ever," Brown told the BBC."He said to me that his own father blamed him for Moira and basically this was said in such a way that he probably thought at this time that I wouldn't remember Moira, because I was only eight when she disappeared."It was really a chilling conversation I had with him and it brought up a lot of echoes and worries for me and eventually it led to me going to the police."After a long campaign by Brown and Anderson's sister, Janet Hart, the lord advocate, Frank Mulholland, ordered a full cold case review last year.Brown and Hart believe Gartshore disposed of Anderson's body in the open grave of his dead acquaintance Sinclair Upton at the Upton family's burial plot, a site thought to contain up to eight bodies.After ground scans suggested another body could be inside the family grave, a sheriff gave permission in December for the exhumation to take place after the Upton family gave its agreement.The Strathclyde police forensics team has started by pumping out the waterlogged site, in a process expected to take several days.Chief Inspector Kenny MacLeod, who is leading the operation, said the sodden ground presented "significant challenges" for investigators."We have uncovered the burial plot. A team from the University of Dundee will be examining the burial plot," he said.He added: "There may be no necessity to exhume all eight human remains but that does remain a possibility."The site does present significant problems and challenges, not only in terms of ground conditions but also record-keeping, as you can imagine, going back to 1908, it may not detail every person in the burial plot."
