Professor Mike Hough (Response, June 29) sought to "set the record straight" regarding our findings from the British Crime Survey 2005-06. He does not disagree with our main conclusion that 3m crimes, all against chronic victims, were excluded but seeks to justify the exclusion. When the BCS was first conducted 26 years ago, the extent of repetitive victimisation was poorly recognised. Accumulated evidence on repeated domestic violence, racial attacks, burglary and so on means that we are wiser now.Hough contends that the most "compelling reasons" for the BCS approach are "technical problems" relating to the sample size. He argues that, for the 1982 survey, a survivor of domestic violence who was beaten twice weekly would gross up to 40,000 offences nationally. What this boils down to is a suggestion that 104 criminal assaults experienced by one woman are worth less than 104 assaults experienced by 104 different people, and should be counted as five assaults. We consider this indefensible, as we believe Mike Hough would if he could be induced to consider it in these terms. Prof Graham Farrell and Prof Ken Pease  Loughborough University
