A judge yesterday rescinded a Â£250 compensation order imposed on a father who assaulted a man he believed had sold heroin to his son.Judge David Griffiths, sitting at Southampton crown court, said it had been "inappropriate" to make Roger Dorrington pay the money to James White, 24. Dorrington had admitted assault. The order sparked outrage, with Dorrington claiming he would not pay it because the money would go toward buying more drugs. Judge Griffiths said: "As you know, I made a compensation order in this case. My recollection is that I did not hear any submissions as to the appropriateness of making the order in the circumstances of this case, and I should have done. "I was already having doubts about the appropriateness of such an order before I became aware of any criticism in the media. I must confess those doubts have been increased by the publicity this case has generated." Judge Griffiths heard submissions from Dorrington's defence lawyer, Giles Curtis-Raleigh. He told the court that Dorrington believed Mr White had been selling drugs to his sons Nicholas, 20, and Joseph, 21, when he hit him 15 times at the family home in Blissford, Hampshire, causing cuts and bruises. Dorrington admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm when he appeared at the court last Friday. The court heard that Dorrington had barred Mr White from his home but when he found him on his property again, the attack took place last June. Speaking afterwards, Dorrington said: "I am happy with the situation and the judge's comments." He will, however, still have to do 100 hours' community punishment. On Friday the court heard that Dorrington's two sons had been taking drugs since their teens and he was trying to wean them off their habit when he assaulted Mr White. Dorrington's sons are now off heroin, with Nicholas living in America and Joseph completing a drug treatment order. Press Association
