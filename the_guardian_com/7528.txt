False teeth and money was missing from the home of a possible victim of serial killer Harold Shipman, the public inquiry into his crimes heard.Beatrice Toft, 59, was found dead in bed by her daughter at her home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in November 1986. Her daughter, Patricia Clayton, told the inquiry in Manchester that she and her daughter had visited Mrs Toft two hours after Shipman's visit. She said: "My daughter went into the house and then came back and said Gran was asleep. I knew that something was wrong because mum never used to lie on her back. "Her mouth was wide open and her false teeth were not there. She never usually took her false teeth out, she always used to sleep in them." Paramedics pronounced her dead and Mrs Clayton called Shipman, who said a post mortem examination was not necessary. When her sister asked about the teeth, Shipman said: "She's probably swallowed them." Shipman, from Hyde, Greater Manchester was jailed last year for murdering 15 elderly women patients with lethal injections of diamorphine. The public inquiry is investigating the deaths of a further 459 patients.
