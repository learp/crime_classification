A former aide to the Duchess of York who was jailed for killing her lover has gone on the run from prison.Jane Andrews, 40, who was Sarah Ferguson's personal assistant for nine years, absconded from East Sutton Park open prison in Maidstone, Kent, on Sunday.Andrews was jailed for life in 2001 for the murder of her boyfriend Thomas Cressman. The court heard she hit the wealthy businessman across the head with a cricket bat and stabbed him through the chest with a kitchen knife in the bedroom of their west London home after he refused to marry her.Andrews, who will be eligible for release in 2012, was moved to an open prison in Yorkshire in July and transferred to East Sutton in the last couple of weeks.Last night, a spokesman for the prison service said the decision to move people to open prisons was taken by the independent parole board.He added that staff discovered Andrews was missing when they took the evening roll call at the 8pm. "Police have been informed and are assisting with the search," he added.Last night, Andrews' friend Lucinda Sharp said she was concerned about her safety and was "absolutely astonished, staggered and stunned" that she would escape so close to her potential release date.At her Old Bailey trial, a jury accepted the prosecution's case that Andrews killed Cressman as revenge after he said he would not marry her. They rejected Andrews' claims that she had armed herself because she was frightened after being abused by Creswell.After the attack, Andrews went on the run. The Duchess of York left two voicemail messages on her mobile phone urging her to give herself up, telling her: "You must come forward and help the police." Andrews sent messages back claiming she did not know why everyone was trying to contact her and insisting that "everything was fine" when she left.Four days later, when Andrews realised there was no escape, she told a friend that she was in Cornwall. Police found her curled up under a blanket in her car.After the guilty verdict, Andrews launched an appeal, claiming she had been sexually abused as a child. She said the trauma damaged her personality and meant that she was not guilty of murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The appeal was rejected.A spokeswoman for Kent police described Andrews as being of slim build with a fair complexion and very long, straight brown hair.She was wearing a long-sleeved black and white striped top, black jeans, a black bodywarmer and black trainers when she was last seen.
