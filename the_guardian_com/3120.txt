The government is not doing enough to tackle the problem of human traffickers forcing women into prostitution in Britain, according to the head of the London vice squad.Chief Superintendent Simon Humphrey said he failed to understand why such exploitation of women, the majority of whom are from eastern Europe, was not being treated with the "utmost seriousness" at a political level. In an interview on BBC World Service's Assignment programme, to be broadcast tomorrow, Mr Humphrey urged the government not to turn a blind eye to these "crimes against humanity". Asked if he felt the government would take more action if British women were victims of the sex trade, he replied: "I'm being forced to think that would be the case. I'm sure that that suggestion would be refuted but I cannot understand why it is not being treated more seriously at a political level at the moment. "Just because the majority of the women in this industry are from eastern Europe, it should not be a reason for not actually treating it with the utmost seriousness." Home Office minister Beverley Hughes refuted the accusation and told Assignment the government was working closely with police and had arrested dozens of traffickers. In November 2000, Britain signed a protocol on trafficking and smuggling, in accordance with the UN convention on transnational organised crime. A Home Office spokeswoman said a multi-agency taskforce, named Project Reflex, was set up in May 2000 to combat organised immigration crime, including people trafficking. Since April 2001 Project Reflex had disrupted 14 organised immigration crime groups and arrested 67 facilitators, she said. A United Nations and International Labour Organisation conference in London last December heard that up to 6,000 women and children from eastern Europe were brought to Britain, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands each year, destined to enter the sex trade.
