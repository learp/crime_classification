Supermarket groups and large manufacturers are now being targeted by organised identity theft gangs as part of a growing tax credit fraud scandal, Guardian Unlimited has learnt.The scale of the fraud could be 10 times higher than previously thought - at £50m rather than the £5m figure disclosed this week by Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general.HM Customs and Excise tax credit fraud strategy board is currently overseeing 40 separate investigations into organised tax credit fraud - most of them in the private sector.The disclosures follow the theft of 8,800 identities from the London region of Jobcentre Plus and 30,000 identities from Network Rail, the not-for-profit company responsible for maintaining tracks and stations.Some 6,800 identities from Jobcentre Plus were used to make false claims for tax credits - with 2,700 being successful and some £2.7m being paid out to fraudsters.All the stolen identities at Network Rail were used to make false claims for tax credits. Some 16,000 claims were stopped and now the remaining 14,000 successful claims have been halted.Details of the latest developments were released in a letter from Sir John to Richard Bacon, the Tory MP for Norfolk South and a member of the Commons public accounts committee, which is investigating the scandal.Mr Bacon said: "It looks as if the problems with the Department for Work and Pensions were just the tip of the iceberg."Apparently, organised criminal gangs have been stealing confidential personal information on an industrial scale, from many different employers."The appalling design of the tax credits scheme then provides a perfect opportunity for criminal gangs to commit massive fraud. It is quite sick-making and it calls into question the whole basis of the scheme".Organised criminal groups appear to be targeting large companies which have large, low-paid workforces who are likely to claim tax credits.Officially, Customs and Excise says 20 of the 40 investigations involve fraud in excess of £250,000, but some of the scams involve sums well in excess of the threshold.Sir John says no further large-scale frauds have been reported involving other government departments.A spokesman for Revenue and Customs said: "These frauds are subject to a series of different investigations which will potentially lead to prosecutions."When these investigations are complete, the number of prosecutions that result from these will be reported to the House [of Commons]."The tax credit fraud is just one of the problems affecting the scheme which is seen by Gordon Brown as a flagship measure.The complex scheme is regularly leading to families having to repay credits because of over-payments, and the computer system has been criticised recently by a Commons Treasury sub-committee.
