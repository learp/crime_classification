A drug addict whose baby died of an overdose of the heroin replacement methadone has been jailed for two years.Gemma Fennelly, 24, of Hartlepool, admitted to allowing or failing to prevent Mitchell Bate, aged 22 months, to swallow a lethal dose of methadone at her home in September 2005.Last month she pleaded guilty at Teesside crown court to manslaughter by "gross negligence".The child's father, Mark Bate, 34, was cleared of manslaughter after the prosecution offered no evidence against him. At the trial, the prosecution said the "tragic" event happened because of the chaotic home life of Mitchell's parents, and no "wickedness" by Fennelly was alleged.The court heard that the amount of methadone the boy ingested would have caused "serious problems" for an adult, let alone a child.In handing down the sentence, Judge Peter Fox said: "Through your very great carelessness, which amounts in law to gross negligence, you are responsible for your infant son's death."Outside the court, Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Lang of Hartlepool police said: "Like any toddler, Mitchell was vulnerable. And like all toddlers of that age, he was totally innocent."He should have been cherished, loved and looked after but the amount of methadone that he had consumed would have caused serious problems to an adult user."At just 22 months old he became a victim, through no fault of his own, to the drug culture. It is an appalling and tragic tale which had a profound effect on the small team of officers who were involved in investigating this case."
