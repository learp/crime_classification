A mother and stepfather accused of murdering her seven-year-old daughter by starving her to death have admitted manslaughter.A charge of murder against Junaid Abuhamza, 31, was dropped after new evidence about his mental health was revealed at Birmingham crown court.However, the prosecution did not accept a plea of manslaughter by Angela Gordon, 35, and her trial for murder continues. The pair were accused of starving Khyra Ishaq to death in May 2008.She was so emaciated at the time of death, her condition was outside the experience of medical professionals, Timothy Raggatt QC, for the prosecution, told the jury.Khyra and five other children under the couple's care and control had been denied food, the court heard.Abuhamza's guilty plea to Khyra's manslaughter was accepted and he was found guilty by the jury after direction from the judge, Mr Justice Roderick Evans.Abuhamza told the court he was brutally abused as a child and witnessed his father beating his younger sister to death when he was five years old.He also told jurors last week he had beaten Khyra with a cane, made her stand outside in the cold and threw cold water over her. When asked by the prosecution if he blamed himself for her death, he said: "Yes, I do."The court has heard he suffered from bouts of schizophrenia and thought Khyra had a "weird face" because she was possessed by evil spirits.Khyra died after being discovered at the family home in Handsworth, Birmingham, in a state of starvation.Abuhamza, who pleaded guilty to five cruelty charges at an earlier hearing, will be sentenced at the end of the trial.Raggatt told the court: "The infection that brought about Khyra's death was one that was caused, and wholly caused, as a result of one thing â€“ for months, quite literally months, she had been starved."Last week, Abuhamza told the court that he blamed himself for her death and felt "like a failure".He said he hadn't noticed how thin she had become, adding: "With all that was going on in the house, I couldn't see what was going on in front of me." Asked if he loved Khyra, he answered: "I did, yes. I feel like a failure."Five other children, who were also in the defendants' care, were also starved, the prosecution alleges.Gordon, of Handsworth, Birmingham, denies five counts of child cruelty.The case was adjourned until next Wednesday.
