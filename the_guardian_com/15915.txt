The brother of a man murdered during riots in Birmingham told a court yesterday how the attackers hurled racist abuse before stabbing their victim and leaving him to die.Zepheniah Young-Sam described how the gang travelling in two vehicles descended on him, his brother Isiah and two others as they walked through the back streets of Lozells to avoid trouble.The 25-year-old told Birmingham crown court how a group of Asian men wearing hoods and bandanas got out of the vehicles and walked towards them armed with knives and bats.Mr Young-Sam and his group tried to escape but Isiah was quickly surrounded. "They started shouting, coming towards us."He told Adrian Redgrave, prosecuting, that the abuse included "nigger".Mr Young-Sam said one of the aggressors threw a punch at his brother and that, as Isiah had gone to retaliate, he had shouted for them to run. He turned back to help his brother and saw "a few" Asian men run off, leaving two behind. Isiah was on the ground.Distressed, Mr Young-Sam was excused from further questioning by Mr Justice Mackay.Waqar Ahmed, 26, Azhil Khan, 23, and Afzal Khan, 22, all from the Handsworth area of Birmingham, deny murder. They also deny wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.The trial continues.
