Two Thai fishermen have appealed against their death sentence for raping and murdering Cardiff backpacker Katherine Horton, their lawyer said yesterday.Bualoi Posit, 23, and Wichai Somkhaoyai, 24, told a court in Surat Thani, southern Thailand, that the penalty was too harsh because they had cooperated with authorities as soon as they were detained for the January 1 attack on Koh Samui island.Appeals usually take a year in Thailand, but the lawyer predicted this one would take a few months after calls by the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, for the case to be resolved quickly.
