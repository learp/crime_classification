There is a chasm between the way parliament looks at legislation and how it should do so, the prestigious Lords committee on the constitution reports today.The committee urges more public involvement in the scrutiny process, and consistent examination of the impact of legislation two or three years after it is enacted. "We find it unacceptable that once legislation is passed it seems to go into a black hole," said Lord Norton, a political scientist and member of the committee. It welcomes the increasing provision of draft bills for committees to scrutinise, but says this should always happen. Committees should be able to take evidence and commission opinion polls and e-consultation. It also says committees should be able to commission independent research on the effects of legislation, and hold an inquiry if a law does not appear to be working as planned.
