The parents of Stephen Lawrence yesterday dropped their damages claim against 15 junior officers involved in the flawed murder investigation.Doreen and Neville Lawrence had issued writs against 41 officers, for their alleged racism, and were claiming Â£500,000 in damages. They said they would press on with suing 26 senior officers, including the former commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, and launched an attack on Scotland Yard for refusing to pay compensation. They said that their long struggle to achieve justice for their son had played a part in wrecking their marriage and left their lives in turmoil. Mr and Mrs Lawrence said their pain had been exacerbated by the police's failure to admit fault. A statement issued on Mr and Mrs Lawrence's behalf by their lawyer, Imran Khan, said: "It is difficult to overstate the damage and loss they have suffered over the course of almost seven years of police intransigence, errors, misconduct and racism." On the eve of the first anniversary of publication of a report which damned the Metropolitan police as institutionally racist, the Lawrences said the force's failure to pay compensation showed it had learned nothing, the statement said. Mr and Mrs Lawrence had dropped the claim against the junior officers to concentrate "on the more senior officers who support their actions". Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed to death by a racist gang at a bus stop in London in April 1993.No one has been convicted of the murder and the Lawrences are also suing the five main suspects for damages.
