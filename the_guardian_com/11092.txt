Portugal's attorney general today confirmed reports he was considering winding down the investigation over missing Madeleine McCann.Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro said the public prosecutor's office was weighing whether "sufficient conditions" had been met to allow for "the case's closure".Earlier, Portuguese media reports claimed a lack of evidence had forced officers to abandon the inquiry, nearly 14 months after the three-year-old went missing.The Correio da Manha paper said sources within Portugal's judicial police said they did "not have sufficient evidence to allow formal charges to be brought against the McCanns in the disappearance of their daughter".In a brief statement sent to the Guardian, the attorney-general's office said a "final report" prepared by the police would be carefully considered.It added: "The public prosecutor's office will proceed with the global analysis and evaluation of the whole case in order to determine whether or not the necessary and sufficient conditions have been united allowing for the case's closure and subsequent preparation of a final report."The statement ended with the note: "The case remains under judicial secrecy until mid-August."Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, disappeared from the resort of Praia da Luz in the Algarve during a family holiday on May 3 last year.Detectives later named her parents, Kate, 40, and Gerry McCann, 39, as well as a local man Robert Murat, 34, as formal suspects or "arguidos" in the abduction.Since then, both the McCanns and Murat have strenuously denied any wrongdoing in Madeline's disappearance.The McCanns' spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said today: "For now we are just trying to establish the truth of these reports."If the police are about to shelve the case we need information from their files. We don't want all that information sitting on a shelf in Portugal."Surely it is only fair if that information is handed over. The search for Madeleine will go on with or without the police's assistance. Kate and Gerry will never give up the search for their daughter."The McCanns remain classified as "arguidos" in the inquiry but have not been charged by authorities.They are due to go to the high court on July 7 in a bid to order the release of the Portuguese police files on the disappearance of their daughter.Should their status as suspects be lifted and the case closed then public prosecutor, Jose Cunha de Magalhaes de Menezes, could reopen inquiries at any stage.Mitchell added: "Arguidos status needs to be lifted from Kate and Gerry's shoulders."They should not have been in this position. They have suffered for long enough."
