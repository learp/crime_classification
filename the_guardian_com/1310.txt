A search for a missing woman has centred on a large pile of wood chippings.Police looking for Kate Prout, 55, who disappeared from her farm in the Forest of Dean a month ago, are now focusing on the several tonnes of chippings as part of a search of 80 hectares (200 acres) of land.More than 50 officers have scoured ponds, woodland and fields on Redhill Farm, in Redmarley, police said.A helicopter from the Western Counties Air Operation Unit also patrolled the skies above the farm over the weekend.Police bailed the woman's husband, Adrian Prout, 45, last week after two days of questioning.He reported his wife missing five days after she disappeared. The civil engineer, who runs a pheasant shoot on the farm, was arrested on suspicion of murder last Tuesday and released the next day.He has reportedly moved in with his wife's relatives as the search continues.Gloucestershire police stressed the inquiry was for a missing person and that the arrest was one of many lines of inquiry.A police spokeswoman said: "Officers involved in the missing person inquiry continue to keep an open mind concerning the circumstances surrounding Mrs Prout's disappearance and the issues surrounding this arrest are just one aspect of this thorough investigation involving numerous lines of inquiry."In the meantime, the search of the extensive grounds surrounding the missing woman's home continues as officers seek to determine whether she has come to harm accidentally or through criminal activity or other means."An extensive search of the area where she lives is continuing and is expected to last for some time."Prayers have been said for Prout at nearby St Bartholomew's church over the past fortnight.Prout has been a long-standing campaigner for better milk prices and has petitioned the prime minister.
