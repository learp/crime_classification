A man jailed for raping and murdering a girl 26 years ago has had his conviction quashed after appeal judges ruled that his confessions were flawed and based on police intimidation.Raymond Gilmour, now 45, was sentenced to life in 1982 for attacking Pamela Hastie, 16, in woods near their homes in Johnstone near Paisley.Strathclyde police made Gilmour, then a highly suggestible 19-year-old with few friends, their suspect because he admitted indecently exposing himself to young women and using pornographic magazines in the woods.Later investigations revealed that after the murder witnesses saw a hooded man running from the woods who was never sought by police.Yesterday, after a lengthy campaign to overturn the conviction, led by his mother, Ena Gilmour, 76, church minister Hamish MacColl and lawyer Gordon Ritchie, appeal judges in Edinburgh decided he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice.Mrs Gilmour said: "It's been a long, long wait but we've got what we asked for. It's been very, very tough for all these years, but I've always believed he was innocent. I've never had any doubts."In the judgment the lord justice clerk, Lord Gill, who is Scotland's second most senior judge, criticised non-disclosure of evidence of police violence against Gilmour and accused police pathologists of concealing evidence that Hastie had defensive knife wounds to her hands.The detective originally in charge of the case, Superintendent James Brown, who never believed Gilmour was guilty, told the procurator fiscal in 1982 that he suspected two officers had used violence to compel Gilmour to confess. The appeal court ruled that had this been revealed at Gilmour's trial, it "would have been a significant matter for the jury's consideration".An expert on confession evidence, Professor Gisli Gudjonsson, had raised substantial doubts about the reliability of Gilmour's confessions, Lord Gill ruled. His analysis established that Gilmour had given statements riddled with factual errors and inconsistencies about the murder.Ten main flaws included his claims he strangled her with her "belt or tie", when the twine used had been tightly wound three times around her neck; that he had left her body in view of a path, when it was dragged for 70 yards and concealed; and that she had worn white socks and black shoes, yet had tights and grey shoes.Lord Gill said two police pathologists, Dr Walter Weir and Dr WDS MacLay, failed to tell the trial that Hastie had cuts on her fingers when Gilmour never mentioned or was accused of using a knife. "It is important evidence of the inadequacies of the postmortem report and, by clearest implication, the lack of professionalism of Dr Weir and Dr McLay," he said.Lord Gill said weaknesses in the prosecution case included the lack of any eyewitnesses, bodily fluids, textiles, soil and scratch marks on Gilmour's body which linked him to the murder.Released in 2002 after serving 21 years, Gilmour is now serving 30 months for indecent exposure. His mother and lawyer, Gordon Ritchie, claim his sexual inadequacy was never treated because he would not admit to killing Hastie. Mr Ritchie said Gilmour could now receive compensation.
