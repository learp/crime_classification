A weapons collector who killed his friend by knifing him in the heart while they were testing out an armoured vest has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.David Baxter, of Newcastle, plunged a combat knife into his friend Christopher Baker's chest in a drunken "initiation ceremony" that went wrong.The 18-year-old victim said: "It's gone through, Davy," when the six-inch blade pierced his heart.He bled to death despite Baxter's desperate attempts to save his life.The accident happened in Seaham, County Durham, in April, at Baxter's former address.Baker had been drinking with friends and called at his neighbour's home at around 2.30am.Baxter, who had been drinking vodka, suggested they perform an initiation test in which each would don protective clothing and take turns to attack the other with knives.The 31-year-old former drug addict, who had a collection of weapons including knives and a samurai sword, put on a black police issue stab-proof vest and invitedBaker to attack him with the sword.He fitted his friend with a protective camouflage jacket and prepared to stab him with the knife.The jacket was built from 16 layers of reinforced synthetic fibre and was designed to fit two bulletproof armoured plates which could be inserted in pockets covering the chest, Newcastle crown court heard.But the plates were not in the jacket when Baxter lunged with the knife.Baxter told police: "I pointed him once and he took the force."He was laughing and he said: 'It's gone through, Davy'.Baker collapsed and Baxter tried to administer first aid. Paramedics arrived at his home at 2.50am but Baker was already dead.Prosecutor Mark Giuliani said tests showed the jacket had been used in the ritual many times before. But it was not designed to be protection against a knife.In mitigation, Paul Sloan QC said the men performed the "foolhardy ritual" as a test of nerve. Baxter always allowed his friends to attack him first during the ritual, Sloan said. He had double-checked the jacket and never meant his friend to come to harm.Sloan said: "He has always blamed himself and has always acknowledged he was responsible for the death that occurred."He will never stop punishing himself for what he did that night."Baxter, who admitted manslaughter, told police: "I wish it was me, not him."Why could it have not just gone through me?"Lock us up; send us to jail, that's where I need to be."I'm going to be paying for the rest of my life."Judge David Hodson said he accepted Baxter did not intend to harm his friend.He said: "This was a tragic death for all concerned, particularly for the family of the deceased, but at the heart of the matter lies this undoubted proposition â€“ the defendant did not intend to kill the victim nor did he intend to harm him in any way."It was foolish and reckless to a criminal degree but it was not intended in malice but by recklessness, bravado, and sheer stupidity on his part."Baxter had previous convictions for possession of offensive weapons and for assaulting a police officer.
