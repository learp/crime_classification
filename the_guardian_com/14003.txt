A teenage boy who lured a friend into a rubbish-filled skip and then set fire to it was warned by a judge yesterday that he faced a long detention term for manslaughter.The 15-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was comforted by his parents who had been allowed to sit with him in court as the horrific story of Michael Temperley's death was put to a jury. The victim, also 15, died of burns after he scrambled into the skip where his friend and a 16-year-old had thrown his mountain bike. The door was bolted behind him and "out of boredom and stupidity" the 15-year-old threw in a lighted piece of paper. Newcastle crown court heard how Michael, described as a bright and popular boy, screamed for help as smoke and flames engulfed the waste cardboard and wood in the skip. Passers-by helped the two other boys in a vain attempt to force open the skip, at the back of shops in Gateshead. Mr Justice Henriques told the boy: "This case is so serious that you must prepare yourself for a lengthy period of time in detention." The jury cleared him of false imprisonment but found him guilty of manslaughter. The 16-year-old was cleared of false imprisonment. The boys told the jury during the week-long trial that Michael, of Low Fell in Gateshead, had gone along with the "prank" and claimed that he had been singing inside the skip and later lit a cigarette. But forensic experts found no evidence for this. Michael's parents said after the verdict: "Our son was a very bright button - he was very intelligent and was in the top set for all his subjects at school. Much has been said about the distress of the other boys' families in their current situation. But they will go on to live their lives - for us this will never end."
