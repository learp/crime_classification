The law governing the killing of young children is "outdated", a judge warned yesterday as he dismissed a mother's appeal against conviction.The comments by Lord Justice Judge will reinforce concerns about courts relying on the evidence of medical experts to prove guilt. Lord Justice Judge, the deputy chief justice, said: "The law relating to infanticide is unsatisfactory and outdated. The appeal in this sad case demonstrates the need for a thorough re-examination. The public interest requires that the problems arising from and connected to the offence of infanticide should be included in any review." The Home Office last year announced a comprehensive review of the law of murder. But delivering their reserved judgment at the court of appeal in London, Lord Justice Judge, Mrs Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Leveson, refused to overturn the life sentence given to Chaha'Oh-Niyol Kai-Whitewind for murdering her son. They said there was sufficient independent evidence to discount any doubts about the conviction. Kai-Whitewind, 28, who denied murder, was convicted at Birmingham crown court in December 2003. The prosecution alleged that she suffocated Bidziil, aged 12 weeks, frustrated at his refusal to breastfeed. At her appeal, her lawyers argued that the conviction was unsafe because it was based on an assessment of evidence from experts who gave conflicting opinions as to whether natural causes of death could be excluded. But Lord Justice Judge said no natural illness explained the old and fresh blood in the baby's lungs, or the nosebleed he had suffered the afternoon he died. The findings related to a mother who "had difficulties" bonding with her child, who may have delayed reporting his death, and who had chosen not to give evidence.
