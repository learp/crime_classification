A babysitter who murdered her neighbour's two-year-old son by repeatedly battering his head against wooden banisters will serve at least 10 years of a life sentence after a judge said she had a low chance of reoffending.Suzanne Holdsworth, 34, was minding Kyle Fisher at her home in Millpool Close, Hartlepool, while his 19-year-old mother Clare was on a night out last July.Her barrister said the normal starting point for a life sentence for murder was 15 years.Mr Justice Grigson, sentencing at Leeds crown court, told Holdsworth he accepted that he accepted her actions were not premeditated."You are a woman of good character, you brought up two children on your own and you acted as a babysitter to other children prior to this tragic incident and in all that time you behaved in a wholly responsible way."Only you know what happened on the night that caused you to assault this young child, a child who apparently loved you and of whom you were fond."A jury at Teesside crown court found her guilty last month after hearing the impact on the child's head was similar to being thrown from a car at 60mph.Kyle died from severe brain swelling at Newcastle General Hospital two days after Holdsworth attacked him. Photographic evidence of the bruising to the top of his head matched the pattern of the wooden banisters.No motive for the attack was given in court and Holdsworth always denied hitting the toddler, claiming he had suffered a fit and collapsed.Holdsworth wept as she was led away while many of her family stood in the public gallery to show their support.Jeremy Richardson QC, for the defence, had earlier told the judge that Holdsworth was a loving mother of two with a large supportive family. He said she had worked on a supermarket checkout while she was on bail in the Halton Moor area of Leeds, the city where she grew up.Mr Richardson said: "She has no history of violence. This was a one-off tragedy."He said that in the 34 days she had already spent in prison she had already made good progress and taken several courses at Low Newton jail's unit for life prisoners.After sentencing, a Cleveland police spokesman said Kyle's death had left many victims."Little Kyle is not going to grow up so his family have been deprived of seeing that," he said. "Holdsworth will not see her children grow up because she will be in prison for a long time."There are no winners in this case."
