A detective launched a private summons yesterday against his chief constable over two uniformed colleagues who allegedly roughed him up for being "ungrateful" after they had decided not to proceed over his positive breath test.Detective constable Neil Marsh told a compensation hearing at the high court in Leeds that he had been made to grovel for his car keys before being grabbed, wrestled to the ground and forced into handcuffs late at night. He told the court that they had made statements which were "all lies and Enid Blyton" before the charge was finally dropped eight months after the incident in September 2000. DC Marsh, 45 and with 22 years' police service, was driving home from a promotion party with colleagues from South Yorkshire police when his car broke down in the middle of Rotherham. Because it was blocking part of the road, he rang police and then settled back drinking whisky from a half-bottle he had in his golf bag, on top of four or five pints of cider drunk at the party. He told the court that PCs Christopher Isherwood and Martin Tate arrived in a patrol car, tested him and got a positive reading. But they accepted his explanation about the whisky after one of them had rung for advice from the station sergeant. DC Marsh said the men then offered him a lift home but their attitude changed after he began "bragging" about cases he had investigated as a detective. DC Marsh is claiming compensation for assault, wrongful arrest and abuse of public office against the chief constable. Asked if he had been violent or abusive, kicking the car seat and spitting, he replied: "Absolutely not." The case continues.
