Pam Knight After the murder the Knights moved with their son Luke from Well Hall Road, Eltham, the street where Stephen Lawrence died, to Beaverbrook Road in New Eltham. Mrs Knight attended the inquiry when the youths gave their evidence. After Luke's arrest in 1993 she was the 'appropriate' adult during his interview with the police, but was replaced when it became clear that she was also his alibi: she said he had been at home on the night of the murder. Pauline Dobson Still lives with her son Gary in Phineas-Pett Road on the Progress Estate, Eltham, a few minutes from where Stephen was murdered. She and her husband, a builder, provided Gary with an alibi for the night of the murder. They said he had been upstairs in his room at the time. Theresa 'Tracey' Norris Lives in a mock Tudor mansion with son David in Chislehurst. Her husband, Clifford, is serving eight years for drug importation and possession of firearms. The house is currently under a receivership order obtained by Customs & Excise this month to effect a confiscation order made at his trial in 1996. Mrs Norris was given 28 days to seek legal advice. She accompanied David when he gave evidence at the public inquiry and was accused at one point by Michael Mansfield QC, for the Lawrence family, of schooling her son's answers. Pat Acourt Lives with her two younger sons, Jamie and Neil, in Dutton Road, Greenwich. They were rehoused from Eltham by the council after the murder. Mrs Acourt has been married twice and has five children. At the time of the murder divided her time between her sons and a boyfriend.
