A city banker who organised a drink-fuelled party on the tube before the start of the system's alcohol ban at the weekend today said he feared he would lose his job after it resulted in vandalism and violence.Alexandre Graham, who works for the Royal Bank of Scotland, arranged the Circle line event to protest against Boris Johnson's decision to ban drinking alcohol on the tube. Police were forced to close six Circle line stations on Saturday night - hours before the ban came into effect at midnight - and made 17 arrests.Several groups were set up on social networking websites in response to the London mayor's ban, with group names including "anti-Boris tube crawl" and "one final tube booze party".Graham claimed today that he had set up the party because a female friend who worked for Ken Livingstone had lost her job when Johnson won May's mayoral election.The 26-year-old's Facebook group, called "Circle line party â€“ last day of drinking on the tube'', attracted more than 1,000 members, but he said he had no idea the event would get out of control."The point of it [the party] was just to make fun of how ridiculous the ban is,'' he told the Evening Standard.''I hope I don't get sacked. You are going to expect a bit of trouble, but I was surprised and disappointed because I don't want to be associated [with it]''.While the party began as a light-hearted protest, violence later broke out after more than 2,000 people joined in.Ian Rawlings, a 23-year-old exhibitions executive who helped Graham set up the event, added: ''We all have very good jobs, we work hard for our money and, when we get the chance to spend it, we like to spend it."While we wanted to enjoy ourselves and have a bit of fun, and almost stick two fingers up at the establishment, we also know it is not just our tube. Other people have to use it.''The Rail Maritime and Transport union said Saturday's violence had been "far uglier" than initially thought.According to the union's dossier of incidents, there were at least five mayday calls from staff. An underground worker was punched in the face and had beer poured over his head, a driver had his glasses broken by a passenger and several people climbed onto the tracks. "The more reports we get from our reps, the uglier the picture of Saturday's violence becomes and the clearer it is that tube bosses effectively simply crossed their fingers and closed their eyes,'' the general secretary, Bob Crow, said."Local reps are telling us that the scenes were among the most chaotic they have ever seen, with none of the mitigation and crowd control that would be in place on new year's eve - and the concentration of numbers at times was probably greater. "A Transport for London spokesman said that while the majority of people who gathered on the underground had been considerate and well-behaved, a number of "unfortunate incidents" had resulted in arrests. A spokesman for the Greater London Authority said: "Londoners are fed up [with] feeling threatened and intimidated on public transport. That's why the mayor has introduced an alcohol ban which came into effect today. "It is ridiculous of the RMT to suggest that the alcohol ban threatens the safety of London underground staff when it was the consumption of alcohol that fuelled the reprehensible incidents of violence that took place."
