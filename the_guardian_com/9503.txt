Police in Northern Ireland have released a picture gallery of people they want to question over rioting in north Belfast that climaxed in shots being fired at riot squad officers.The PSNI has published images of nine individuals they want to speak to in relation to the Ardoyne disorder on 12 July. Twenty police officers were injured in the disturbances following a controversial Orange Order parade past the Ardoyne district.Up to 10 shots were directed at police lines while republican youths threw petrol bombs, fireworks, bricks, golf balls and other missiles at officers.Detective Chief Inspector Alan Little, who is in charge of investigating the Ardoyne violence, said he hoped members of the public could help police identify the nine people shown in the images."From the start we have adopted a very proactive approach in relation to the investigation of public disorder both in the leadup to 12 July and following the scenes that were witnessed again this year," he said. "This approach has included taking every step possible to reduce the possibility of violence, including reviewing investigations from previous years."He said the public disorder in the Ardoyne area "wreaked havoc on local people"."It is in everybody's interest – as well as in the interest of justice – that those responsible are dealt with appropriately."To date, 26 people have been arrested in relation to trouble in the area last month. Of these, 25 have been charged and one has been released unconditionally.
