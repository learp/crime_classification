A primary school caretaker who carried out a letter bomb campaign in which eight people were injured was given an indeterminate jail sentence today.Miles Cooper, 27, from Cambridgeshire, who said he sent the packages as a protest against Britain's "authoritarian surveillance society", was told at Oxford crown court that he would have to serve at least five years in prison.Cooper was convicted yesterday of 11 counts under the Explosive Substances Act and the Offences Against the Person Act. Judge Julian Hall described Cooper as "a terrorist" and "a coward".He said he was imposing an indeterminate sentence because of the danger Cooper posed to the public.Cooper must serve a minimum of five years minus the 116 days he has already spent in custody.He said: "First and foremost you are a terrorist, let there be no mistake. Anyone who tries through violence or threat of violence to change the political will is a terrorist and that is precisely what you did."People who opened Cooper's devices were showered in glass fragments or nails, the jury heard.Judge Hall said Cooper had caused lasting psychological damage to his victims and massive disruption to the organisations he targeted.He told Cooper: "Either what you did was rational, in which case it was evil, or it was irrational, which, in my mind, makes it even more frightening."You didn't follow up your campaign of terror with any attempts at publicity trying to make your point. It makes one doubt your motives. I think you had a double motive and simply didn't care if people were hurt."You come across as a quiet, unemotional young man with little empathy for others."I have no hesitation in finding you a serious risk of harm to the public. If ever the public should be protected from someone it is you."In the first explanation of his actions, Cooper said he had turned to violent methods after first campaigning peacefully against proposals to introduce ID cards.He told the court that "it became more and more obvious that the government was not going to listen to peaceful protesters".Britain was "one of the most watched societies on the planet", he said.The seven crude nail and broken-glass bombs, posted in January and February this year, were sent to three forensic science laboratories, a computer company, an accountancy firm, the DVLA and a residential address.He targeted organisations he believed were connected to government control, surveillance and monitoring, and watched the impact on the TV news.His first efforts did not achieve the publicity he wanted, appearing only on a BBC website.The second batch of more powerful bombs were made by putting explosive material into nail varnish bottles, a device designed to flash and shatter."I was hoping to achieve a bomb scare, to shut down a building, but cause no real harm to any individual," he said.When he saw the news coverage, he changed them again."When I realised people had been more seriously injured than I had intended, I decided to redesign the devices to make them harmless," he said.Cooper told the jury he was "genuinely ashamed". He said he had wanted to spread fear and denied intending to cause serious harm.Cooper, who was described by neighbours as shy and introverted, was arrested at his home in the village of Cherry Hinton. The police discovered three more devices at the house, which he shared with his mother and sister.Gareth Branston, prosecuting, told the court: "The Crown suggests that the defendant's motivation was as much to do with his interest in explosives as much as anything else."Contrary to his assertion he was downgrading his devices, he was capable of upping the ante considerably. He was going to build further and dispatch more dangerous devices."Michael Wolkind QC, defending Cooper, said he was "lost and obsessed by his misguided campaign".He added: "He wasn't planning to escalate the campaign, he was trying to devise a series of items that would cause less harm."Mr Wolkind said Cooper had told a psychiatrist: "An urban guerrilla is useless when discovered."
