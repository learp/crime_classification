Six large plasma screens blinked into action yesterday in the control room of an NCP car park in a not very salubrious part of Manchester.An operator zoomed in on three young boys in Piccadilly Gardens. They should have been at school, but seemed more intent on shoving each other around. The Â£3.2m network of more than 400 closed circuit cameras monitoring the city centre and its car parks is one of the most sophisticated in Britain. Funded by the city council and NCP, it was opened yesterday by Lord Falconer, the minister for criminal justice. The screens can display up to 180 high resolution images at one time. It is possible to track someone walking from one side of the city to the other. Trials have shown a 60% rise in the incidents to which police have been alerted.
