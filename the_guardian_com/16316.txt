But that was Jo; working above the fray, across the political divide. She reminded us, many of us, why we entered politics. She allowed us to believe that we could make a difference and that we could change things,” said Warsi.

We were both asked to appear on the Sunday Politics show. I was taken by the BBC to the makeup room. She was having her makeup done and she instantly smiled at me and I knew within those first few seconds that this was a person I was going to enjoy knowing. She was so warm and so kind. In fact, I think the producers of the programme were a bit disappointed because we got on so well,” he said.“From that moment on, every time I saw Jo – in a meeting in parliament or passing her in a corridor or whether it be at prime minister’s questions on the opposite side of the chamber, we would look at each other and smile.”Various men from the local Muslim community paid tribute to Cox. Iqbal Bhana, deputy chair of the Al Hickmah centre, where the event was held, warned the audience that he may struggle to “keep it together” as he delivered his tribute, in which he recalled how Cox would always greet him with a hug: “My wife doesn’t even normally do that.”Updatedat 10.18pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose8.14pm BST20:14A two-minute silence in memory of Jo Cox has just been held in Parliament Square, in central London, followed by tributes paid to her by her fellow Labour MPs Wes Streeting, Harriet Harman and Ed Miliband.Miliband talked of pledging to “honour her (Cox’s) legacy”. He said: “Jo Cox only loved, she never hated. Tonight, from this square, we send our love to her husband Brendan, her two children and her family. And let us honour her memory by building a world where there is more love and less hate.”Harman said those present were “showing you mourn the loss of Jo Cox and mourn the tragic loss for her two children of their irreplaceable mother. And you show too your admiration for what she stood for”.Cox’s fellow Commons newcomer, Streeting, said: “The solidarity we have seen in the last days has been overwhelming and, in time of overwhelming grief, it can be hard to find anything positive to hold on to ... What we can all do is to pledge ourselves to build the world that Jo was fighting for; a world of humanity, decency, compassion, solidarity, human rights, social justice, of simple kindness.”The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, and the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, also attended the Parliament Square event.

A minute’s silence was led by a local priest, Rev Mark Umpleby.Afterwards, Naz Shah, the MP for nearby Bradford West, was tearful as she described her shock at Cox’s death. “She was one of those women who should have made history. She’s the type of person legends are made of,” said Shah, who was – like Cox – part of the new intake to the Commons last May. “She had this incredible energy about her, and what was amazing was her dedication not just to her constituents but to her kids. You’d see her rushing off back to the boat to tuck her kids in and then she would cycle back to vote.”Shah remembered a joyful meeting in Portcullis House with Cox and Stephen Kinnock, another 2015 parliamentary newcomer. Cox had brought her two small children, who were causing mayhem. “I remember saying to her, ‘We need a picture of this for your memoirs.’ She was trying to have a serious political conversation while her two little ones were running between her legs. I have a picture of us three next to a buggy, with a blur of her little boy running past.”Cox held a party on her boat on Tuesday for the 2015 intake but Shah was unable to make it. “It’s one of those things I will live to regret,” she said.Another vigil is due to take place at the Al Hikmah community centre in Batley at 7pm.

We have been mugged off for Far to (sic) long.” The post was later deleted.That follows the news that police are investigating a white supremacist group after applause for the killing was posted on one of its social media accounts.According to the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate, at least nine MPs have been targeted by far-right activists during the past two years.Updatedat 7.22pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.28pm BST18:28New details about Cox’s killing were also released by the police. They said she was attacked as she arrived for her constituency surgery on Thursday – not after, as was previously thought.“During the course of the incident, a 77-year-old man bravely intervened to assist Jo and in doing so sustained a serious injury to his abdomen and although now stable he remains in hospital,” the force’s temporary chief constable, Dee Collins, said.She confirmed the north-east counter-terrorism unit would be providing specialist support and said that medical examinations had resulted in Mair being declared fit for both detention and interview, adding that detectives would continue to question him today.It also emerged that Cox had twice received a “malicious communication of a sexual nature at her parliamentary office in Westminster”. Collins said that both incidents were investigated by the Metropolitan police and that one person – not Mair – was given an adult caution.“The other incident remains undetected. West Yorkshire police have not been made aware of any complaints or concerns from Jo Cox,” she said.Collins also praised members of the public who helped unarmed officers find and tackle the suspect.Updatedat 7.51pm BSTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.11pm BST18:11Suspect's far-right links are 'priority line of inquiry', police sayWest Yorkshire police have released a statement saying that reports linking the man who shot Jo Cox to far-right extremism form a central part of their inquiries. “[This is a] priority line of enquiry which will help us establish the motive for the attack on Jo.
