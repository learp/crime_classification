Police officers have rejected the government's offer on pay and conditions, striking a blow at the wider programme of changes in British policing, union officials said today.The police federation chairman, Fred Broughton, said the ballot of 126,000 front-line officers in England and Wales produced "a massive and significant rejection" of the proposed reforms.He said the ballot result reflected a lack of trust in the government's agenda. "The questions about the discretionary money to be distributed ... and the detail of these proposals have also been a major part of the rejection," he said.Officers are also concerned about wider aspects of Mr Blunkett's modernisation scheme, including plans for a new breed of civilian wardens with the power to use force to detain suspects, and greater centralised control over chief constables. Under the scheme, the government would raise all annual pay scales by £400, make it easier for officers to rise up the scales. It would also offer an extra "competence-related" pay tier, paying a bonus of £1,002. There would also be special payments for officers in specialised or difficult jobs of between £500 to £5,000 a year. Some officers have said they have not received enough information from chief constables on how the special payments would be applied. The deal would also cut back on overtime payments and abolish a number of allowances.
