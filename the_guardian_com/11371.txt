Harold Shipman, Britain's worst serial killer, will not face further charges for the alleged murder of 23 additional female patients.According to David Calvert-Smith, director of public prosecutions, a second trial against Shipman would be too difficult due to the huge publicity surrounding the case.Shipman, who has already been imprisoned for the murder of 15 of his female patients, is believed to have committed a total of 146 murders in his 20-year career as a medical doctor in Hyde, near Manchester.Greater Manchester police say they have enough evidence to charge Shipman with the murders of another 23 women.The families of his other suspected victims have agreed that a second trial could not take place.The first trial was limited to 15 victims so that the judge and jury would not be overwhelmed by the proceedings. Mr Calvert-Smith pointed out that Shipman has "already been sent to prison for the rest of his natural life". But, he added: "I have been acutely aware of the distress of relatives of the deceased and the understandable desire of some of them for a further public trial in a criminal court."
