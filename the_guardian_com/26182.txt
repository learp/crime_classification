The Home Office minister responsible for policing appears to be unmoved to take action over the latest allegation surrounding Bob Lambert.Earlier this month, Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, highlighted an allegation that Lambert, while working as an undercover policeman, planted an incendiary device which set fire to a Debenhams store.In the parliamentary debate, she asked the minister, Nick Herbert, "what is the Minister going to do now, given that the issue is in the public domain?"Herbert appeared to dodge the question, as Lucas accused him of extraordinary complacency.This week, we asked the Home Office if the minster was doing anything. They have not answered our question.Since the allegation was aired in Parliament, there have been two articles worth reading which argue in favour of a public inquiry into the police's undercover operations.Lucas herself argued in the New Statesman that "If the allegations turn out to be true, then we must ask: can it be right that officers who commit a crime undercover should be able to do so with impunity?"Ellie Mae O'Hagan, in the Guardian, criticised the way in which the 12 previous inquiries into undercover policing, each one with the "narrowest possible remit", have followed the same pattern."The golden rules are: leave stones unturned, concede that things were less than perfect in the particular incident you are investigating, and never widen the investigation beyond the isolated case."Meanwhile, for some trenchant analysis of Lambert from an activist perspective, catch this from the Bristling Badger blog.
