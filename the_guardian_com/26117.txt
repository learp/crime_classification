Speculation is rife as to the identity of the spoof tweeter @hoganhowe. Tweeting since October 2, the "commissioner of the Metropolis" - 'not really', has attracted 427 followers including - for some reason - the acting head of Scotland Yard's directorate of public affairs Caroline Murdoch.Such is the wit of his tweets that many believe they could not emanate from a police officer spoofing his boss. The finger is being pointed instead at a wayward hack.Unlike the rest of the Metropolitan police, @hoganhowe regularly comments on the ongoing investigation into hacking, or as he puts it- Operation Weetabix."Officers from Operation Weetabix are surrounding Old Bailey and High Court following intel that lots of journalists are inside #totalwaronhacks" he tweeted last week. On the closure of the Police Review magazine @hoganhowe confesses: "I closed down @PoliceReview following intelligence that pre-crimes (critical pieces about the Met) were being planned #totalwaronhacks". Whoever is behind the tweets has knowledge of the commissioner's penchant for holding meetings with his officers at 7am over breakfast - incluiding a regular session in the police canteen on Friday morning for any of his officers who are awake to come and talk to him about issues they want to raise."Tomorrow is Thursday: that means Coco Pops for breakfast to remind me of the perils of youth crime #totalwaroncrime"Evidence that the spoofer is a journalist is growing as observers are increasingly noting that the posts tend to reduce on a busy news day in the crime field but as yet there has been no more light shed on the identity of the tweeter whose favourite and repeated post focuses on the real commissioner's much vaunted philosophy:"total Total Total TOTAL TOTAL TOTAL POLICING."Anyone with information please contact Crime and Justice Blog in strict confidence.
