A nurse was charged last night with the murder of four elderly women at two of Britain's largest teaching hospitals. The 29-year-old man is also accused of attempting to kill a 90-year-old woman during a six-month spell three years ago.The nurse, who has not been named and has been remanded in custody, was arrested on suspicion of murder three years ago when questions were raised about the death of one of the women, Ethel Hall, an 86-year-old grandmother from the village of Calverley, West Yorkshire. She was admitted to Leeds general infirmary with a fractured hip but was otherwise in good health.But she died after a big overdose of insulin, collapsing so quickly that a shocked doctor ordered blood tests.Detectives moved into the hospital soon afterwards to question staff, at the start of an inquiry which lasted until last night when the man was charged.The nurse, who had worked on orthopaedic wards since 2001, was suspended and questioned about 19 other deaths. He will appear before magistrates in Leeds this morning. He is accused of three killings at the infirmary and one at St James's University hospital, Leeds, the city's other main hospital.
