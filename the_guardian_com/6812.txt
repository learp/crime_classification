More than 4,000 men living or working in the area where a young model was fatally stabbed are being asked to voluntarily undergo DNA testing, police said today.Detectives investigating the sexual assault and murder of Sally Anne Bowman outside her home in Croydon, south London, on September 25 last year are sending letters to men in the area, asking them to undergo the test.Police believe Bowman's killer was a serial sex offender who lives or works in the area. They have already obtained hundreds of DNA samples from local men as part of the hunt for her killer.Detective chief inspector Stuart Cundy, leading the murder investigation, said the samples would not be kept on the national DNA database or checked against other unsolved crimes.However, he warned that any of the 4,000 men who did not come forward voluntarily would be visited by officers, and said there were up to 2,500 men in south Croydon matching the description of the model's killer. "The letter asks men who live or visit the South Croydon area, who are white or light-skinned and were born between 1965 and 1985, to voluntarily provide their DNA," he said. "This is about men helping their community to catch Sally Anne's murderer before he does any further attacks."Mouth swabs will be carried out at a temporary police station in the Brighton Road Baptist Church, south Croydon, and from Monday until March 12 between 7am and 10pm. The 4,000 men do not need to make an appointment but are asked not to consume any coffee or food or smoke any cigarettes for 20 minutes beforehand. They will need to take two forms of identification - including one showing a current address and photo ID such as a driving licence or passport - with them.
