A Royal Navy sailor has been remanded in custody at Winchester crown court accused of the murder of a colleague and the attempted murders of three other crew on board a nuclear submarine.Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donovan, 22, of Dartford, Kent, was charged with murdering Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, 36, who was fatally shot on HMS Astute at Southampton last Friday.He has also been charged with the attempted murders of Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37, and Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge, 45.Judge Keith Cutler adjourned the case for a plea and case management hearing on 10 June.A hearing at Southampton magistrates court on Monday was told by Nick Hawkins, chief prosecutor for Hampshire Crown Prosecution Service, that the director of service prosecutions had agreed to hand over jurisdiction of the case to the civilian courts.Hawkins said the allegation against Donovan was that he fired an SA80 rifle six times, aiming at the four named victims, killing Molyneux.Molyneux's widow, Gillian, described the father of four from Wigan as "utterly devoted to his family".She added: "Everything he did was for us. He was very proud to be an officer in the Royal Navy submarine service."The shootings took place as local dignitaries, including the city council's mayor, chief executive and leader, were being given a tour of the submarine while it was berthed at Eastern Docks, on a five-day official visit to the Hampshire city.Astute was cleared to leave Southampton on Monday to return to its base at Faslane, Scotland.
