The home secretary, Charles Clarke, has turned down a plea for Ronnie Biggs to be released from prison on compassionate grounds, it emerged last night.Biggs, 76, the ailing Great Train Robber, has been told that he cannot leave Belmarsh high security jail in London because his persistent poor health is not terminal. The former fugitive, who was originally jailed for 30 years for his part in the 1963 robbery, has recently suffered minor strokes and heart attacks and contracted MRSA.A letter to Biggs said he was not "severely incapacitated so as to satisfy the criteria for compassionate release".
