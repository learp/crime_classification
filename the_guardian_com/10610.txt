People who persistently abuse the 999 ambulance service by making hoax or inappropriate calls will face prosecution under a new "zero tolerance" crackdown announced by ministers today.Ambulance services will also be given the right not to send vehicles to non-serious calls which they believe do not require a full scale emergency response but will instead refer the caller to NHS Direct, the telephone health advice line.Services are currently obliged to send an ambulance to all 999 calls regardless of suitability, and take the caller to the nearest accident and emergency department. Last year there were around 70,000 hoax calls to services in England.This has seen highly-trained paramedics sent to callers who have called 999 to report "problems" as trivial as toothache, broken finger nails, or lost door keys.Guidance issued to ambulance trusts states that they should report hoax calls to the police and consider private prosecution where a conviction is likely and it is in the public interest to do so.Health minister David Lammy, making his first major policy announcement since his promotion in the May reshuffle, said that the move would help ensure that ambulance trusts are able to concentrate resources on meeting the needs of seriously injured or ill callers.England's 32 ambulance trusts are expected to reach 75% of emergency category "A" calls - which refers to serious ailments such as heart attack which need swift attention - within eight minutes. But the majority of trusts are finding it difficult to meet the target.Studies have estimated that around 40% of 999 ambulance journeys are unnecessary. A proportion of these are bogus or trivial. An expert advisory group is currently reviewing 999 call prioritisation categories to identify those conditions which can be passed on to NHS Direct.Mr Lammy said: "This is about rights and responsibilities. People have a responsibility to use NHS services in a fair way that doesn't endanger other patients."Research by the London Ambulance Service in December 2001 found that one in 10 respondents from the capital would call an ambulance if they were suffering from flu. Just under half would call 999 if they had problems getting through to their GP, while nearly a third would call the emergency service if they could not get a doctors appointment for several days.
