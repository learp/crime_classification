A shopkeeper was stabbed to death as he chased thieves who grabbed two bottles of spirits from behind his off-licence counter, police said yesterday.Mahmut Fahri, 59, was knifed in the chest as he tried to tackle the duo at his Albion store in Whittington Road, Wood Green, north London. The father of two, a Turkish-Cypriot who lived with wife Pembe in Palmers Green, raced outside to follow his attackers, before he staggered into a minicab office, bleeding heavily at about 9.15pm. He died three hours later at North Middlesex hospital. It is believed he suffered more than one knife wound in the attack, carried out by a man aged about 35 and an accomplice in his 20s. Detective Chief Inspector Dick Langley said the motive appeared to be robbery: "It is shocking to think a man has died over the theft of two bottles of alcohol." Friends said Mr Fahri was a grandfather of four and a passionate Manchester United fan, who lived a mile from the shop. Family friend Nathaniel Peter, 22, a bank worker, said: "For this to happen this close to Christmas, I just can't even begin to get to grips with it. "For someone to die over alcohol is outrageous, it's disgusting, totally disgusting. Mr Peter, who had known Mr Fahri for 11 years, added: "He was a very community-minded person and was very respected by a lot of people. He was such a good person. "He was only about 5ft 5in tall but he would have put up a fight if someone was trying to steal something because he was a man of principle. That has resulted in him losing his life." Vivian Muirhead, 59, another friend, said: "He worked so hard in his shop and I just can't believe this is real. "Whoever has done this has ripped the heart out of a community." Detectives said both suspects were described as Asian or Turkish in appearance and wore dark clothing.
