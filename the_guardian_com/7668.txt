Lisa Hayden-Johnson (Mother jailed for faking healthy son's illness, 23 January) has an extreme but textbook case of the much-derided Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Despite many claims to the contrary, this condition does indeed exist, although not usually as obviously as in this case. As a social worker I detected Munchausen syndrome and Munchausen by proxy several times. It is a serious form of child abuse and whatever it is called, eg induced illness syndrome, it is not particularly difficult to detect. I am dumbfounded that the medical staff involved did not spot the deception for such a long time. Will they be named and shamed as a social worker would be? This condition is real, not as uncommon as you may think, and extremely dangerous.Josette Morgan-CoburnPotton, Bedfordshire
