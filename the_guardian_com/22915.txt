An international concert pianist battled to protect his hands as he was surrounded and attacked in the street by a gang of hooded youths, a court heard yesterday.Karl Lutchmayer, 36, fell to the ground as a defensive move as the gang of up to seven youths punched and kicked him, having first hit him with a piece of wood.The attack occurred in daylight as Mr Lutchmayer walked to Clapham Junction station, south London, on his way to a rehearsal. The musician, who has given recitals around the world, told Inner London crown court that he offered the muggers his wallet when they blocked his path but their response was to strike him in the back and head."Being a pianist I'm very aware of looking after my hands so I dropped to the floor to protect myself," he said. "I received very savage blows, kicks, punches continuously as far as I could tell by all of the group that were standing around me."The youths went through his pockets, stealing his wallet, a suit bag and a briefcase. Mr Lutchmayer told the court that as he got to his feet one of the gang gave him "one last strong kick" to his legs. "There seemed to be a real bloodlust about the situation," he said.Mr Lutchmayer recounted the attack at the start of the trial of a 17-year-old youth, who denies robbery. The youth cannot be named for legal reasons. The jury heard that two other youths, who also cannot be named, have pleaded guilty to robbing Mr Lutchmayer. The trial continues.
