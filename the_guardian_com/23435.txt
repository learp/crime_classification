A teenage father who became irritable if he was interrupted while playing computer games killed one of his four-month-old twin sons and badly injured the other, it was alleged in court today.James Tuffs, now 21, cared for Byron and Tyrese while his girlfriend, Zoe O'Leary, now 18, looked after their daughter, Aaliyah, now two, Norwich crown court was told.In January 2004, doctors declared Byron dead after he was found "grey and floppy" at the family home in Stowmarket, Suffolk, the prosecutor, Oliver Sells QC, told jurors. The boy was found to have a fractured skull and two fractured ribs.Tests also revealed that Tyrese had a fractured skull, multiple rib fractures, a fractured arm and fractures to both legs, Mr Sells said.Medical experts had said the injuries to the children could not have been accidental, according to Mr Sells. "These very extensive and serious injuries were caused ... by this defendant," Mr Sells said. "This defendant must, for whatever reason, have operated a persistent regime of cruelty."Mr Sells told the court that Mr Tuffs and the boys lived downstairs while Miss O'Leary cared for Aaliyah upstairs. "He would look after the twins downstairs in the room where the sofa was. After changing them he spent a lot of time watching television, playing computer games late into the night."You will hear something about his moods - irritable if his computer games were interrupted, on occasion shouting. He would rather play on the computer than anything else."Tuffs denies manslaughter and cruelty. The case continues.
