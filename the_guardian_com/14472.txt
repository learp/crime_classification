The 11 members of the jury in the Mark Duggan inquest were on Monday told the key issue they may have to decide is whether his shooting dead by police was lawful or unlawful.The fatal shooting by police of Duggan, 29, in August 2011, prompted the biggest riots in modern English history.Opening the delayed inquest, the coroner, Keith Cutler, said the death was a tragedy and a regrettable loss of a young life. He held a brief moment of silence as he began the hearing the Duggan family hope will provide them answers as to why their loved one was killed.During the judge's opening remarks to the jury, Pamela Duggan, the mother of the deceased, left the courtroom in tears.Cutler told the jury their task was serious and said: "It may be the case that at the heart of your considerations will be whether Mark Duggan was killed lawfully or unlawfully."Duggan was shot dead two years ago by police after the cab he was travelling in was forced to stop in Tottenham, north London.The coroner said Duggan died on 4 August 2011 at around 6.15pm. He died on the pavement of Ferry Lane, Tottenham, where he fell after being shot.The jury were told they would hear from a police marksman, known as V53, who fired the two shots that killed Duggan, believing he was holding a gun.They will also hear from a witness who will be brought from prison. Kevin Hutchinson-Foster was convicted at an earlier criminal trial of supplying a gun to Duggan.Cutler told the jury they were engaged in a search for the truth and not to determine any civil or criminal liability. He added that no individual or organisation was on trial.The jury were told the proceedings would last between eight and 10 weeks.The hearings are taking place at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, in the same court room where the Leveson and Hutton inquiries were conducted.The coroner warned the jury not to conduct internet research into the case or discuss it with anyone, and after a issuing a series of warnings said: "I'm sorry if I sound like a grumpy headmaster with all these warnings."The inquest resumes on Tuesday with an opening from Ashley Underwood QC, counsel to the hearing, which will set out the evidence. The coroner said it was expected the jury would hear from their first witness next Monday.
