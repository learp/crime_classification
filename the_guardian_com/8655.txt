A man has been arrested after attacking two Church of England staff during a General Synod service at York Minster attended by the archbishops of York and Canterbury.The man, who is understood to be well known to local police, began shouting and swearing as the archbishops' procession entered the cathedral shortly after 10am on Sunday.After coming within yards of the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, he was approached by a steward, whom he punched. Dave Smith, a member of the archbishop of York's staff, then stepped in and was also punched by the man and left with a bloody nose.Smith sat on the man until the police arrived.The man, who is believed to have problems with drugs and alcohol, was restrained by his hands and feet and carried to a police van by eight officers. The steward and Smith were examined by paramedics but were not seriously injured, and the service was quickly resumed, with the blood mopped off the flagstones.  The man, 42 and of no fixed abode, is taken from York Minster by police officers and arrested on suspicion of assault.

Welby broke off from shaking the hands of the congregation during the sign of peace to walk over to him and ask if he was all right.A spokesman for the Church of England stressed that the incident had nothing to do with the upcoming synod vote on new legislation to introduce female bishops.A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said: "We received a call just after 10 o'clock with a report of an assault on a male at York Minster. We were there within minutes and one male was arrested on suspicion of assault."The suspect, who is 42 and of no fixed abode, remained in police custody on Sunday afternoon.
