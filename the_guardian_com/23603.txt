A second man appeared in court today charged with the double murder of French students Gabriel Ferez and Laurent Bonomo. Daniel Sonnex, 23, of Etta Street, Deptford, south-east London, is charged the killing the pair, both 23, on June 29 this year. Ferez and Bonomo were tied up and repeatedly stabbed in the head, neck and torso before the bedsit was set alight. Bonomo had been stabbed 196 times and Ferez 47 times. Security was tight as Sonnex appeared in the dock at Wimbledon magistrates court in south-west London today, handcuffed to a guard and surrounded by other officials. He waved to relatives, who were in the public gallery and spoke only to confirm his name and address, and to give his age.Three Met police officers inspected the dock before Sonnex was taken into the courtroom and they then sat in the public gallery behind the alleged killer's family. Rob Dyson, prosecuting, told the court: "Mr Sonnex is charged with the murder of two persons, two French students, both of whom were stabbed on a number of occasions."There was no application for bail and one of the magistrates, Yvonne Powell, told Sonnex he would be remanded in custody until he appears at the Old Bailey for a preliminary hearing on October 20.Nigel Farmer, 33, of no fixed address, has already been charged with the murders. Both men will face trial at the Old Bailey and also face charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice. A 35-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman arrested at an address in Streatham, south London, on Wednesday have been bailed to return on dates in July and August respectively, pending further inquiries. Bonomo and Ferez were in the second year of a masters degrees at Clermont-Ferrand Polytechnic, in the Auvergne region of central France.Both were nearing the end of a three-month research placement studying DNA at Imperial College London when they were murdered.
