Detectives have launched a murder investigation and arrested a 16-year-old and another man after a woman died following an assault at a house. Police were called to an address in Buckinghamshire on Saturday and arrested the teenager and a 21-year-old man at the scene on suspicion of murder. The victim, a 40-year-old woman who lives at the address where the incident took place, was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital with serious injuries but died shortly after 8pm. Thames Valley Police said: "We believe this was not a random attack and that both the suspects and victim are known to one another."
