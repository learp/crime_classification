The UK cannot arrest its way out of violence and should tackle the underlying causes of unrest such as racial tensions, the prime minister's new crime adviser, US "supercop" Bill Bratton, has warned.The former New York and Los Angeles police chief, who will meet David Cameron next month to share his expertise in tackling gang violence and street crime, said crime-fighting solutions that have worked in the US, such as making police forces more ethnically diverse, could get results in the UK.Bratton said British police needed to focus on calming racial tensions by working more with community leaders and civil rights groups, noting that communities could not "arrest their way out" of gang crime.Employing more police officers from ethnic minority communities was another potential long-term solution to stopping future disorder, he said."Part of the issue going forward is how to make policing more attractive to a changing population," said Bratton.Los Angeles and New York had benefited from police forces that "reflect the ethnic make-up of the cities"."Arrest is certainly appropriate for the most violent, the incorrigible, but so much of it can be addressed in other ways and it's not just a police issue, it is in fact a societal issue," he told US broadcaster ABC."It's not easy, it's hard work, but it can be done and in many respects you have to argue that it must be done because you just can't continue the way you've been going."Bratton, who is chairman of private security firm Kroll, said social media sites could be useful for law enforcement in monitoring gang activities. "The idea is to get ahead of the violence rather than just react to it," he said.Police forces should be more assertive in their dealings with offenders so criminals would "fear them" and lose confidence in their ability to commit crimes, he said in an interview with the Telegraph.Bratton advocates a doctrine of "escalating force" against criminalscalling for rubber bullets, Tasers, pepper spray and water cannon as potential weapons.Over the past two decades Bratton has gained a reputation for introducing bold measures to reduce crime, particularly in Los Angeles where he is credited with ushering in an era of safer streets and improved relations between police and communities.Civil rights attorney Connie Rice said she considered Bratton a transformative figure in the history of the LAPD, which was tarnished by the 1991 attack on black motorist Rodney King by four white police officers, leading to rioting the following year."He has a racial-justice vision that is married to effective law enforcement," Rice said of Bratton, who ran the LAPD between 2002 and 2009. "He knows how to carry out both."Bratton's initial success in reducing crime in New York relied on big increases in resources, which contrasts sharply with Cameron's pledge to stick to planned cuts in UK police budgets.Bratton recruited 5,000 new, better-trained officers to make the police more visible on the streets. This was partly funded by a new local crime tax.The chancellor, George Osborne, has indicated he backs Bratton's analysis but has reiterated that there will not be extra resources for the police."There are very deep-seated social problems which we need to tackle. There are communities that have just been left behind by the rest of the country, there are communities cut off from the economic lifeblood of the rest of the country," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.He pledged to press ahead with planned police budget cuts, claiming the debate should not be reduced to "whether there should be x-thousand numbers of police officers or x-thousand-plus-one numbers of police officers"."We want an effective police service. They have done an amazing job this week. We want to use the advice of people like Bill Bratton to really tackle some of the deep-seated social issues like gang culture."But this is not just about police budgets; this is about a far bigger challenge for our society, which is dealing with people who we have ignored for too long and helping them feel they have a stake in society."
