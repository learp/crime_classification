Police will today gain the powers to hand out £80 on-the-spot fines to adults and teenagers for vandalism, shoplifting and underage drinking, the Home Office announced.The powers coming into force today are a watered-down version of Tony Blair's original plan for teenagers to be frogmarched to cash machines to pay their fines. The fixed penalty notices - which can be challenged in court - will be issued to adults and 16- and 17-year-olds caught drinking alcohol, buying alcohol for a minor, shoplifting for the first time or causing minor criminal damage. Litter louts will also face £50 fines. A pilot scheme involving on-the-spot fines for 10- to 15-year-olds is also due to start later this year. Trials found the overall payment rate for such fines was nearly 70% - far higher than conventional court fines - and those who refuse to pay will face even higher penalties. The courts also have new powers to chase non-payers, including deductions from their earnings or benefit payments, seizing their possessions and clamping their cars. The use of on-the-spot fines for shoplifters who steal goods worth up to £200 or those who cause criminal damage valued at less than £500 has attracted criticism from retailers, who claim it will decriminalise shoplifting. To meet such concerns the Home Office announced police guidelines and said the fines must only be used for minor offences. Incidents involving aggravating factors must be prosecuted and repeat offenders will also be arrested. Ministers expect that by 2007 the police will be issuing about 50,000 on-the-spot fines a year. The Home Office minister Hazel Blears said: "These fines will make people think twice." She said fixed penalty notices saved police and court time, leaving them free to focus on serious offenders.
