Prison educators have warned they may resign if new employers worsen their pensions, the University and College Union (UCU) said today.Qualified teachers employed by further education colleges have previously provided most offender education but, from next Monday, private companies will take over some of the Offenders' Learning and Skills Service (Olass) contracts.Former college staff will be automatically transferred to contracts on the same pay and conditions but many have not received guarantees regarding their pensions.Educators transferring to one of the companies that have won contracts (known collectively as A4E) currently belong to the final-salary Teachers' Pensions Scheme (TPS), but their membership may be discontinued if the company concerned is ineligible to join the TPS.Staff are writing to MPs, and the University and College Union (UCU), which represents prison educators, has protested to the higher and further education minister, Bill Rammell, over the changes.The UCU said the Learning and Skills Council was also believed to be sympathetic to the prison educators' case.Christiane Ohsan, the UCU national official for prison educators, said: "A4E has offered stakeholder pensions that are not comparable to TPS. Another organisation that is to deliver offender learning ... has agreed to fund the employer's pension contribution so that staff can stay in the TPS - there is no reason why A4E should not match this."We hope A4E's tender - and the bid's acceptance - was not based on a calculation that the service could be supplied more cheaply by reducing staff pensions. That would send out a message that would wreck the morale of prison educators and lead to an exodus of valuable staff."With [the presence of] new contractors such as A4E - quite new to offender learning ... - and the importance of this work to government efforts to reduce offending, staff want to concentrate on their work not worry about their pensions."This is not well-paid work, and if pensions are reduced many staff may vote with their feet and seek teaching work elsewhere, where they can protect their pensions."UCU is writing to ... Bill Rammell, urging him to encourage A4E to meet the costs of the employer's contribution to enable staff to stay in the Teachers' Pension Scheme. If prison education is to avoid serious damage we need swift action by the minister."
