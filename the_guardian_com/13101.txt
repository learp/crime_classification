A man died after being attacked by robbers who wanted his BlackBerry, the Old Bailey heard today.Saravanakumar Sellappan, 24, was talking on his mobile phone metres from his home when he was spotted by three robbers. They hit him on the head and stole the phone, which they later sold for £60 and a box of takeaway fried chicken, Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting, told the court in London.Sellappan later fell into a coma and died.His BlackBerry was offered to a worker at the PFC restaurant in Thornton Heath, south London, less than three hours after the attack. One of the accused, Roshan Samedov, 18, put the sim card in his own phone and used it to make a five-minute call to a sex line, the court was told.The next day, Samedov and co-accused Awat Muradi, 18, allegedly asked for a valuation of the phone at a pawnbroker, but were refused. They returned to the PFC restaurant and sold it to a different worker, insisting that their food be part of the deal, the court heard.Jafferjee said: "This man lost his life in a robbery which netted his assailants £60, some free phone credit and a box of chicken."He said Sellappan had been walking home from work at a petrol station last October when he rang a friend. They talked for 20 minutes before he was attacked.The robbers struck after seeing him with the phone earlier.Samedov, Muradi and Jegir Ahmmadi, 20, all from Thornton Heath, deny murder and robbery.Jafferjee said the defendants blamed each other when arrested. He said Sellappan complained to friends that his head hurt but did not want the police to get involved because he might miss work.A friend took him to the Mayday hospital in Croydon but he was sent home after telling a doctor he fell downstairs.The next morning a friend found him unconscious in bed. Sellappan was taken to St George's hospital in Tooting where he died. The trial continues.
