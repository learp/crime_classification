A convicted paedophile was today jailed for life for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a three-year-old girl.The attack happened only weeks after Craig Sweeney's licence for a previous sex attack on another child had run out.Judge John Griffith Williams QC, the Recorder of Cardiff, told Sweeney he was a "devious" man and would spend five years in jail before being considered for parole.He told Cardiff crown court he posed a significant risk of re-offending and displayed all the classic characteristics of a paedophile.The family of the three-year-old girl described his sentence as "an insult".The court heard that Sweeney, who lived at Caerleon Road in Newport, South Wales, carried out the attacks on January 2 and 3 this year.It is understood he was released on licence halfway through his sentence and that his prison licence had expired at the end of December 2005 - weeks before his second offence was committed.The three-year-old's ordeal began when Sweeney snatched her from her home in Rumney, in the Llanrumney area of Cardiff, on the evening of January 2.She was only found by police when he crashed his car on the A4 between Marlborough, Wiltshire, and Hungerford, Berkshire - 80 miles away - during the early hours of the following morning.Officers in Wiltshire said they had pursued the car after seeing it jump a red traffic light with its headlights switched off.The toddler suffered minor injuries in the crash, and also required hospital treatment for other "significant" injuries.After sentencing, Detective Superintendent Paul Kemp, of South Wales police, said it had been a "particularly shocking and disturbing case".He said such child abductions were "extremely rare", and described Sweeney as a "very dangerous offender". "This has been particularly distressing for the family," he added.
