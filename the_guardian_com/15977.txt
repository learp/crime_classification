Computer-based hi-tech crime cost Britain's big companies at least £2.45bn last year, a survey revealed yesterday. Almost 90% of businesses were hit by cyber criminals at least once in 2004, with internet fraud and computer viruses among the most common types of attack. The survey also found that about half of computer-based crime last year was carried out by company insiders, usually dishonest or disgruntled employees. The research was carried out by NOP for the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit and is the first time the overall financial impact of so-called "e-crime" has been estimated.The cost to larger firms - those with more than 1,000 employees - was £2.45bn; smaller or medium-sized businesses with between 100 and 1,000 workers lost £177m.
