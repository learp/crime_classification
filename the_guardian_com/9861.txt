Local crime figures will be available and updated every month by next summer, the home secretary promised today as she unveiled a government initiative to cut crime and reassure the public.Jacqui Smith also pledged a drive to cut crime through better designed technology, so that "the iphones and sat-navs of the future are worthless to thieves".Her statement came on the day that the Home Office released the annual crime figures, which showed that crime remained stable in England & Wales, but with a 5% increase in violent crimes - according the British Crime Survey.But the range of measures was dismissed by the Liberal Democrat as a "ragbag of minor, unrelated, media initiatives" rather than an attempt to cut crime.And the Conservatives called it nothing more than a "few small steps in the right direction".David Davis, the shadow home secretary, complained: "If you can't calculate crime, you can't tackle crime." The Tories regard the British Crime Survey, based on questionnaire responses, as "flawed data" as it does not include murder, or crimes against children under 16.However, Ms Smith told MPs today: "As today's crime statistics show, we are holding the improvements to the falls in crime. But we must go further. And now is the time to reinvigorate our efforts to ensure we continue to make strong and sustainable reductions in crime."In the strategy, which will span 2008-11, Ms Smith proposed setting up a cross-Whitehall national crime reduction board, which will "lead to support and where necessary, challenge local delivery".There will also be new record kept of how confident the public are that crime is dealt with at a local level by police and other agencies.And she announced: "Working with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities we will ensure that by July next year, everyone will be able to have access to meaningful local crime information updated every month so they can see how their priorities are being tackled."Ms Smith, who this morning confessed she had tried cannabis as a young woman, announced she would visit a special session of the youth parliament this autumn to hear firsthand young people's experience of being the victim of crime.In possibly the most eye-catching initiative, Ms Smith announced that a new Design and Technology Alliance would look at ways in which crime could be "designed out" of technology devices. But there was little immediate detail on how this would be achieved.The designer who will head the design and technology alliance later told Guardian Unlimited that a variety of simple measures could in future aid crime prevention on gadgets. Sebastian Conran said: "This is really about a mix of experience, expertise and common sense. "In future it should be easy for retailers to ensure that every phone should be laser engraved on its rear with its number, so that you can have traceability with anonymity. "It's not the same as putting someone's name and address there, but it would be traceable if nicked." In her statement, Ms Smith insisted the chance of becoming a victim of crime was at "historically low levels".On violent crime, she told MPs: "We are seeing signs of real progress here and the statistics today are positive: overall violence down 31% since 1997. But we know we must do more."And she claimed the government had "revolutionised the crime-fighting landscape", adding: "We have provided record levels of funding, created new powers and partnerships, set targets."This formidable combination has seen crime fall by around a third since 1997."Car crime had halved, with 1.8m fewer incidents, she added. "On average, the chances of becoming a victim of burglary are roughly now once every 40 years compared to every 25 a decade ago."Staffing levels across the police service are at a record high at over 223,000 people and the chances of becoming a victim of crime remain at historically low levels."These are real achievements that make a real difference to people's everyday lives."
