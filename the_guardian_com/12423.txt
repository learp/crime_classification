A shopkeeper was found guilty today of blackmailing a Muslim student by convincing her she could be prosecuted for allegedly supporting terrorists.Mary Sturges, who runs a shop selling antique teddy bears, convinced Nabilah Hussain she could be in serious trouble with the police for supposedly saying that British people "deserved what they get" from terror attacks.Sturges, 53, was found guilty of extorting thousands of pounds from the 23-year-old art student and was told that a jail sentence was inevitable.Plymouth crown court heard that Sturges told Hussain that a friend had recorded remarks about terrorism and told her she would be in serious trouble with the police because of her views.She claimed to be in touch with an organisation called the Racial Equality Police and persuaded Hussain to deceive her parents to get more money.The scam lasted for six weeks with the demands getting larger and larger.Hussain was so frightened she lied to her family to get more money by telling them she had crashed into and killed a sheep on Dartmoor and needed cash to pay off the farmer.Finally Hussain's family realised something was wrong and travelled from their home in Surrey to Devon to take her home. Sturges, of Tuckenhay, near Totnes in Devon, was found guilty of three counts of deception and three of blackmail.Sentencing was adjourned and she was warned by Judge Paul Darlow that a jail sentence was inevitable.During the three-week trial Hussain told the jury she had no memory of making the remark about terrorism but Sturges insisted a friend had recorded it.Sturges posed as Hussain's protector and told her she needed to pay off the man to keep the recording out of the hands of the police.Hussain became friends with Sturges and her husband, James, when she was a student at Dartington College, near Totnes, and worked in a bistro next to the couple's shop in Totnes.She said the blackmail started after they had a row about race, religion and terrorism and that she paid around Â£8,000 over six weeks.She told the jury: "Sturges started to talk about refugees and immigrants and racial stuff and she had quite strong views."I got upset because I have worked with asylum seekers and said their life is quite tough and Sturges got really angry and she said something about all Muslims being terrorist, which made me really upset."I said Muslims do not believe in trying to hurt people. I said we believe in peace but she didn't try to understand my point of view."I got really vulnerable and really emotional and quite stressed and started to cry. Sturges was constantly making me say things I should not say."I do not remember saying it but she kept telling me I had said that the British deserve what they are getting. On the way back she told me people had heard what she claimed I had said and I was panicked and had an anxiety attack."I could not understand what I was supposed to have said. They took it wrong and misinterpreted it completely."Sturges insisted she had never asked for or received any money and said no money was paid into any of her accounts.She denied inventing stories to induce Hussain's family to transfer money to her accounts.
