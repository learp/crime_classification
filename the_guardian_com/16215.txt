Gordon Brown was accused of "monumental failures" in government and behaving like an "irresponsible opposition" today as he put the country's neediest pensioners at the heart of the government's legislative programme in the last Queen's speech before a general election.With less than seven months to go before the country must go to the polls, the prime minister used the state opening of parliament to showcase a series of initiatives designed to draw battle lines between the parties.But David Cameron, the Conservative leader, launched a scathing attack on the prime minister's record in office.Among the bills put forward by the prime minister were proposals to ensure free personal care for 280,000 elderly and disabled people with the highest need and new guarantees for parents on schooling, as well as a crackdown on "risky" bank bonuses, and legislation committing the government to halve its deficit over the next four years.Union chiefs largely welcomed the announcements, but, with parliamentary time running out, not all of the 15 bills are expected to make it to the statute book before the general election.In one of the most heavily trailed speeches in recent times, the Queen told the assembled MPs and peers: "My government's overriding priority is to ensure sustained growth to deliver a fair and prosperous economy for families and businesses, as the British economy recovers from the global economic downturn."By the active creation of jobs, restructuring the financial sector, strengthening the national infrastructure and providing responsible investment, my government will foster growth and employment."The personal care at home bill is intended to enable elderly and disabled people to remain in their own homes – rather than going into residential care – while laying the foundations for the new national care service promised by the prime minister in his party conference speech in September.Officials estimate that about 400,000 people will benefit from the measures in the bill, which will cost £670m a year to implement.They include a guarantee of free personal care at home for up to 280,000 people with the greatest needs – although 166,000 do already receive free care.A further 130,000 who need home care will also benefit for the first time from other measures including adaptations to their homes – such as the installation of electronic pill dispensers – so that they can carry on living independently for as long as possible.A financial services bill will bolster the Financial Services Authority, giving it the power to tear up bankers' contracts which could promote risky behaviour.Key banks and financial institutions will also be obliged to draw up "living wills" describing how they can be wound up without threatening the stability of the overall system.The fiscal responsibility bill will provide a "firm and binding statutory basis" for reining in the government's spiralling debt in the wake of the credit crunch and recession, according to officials.The chancellor is expected to give full details of the recovery plan and legislation when he delivers his pre-budget report next month.A children, schools and families bill will introduce so-called "MOT" licensing for teachers, extend the information on schools available for parents, and guarantee one-to-one tuition for pupils who fall behind.The Queen also announced moves to devolve more power to Scotland and Wales.The programme also included a number of previously announced measures, such as giving agency workers equal rights on pay, holidays and basic conditions, and introducing a binding commitment to abolish child poverty by 2020.There was a pledge to crack down on antisocial behaviour with compulsory parenting checks when youths are unruly.In a move that will please Labour's left, a ban on cluster munitions will be put before parliament.On the environment, legislation will be tabled to support carbon capture technology and improve flood defences.In the Commons debate that followed the speech Cameron said: "Only this prime minister could draw a dividing line and find himself on the wrong side of it."This government has been a monumental failure."Cameron said Brown had often lauded his own economic stewardship but despite his claim to have ended boom and bust, Brown had presided over the "longest, deepest recession in recent memory".Mocking Brown's self-asserted "moral compass", Cameron accused the prime minister of borrowing slogans "directly from the far right BNP" with his pledge of "British jobs for British workers" and allowing No 10 staff to smear MPs – a reference to the row over the Damian McBride affair.Cameron said the Tories had made "tough choices on public sector pay, on pensions, on benefits".To Tory cheers, he said: "What you have got in Britain today is you have got an opposition behaving like a government and a government behaving like an irresponsible opposition."He added of the Labour government: "They have run out of time, they have run out of money, they have run out of ideas and as we have just seen they have run out of courage as well."The prime minister hit back, rejecting claims that the government's legislative programme was motivated by party politics and saying that every measure announced by the opposition was a "repeat of the failed policies of the 1980s and 90s".The Tories' only definite commitment was to cut inheritance tax for the richest, with the biggest group of beneficiaries being in Kensington and Chelsea, including Notting Hill, Brown said.To Labour laughter, he added: "This must be the only tax change in history when the people proposing it – the opposition leader and the shadow chancellor – will know by name almost all of the potential beneficiaries."Is this what the Conservatives mean when they say 'we're all in this together'? Is this what they mean by the 'age of austerity'? Austerity for the many, paid for by tax cuts to the very few?"Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, praised the government for listening and taking up issues that matter to people such as care for the elderly, curbs on risk-taking and sharp practices by the financial sector, poverty and the environment.Paul Kenny, leader of the GMB union, said: "It is high time that the government took proper legal powers to cut bankers' bonuses. It is unlikely that the Tory party, which is fielding 63 bankers and financiers as candidates in the next election, will support the government on this long-overdue popular measure."Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, said: "The bill on halving the public deficit should not be seen as a green light to slash and privatise vital public services."Investment rather than cuts, combined with a drive to tackle over £100bn in uncollected, evaded and avoided tax is the best way to tackle the public deficit."
