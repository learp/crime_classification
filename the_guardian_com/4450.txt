Photograph: Leicestershire Constabulary/PAThe 38-year-old faced a doubly difficult life: as well as caring for two vulnerable teenage children, she had to cope with anxiety, depression and possible mild learning difficulties. Pilkington was unable to work during her 15 years living in Bardon Road, principally because she was responsible for her daughter Francecca. Pilkington had lived with her partner, Simon Hardwick, the father of her children, but he moved out eight years ago when their relationship broke down. Hardwick visited regularly, as did Pilkington's later partner. Her mother, Pam Cassell, 72, also lived with the family for a while. But Pilkington found herself isolated and under pressure. "Fiona couldn't defend herself. She was very shy and didn't want any trouble," Cassell said.
