A man accused of murdering a vicar and a retired teacher admitted carrying out a burglary in which a note threatening to "kill Christian scum" was pinned to the table with knives, a court has heard.Stephen Farrow, 48, admits the manslaughter of the Rev John Suddards but denies murdering the clergyman between 12 and 15 February this year on the grounds of diminished responsibility.He also denies the murder of Betty Yates between 1 and 5 January this year.Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to death at his home in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on 14 February, while Yates, 77, was stabbed at her cottage in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on 2 January.Opening the case at Bristol crown court, prosecutor Michael Fitton QC told the jury of eight men and four women that Farrow, of no fixed address, admitted a separate charge of burgling Vine Cottage in Thornbury between 21 December last year and 3 January this year.Fitton said the three charges span a period of eight weeks and that there were distinct links between them. He said the burglary was the first offence in the sequence.The jury members were shown a map of Thornbury village which illustrated the proximity of the vicarage, where Suddards's body was found, to Vine Cottage, from which cash, jewellery and a radio were stolen in the burglary.Fitton said a note was found on the kitchen table following the burglary that read: "Be thankful you didn't come back or we will have killed you, Christian scum. I fucking hate God."The prosecutor said: "There are two charges for you to decide upon. They relate to different individuals and different places."He said the first was the murder of Betty Yates, a widow who lived alone next to the river Severn. He said she was last seen alive on Monday 2 January."The defendant has pleaded not guilty to that count. He denies killing her. He denies any responsibility for her death at all," Fitton said."His case is that he was not at her house or in the area she lived on the day she died."Our case is that he was there and that he killed her and that he intended to kill her."Fitton added: "Count two is the murder of Reverend John Suddards."The defendant pleaded not guilty to that charge, but there is a significant difference in his case."Stephen Farrow admits he killed the Reverend John Suddards. What he denies is the charge of murder; he will only admit a charge of manslaughter."Fitton said Farrow was claiming a partial defence arising from his mental condition."He claims the defence of diminished responsibility. The prosecution recognise and accept the defendant has a relevant mental condition, a mental disorder, I will call it, but we do not accept that his mental disorder diminishes his responsibility for what he did to entitle him to that defence."Farrow was arrested in Folkestone, Kent, in February after a tip-off from the public following a nationwide manhunt launched by Avon and Somerset police after Suddards's body was discovered.Fitton said the first of the three offences related to the burglary, near Thornbury vicarage, at Vine Cottage.Its owners, Alan and Margaret Pinder, had spent Christmas away. When they returned home on 2 January they discovered the house had been burgled, the court heard.The court heard the home had been subject to an "untidy search", with food and drink discarded, half-eaten, in the kitchen. The contents of drawers in the home had been strewn all over the floor, Fitton added."And on the kitchen table there was a note, pinned using two kitchen knives," he said."It was written in a curious, disguised style of writing. But it is what it says that is of significance."The jury was shown an image of the note, written in capital letters in red ink, with a "squirly symbol" in the top right-hand corner.Fitton said the contents "meant nothing" to the Pinders, who are not religious.He added: "It offers a disturbing insight into the mind of whoever wrote it."The court heard there was strong forensic support that some of the boot markings discovered at the scene matched those recovered from the defendant later.Fitton said Farrow "may have contributed to the low-level DNA" on the handle of one of the knives found piercing the note.
