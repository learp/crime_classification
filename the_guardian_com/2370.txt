Police are not doing enough to protect victims of “honour-based” violence (HBV), forced marriage and female genital mutilation, according to a report by the police watchdog.The first report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) on forces’ responses to the set of crimes, which disproportionately affect women from ethnic minorities, found that only three of the 43 forces in England and Wales were adequately prepared in all areas to respond to the needs of victims and take cases through to prosecution.Inspectors found that well-trained and experienced officers who can identify and protect victims at an early stage were spread thinly, while attempts to adapt existing domestic abuse and child protection procedures could not take into account specific challenges posed by honour-based violence.

In 2014 and 2015 there were 129 successful prosecutions for HBV. In the 96 cases where prosecutions did not end with a conviction, the top reason for the cases failing was that the victim retracted the complaint.HMIC’s report raised concerns about the identification, recording and flagging of cases on police computer systems. Some forces had very limited or no capability at all to flag cases. “Without accurate data, the scale of the problem and the effectiveness of the police response to it cannot be properly assessed,” the report said. “More importantly, victims may be placed at risk if the context of their records is not clear.”In some cases, officers spoke to “precisely the wrong type of person” as they attempted to investigate the circumstances surrounding allegations, including family and community members who may have been involved in the abuse. Jasvinder Sanghera, chief executive of Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of HBV and forced marriages, said her organisation had lobbied for the inspection after a separate report on domestic violence failed to include the issue.She said: “The KN helpline receives calls every day from victims experiencing [HBV and forced marriage]. However it still is very much a postcode lottery as to if you are going to be protected or not. It remains dependent who you get on the day and their level of awareness.“Many victims are still not believed, the abuse is dealt with as cultural and the family is still deemed as the protective factor when clearly in these cases it is your family you are reporting. Victims always have multiple perpetrators who are extremely convincing and do not report these abuses. They are organised and will work collectively to deceive the police and further isolate victims.”Sanghera added: “This report is welcomed and long overdue as we continue to shift attitudes related to cultural sensitivities.”In separate research conducted by academics from the University of Bristol and published alongside the HMIC report, victims of HBV said police often found it difficult to understand their situations. One said that it seemed that officers were afraid of appearing as though they were racist.Another, a victim of both forced marriage and HBV, said she was surprised by what she faced when she came to the UK. “It really isn’t as bad [in the victim’s home country] as it is here [in the UK] with what happens to girls,” the anonymised statement said. “At least [in the victim’s home country], people are afraid that these girls might speak and ruin their reputation, so it’s a question of honour. Here no one is scared because they know they can send the girls back home, and some of the girls do just that, because like me they probably don’t know any better.”One participant suggested that authorities hand women information about their rights when they first enter the UK at ports and airports to empower them to be independent of their husbands and in-laws if they need to be.However, the research found a number of victims who had insecure immigration status and no recourse to public funds, which they felt made access to safe accommodation and support difficult.Let's stop talking about 'honour killing'. There is no honour in murder | Dexter Dias and Charlotte Proudman The chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Thomas Winsor, said: “The vulnerability of victims and potential victims of these crimes comes principally from their sense of helplessness and hopelessness, their fear or conviction that their circumstances are not or will not be understood, and the fact that the people closest to them are the people who are most dangerous to them.“Cultural traditions and sensitivities deserve and should always be given due respect. But where they operate to imprison vulnerable people behind barriers of fear and the threat or reality of violence, and facilitate or intensify crimes committed against them, such barriers must be broken. They deserve no respect at all.”A statement from the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “The report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary makes several important recommendations that underline the complexities involved in tackling honour-based abuse and violence. We are working to develop a more consistent approach to policing in this area, particularly in the early identification of victims, potential offenders and protecting vulnerable people by managing risk.”
