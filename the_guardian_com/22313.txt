Social workers in West Yorkshire could face criticism when a review into the role they and other agencies played in the life of Shannon Matthews before her kidnapping in a plot hatched by her mother is published today.Shannon's disappearance, in February 2008, sparked a £3m police operation and a nationwide search, which ended when the nine-year-old was found concealed in the base of a divan bed in a flat around a mile from her home in Dewsbury.Last year, Shannon's mother, Karen Matthews, then 33, was jailed for eight years for her part in what a judge described as a "truly despicable" plot with Michael Donovan, in whose flat the youngster was found.Reports later suggested the local Kirklees council had placed Shannon on the child protection register five years earlier, but had removed her despite concerns about the Matthews household.Shannon was kept hostage at Donovan's flat for 24 days. She had been drugged and forced to adhere to strict rules.Prosecutors said Donovan kept her imprisoned as part of a plan he and Matthews had made to claim a £50,000 reward offered by a national newspaper.The trial judge said it was doubtful whether Matthews and Donovan, who both have a low IQ, could have carried out the kidnap without other people. The court was told the ordeal left Shannon "disturbed and traumatised" and suffering from nightmares.Kirklees council launched an independent serious case review in December 2008 into any dealings its agencies had with the Matthews family.Matthews' children were placed on the child protection register five years before the kidnapping plot, but were taken off it despite concerns about violence in the household and poor living conditions, the BBC reporteded after Shannon was found.A team from the corporation's Panorama programme, which was given access to the West Yorkshire police investigation, said social workers commissioned a psychological report in December 2003, which said of Matthews: "Her ability to protect her children is compromised by her inability to successfully place the children's needs above her own."Matthews's children were removed from the child protection register by the time the report was completed, Panorama alleged.The programme claimed the children were taken off the register despite persistent concerns, which also included lack of control and poor school attendance.Other reports at the time of Matthews's conviction said social workers first became involved with the family six years earlier, but decided no further work was required in late 2005.Last week, ministers confirmed the full reports of serious case reviews into the most notorious cases of child abuse are to be published, including the one relating to Shannon.
