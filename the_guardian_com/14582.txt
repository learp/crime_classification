Barry George, who spent eight years in prison after being wrongly convicted of the murder of TV presenter Jill Dando, has lost his high court bid for compensation as a victim of a miscarriage of justice.Two judges rejected his claim that the justice secretary unfairly and unlawfully decided he was "not innocent enough to be compensated".Lord Justice Beatson and Mr Justice Irwin ruled on Friday that the secretary of state was "entirely justified in the conclusion he reached".George's solicitor, Nick Baird, said: "We are very disappointed with the judgment and we shall be applying for permission to leapfrog the court of appeal to have the matter heard before the supreme court."George, 52, sought a reconsideration of his case which could have opened the way for him to claim an award of up to Â£500,000 for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment.But the judges ruled that he had "failed the legal test" to receive compensation.Jill Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham in April 1999. George, of Fulham, west London, was convicted of the 37-year-old BBC presenter's murder in July 2001, but was acquitted at a retrial in August 2008.Friday's high-profile compensation action was one of five test cases assembled to decide who is now entitled to payments in miscarriage of justice cases following a landmark decision by the supreme court in May 2011.Decisions in all five cases to refuse payouts were defended by the current justice secretary, Chris Grayling, in a three-day hearing last October.
