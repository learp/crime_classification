Four men are being held for for questioning by police on suspicion of the murder of a man found dying in the back of a van.The men, aged 24, 26, 54 and 56, were arrested yesterday after armed officers acting on a tip-off pulled over the vehicle in Sunningdale, Berkshire, at about 1pm.Three were quickly arrested but officers had to use a helicopter to find and capture the fourth man.The man, who was believed to be in his 40s, lay dying in the back of the white Mercedes Sprinter van while officers made the arrests.When officers discovered him he was breathing shallowly and an air ambulance was called at 2pm – around an hour after the van was first stopped. Paramedics were unable to save him and he was pronounced dead at the scene.Superintendent Richard Humphrey, of Thames Valley Police, said the man was not "readily visible" and was "only found when a thorough search was undertaken".Humphrey, police commander for the Slough area, said: "At about 1pm, officers were tasked with looking for a white Mercedes Sprinter van that was believed to be travelling in the Sunningdale area of Berkshire."The officers were acting as a result of information that was given to the police, which made officers suspect that the occupants may be involved in crime."After the suspects were caught, officers returned to investigate the van and "immediately commenced first aid and called an ambulance" when they found the critically injured man, he added."This injured man was not readily visible from outside the vehicle and was only found when a thorough search was undertaken. Despite the efforts of the officers and of the paramedics this man has now died," he said.Eyewitnesses said the victim was wrapped in bags and one officer at the scene remarked that he appeared to have been tortured.Bystanders also said a sledgehammer, which may have been used to attack the victim, was recovered from the van by investigators.David Redding-Lang, 52, landlord of the nearby Sunningdale Lounge pub, said: "I was up in the office and I noticed a van being pulled to the side of the road by a patrol car."I thought it was just a minor offence – the van was a bit shabby. The next time I turned I saw the police chasing someone down the road. There were three other men on the ground. I later saw the police bring back the fourth man.""I could see a body underneath the van – the van is directly opposite and I could see the body on the floor. The person had no shoes on and was very still."Sources said Thames Valley Police will refer the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission later today. It is routine to alert the watchdog to all incidents in which someone dies following contact with police.
