A week ago, the BBC’s flagship current affairs programme in Northern Ireland, Spotlight, investigated a disgraced psychiatrist, Morris Fraser.The Paedophile Doctor told how Fraser was allowed to continue working with children after being convicted in London in 1972 of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy.He was allowed to remain in his post as a child psychiatrist at a Belfast hospital because the RUC (the Northern Ireland police force at the time) and the Metropolitan police failed to tell the hospital authorities.The programme was prompted by the findings in a research paper, “Morris Fraser, child abuse, corruption and collusion in Britain & Northern Ireland”, written by a Dublin-based journalism academic, Niall Meehan.He was, of course, gratified that Spotlight followed up on his paper and pleased that it highlighted important new information, notably the negligence of the General Medical Council (GMC) in its dealings with Fraser’s case.But time limitations, the problem that always faces TV documentary makers, prevented the programme from touching on several institutional failings.So Meehan, who heads the journalism and media faculty at Griffith College, has now made formal submissions to both the historical institutional abuse inquiry (chaired by Sir Anthony Hart) and the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (chaired by Dame Lowell Goddard).In his document, Meehan points to a disturbing series of events that suggest some kind of official cover-up. It begins with failures by both the Met police and the RUC to inform hospital authorities in Belfast about Fraser’s 1972 conviction for abusing the boy in London.At the time, Fraser was fined £50 and received a conditional discharge. Meehan notes: “The case was not reported in newspapers... He was effectively tried in secret.”He calls on the Hart inquiry to “attempt to discover why both of these things happened.” Did the police seek to “manage” Fraser’s disgrace? If so, why? Meehan suggests that Fraser may have had a relationship with the security forces, a belief reinforced by the refusal of a 2015 freedom of information request about Fraser, partly on the grounds of national security.He also contends that there was a failure by the GMC to investigate Fraser’s criminal and unethical behaviour. In 1973, after Fraser was arrested in New York with seven other men accused of abusing 15 boys, the GMC’s disciplinary committee charged him with professional misconduct.But it is Meehan’s belief that the committee not only ignored Fraser’s US arrest, it also overlooked the fact that, in the following year, he pleaded guilty to the New York offences.Instead, he argues that the GMC considered, belatedly, only the London conviction and then took “the bizarre view” that he had been involved in a single “sordid” act, having been corrupted by a drug-addicted homosexual child.Fraser accepted psychiatric treatment and this was later declared to have been successful, so he was permitted to practice without professional restriction. Meehan also castigates media in Britain and Ireland for promoting Fraser’s research - after his New York arrest - on the alleged affects of the Irish troubles on children. He also accuses journalists of failing to notice the July 1973 GMC revelation that Fraser, a convicted child abuser, was left in post for a year.For a much fuller, detailed account of Meehan’s research to the two inquiries, which includes eye-opening “mistakes” suggestive of the authorities’ turning a blind eye to Fraser’s activities, see Meehan’s submission on Spinwatch.
