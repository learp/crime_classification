New powers to enable courts to lock up persistent young offenders while they await trial will be introduced this summer, the home secretary, David Blunkett, has announced today. Mr Blunkett told a conference on youth crime in London that 12-16 year olds will be held on remand in secure accommodation if they have a history of crime. But criminal justice and children's charities warned that the move will place the prison service and the youth justice system under great pressure as they struggle to cope with the rising numbers of teenagers in secure accommodation.The measure is part of an effort to tackle street crime and so-called bail bandits - young criminals who continue to offend while out on bail. The home secretary said he was also looking for ways to detain 10 and 11-year-old offenders in secure foster homes. "We are sending out a clear warning to youngsters who think that they are above the law - you will be caught and you will be punished," said Mr Blunkett.About 600 places in local authority secure units will be made available by transferring older teenagers to young offender institutions.At present young offenders under 16 can only be held on remand if they have committed a very serious violent or sexual offence, or if they have repeatedly absconded while on bail.The home secretary said he was implementing section 130 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which extends these powers to cover those accused of crimes such as car theft and criminal damage. "One of the biggest challenges we face is how to deal with young offenders who believe that their age makes them untouchable, who flout the law, laugh at the police and leave court on bail free to offend again. The public are sick and tired of their behaviour and expect the criminal justice system to be able to keep them off the streets," said Mr Blunkett."Young offenders aged 12-16 who are charged with street crime can already be remanded to secure accommodation. This is not always the case with those charged with other types of crimes like car theft or threatening behaviour, even though these youngsters also cause untold misery.""That is why I am today closing the loophole in the law that allows these young persistent offenders to walk away from court on bail to create further havoc in the community."The new measures will be available in the government's 10 street crime areas from June and rolled out nationally in September. The 10 areas are London, Manchester, West Midlands, Merseyside, Thames Valley, Lancashire, Avon and Somerset, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire.Paul Cavadino, chief executive of crime reduction charity Nacro, warned that sending more young people to secure accommodation could be counter-productive. He said early evaluation of community-based programmes for supervising young people who are awaiting trial suggested that they were successful in reforming offenders. "The emphasis should be on expanding our capacity to deal with young offenders in the community not in detaining more of them in custody," he said.The Children's Society said the move went against the recommendation of the youth justice board, which advises the government on the youth justice system, that the courts should be sparing in their use of custody.The charity's youth justice spokeswoman Sharon Moore said the policy could result in an extra 500 young people in custody. The home secretary also announced the extension of the intensive surveillance and supervision programme (ISSP), under which repeat offenders are subject to intensive round the clock surveillance in the community.Mr Blunkett said he was planning to strengthen measures to deal with 10 and 11 year-olds who persistently commit less serious crimes and young offenders who fell outside the powers available to judges and magistrates in a criminal justice white paper later this year.In a significant shift from traditional thinking that young offenders were best left with their families whenever possible, he announced plans to hold them in secure foster homes."I'm working with the Department of Health on the expansion of operation of care orders and the way in which protective custody can be contemplated where the family has broken down; the community has not been able to intervene, and professional services have not been able to stop continuing misbehaviour," he said. "Intensive fostering is a real option which we should be exploring."Mr Blunkett also intends to extend the use of parenting orders, which compel the mothers and fathers of unruly teenagers to attend special parenting classes."I want to find a way of enabling parenting orders to be issued before bad behaviour has become criminal behaviour," he said.
