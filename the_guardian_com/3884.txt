Members of a "white witch coven" in Cornwall donned ceremonial robes and used daggers in ritualistic sex abuse of young girls, a court has heard.Peter Petrauske, 72, who allegedly told police he was high priest of the coven, and Jack Kemp, 69, were said to have been involved in criminal "pagan ceremonies" over a 30-year period.Children were plied with alcohol before being made to undress in front of a crowd of men wearing robes, it was claimed.The alleged victims, the youngest of whom aged three to five, were then abused by their tormentors before being given money and sweets to buy their silence, Truro crown court was told.When Petrauske was arrested last year, detectives discovered daggers, candles, incense and lavender at his home, the court heard.The men, both from Falmouth, deny a string of charges relating to the abuse of children from the late 1970s to 2009. Petrauske also denies one charge of rape.Police investigated last year when Kemp was arrested concerning another incident, causing rumours to spread around Falmouth and prompting the alleged victims of the historic offences to contact detectives.Jason Beal, prosecuting, said some of the assaults took the form of rituals with the young girls' wrists tied. He said a dagger had been involved and wax poured onto the bodies, according to testimony from some of the victims.One witness had told police that Petrauske claimed to be involved in a coven of white witches. Beal said: "She was taken to a house where pagans were present. Jack Kemp was present and 'German Pete' [Petrauske] was also there. She was given alcohol, told to dance and take her clothes off."The trial, expected to last about four weeks, continues.
