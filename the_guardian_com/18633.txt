A former cage fighter who masterminded the Britain's biggest cash robbery has been sentenced to 10 years in a Moroccan jail.Lee Murray, 30, fled to north Africa four days after the gang got away with £53m in a robbery on a Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent in 2006.Murray's father was Moroccan and he claimed nationality in the north African country, avoiding extradition to the UK.But yesterday Kent police confirmed that he had been successfully prosecuted for his part in the robbery and would serve 10 years in jail.The details of the charges Murray had faced in Morocco remained unclear tonight.Detective Superintendent Mick Judge said: "I'm pleased Murray will now begin serving a significant prison sentence for his part in the Tonbridge robbery."Officers investigating the £53m robbery have put six men before the courts in the UK and they have been sentenced to a total of 156 years imprisonment."Last June the Moroccan authorities refused to extradite Murray, originally from Sidcup, after establishing his Moroccan nationality.Since then UK detectives have worked closely with their overseas colleagues to ensure Murray does not escape justice. He has been held in prison since his arrest at a shopping centre several months after the raid and has already served time for drug-related offences.Posing as police officers, the gang stole what was described as a "king's ransom" in February 2006. They were forced to leave behind a further £153m because they could not fit any more into their lorry.During the raid the manager of the depot, Colin Dixon and his family were kidnapped at gunpoint, and CCTV footage shows the gang wearing balaclavas and holding guns, including a shotgun and an AK-47 assault rifle, threatening to kill staff in the depot if they did not co-operate.Murray, the ringleader, had been one of the world's leading cage fighters, earning £30,000 a bout at events, the Old Bailey heard.Four days after the raid Murray and fellow gang member Paul Allen fled to Morocco where they hoped to live on the proceeds. The court heard that in a spending spree Allen and Murray bought villas, drugs and jewellery, and spent thousands of pounds on plastic surgery for their partners.After they were caught Allen was extradited back to Britian and, in October 2009, he was sentenced to 18 years at Woolwich crown court after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to possess a firearm. Allen pleaded guilty on the basis that he was not at the depot on the day of the robbery or part of the gang who kidnapped the manager and his family.Det Sup Mick Judge said: "I'm pleased that Murray, who played a key role in the conspiracy to kidnap the Dixons and rob the depot, has now been held accountable."Stuart Royle, 49, Lea Rusha, 35, Jetmir Bucpapa, 26 and Roger Coutts, 30, each received minimum prison terms of 15 years for their part in the robbery. Emir Hysenaj, the inside man, was jailed for 20 years.
