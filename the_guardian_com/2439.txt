Plans to allow men who beat their partners or former partners to escape custody by pleading remorse have been dropped in guidance for judges on sentencing for domestic violence. The Sentencing Guidelines Council had originally proposed that remorseful offenders could be punished with a community order or a suspended sentence. But the final guidance, published yesterday, omits the suggestion, after protests from the Home Office minister, Lady Scotland, and women's groups.The council, whose guidance will be relied on by judges in England and Wales in passing sentence, said: "It was pointed out that remorse is impossible to measure - particularly in light of the recognised domestic violence cycle of violence followed by remorse - and that reference to remorse should be deleted." Judges are now told to treat domestic violence as seriously as violence elsewhere and to sentence accordingly. Serious violence normally calls for a jail sentence, it says.However, while remorse is no longer a factor, judges may pass a non-custodial sentence if satisfied that both parties genuinely want to try to save their relationship, and that the victim will not be put at risk of further violence. Judges are also told to bear in mind that a victim who pleads for mercy for her abuser may be acting under pressure from the offender.The guidelines say domestic violence may be more serious than other violent crimes because of aggravating factors, such as abuse of trust, the impact on children or forcing the victim to leave home.Judges are told to consider the victims' vulnerability when sentencing offenders, including cultural, religious, language or financial factors. A victim should be regarded as "particularly vulnerable" if she was pregnant at the time of the assault.Claims by abusers that they were provoked should be treated with great care, the guidance says. "Provocation is likely to have more of an effect as mitigation if it has taken place over a significant period of time."
