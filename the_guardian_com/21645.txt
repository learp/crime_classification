A music teacher is being questioned on suspicion of murder after police searching his home found the body of a missing woman stuffed into a suitcase in the garage.Marie Stewart, 30, a classroom assistant and the mother of two children, was last seen almost two months ago. Her body was found in the village of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire. Police are investigating claims her mobile phone was used and her Facebook page updated to make it appear she was alive.Police from West Yorkshire police's homicide and major inquiry team have been given more time to question her partner, Andrew Lindo, 28, about her death.Lindo, believed to be a teacher at a drama school in Barnsley, is understood to have been living in the couple's rented townhouse with another woman. The couple's two children, who are thought to be aged three and one, were also living there.Officers found the body in a basement garage at the house in Perseverance Place, Holmfirth, on Sunday. Her family had contacted police the day before because they had not seen her since Christmas.Her body is understood to have been so badly decomposed that it was possible formally to identify the remains only through checks against dental records.Scene-of-crime officers have been searching the house for clues while a forensic tent stands in front of the garage to protect evidence. Several cars have been removed from the estate, located between Holmfirth and Holmbridge, for further scientific analysis.Neighbours said they had noticed a foul smell coming from the house in the days before the body was found.One said: "It's just awful this has happened. I know they had two young children and I just feel really bad for them. It makes me cringe to think that there might have been a dead body in that garage for weeks. It's just shocking."Other neighbours said they were stunned at the news because they had been told Stewart had left Lindo and moved away.West Yorkshire police said they could not confirm who had been arrested or who had been living at the house.The spokesman said: "The body can now be confirmed as that of 30-year old Marie Stewart, of Perseverance Place, Holmfirth."A postmortem examination carried out on Monday revealed that the cause of death was "multiple stab wounds and blunt force trauma", he added.
