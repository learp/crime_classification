Prosecutors pledged to deal more effectively with domestic violence cases with the publication yesterday of new guidelines, including advice on when to go to court even if the alleged victim wants the charges dropped.The Crown Prosecution Service booklet advises on how best to ensure the safety of victims and children and how to deal sensitively with victims from different cultural backgrounds and those in same-sex relationships. Two women a week are murdered by current or former partners, and domestic abuse accounts for 16% of all violent crime in England and Wales. British Crime Survey figures show there are almost 13m incidents against women and 3m against men every year. The CPS pursued 30,000 cases last year.Harriet Harman, the solicitor general, said the CPS guidance was a recognition that domestic violence was a key criminal justice issue. In the past, if a victim wanted a case dropped, it was. But in the last few years, the CPS has compelled some victims to give evidence. Victims are often the only witnesses to domestic assault, though forcing them to testify against their will, under threat of contempt of court, is rare and controversial. But Ms Harman said prosecutors had to consider the wider public interest - not only the victim's safety, but the impact on children and any future partners the abuser might go on to attack. However, the CPS is also exploring effective ways to present evidence from relatives, friends, neighbours and children, and allowing victims anonymity in certain circumstances.
