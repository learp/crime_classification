A man was sentenced to indefinite detention today after he admitted stabbing a priest to death outside his vicarage.In March, Geraint Evans, 24, repeatedly knifed Father Paul Bennett at St Fagan's Church, Trecynon, Aberdare in south Wales.Evans, of Maes Rhydwen, Trecynon, was sentenced to indefinite detention at Ashworth Special Hospital after admitting to the manslaughter of Father Paul.The priest lived at the vicarage with his wife Georgina, children Emma and Nigel and grandson John.Prosecuting QC, John Jenkins, told Cardiff Crown Court that Father Paul was attacked as he stepped outside his home to put out the rubbish.He said: "It is apparent he immediately ran away from the direction of the front door. He probably did that to protect his family."His son Nigel, who was in the living room, saw his father running that way with the defendant in pursuit."The defendant stabbed him in the back while he was trying to run away. He had six stab wounds in his back."Mr Jenkins said three separate psychiatric reports on Evans following the attack found he was likely to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.Toxicology reports revealed he had traces of alcohol, cannabis and by-products from butane gas in his body. Judge Nicholas Cooke QC said Evans admitted to long-term cannabis use.The court heard the murder weapon was a seven-inch combat-style knife that Evans bought from an army surplus shop in Pontypridd, about a year before the stabbing.In interviews after his arrest, Evans admitted he stabbed Father Paul in the head, adding: "He deserved it."Evans said: "I tried to preach to him. He had it coming. I am here because I came with the intent to kill and I executed it."
