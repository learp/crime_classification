A nationwide "deradicalisation" programme is being developed to tackle people who have been drawn into Islamist violent extremism in Britain, the government will reveal today.The Home Office said the strategy was needed to help bring back those who had "already crossed the line" in terms of ideology and outlook, but not yet committed any clear criminal offence.The local schemes involved so far aim to reverse the process of radicalisation possibly through mentoring those involved: "Nationally we are developing a UK deradicalisation programme," says the government's new strategy document on preventing violent extremism published today. "That involves learning from overseas, from other professions, and through pilot programmes. We recognise that more specialised techniques are likely to be necessary but a key element of this approach is for local partners to identify and work with organisations that may be able to provide this capacity."It cites the example of a community based programme in Leicester that is already mentoring "vulnerable individuals" using techniques including encouraging them to feel more valued and to eradicate myths and assumptions which have led to them becoming alienated and disempowered.One potentially controversial element of the new document states that it is "an important assumption" of this diversionary work that vulnerable individuals involved will not face prosecution. "We do not want to put through the criminal justice system those who are vulnerable to, or are being drawn into, violent extremism unless they have clearly committed an offence," the report says. "It is vital that individuals and communities understand this and have the confidence to use the support structures that we shall be developing."The new guidance to local authorities also sets out a range of factors, based on case histories of those involved in past terrorist attacks, that may leave a person more susceptible to exploitation by violent extremists. The profile includes those who have experienced trauma through migration or asylum; those who have gone through a personal crisis such as divorce, family estrangement or time spent in prison; and those frustrated by having a job way below their perceived skills or education.But it can also include those who espouse a religious doctrine to escape from a criminal past or use it to justify ongoing criminal activity.Nevertheless the government's counterterrorism experts acknowledge that real or perceived grievances about official policy, particularly foreign policy, discrimination or racism, and counterterrorism measures themselves, can also contribute. Another potential factor is a lack of trust in British political structures to represent their interests.The document publicly confirms for the first time an attempt within Whitehall to map the country by the religious denominational background of the population, to better understand where radicalisation is taking place. However, last month's attempted bomb attack in Exeter, which does not have a significant Muslim population, demonstrates the limits of this approach.The plan is accompanied by the announcement today of an extra £12.5m for the "prevent strategy" to tackle radicalisation in communities, on top of the £40m already spent. So far, 200 projects in 70 local authority areas have received funding.A shorter document published today outlining the "prevent strategy" acknowledges that other extremists such as rightwing groups pose a threat, but says the most dangerous are those who distort Islam to attempt to justify murder. A key element of the strategy is to "facilitate debate and amplify mainstream voices" against Islamist extremists.Ministers say they do not seek to change any religion. Nevertheless the document adds: "However, where theology is clearly distorted to justify violent extremist rhetoric or activity and threaten both Muslims and non-Muslims, government should reinforce faith understanding and thereby build resilience." One product of this approach has been the official support for the Radical Middle Way website, which provides a platform for Muslim scholars to speak to young British Muslims. The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said the aim of the strategy was to stop people getting involved in extremist violence.She said: "Only by working together and building on our shared values can we prevent terrorism in the first place. We are investing at local level to build resilient communities, which are equipped to confront violent extremism, and support the most vulnerable individuals."Smith also discloses today the 24 police forces that will share the 300 extra specially trained counterterrorism officers that she announced during the local elections campaign in April.
