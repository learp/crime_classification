A white supremacist arrested by chance at a railway station was "on the cusp" of launching a campaign of terrorism, the Old Bailey in London heard today.Neil Lewington had developed a bomb factory in his bedroom at his parents' home and aimed to target "those he considered non-British", jurors were told.He had an "unhealthy interest" in the London nail bomber, David Copeland, America's Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh, the court heard.Lewington, 43, was arrested at Lowestoft station in Suffolk last year after abusing a female train conductor. He was found to be carrying the component parts of two "viable improvised incendiary devices", the court was told.Later searches of his home revealed a notebook entitled Waffen SS UK Members' Handbook, containing drawings of electronics and chemical mixtures.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, said: "The effect of these finds is to prove that this man, who had strong if not fanatical rightwing leanings and opinions, was on the cusp of embarking on a campaign of terrorism against those he considered non-British."Lewington, who lived with his parents in Tilehurst, Reading, Berkshire, is accused of preparing for terrorism by having bomb parts in a public place.He also faces two charges of having articles for terrorism including weedkiller, firelighters and three tennis balls, plus two charges of having documents for terrorism and another of collecting information for terrorism.Two further counts allege he possessed an explosive device "with intent to endanger life" and that he had explosives, namely weedkiller.He denies all eight charges.Lewington had travelled to see a woman in Lowestoft on 30 October when he was arrested after drinking and smoking on the train and urinating in public, the court heard. He was arrested for a public order offence and his bag was searched.Altman said: "The defendant had in his possession the component parts of two viable improvised incendiary devices, which, if assembled together, would have created devices which, if ignited, would have caught alight and caused flames and fire."Later searches of the house where the defendant lived revealed nothing short of a factory for the production of many such similar devices."In addition to all of that the police discovered evidence that the defendant sympathised with and quite clearly adhered to white supremacist and racist views."Lewington had two video compilations of footage about bombers and bombings.Altman said: "In addition to his extreme views on race and ethnicity, the defendant had an unhealthy interest in bombers as well as bombings. Lewington was someone who had taken his interest and his practical skills far beyond the mere intellectual or academic levels."The court was told Lewington left school at 16 without qualifications but had worked in a number of electronics jobs. He had been unemployed for 10 years after being sacked for being drunk.He lived with his parents but had not spoken to his father for 10 years. His mother said he had placed Plasticine in the keyhole of his bedroom so no one could see inside.Lewington had met women after talking on mobile phone chatlines. Altman said. One woman was put off by him when he said "the only good Paki is a dead Paki" and he would not hit a woman but would "make an exception for a Paki".He said he was a member of the National Front and wanted the Ku Klux Klan brought back, it was alleged.Another woman said he bought a child's chemistry set from Toys R Us and told her he could make explosives using it and household items, said Altman. "He said he had made tennis ball bombs and taken them to the woods to explode them. Lewington was found in possession of three tennis balls and a diagram showing how to convert them into shrapnel bombs."Another girlfriend said he spoke of making bombs and asked at which house in her street an Asian family lived."He explained how he could throw a tennis ball bomb or place it somewhere and then run away," Altman said.
