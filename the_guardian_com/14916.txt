Seven people, including five Britons, were arrested after a fishing boat carrying £22m worth of hashish was seized off the coast of Spain, authorities said today.The fishing boat, named Squilla, is being towed to the southern port city of Cadiz where it is expected to arrive later today. Authorities believed the drugs came from Morocco and were bound for Britain. Four crew members - two Britons, a Spaniard and an Estonian - were arrested early on Sunday when police boarded the British-flagged boat in international waters. Eight tonnes of hashish were found onboard, according to a statement from the Interior Ministry of Spain. Three other Britons were detained in Glasgow on suspicion of leading the drug trafficking ring, the ministry said. More arrests were expected both in Scotland and Spain. The hashish had a wholesale value of €11m (£7.4m) and a street value in Britain of around €33m, the ministry said. During the raids, police also seized large sums of money and documentation.Spanish authorities said they had disrupted an international drug trafficking network based in Scotland as part of an operation which began three months ago. Operation Bouzas was jointly planned with British police under the auspices of the EU's Eurojust agency, the ministry said. Strathclyde police said they were aware of an operation being carried out in conjunction with Spanish authorities but they were awaiting information and could not give details at this stage. Spain's interior ministry would only give initials of those arrested on the boat - the two Britons were PDA and RW, and the Estonian and Spaniard were PA and MDS respectively.
