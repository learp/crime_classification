Students were in fear tonight following the "gruesome" discovery of two bodies at a flat.A man and woman - both Chinese nationals - had suffered significant head injuries and were found on beds in separate rooms of a downstairs flat in Newcastle upon Tyne's West End by police yesterday afternoon.The nature of the attack meant police would not speculate on what caused the injuries, and post mortem examinations were being held to establish the cause of death.Northumbria police said the bodies had not been formally identified and relatives were yet to be contacted.It is expected the force will reveal more details about the murders tomorrow.The unexplained murders left other Chinese students living in fear.Ishaopeng Wu, 31, said he had been attacked himself by local youths in the past.The mobile communications student, who is a member of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, said: "I am very shocked, I cannot see if we should live in this area any more."It is a tough area, but convenient for the university. I cannot believe this has happened."Wu, who has lived in the West End for four years and attends Newcastle University, added: "As Chinese students we do not have any affairs with other people."We are far away from home and we live in a strange area. I want to know why this happened."Sometimes local children attack us, I don't know whether it is because we come from another country."Sheik Asadujjaman, 23, a student living two doors away from the flat, said the murdered male student was aged about 30.He had only seen him once, driving a red sports car, around a month ago.A source said the crime scene was "gruesome".The bodies were removed last night.Forensic experts wearing white protective suits watched as a silver hatchback was loaded onto a covered police lorry yesterday.Others returned to the flat today to carry out more searches of the two-bedroom flat, while uniformed colleagues carried out house-to-house inquiries.Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, a senior murder investigator, was at the scene talking to officers.Croydon Road, which is in the heart of a multi-cultural area of terrace streets and is popular with students, was cordoned off.
