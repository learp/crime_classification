Simon Jenkins' proposals for a new approach to crime reduction (Comment, November 30) could well run into the sand because of his over-optimism on community sentences. Unfortunately, community sentences do not "have a reoffending rate well below" that of prisons. For example, 69% of those serving community sentences for robbery reoffend compared with 53% who are imprisoned. Seventy-five per cent of young offenders placed on an electronic tag were reconvicted within a year, compared with 69% of all young offenders who serve custodial sentences.A better sentencing policy can't be built on false confidence in non-custodial sentences. Reformed prison regimes, focusing on drug rehabilitation, education and work, are more likely to reduce reoffending. That said, certainly new technology should be investigated, but on the evidence of current schemes, increasing the use of non-custodial sentences will endanger public safety without improving rehabilitation. Blair Gibbs ReformAmerica, with 2.1 million prisoners, provides a cautionary example of just where our obsession with imprisonment could lead. The "land of the free" imprisons proportionately more of its people than any other nation. Despite accommodating just 5% of the global population it incarcerates a quarter of the world's prisoners. Trends in US offending are not dissimilar to those in Europe, yet its prison sentences continue to lengthen while the inmate population grows. With three murders every hour, a rape every five minutes and a robbery every 49 seconds, US citizens hardly sleep safer in their beds. When will we ever learn that tougher crime control polices are ineffectual in reducing crime? Michael Teague Senior lecturer in Criminology, University of Teesside
