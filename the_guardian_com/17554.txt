  Gary Cooke leaves Chelmsford Crown Court today. Photograph: John Stillwell/PAThe father of a seven-year-old girl killed in a head-on collision while riding a quad bike was today given a nine-month suspended jail term after admitting his daughter's manslaughter.Gary Cooke, 46, was also banned from riding quad bikes on public roads for two years. The jail term would be suspended for two years, the judge, Christopher Ball QC, told Chelmsford crown court.Cooke's daughter, Elizabeth, died after a crash with a Range Rover on Boxing Day evening last year, near her family home in Blackmore, Essex.She and her brother Jack, 10, had been riding the quad bikes, which they had been given for Christmas, behind another Range Rover driven by their father Cooke, 46. While driving down a country lane, Elizabeth's bike collided with a vehicle driven by a 28-year-old woman, which was heading in the opposite direction.The seven-year-old suffered multiple injuries and died in hospital. Her brother was unhurt. The woman driver was arrested but was later told she would not face charges.Judge Ball said Cooke had been "grossly negligent" and "stupid"."I don't suppose I am alone in remembering the shock of hearing the news on the radio when this happened," said the judge."I don't suppose I was alone in immediately thinking 'what sort of a fool would allow his child out in such circumstances'. It was a moment of great folly and the consequences will remain with you for ever."The judge said he had received many letters of support from Cooke's relatives and friends. He added that Cooke had acknowledged his "stupidity" from the outset.It is illegal for anyone under 16 to ride a quad bike on a public road.
