People in the north and west of England and Wales are more than twice as likely to need treatment because they have been assaulted as those in the east or south, a new study has shown.Researchers who analysed visits to accident and emergency departments over the past five years found huge regional disparities in the numbers who had suffered violence. "Violence is more of a problem from a health perspective the further north and west you go," said Jonathan Shepherd, of the University of Wales College of Medicine. In the north-west, the worst-affected area, 1% of the population needs to visit hospital each year following an assault, while in the east it is a mere 0.28%. The statistics, published in this month's British Journal of Criminology, show that men are three times as likely as women to go to hospital with an injury caused by assault. Young people are more likely to be affected than older people.
