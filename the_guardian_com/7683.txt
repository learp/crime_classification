Detectives warned yesterday that a man believed to have carried out five random knife attacks could strike again.Four men remained in hospital yesterday after being stabbed in seemingly unprovoked attacks in Paisley and Renfrew, both in Renfrewshire. One man is in a serious condition. Four of the five were attacked in just over an hour. Three had just stepped off buses. Police were yesterday interviewing drivers and tracing passengers. The man believed to be responsible for the attacks is described as in his mid-20s to early 30s. Detectives said he was highly dangerous and should not be approached. His first victim, a 29-year-old man, was stabbed as he left a bus in Pine Street. Within minutes, a 30-year-old man was attacked as he entered Paisley's Piazza shopping centre. The third victim, aged 55, was stabbed as he walked along Paisley High Street. The fourth, 44, was attacked after leaving a bus in the Garrowhill area of the town. These attacks took place between 4.10pm and 5.15pm on Wednesday. A police spokeswoman said the final attack had been on a 26-year-old man in the Kind Man pub, in Renfrew, shortly before 9.30pm. She added: "These seem to be five random attacks. Inquiries are at an early stage but at this time the incidents would appear to be linked." The suspect is described as white, about 1.89 metres tall (6ft), and scruffy with short dark hair. He was wearing a dark bomber-style jacket and dark jeans.
