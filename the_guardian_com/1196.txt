Jamaican police today reiterated that they were continuing to treat the death of the Pakistan cricket coach, Bob Woolmer, as murder.Karl Angell, the force's head of communications, described weekend reports that the 58-year-old coach had died of natural causes as "unhelpful", and said the Jamaica constabulary force (JCF) was conducting an "extensive and thoroughly professional investigation" into the death.Woolmer, a former England batsman, was found dead on March 18, the day after Pakistan crashed out of the Cricket World Cup in Jamaica.Although an initial post-mortem was inconclusive, a second examination found that he had been strangled."That will remain our position until such time as the results of the investigation are known, including the forensic and pathology analysis," Mr Angell said in a statement."The speculation made in Sunday's newspapers is part of a series of unhelpful reports that have appeared in the media throughout the duration of this investigation."The JCF would again urge the media to refrain from speculation because of the additional distress it places upon the Woolmer family and the fact that it can hinder the progress of the investigation."Yesterday, the News of the World said Mark Shields, the officer leading the investigation, was flying to South Africa to tell Woolmer's widow that he had died of natural causes, pending further toxicology reports.Last week, Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper reported that Pakistani investigators doubted whether Woolmer had been killed, forcing the JCF to defend its inquiry.The Metropolitan police, which has sent investigators to help with the investigation, declined to comment on the latest reports and said it would not discuss an analysis of toxicology tests conducted on behalf of Jamaican authorities."This is an inquiry being conducted by the Jamaican authorities," a Scotland Yard spokesman said. "It's down to them to comment on developments."
