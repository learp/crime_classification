A man who battered his mother's ex-boyfriend before cramming the body into a chest freezer was jailed for life yesterday for murder.Matthew Roberts, 27, repeatedly punched David Heal, 64, in the face. The body was found more than a week later and police were unable to say if Heal was dead or alive when he was put in the freezer. Roberts tried to blame the killing on his mother, Lorraine Harvey, 52. But while in prison he wore a T-shirt bearing the slogan: "I freeze old people." Bristol crown court was told that in January 2004 Roberts went to stay with Heal and his mother in Paulton, Somerset. During his time there Ms Harvey ended the relationship with Heal and moved out, leaving her son living with her ex-lover. On January 4 Roberts and Heal, a parish councillor, were seen in a pub, apparently getting along well. But later that evening when they returned to Heal's house he made a rude remark about Roberts' mother. Roberts retaliated by punching Heal three times in the face, knocking him unconscious. He stuffed Heal's body into a chest freezer and fled to Manchester, using Heal's credit card to spend Â£1,300 on computer games, clothes and three mobile phones. Judge Tom Crowther said Roberts should serve at least 12 years in jail.
