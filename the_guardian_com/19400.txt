The family of the great train robber Ronnie Biggs was hopeful today that he might be released after being granted permission to challenge the decision to refuse him parole.His legal adviser, Giovanni di Stefano, said the high court had granted Biggs permission for a judicial review of the decision by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, earlier this month to refuse to accept a parole board recommendation to free Biggs on the grounds that he was "wholly unrepentant" about his crimes.In addition to the judicial review decision, the Ministry of Justice confirmed that it had received an application from the family to release Biggs from prison on compassionate grounds because he was suffering from severe pneumonia.The family wrote to Straw asking him to end "further procrastination" as the 79-year-old's life hung in the balance. Doctors at Norfolk and Norwich University hospital have said he has "little hope of recovery". They have agreed with his son, Michael, that Biggs will not be resuscitated if his heart stops. Biggs, who turns 80 next week, was transferred from Norwich prison to hospital on Tuesday.He is fed through a tube and communicates by pointing at letters on a card. In recent years he has suffered strokes, leaving him unable to eat, speak or walk.Prison Service officials are aware that "time is an issue" for Biggs. But Straw has remained unmoved by pleas in the past.Dr Helen May, who is responsible for Biggs's care, said he "remains frail and in poor condition" although he was a "little brighter". In a letter about his condition, she said: "On July 28 Mr Biggs was unresponsive and unable to communicate." He had little hope of recovery because of his frailty and poor nutritional status.Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: "Prison comes as a harsh double punishment for people who are frail, elderly or disabled."Instead of standing back and watching Ronnie Biggs die a bleak death in jail, the justice secretary could take this opportunity to show compassion and also to review the care and management of other old prisoners suffering in similar circumstances."Biggs, from Lambeth, south London, was a member of the 15-strong gang that attacked the Glasgow to London mail train at Ledburn, Buckinghamshire, in August 1963 and made off with Â£2.6m in used banknotes.He was given a 30-year sentence but after 15 months he escaped and spent more than 30 years on the run, living in Australia and Brazil before returning to the UK voluntarily in 2001 for medical treatment.Earlier requests for release on compassionate grounds were refused in 2006 and 2007 and last month.
