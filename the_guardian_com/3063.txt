A jury has retired to consider its verdict on a 59-year-old man accused of murdering three men in 1994.The jury sitting at Birmingham crown court has heard more than a month of evidence about the deaths of Trevor Bradley, Brian Coles and Bernard Czyzewska, whose bodies were found in the Shropshire area.It is alleged that the three men were unlawfully killed by Robin Stanislaw Ligus between April and November 1994.The jury has been told that Ligus, who was deemed unfit to plead to the charges, is serving a life sentence for murdering a pensioner in Shrewsbury in 1994.The defendant, who was living in Middletown Square, Shrewsbury, at the time of the deaths, is alleged to have killed Bradley near Melverley by knocking him out with a blow to the head and setting his car on fire.Coles is alleged to have been killed during a burglary at his home, while the Crown claims Czyzewska drowned after being thrown into the river Severn from a bridge in Shrewsbury.
