A chef who murdered his former wife after she taunted him on the social networking site Facebook about child support payments was jailed for life today.Adam Mann, 29, used a hammer to batter Lisa Beverley, 30, before slashing her neck with a knife, the Old Bailey was told.He left his former partner in a pool of blood, where she was found by the couple's five-year-old son, in a scene of "unimaginable horror", the court heard.Beverley had 18 broken ribs and had no chance of survival after being hit repeatedly on the face, head, neck and over her body, the court heard.Mann will have to serve a minimum of 24 years for the murder, which was carried out at their home in Plumstead, south-east London, last September.Sentencing judge Paul Worsley said that Mann had been involved in a dispute with the Child Support Agency (CSA) on the day of the murder, which he described as "a truly dreadful killing"."You desperately tried to avoid responsibility for your son. I have no doubt you wanted to remove any further claim by removing Lisa Beverley," said the judge."You have shown no flicker of remorse. I reject the suggestion that there was any degree of provocation."The court heard Beverley had called Mann "a joke" on the social networking site, after chasing him for child support payments over several years. The couple had been engaged in a bitter dispute since the couple divorced in 2007, and had escalated in the weeks leading up to her death.Beverley was trying to get Mann to contribute towards raising their son, through the CSA. She told the agency he had lied about being unemployed and the agency sent him a letter demanding payments of about Â£400.The day before her death, Beverley's Facebook profile was updated to say: "Now whose laughing? U've got done big time by the CS, so now leave us alone for good, your son hates u and so do I."She later added: "He is a joke."Hours before the victim's death, Mann telephoned the CSA saying he had no money and would not pay, said Jeremy Donne QC, prosecuting.Beverley's body was found the next day by her son in the living room of her house. The child called his grandfather, Stephen Beverley, as he had been taught to do if his mother went into a diabetic coma."The scene that confronted him, and that had been found by his five-year-old grandson, was one of unimaginable horror," said Donne."His daughter lay in a pool of her own blood on the floor of her living room. She had been savagely beaten and stabbed to death."Mann, of Springfield Road, Welling, Kent, was found guilty in August of murdering Beverley on 15 September last year.The couple's relationship had become increasingly acrimonious after their divorce, added Donne."The relationship had deteriorated sharply. Contact between the two, by 2009, had become increasingly bitter," he said.
