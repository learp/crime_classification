An experienced ferry officer accused of leaving three yachtsmen to die after his ferry hit or swamped a vessel was today cleared of manslaughter.Michael Hubble, 62, from Folkestone, Kent, said the 37,000-tonne Pride of Bilbao had missed a small boat which had passed close by on the night the yacht Ouzo vanished in August last year.Hubble, who has 42 years of experience at sea, told the court the P&O ferry, on which he was the officer of the watch, had been forced to carry out a last-minute manoeuvre. But he was certain the other boat was safe as he had seen its lights when he looked back.He repeatedly said that he would have gone to help if he had thought the vessel he had encountered was in danger.The prosecution insisted the vessel was the yacht Ouzo.Friends Rupert Saunders, James Meaby and Jason Downer died after it vanished in the Solent en route from the Isle of Wight to a regatta in Devon. The three men were school and university friends.Experienced sailor Saunders, from Tooting, south London, was the owner and skipper of the Ouzo, which was 24 years old but well-maintained and equipped.Meaby, also from Tooting, and Downer, from Kent, were also experienced sailors. All three were wearing lifejackets.Meaby, 36, lived for as long as 12 hours, while 35-year-old Downer and Saunders, 36, survived for at least three hours before succumbing to hypothermia, it was claimed.Hubble's defence team argued that the vessel that came close to the Pride of Bilbao was not the Ouzo, which it claims came close to a tanker, the Crescent Baune, that was in the area at the time.The prosecution alleged that the 7-metre (22ft) Ouzo was hit or swamped by the ferry but, rather than stopping or alerting the coastguards, Hubble "crossed his fingers" and the Pride or Bilbao continued to Spain.The jury at Winchester crown court, which is still considering separate charges against Hubble under the Merchant Shipping Act of engaging in conduct as a seaman that was likely to cause death or serious injury, has been sent home for the night. It will continue its deliberations tomorrow.
