Another strand of the police's long-running undercover infiltration of political groups appears to be slowly unravelling.Yesterday, Theresa May, the home secretary, unveiled the scope of an independent review. (See here for the announcement, with coverage here in the Guardian and here by the BBC).It will examine whether more campaigners have been unjustly convicted because crucial evidence gathered by undercover police may have been concealed from their trials.Potentially this could lead to a significant number of convictions being overturned.‬This latest review will be led by Mark Ellison, the QC who concluded in March that Scotland Yard's undercover unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, had spied on the family of murdered teenager, Stephen Lawrence.‬This new review by Ellison has an interesting genesis. While Ellison was examining claims surrounding the Lawrence controversy, he seems to have come across other things that left him concerned.‬Although expressed in lawyerly tones, it is striking that he seems to have gone out of his way to make public his concerns and flag them up to the home secretary. To her credit, May responded by asking Ellison to start this new review.‬The concerns are described in the report he produced in March into the Lawrence controversy (see pages 274/5 here) in what he politely calls a "postscript on undercover policing".‬Ellison describes how the police enveloped the undercover infiltration in an 'extraordinary level of secrecy' to prevent it being exposed.‬Blaming not just the SDS but the 'wider' Metropolitan Police, he says that the undercover police operated as if they were exempted from the legal rules requiring them to disclose evidence to ensure fair trials.‬He says that undercover officers in the SDS - 'shrouded in almost total secrecy' - used their fake identities when they appeared in court. (For one alleged instance of this sort, involving SDS spy Jim Boyling in a prosecution of pro-cycling protesters, see this and this).‬Ellison also says that on occasions, the SDS knew that evidence advanced by prosecutors against campaigners was false, but did nothing. He suggests that police have concealed evidence that could have helped to acquit campaigners or shown that "the undercover officer had encouraged the alleged criminal activity of others".‬How many campaigners will have their convictions eventually overturned is difficult to predict at this time.‬The clearest clue to the scale of possible concealment comes from the second report published by Mick Creedon, the Derbyshire Chief Constable running the police's internal investigation into the undercover infiltration of political groups, in March this year. (Incidentally, it is one of the few findings of any worth in a generally shabby report).‬Creedon says (on page 49 here) that so far, he had identified 24 SDS undercover officers who were arrested while they pretended to be campaigners, some more than once, during the 40 years of the unit's operations (1968 to 2008).‬He also says that 10 undercover officers are known to have given evidence in court using their fake identities.‬So far, the authorities have not disclosed any more details. There has however been an admission from one SDS undercover officer, Bob Lambert, who infiltrated environmental and animal rights campaigners in the 1980s.‬In an interview with Channel 4 News last year, he said he was arrested 'four or five' times while undercover and in 1986 he appeared in a magistrates court charged with a 'minor public order offence'. He added he had to appear in court using his alter ego – rather than his real name – in order to 'maintain cover'.‬The scope of Elllison's review is wider than expected. It will focus not only on the SDS, but also the National Public Order Intelligence Unit which was set up in I999 to run undercover officers in political groups. Green MP Caroline Lucas, one of the few politicians to try and hold the undercover police to account, had lobbied May to ensure that the Ellison review examined the NPOIU as well as the SDS.Ellison's pro-active reaction stands in contrast to others in authority, who have previously appeared to have been either obstructive or complacent.The first wave of campaigners to have their convictions quashed came in 2011. The unmasking of NPOIU undercover officer Mark Kennedy by activists led to revelations that police and prosecutors had withheld evidence of his infiltration from 26 campaigners who planned to occupy Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station. Twenty had their convictions quashed, and the prosecutions of another six were dropped.‬The second wave came this year when senior judges overturned the convictions of 29 environmental protesters who had blocked a train carrying coal from going into the Drax power station in North Yorkshire. Again vital evidence gathered by Kennedy had been hidden from their trial, either by police or prosecutors.‬Evidence of this concealment had been brought to light by activists and their lawyers. They argued that this was a systemic problem as there must have been many other prosecutions of activists in which key evidence gathered by undercover officers had been hidden.‬But the authorities, including in particular the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, rejected their claims, maintaining that the cases involving involving Kennedy's evidence were simply isolated instances.
