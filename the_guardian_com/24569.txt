A family doctor accidentally injected a patient with six times the correct dose of painkiller within an hour of visiting another patient who died after he administered a similar dosage, it emerged today.Dr Michael Stevenson, 57, from Bootle, Cumbria, was given a suspended prison sentence after he admitted the manslaughter of Marjorie Wright, 58, in January 2005.Stevenson gave Wright a 30mg dose of diamorphine instead of 5mg, failed to monitor her reaction to the drug, and left her in order to attend another call.She was found dead when police broke into her home in Workington after a neighbour dialled 999.A General Medical Council (GMC) disciplinary hearing in Manchester today was told that another patient in Stevenson's care suffered a respiratory arrest on the same day when the doctor administered 30mg of diamorphine hydrochloride, rather than the intended dose of 5mg.The patient, a 59-year-old builder, who has not been identified, made a full recovery after the emergency services were called and he was given an antidote to the overdose.But Stevenson later recorded in the patient's notes that he only administered 5mg of the drug and told the man's wife he may have suffered a heart attack just before the point of injection.Stevenson is facing a fitness to practice hearing in relation to four patients whom he treated with painkilling drugs while working for the out-of-hours GP service Cuedoc.In two of the cases the doses he administered were "in excess of recommended guidance and potentially fatal" and his actions "were not in the best interests of the patients, and irresponsible", the GMC alleges.Stevenson was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Preston crown court in April 2007 for manslaughter.He had been a senior partner at the Seascale practice but was forced to take a sabbatical by colleagues over earlier concerns about his "workaholic" nature, the court heard.He had suffered from depression since childhood and tried to bury his mental illness through overwork. His eldest daughter had killed herself three years ago and this had exacerbated his depression.In September 2007 lawyers for the GMC told a high court hearing – which extended his suspension from practice – that inquiries had been launched into up to 14 further possible excessive dose cases involving the doctor.The court heard Cumbria police investigated those allegations but no criminal charges would be brought.Stevenson remains on an interim suspension order. He denies his fitness to practice is impaired because of his alleged actions in the four cases.The GMC hearing continues.
