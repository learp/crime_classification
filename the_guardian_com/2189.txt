A murder investigation has been launched after a 17-month-old boy died after being found unconscious with serious head injuries in a tower block in Greater Manchester.Hugo Wang was taken by ambulance to Manchester royal infirmary on Thursday evening. Hospital staff contacted Greater Manchester police after they noticed multiple bruises. His injuries were so severe that he was transferred to the Royal Manchester children's hospital in Pendleton, where he died the following day, shortly before 5pm. A postmortem examination revealed he had suffered a head injury.The toddler was allegedly assaulted in a fourth-floor flat in a tower block used as student accommodation in Salford. Two men, aged 38 and 28, and two women, aged 28 and 27, have been arrested at an address in the area and are being questioned on suspicion of murder. None of them are the child's parents, but they are believed to be known to his family. They were initially charged with assault, but it became a murder inquiry once Hugo died. Their exact relationship to the boy is not yet known.Police were yesterday granted extra time to question the four. They will be either released or charged by this evening.A police spokeswoman said: "A postmortem examination revealed Hugo died from a head injury. Police are continuing to question two men, aged 38 and 28, and two women, aged 28 and 27, on suspicion of murder."Next door neighbour Feng Gu, a 33-year-old accountancy student, said: "I gave a statement to the police. I heard nothing at all. I had earlier seen a little boy in the kitchen, about seven or eight years old. It is a family who live there."Another resident, Alex Margaritis, 23, a sports and leisure management student, said: "It's a terrible shock ... I can't believe this has happened here."
