Detectives are trying to find out where the killer of Cambridge student Sally Geeson was when the schoolgirl Milly Dowler was abducted.It emerged yesterday that not long before the death of 13-year-old Amanda Dowler, known as Milly to family and friends, David Atkinson had been based at a barracks in Hampshire, less than a mile from where her remains were found.The soldier had been transferred from the area, but three weeks before Milly disappeared in March 2002 he quit the army course he was attending in Kent. Investigators have not yet been able to confirm where he was on the day Milly vanished.A Surrey police spokesman confirmed his force was liaising with officers in Cambridge and the Ministry of Defence, but played down reports that Atkinson was the prime suspect for Milly's murder.The adjutant general secretariat hopes to pin down the lance corporal's movements. It is also likely that soldiers and officers will be questioned, and police will examine Atkin son's bank and other records to track his movements.Milly disappeared possibly after getting into a car near Walton-on-Thames railway station in Surrey. Her remains were found six months later in Yateley Heath wood, near Fleet, Hampshire.Following the murder of 22-year-old Ms Geeson, who went missing early on New Year's day, and the subsequent death of 31-year-old Atkinson, detectives began investigating the soldier's life and discovered his link to the spot where Milly's remains were found.He had been based at Gibraltar barracks, on the Hampshire-Surrey border, during the early 1990s and from March to May 2001. By 2002 he was on a course at a military college in Chatham, Kent. The MoD said yesterday that he left the course at the end of February 2002, three weeks before Milly vanished.The link is intriguing because of Atkinson's predatory tactics. He is thought to have picked up Ms Geeson in his car after she became separated from friends. Milly, similarly, is believed to have been picked up after saying goodbye to friends. Police also think Milly's killer must have had detailed knowledge of the area where her remains were found.A Surrey police spokesman played down the development, insisting it was not considered "significant" at this stage.But even if there is no link between Atkinson and Milly, the fact that the police knew nothing of the soldier's links to the area until he murdered Ms Geeson may highlight a failure in communication between the military and police.When Milly was found, Surrey detectives checked the past of soldiers based at the nearby Gibraltar barracks but did not hear about Atkinson, though he had served eight months in a military jail for falsely imprisoning a woman.The MoD is reviewing procedures to see if lessons can be learned; one issue almost certain to be looked at is whether police should routinely be informed about soldiers' offences.
