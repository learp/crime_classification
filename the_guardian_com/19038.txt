The families of murder and manslaughter victims will be allowed to speak out in court for the first time about the impact of the death on their lives under a pilot scheme which gets under way in April in five crown courts in England and Wales.Those who prefer not to speak in person will be able to ask a victim's advocate to speak on their behalf after the killer's conviction, but before sentencing. This could be the crown prosecutor handling the case or an independent lawyer or lay person, such as a family liaison officer attached to the police.The move, expected to affect about 400 cases a year, follows a consultation paper last year outlining proposals for victims' advocates, which were strongly supported by groups representing families of homicide victims.Lawyers who appear as victims' advocates will be paid by the Department for Constitutional Affairs as part of the Â£1m one-year pilot scheme at the Old Bailey in London, and crown courts in Birmingham, Winchester, Manchester and Cardiff.The lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, said: "This a ground-breaking way of supporting victims and their families. The consultation showed that there was firm support for piloting victims' advocates. The government believes the proposals should now be tried out in practice."Rose Dixon, from Support After Murder and Manslaughter, said: "This will go some way to redress the balance of the rights of the bereaved families in homicide cases and will give families a sense of having some input to the process."Currently, those most affected by a homicide have no right to speak in court unless they happen to be witnesses. In the US, families often make impassioned pleas to the court sentencing their loved one's killer, sometimes showing pictures, delivering a funeral-type eulogy, and suggesting a possible sentence.In Britain, families of victims have long complained that they have no voice even if the victim's character has been maligned as part of the accused's defence - for example, if a murder accused pleads provocation to try to reduce the offence to manslaughter, the victim's character can be blackened with no right to reply.At present, families have the right only to make a written victim impact statement which is filed with the court papers if police offer it. But take-up has been patchy among police forces and victims are often not told of their right.Judges will be able to take account of the impact of the crime on the victim in passing sentence but, as now, will have to disregard any opinion by the victim on what sentence to pass.Oral victim impact statements date back to the mid-1970s in the US, where most states allow courtroom speeches by homicide victims' families. Critics there argue that they introduce an arbitrary element into the sentencing process and may lead to longer prison terms for killers whose victims happen to have eloquent relatives.
