A makeup artist told an Old Bailey jury yesterday how she used her bra straps and baby bottle teats to disguise one of the alleged Â£53m Securitas robbers. Michelle Hogg, 32, brought laughter to the court when she explained her improvised methods to the jury. She was giving evidence against a group of men alleged to have taken part in Britain's biggest cash robbery, in Kent in February last year.She was cleared of involvement in the crime two weeks ago after the prosecution accepted she did not know why she had been asked to provide masks and disguises. Jurors have been told the robbery gang used theatrical masks to carry out the hold-up and kidnap of a Securitas depot manager, his wife and child.Ms Hogg said one of the men she made the masks for complained that he had been make to look "like a black Father Christmas ... He wanted his nose flatter, so I used rubber baby teats. The ends were cut off and I put them up his nostrils. That made his nose look flatter and wider with flared arches," she said. "I also pinned his eyes back. I used the straps from my bra. I attached it on his scalp and under his hair, to make his eyes look slanted."Car dealer John Fowler, 59, of Elderden Farm, Staplehurst, Kent; car salesman Stuart Royle, 49, of Maidstone, Kent; unemployed Jetmir Bucpapa, 26, of Tonbridge; roofer Lea Rusha, 35, of Southborough, Kent; garage owner Roger Coutts, 30, of Welling, south-east London; and Emir Hysenaj, 28, a Post Office worker, of Crowborough, East Sussex, deny conspiracy to rob and to kidnap, and conspiracy to possess firearms.
