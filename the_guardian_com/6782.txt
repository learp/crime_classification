Heroin should be prescribed to a greater number of addicts in a bid to reduce crime, one of the country's most senior police officers said today.Ken Jones, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), called for the drug to be made available to long-term users so they no longer need to commit crime to fund their habit.The government announced plans more than five years ago to massively expand an existing scheme which prescribes medical-grade heroin, but the number of addicts on the scheme has remained the same.Mr Jones, the former Sussex chief constable, told the Independent: "You need to understand there is a hard core, a minority, who nevertheless commit masses of crime to feed their addiction."We have to find a way of dealing with them, and licensed prescription is definitely something we should be thinking about."The Conservative leader, David Cameron, backed the same idea in 2002, while a member of the Commons' all-party home affairs select committee and before becoming opposition leader. A similar proposal was backed by one of Mr Jones' predecessors as Acpo president, Sir David Phillips, also in 2002.Diamorphine, which is identical to heroin but produced under pharmaceutical conditions, was prescribed to about 300 addicts by specialist GPs in 2002.In October 2001, former home secretary David Blunkett said he wanted the system to be expanded and set a target of 1,500 users.However, the National Treatment Agency (NTA) confirmed today that the number on diamorphine programmes still stands at 300 in England.Mr Jones added: "I am not in any shape or form a legaliser, but what I am concerned with is that we have to shape up to some tough realities."What we need is a cross-party consensus which considers the overwhelming public view to be tough on the roots of drugs, as well as treating its victims."Home Office figures show there are about 330,000 problem drug addicts, mainly opiate users.The heroin market is worth Â£1.2bn a year in England and Wales, according to the figures.A Home Office-funded pilot scheme run by the NTA is currently prescribing diamorphine, injectable methadone and oral methadone to 150 addicts, with results due to be published in two years.
