A sex attacker imprisoned in the top-security Broadmoor hospital is being questioned by police today over the 1992 London killing of the young mother Rachel Nickell on the basis of new DNA developments, reports said today.The 40-year-old man was imprisoned over a separate killing of a mother and child in the early 1990s, and has now been linked to the Nickell killing using DNA evidence.Officers attending the hospital today will ask him for a fresh DNA sample to compare with traces of DNA found on Rachel's underwear that can now be analysed thanks to scientific breakthroughs since the original investigation.The DNA is believed to be a partial sample, meaning that on its own it would not be enough to convict the man, who was not named.The link was thrown up after police ordered a 10-year anniversary review of the case files in 2002, in which they compared original witness statements, suspect files, links to other crimes and similarities between the injuries inflicted on the victims.Ms Nickell had been walking during the morning with her two-year-old son, Alex, on Wimbledon Common when she was attacked, sexually assaulted and stabbed 49 times. Alex was later found beside her body saying: "Get up, mummy."Last year, Ms Nickell's former partner Andre Hanscombe said that Alex had been permanently traumatised by the incident, and had become a troublemaker who claimed not to have a family.A former suspect Colin Stagg said that he was vindicated by the news. Mr Stagg was arrested for murder and spent a year in jail on remand before a judge threw out the case on the grounds that the police had used a "honey-trap plot" to force him to confess. A female undercover police officer, claiming to want to start a sexual relationship with Mr Stagg, encouraged him to describe imagined fantasies about the killing.He told the Daily Mail that he would be seeking Â£1m in damages for his imprisonment. "People have been pointing the finger at me for 12 years," he said."I haven't been able to get a proper job, I live in fear the whole time and people treat me as if I am a sex attacker."I said I was innocent from day one but nobody listened. I'm entitled to every penny I can get."
