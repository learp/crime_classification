The attorney general is to ask the court of appeal to examine whether the sentences passed in the Baby P case were unduly lenient, the justice secretary, Jack Straw, said today.Baby P's mother, her boyfriend and their lodger were all jailed on Friday for causing or allowing his death.The mother of Baby P – now named as Peter – and the lodger, Jason Owens, were both given indefinite sentences with a recommendation that she serve a minimum tariff of five years and Owens at least three years.The boyfriend was given 12 years for Peter's death and life for raping a two-year-old girl with a recommendation to serve at least 10 years.Although the Old Bailey judge in the case, Stephen Kramer, said the two given indefinite sentences would both be held until "deemed no longer to be a risk to the public, in particular to small children", the sentences were subject to widespread media criticism last weekend. The mother's tariff of five years means that in practice she could be released three years from now, because of the time she spent on remand awaiting trial.Straw defended the use of the indefinite sentences for public protection, saying the tariff that had been set was the "absolute minimum" those involved would serve. But he added that he understood the attorney general, Lady Scotland, intended to ask the appeal court to look at them under her powers to refer unduly lenient sentences.The attorney general's office said: "We have called for the papers in this case since the attorney general has the power to refer certain sentences to the court of appeal for review if, after looking at all the facts, she thinks the sentence was unduly lenient."Within this power, the attorney general can look at minimum tariffs imposed on life and indeterminate sentence prisoners."The spokesman said it was important to understand that such prisoners were not released automatically after the minimum term had been served – they were only released when the independent parole board was satisfied their continued detention was no longer necessary to protect the public.It is understood Scotland is looking at the sentencing decisions in the case as a whole.Children's charities were particularly critical of the sentences passed in the Baby P case.The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the minimum terms were unacceptable because they were so low. "It raises the question of how bad the abuse has to be before offenders get a longer time in prison," said its chief executive, Andrew Flanagan.
