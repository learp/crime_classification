Three men have been charged with the murder of an inmate at a privately-run jail, police said today. Wayne Martin Reid, 44, suffered a fatal chest wound in an assault at Rye Hill Prison near Rugby, Warwickshire, on Wednesday evening. A Northamptonshire police spokesman said three men - aged 40, 30 and 25 - had been charged with Reid's murder and also with conspiracy to commit murder. They are all appearing before magistrates in Northampton this morning. Reid, from the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham, was serving seven years for robbery at the 660-inmate jail, which opened in 2001, and is run by the private security firm GSL. A post-mortem examination revealed last night that he died of stab wounds.
