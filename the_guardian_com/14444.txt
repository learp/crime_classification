A former Tory minister has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a Conservative canvasser, the party said today. Rod Richards was said to have tried to attack a party activist going door-to-door near his home in Cardiff last night. A Welsh Conservative spokesman said: "One of our guys was assaulted and contacted the police and I understand he (Mr Richards) was arrested last night." He said the canvasser was not badly hurt and "shaken by the experience of it more than anything else". BBC Wales said Mr Richards was taken to Fairwater police station and was due to be questioned today. The one-time junior Welsh Office minister, who has admitted to an alcohol problem in the past, resigned from politics in 2002 due to ill health. He stood down as the Conservatives' leader in the Welsh assembly to fight an allegation of causing grievous bodily harm to a young woman, a charge of which he was found not guilty in 2000.A South Wales police spokeswoman said: "A 61-year-old man was arrested in Fairwater last night on suspicion of common assault. "He is currently in custody being questioned in Fairwater police station."
