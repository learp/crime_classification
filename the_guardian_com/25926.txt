The newly released crime maps site are a fundamentally unreliable source of information, because they are subject to unreported changes by the police forces compiling them both before and after they are displayed, and the data will not be stored on the site for comparison over time, observers say.There is also growing concern among developers who want to use the data to paint a picture of the UK's crime and policing strategies that the maps will give a distorted picture of crime in neighbourhoods – and that the apparent transparency in publishing them instead hides behind-the-scenes decisions about what crimes to report. Adrian Short, a Sutton-based developer, says that "what we're looking at here isn't a value-neutral scientific exercise in helping people to live their daily lives a little more easily, it's an explicitly political attempt to shape the terms of a debate around the most fundamental changes in British policing in our lifetimes." He accuses the maps of being "pseudo-transparency", and says that the site is "worse than useless".Additionally, police forces have indicated that whenever a new set of data is uploaded – probably each month – the previous set will be removed from public view, making comparisons impossible unless outside developers actively store it. That also means that datasets from each previous reporting period will not be available through the government's overarching data portal, data.gov.uk – a move that has angered some inside government who have been pushing for better and more open data.One source close to government told the Guardian: "I get the strong impression that the Met [police] were forced into this by National Policing Improvement Agency and Home Office – [but] they [the police] don't care about this stuff and will not take any action to make the point data accurate unless there is some significant pressure on them."That contrasts sharply with the US, which trailblazed the concept of crime mapping by allowing third-party developers to use crime data published by local police forces to map reports of incidents. One of the first, chicagocrime.org, was set up in April 2005, and began mapping at once. There have been no reports of adverse effects from the detailed crime mapping - which includes times and locations of reported crimes - from any cities in the US where it has been tried.However in the UK the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) advised that tying crime reports to postcodes or streets with fewer than 12 addresses would render the individuals involved too identifiable. The police have also decided to remove data about murders or sexual assaults.William Perrin, who has run a local blog for the King's Cross area in London for a number of years, says in a blogpost  that "A tiny minority of crimes are privacy sensitve and would have the victim protected in court. Surely they can be filtered out. The information commissioner's role in the background is odd – why would they not consult publicly and widely on how to handle privacy issues?"Now Perrin has entered a freedom of information request to the ICO demanding "all correspondence, records, emails, texts documents, presentations, meeting notes etc and any other information you hold that discusses issues around crime mapping from May 2010 to date" on the basis that "there is a strong public interest in understanding how your office arrived at the advice to which your press notice refers and the nature of your dialogue with the principal actors as they formed their opinions. In particular how your office balanced the public interest factors with privacy issues".Overall, there is widespread dissatisfaction among developers with the quality of the data, its presentation, and especially with the vague and arbitrary nature of the content. Many newspapers have picked up on the fact that so-called "crime hotspots" are nothing of the sort; instead, they are sometimes just the location of the police station where nuisance calls were received.Jonathan Raper, an external developer who has developed a number of local data sites using government information, notes five key flaws in the map data: • Locations used are approximate (so that "top 10 crime streets" may actually be places which have had no crime). • Data for streets with fewer than 12 postal addresses is apparently not recorded "to protect privacy". • Some data such as sexual offences and murder is removed – even though it would be easy to discover and locate from other police reports.• Data covers reported crimes rather than convictions, so some of it may turn out not to be crime.• The levels of policing are not provided, so that two areas with the "same" crime levels may in fact have "radically different" experiences of crime and policing.UK police forces have a longstanding antipathy to making crime maps available to the public, however. In May 2008 Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner at the Met, told the Today programme that the police think there are "significant downsides" to public crime mapping and that "it's not a very British thing to hold people to account in front of their peers".
