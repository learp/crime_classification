A mother came face to face yesterday with the man accused of raping her daughter.Antoni Imiela, 49, looked down as the woman gave evidence at Maidstone crown court. He denies snatching the 10-year-old girl from outside a youth club in Ashford, Kent, and raping her in November 2001, along with eight further counts of rape against two girls under 16 and five women. The railway worker, of Appledore, near Ashford, also denies the kidnap, indecent assault and attempted rape of a 10-year-old girl in Birmingham in 2002. The mother confirmed she had identified clothes found after the attack as belonging to her daughter. Police found the trousers, shoes, knickers and a sock along a muddy track where she had been dragged. The woman was asked by Rebecca Poulet QC, defending, about an incident in the days after the rape when her daughter thought she saw a man similar to her attacker. The mother said: "[She] saw this bloke and kids and said 'that is him' but we sort of didn't look at the time - it was something about this person's eyes that she picked up on." Ms Poulet said a police statement was made in which the man the girl had seen was described as being in his 20s. Earlier, the court heard from a forensic scientist, Gillian O'Boyle, who said DNA taken from Imiela matched DNA found in semen samples obtained from the victim of the Ashford rape. The hearing continues.
