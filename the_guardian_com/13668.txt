No charges will be brought against police marksmen who shot dead a barrister last year after a siege at his home, the Crown Prosecution Service said.The incident began when Mark Saunders, 32, began firing at neighbours from his Georgian townhouse in Chelsea, west London, with a legally owned shotgun. After a five-hour siege, the divorce lawyer was hit in the head, heart and liver in a volley of 11 bullets.The CPS had considered charges of murder, attempted murder and manslaughter against seven officers from the Metropolitan police's elite CO19 firearms squad, but found "insufficient evidence" that the officers had acted in anything other than self-defence, the CPS said.Saunders, who had served in the Territorial Army, was said to have been depressed and had been drinking on the afternoon of 6 May last year when he began firing with a 12-bore shotgun at neighbouring windows in the square where he lived with his wife, Elizabeth, also a barrister. Locals spoke of diving for cover as their homes were peppered with pellets."We recognise that Mr Saunders was in a distressed state but the police have a duty to protect the public and the right to defend themselves," Sally Walsh, reviewing lawyer from the CPS Special Crime Division, said in a statement.His widow Elizabeth Saunders, and his parents and sister, argued Tasers or CS gas could have been used. Jane Glass, solicitor for Mrs Saunders, said: "Elizabeth now awaits the inquest which will consider in public why it was necessary for police officers to shoot her husband."
