A post-mortem examination into remains found at the Shropshire mansion of millionaire Christopher Foster has identified one of the bodies as that of his wife Jillian, who died from a gunshot wound to the head, with the other body believed to be that of an adult male, West Mercia police said today.Jillian Foster's body was identified using dental records and following the post-mortem examination officers said they had launched a murder inquiry.Christopher Foster, Jillian, 49 and 15-year-old daughter Kirstie had been missing since the family went to a friend's barbeque on Monday before returning to the Â£1.2m family home at Maesbrook, near Oswestry, later that evening. Police believe the fire that engulfed the property was started deliberately in the early hours of Tuesday.A gun was recovered near the two bodies and has been identified as a .22mm rimfire rifle legitimately owned by Christopher Foster, it was revealed today.Police said the body of a dog, which had been shot, was also found close to the remains. Three horses and three dogs found in the outhouses had also been shot and spent and unspent gun cartridges were found scattered around the grounds of the property."Further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals," said Superintendent Gary Higgins, of West Mercia Constabulary.Police said the second body had not been formally identified and a cause of death had not been established. After the remains were discovered yesterday, speculation focused on the theory that the bodies were those of Christopher Foster's wife and his daughter and that the businessman, who was heavily in debt, might have killed them.Police were still stressing yesterday that a third body could still be discovered at the site as there were vast amounts of material to be sifted through.Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, of the force's major investigation unit, who is leading the inquiry, said: "Although this is now being treated as a murder, we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident."Thee are 100 officers involved in the investigation, which also seen detectives looking into Christopher Foster's murky business background.Earlier this year a high court judge criticised Foster for stripping his company of assets so he could transfer them to a new company.Search teams withdrew from the main part of the house last night for safety reasons because the walls were leaning in but were hoping to resume today.
