Tony Blair launches his most comprehensive drive to stamp out antisocial behaviour today with a raft of measures including powers for a 24,000-strong army of community support officers to conduct truancy sweeps and force errant schoolchildren back to school. The government's £1bn anti-truancy campaign has so far been branded a failure.Community support officers currently have no power to apprehend truants. Dedicated truancy officers will be deployed in 200 schools with the biggest problems. At present 7.5m school days are lost each year due to unauthorised absences.The respect action plan covers seven government departments and its importance to Mr Blair will be symbolised by the involvement of 17 different ministers.Mr Blair will say: "There are still intractable problems with the behaviour of some individuals and families, behaviour which can make life a misery for others, particularly in the most disadvantaged communities."The package is designed to balance punishment and prevention with promises of more youth clubs, £70m in funding for the Department for Education and Skills to help with parenting and a national Yob Direct hotline where intimidated members of the public can inform of persistent misbehaviour.Local communities are also to be given powers to demand action by councils and police to deal with troublemakers.Council scrutiny committees will be given powers to demand action on problem estates, as well as to require public explanations from the police on why they did not act sooner to stamp out antisocial behaviour.Eviction powers will be introduced to deal with occupants of "properties from hell", using current police powers to close and seal flats and houses that have been the scene of "persistent and serious nuisance" regardless of ownership. They will remain boarded up for at least three months.Problem families will be required to go on compulsory rehabilitation courses covering anger control, money management and parenting.Families may be required to live in a secure council "sin bin" modelled on a project in Dundee. But a punished tenant will not lose his or her right to council property permanently.It is expected that police will also be given new powers to identify children under 10 who are in problem families and at risk of becoming offenders so that the authorities can intervene before they start committing offences.As part of the plan, Ruth Kelly, the education secretary, will announce a national parenting academy, to train professionals who work with young families.An extra £70m will be available to fund parenting classes and other support groups for families who are struggling to control poor behaviour in the home.Teenage parents will also be offered £30 a week as part of the education maintenance allowance if they attend parenting classes and a further £20m will pay for more parent school advisers to help families make the right choices for their children's education.Ms Kelly will outline the proposals at a parent support class in Birmingham today, saying: "Our action plan is a balance of support and sanctions. We will provide more help to prevent families falling into the pattern of antisocial behaviour but strong sanctions should they ignore that support and cross over the line."As the government has increased the agencies empowered to impose fixed penalty notices or impose antisocial behaviour orders, the numbers of Asbos has risen and so have the numbers failing to comply with the orders.Graham Allen, the MP for Nottingham North, said he wanted more community courts so judges toured local estates and are answerable to communities for their judgments. But the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, warned that helping families to create a safer society could not be achieved with "a mish-mash of gimmick and spin".
