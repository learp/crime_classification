A woman who filled her fiance's van with his possessions and dumped it into a harbour after a furious row was warned today she may go to jail.Emma Thomason, 24, took revenge on Jason Wilson after he refused to come home from the pub where he was drinking with friends.She loaded his clothes, CDs and DVDs into his work van and rolled it into the harbour of Whitehaven in Cumbria.Today she pleaded guilty at the town's magistrates court to aggravated vehicle-taking without consent and driving without insurance.Ms Thomasen has already been told by Mr Wilson, also 24, that their planned wedding is off and today the chairman of the bench, Ian Killip, said she may be jailed.Mr Killip said she had committed "a very serious offence for which we must consider a custodial sentence as a serious possibility".The court had heard that the mother of two "bitterly regrets" her behaviour, which was an "act of frustration" after many years of Mr Wilson allegedly shirking his responsibilities.Ms Thomason had asked her fiance to come home on May 13 and help look after their two children but he insisted on staying out drinking with his friends.She had then loaded up Mr Wilson's Ford Transit van before parking it on a slipway, letting the handbrake off and watching it roll into the sea. The damage to the van, the plastering equipment Mr Wilson used in his job and his possessions came to around Â£15,000.Mr Wilson only discovered what happened after his boss called to tell him the van had been spotted floating in the harbour. Police were forced to partially drain the harbour the next day to recover the vehicle. Just 24 hours before the argument, the couple, who had been together for seven years, booked their honeymoon.Mr Wilson has since moved out of the family home. Ms Thomason will be sentenced later this month.
