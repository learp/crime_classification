Racist crime is a priority for the Met, so senior officers must have been delighted to get volunteers for undercover duties to crack down on verbal and physical attacks by customers on staff in Asian restaurants.Up to 20 officers gave up evenings last weekend to dine anonymously in Indian, Thai and Chinese restaurants in the West End - on expenses, naturally. Unfortunately they failed to deliver any suspects along with their receipts. "We were not expecting to pick anyone up and that's exactly what happened," said Det Chief Insp Brett Lovegrove, head of hate crime initiatives for Westminster. "It's fair to say this is a very sought-after position. Officers are keen to spend the night in a nice warm restaurant with a meal and a soft drink - no alcohol allowed, of course. "But to be serious, the message is that anyone thinking of abusing the staff should watch out - they could be sitting next to a table full of police." In the past there have been incidents in which victims of race crime in Chinatown complained of being treated as if they were perpetrators. Mr Lovegrove said the initiative would break down mistrust. Westminster councillor Murad Qureshi, who came up with the idea, said: "The Chinese and Bengali community will greatly appreciate this effort by the police."
