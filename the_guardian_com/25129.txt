A 47-year-old man pleaded guilty today to the murder of a registered childminder who was stabbed to death in her home. Mark Odeyemi admitted killing 30-year-old Mandy Skedd as she looked after two children at her house in Nottingham last November. Odeyemi, Skedd's former partner, entered his plea before a judge at Nottingham crown court on the day his trial over the murder was due to start. It is believed a nine-month-old boy and a two-year-old girl witnessed Skedd's murder on November 23 2004. She was stabbed to death in the house she had once shared with Odeyemi in Dowson Street, Nottingham. Stephen Coward QC, defending, said Odeyemi was due to visit a neurologist tomorrow and asked for the case to be adjourned for sentencing.
