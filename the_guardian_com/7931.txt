Police yesterday targeted 16 Spurs fans suspected of aiming racist and homophobic chants at Portsmouth defender Sol Campbell, in an effort to send a "clear message" to supporters that abuse from the stands would not be tolerated. Two arrests were made after Hampshire police released images of the men, alleged to have been among a crowd of Spurs fans abusing their former player during their team's away match at Fratton Park on September 28.A 28-year-old man from Ringwood, Hampshire, and a 36-year-old from Wokingham, Berkshire, were questioned on "suspicion of indecent or racial chanting at a designated football match".A spokesman for Portsmouth Football Club said Campbell, who left Spurs for arch-rivals Arsenal in 2001, had spoken to police about the incident and made his views clear. The pictures of the suspects, widely published on the internet yesterday, were taken at the match by a uniformed policeman.Superintendent Neil Sherrington, of Hampshire police, said that after listening to recordings of the match it was "clear there was a level of homophobic abuse" aimed at the former England centre back. "I would regard this abuse as intolerable in any forum or venue - the excuse that it was at a football match is not a valid one." He added that while many of Tottenham's 2,500 away fans were not taking part in the chanting, a "significant number" were. "We want to send a clear message that abuse of this kind will not be tolerated and that we are taking robust action." If convicted, the fans could face a fine of up to Â£1,000 and a ban from entering any football ground in Britain for up to 10 years. Tottenham's safety officer, Sue Tilling, said the club would cooperate fully with police and not hesitate to ban indefinitely "supporters whose behaviour is proved to be unacceptable".
