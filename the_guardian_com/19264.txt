A student was jailed for eight years yesterday for preying on young women colleagues while unsuspecting staff named him "student of the year" on his course.Stuart Schultz, 19, a rugby player, raped two fellow students and indecently assaulted a third after drunken evenings at a further education college where he had earned a reputation as a ladies' man. His lack of regard for his victims was described as "chilling" by Judge Simon Lawler QC at Hull crown court, where Schultz was convicted unanimously by a jury after a six-day trial. "You have shown absolutely no remorse whatsoever. You have been concerned only with your own predicament," the judge told him. Several women students gave character evidence for him during the trial and one said afterwards: "The jury didn't know him like we do. There would not be four women here now if we thought he was guilty. "He was the only black guy in college. There was jealousy. We will be standing by Stuart. We will be stood at the gates when he comes out of prison." The college is not being named, to avoid identitying the victims.
