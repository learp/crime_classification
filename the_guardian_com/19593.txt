Two police officers who shot dead a man brandishing a sword after he drove the wrong way down a dual carriageway and crashed will not face charges, the director of the Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday.Simon Murden, 26, who worked for a fair trade charity run by his family near Hull, died in March last year after ignoring warnings and baton rounds.Ken McDonald QC said the officers "honestly and genuinely" believed Murden presented a lethal threat to people at a nearby filling station. The death was the Humberside force's first involving armed police.
