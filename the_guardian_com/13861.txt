A man who attacked a rising rugby star with a claw hammer leaving the weapon embedded in his victim's head has been jailed for 15 years.Kris Bradley, 23, who was found guilty this month of attempted murder was told by the judge his attack was one of "horrific violence".Sentencing Bradley at Birmingham crown court to 15 years custody with three further years on licence, Judge Melbourne Inman QC told him: "Your intention was terrible. In my experience, it was a singular attack without warning, in which you hit him so hard the claws of the hammer penetrated to their full depth through the front of the skull and embedded in his brain."His victim, Matthew Probert, a prop with Scunthorpe rugby union club, was a rising star on the brink of playing professionally before the attack in Lincoln city centre in the early hours of 1 September, last year.However, despite what the judge acknowledged to be "a remarkable recovery", prosecutor Tim Bowden told the court the assault had robbed Probert of any immediate career in the sport.The judge said doormen from nearby nightclubs and later paramedics "sensibly" did not attempt to remove the hammer from Probert's head after the attack, and the tool was later successfully removed by neurosurgeons.He said: "His life was saved. It is quite clear from the evidence of the neurosurgeon that had the hammer penetrated an inch higher or lower it would have had, at the very least, a catastrophic effect on Mr Probert's ability to lead a full life."Trouble initially flared that night following an altercation between Bradley – out drinking with his friend Alex Taylor – and Probert in Lincoln's Walkabout bar in the early hours of 1 September, last year.All three men - including Probert who had been celebrating a friend's birthday - were ejected by door staff following a fracas, in which the rugby player had slapped Bradley.Outside, Bradley, who was drunk and still angry from what the judge called "a perceived slight" called his friend Daniel Burrell who a short time later arrived in a car with the claw hammer.Bradley then followed and attacked Probert with the assistance of Taylor. After leaving their victim seriously wounded, the two men got back into Burrell's car and drove away.Burrell, 23, of Lincoln, was found guilty of encouraging or assisting in the commission of an offence of grievous bodily harm with intent. He was handed a four-and-a-half year jail sentence on Monday.Taylor, 22, also of Lincoln, had admitted encouraging or assisting Bradleyin the attack, "keeping watch" for Probert as the judge said, as he and Bradley shadowed him through the city's streets. He was sentenced to 16 months.In addition to his 15-year sentence, Bradley, of Lincoln, was given a six-month jail term to run concurrently for punching and knocking unconscious a man during a separate street attack outside a kebab shop in Great Yarmouth on 27 February last year.
