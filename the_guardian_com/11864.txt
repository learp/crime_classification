More murder charges could be brought against Dr Harold Shipman after a source close to the police investigation said 23 more deaths at his Hyde surgery were being studied.The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that it was considering a number of allegations and would make a decision on whether to pursue the cases after consultation with victims' relatives. Robert Davies, crown prosecutor in Oldham and Hyde, Greater Manchester, said: "No decision can be taken as to whether it is in the public interest to pursue these allegations further until the views of the families concerned have been sought.""We will reach a decision as soon as possible," he added. After Shipman's arrest in August 1998 police found stockpiles of diamorphine which could provide nearly 1,500 lethal injections. Police subsequently investigated around 140 deaths of patients at Shipman's practice and found enough evidence to raise suspicions about Shipman in some 90 of those.South Manchester coroner John Pollard said it was possible to speculate that the death toll could be as high as 1,000, but that the full extent of his crimes could never be known. It was unlikely that the full extent of Shipman's crimes would ever be discovered, Mr Pollard said, both because it was extremely difficult to detect the cause of death in bodies which were buried more than four years before any examination, and as most funerals now took place as cremations. "He is convicted of 15 murders over three years," Mr Pollard said. "The police investigated about 130 deaths over that time. Say 100 were murdered, then multiply that by 10 because he has been practising for 30 years. "There is the potential for about 1,000 deaths - but that's pure speculation."
