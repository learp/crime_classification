As many as 121 children are currently victims of child sexual exploitation in West Yorkshire, according to police who have revealed a dramatic rise in the number of offences under investigation.West Yorkshire police said they had identified dozens of victims as part of 180 investigations into child grooming in the region – almost three times as many as a year ago.Describing child sexual exploitation (CSE) as “a significant and increasing threat”, DCI Sue Jenkinson said the number of cases being investigated by police would continue to rise.“The levels of information, intelligence, incident reporting, referrals and investigations linked to CSE both in respect of contact and online offences continues to grow.“As we achieve success, and victims feel more confident in coming forward, and with use of improved technology, particularly in the area of online offending involving indecent images of children, we can anticipate further increases in demand.”Study reveals scale of child sexual exploitation in West Midlands The scale of current CSE investigations in the region was revealed in a little-noticed appendix to a report by West Yorkshire’s police and crime commissioner. It revealed that the number had risen to 180, up from 65 a year ago.From the 180 investigations, police have identified 121 victims and 157 suspects across the region. Of all the cases, 115 involved “contact offences” – where the victim is believed to have been sexually abused – and 65 took place over the internet.Of the 157 suspects, 124 had been arrested and 23 had been charged and were awaiting prosecution.In addition, the force said it had identified 190 alleged perpetrators and 146 victims of abuse during its 40 investigations into historical cases, carried out as police across Britain come under pressure to tackle abuse in the wake of the Rotherham and Jimmy Savile scandals. Forty of those 190 suspects have been arrested, with 19 having been charged.West Yorkshire police said tackling CSE was a priority for the force: “Significant work has also been ongoing with partners to encourage victims to come forward and report. This has included work in schools and communities.“The force will continue these methods to give confidence to victims and adults to come forward and report child abuse.”It said safeguarding units had been restructured to allow them to tackle CSE proactively, it said.“In addition to the work locally there have been a number of high-profile investigations across the country that have again given victims of child abuse who are now adults the confidence to come forward.”West Yorkshire police have hired 24 civilian investigators to help detectives cope with the increased workload, and are looking for a further six recruits.Gabrielle Shaw, the chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said the figures indicated that the signs of CSE were “better recognised, better reported and better investigated” than before.“With the recent focus on cases of high-profile and non-recent abuse, we must not fool ourselves that sexual abuse and exploitation of children is ‘yesterday’s problem’. This is happening here and now. “Perpetrators are likely to continue offending if they aren’t stopped, so we need to make sure police have sufficient resources to pursue all cases, whenever the abuse took place. West Yorkshire’s use of civilian investigators is an innovative step in the right direction.”
