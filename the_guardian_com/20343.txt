The murdered Swindon woman Sian O'Callaghan is likely to have died from head injuries, a coroner has heard as an inquest into her death was opened and adjourned.The 22-year-old personal assistant went missing from the Suju nightclub in Swindon on 19 March. Her body was found near the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire last week.A Home Office forensic pathologist is still working to confirm a precise cause of death while Wiltshire police continue to examine the remains of a second woman which were discovered in Gloucestershire.Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher confirmed that O'Callaghan's death was formally certified last Thursday, following the arrest of taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, who has subsequently appeared in court charged with her murder.The coroner, Nicholas Gardiner, sitting at Oxford coroner's court, said examinations were continuing to determine exactly how the young woman died."I think the actual cause of death has not yet been defined but is likely to be head injuries of some description."O'Callaghan was formally identified by Pete Shawe, the partner of her mother, Elaine, who had known her for four years.The 10-minute hearing on Friday came after Mrs O'Callaghan described news of her daughter's death as "the worst of the worst" she could imagine."I always had hope but I still tried to prepare myself for the worst," she told the Swindon Advertiser. "It was the worst of the worst that I could've imagined. But they'd found her."It was a relief in a way. I would have hated to live the rest of my life looking over my shoulder and looking at every brunette girl, wondering if it was her."O'Callaghan had been out with friends before she disappeared in the early hours. She was last seen alive in CCTV footage filmed close to the nightclub, only half a mile from the flat she shared with her boyfriend, Kevin Reape, 25.On Wednesday, Halliwell, 47, appeared at Bristol crown court accused of her murder.O'Callaghan's family were not present for the brief hearing, which was held in order to expedite her funeral arrangements.However, she cannot be buried until Halliwell's defence team have decided whether to request a second postmortem examination, as is their right.Outside court, Fulcher said O'Callaghan's family were "bearing up" but added: "It is a horrific trauma for them."I want them to have closure and they need to organise her funeral. That can't happen until the defence have decided whether or not they want to have a second examination."The hearing is expected to be resumed and adjourned once criminal proceedings have concluded.
