The mother and stepfather of a seven-year-old girl allegedly starved to death at her Birmingham home have been charged with five counts of child cruelty.Khyra Ishaq was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital from her mother's home in Handsworth, Birmingham in the early hours of May 17.Her mother, Angela Gordon, 33, and her stepfather, Junaid Abuhamza, 29, who lived with Khyra and her five siblings, had previously been charged with ''causing or allowing'' her death contrary to Section 5 of the 2004 Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act.They will now appear before magistrates in Birmingham next Tuesday to face the additional joint charges of cruelty to a person under 16 years of age. The new charges are brought under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.Hayley Firman, assistant district crown prosecutor for Birmingham, said: "Junaid Abuhamza and Angela Gordon have previously been charged with causing or allowing the death of Khyra Ishaq. "The available evidence has been considered and it has been decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge the two defendants with the five additional charges of cruelty, one each in relation to the remaining children of the household." The Birmingham safeguarding children board has launched a case review into the circumstances of Khyra's death.
