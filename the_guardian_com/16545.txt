Today's second Northerner post flagged up our plan to bring you details of the Police and Crime Commissioner candidates for all the police forces in the three northern regions of England. We also hope to run as many manifestos from them as possible and posts from others interested.Before we get going on each force, here's an overview showing which parties, and/or independents, are in the field in all 12 elections. You'll see some familiar names - notably John Prescott in Humberside where his opponents include Geoffrey Bloom, the UKIP MEP. Other former Westminster MPs include Vera Baird, fighting for Labour in Northumbria, and there are many local councillors putting up.Independents include Sultan Alam in Cleveland, a former officer in the local force who was paid more than Â£840,000 earlier this year for wrongful dismissal. The former chief executive of Durham county council, Kingsley Smith, is another, fighting to win the Durham commissioner's job.The biggest slate is the seven-strong one in Humberside, followed by six in Merseyside at the other end of the M62. The smallest is in North Yorkshire where only Labour and the Conservatives will battle it out. Nominations have closed but candidates may still withdraw. There are links to all the candidates which has taken an absolute age but was well worth it. There are some very interesting people here; it isn't a tedious slugfest between political hacks.The poll is on Thursday 15 November which also sees the Parliamentary by-election in Manchester Central on which the Northerner is running a similar series of candidates' manifestos. See those so far published here (using the links at the bottom of the piece too). The by-election was caused by Labour MP Tony Lloyd's decision to run for the police commissioner job in Greater Manchester.CheshireAinsley Arnold Liberal DemocratLouise Bours UKIPJohn Dwyer ConservativeSarah Flannery  IndependentJohn Stockton  LabourClevelandSultan Alam  IndependentBarry Coppinger  LabourKen Lupton  ConservativeJoe Michna  GreenCumbriaPrue Jupe  Liberal DemocratPatrick Leonard LabourRichard Rhodes ConservativeMary Robinson IndependentDurhamMichael Costello UKIPRon Hogg LabourKingsley Smith IndependentNick Varley ConservativeGreater ManchesterMatt Gallagher Liberal DemocratsTony Lloyd  LabourRoy Warren  IndependentMichael Winstanley ConservativeSteven Woolfe  UKIPHumbersideGodfrey Bloom  UKIPSimone Butterworth Liberal DemocratPaul Davison IndependentNeil Eyre  IndependentMatthew Grove  ConservativeJohn Prescott  LabourWalter Sweeney IndependentLancashire:Afzal Anwar Liberal DemocratsTim Ashton  ConservativeRobert Drobny UKIPClive Grunshaw  LabourMerseysideGeoffrey Gubb ConservativeHilary Jones  UKIPPaula Keaveney Liberal DemocratsJane Kennedy  LabourKiron Reid IndependentPaul Rimmer  English DemocratsNorthumbriaPeter Andras  Liberal DemocratVera Baird LabourAlistair Baxter  UKIPPhilip Butler ConservativeNorth YorkshireJulia Mulligan ConservativeRuth Potter LabourSouth YorkshireDavid Allen  English DemocratsJonathan Arnott UKIPNigel Bonson ConservativeRobert Teal  Liberal DemocratShaun Wright  LabourWest YorkshireMark Burns-Williamson  LabourGeraldine Carter ConservativeCedric Christie  IndependentAndrew Marchington Liberal Democrat  Hillsborough.
