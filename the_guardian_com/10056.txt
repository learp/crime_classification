Alan Travis and Allegra StrattonGordon Brown will today announce an overhaul of government strategy for ­combating serious crime, in his first speech on law and order in nearly two years as prime minister.In recognition of a spike in crime being associated with the recession, the prime minister will also say that dealing with burglary and robbery is a new government priority.Brown will say: "We face new kinds of crime – especially knife crime, organised crime, e-crime and identity theft. And now, of course, the new challenge of preventing what happened in previous recessions, where crimes like burglary and robbery went up. We face new causes of crime – including binge drinking, youth gangs and problem families. And we need new ways of responding – for government, the police, courts, local authorities and communities themselves."The government is concerned about a rise in the number of house break-ins, fraud and forgery offences recorded in the three months before last September, ­suggesting the decline in overall crime levels recorded in recent years has ended.Earlier in the year a leaked memo to Brown from the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, warned that the Home Office feared the economic downturn would result in an increase in crime. The figures showed that robberies at knifepoint rose by 18% from 3,551 to 4,207 in the three months to September last year, compared with the same period in 2007, while house break-ins recorded by police were up by 4% to 69,700, and fraud and forgery were up by 16% to 43,800.The government will legislate to shift the burden of proof so that convicted criminals have to account for their houses, cars and other assets.Brown's intention to overhaul the strategy to tackle organised crime follows Whitehall dissatisfaction at the performance of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the disclosure that the police have identified 2,800 organised criminal gangs, nearly three times the number previously acknowledged. The Downing Street strategy unit has started an inquiry into why British law enforcement agencies are struggling to cope with the threat.The prime minister's speech coincides with a stark warning from the police that an extra 2,000 officers are needed to cope with a predicted 25% increase in some types of crime over the next two years.Paul McKeever, the Police Federation chairman, is to tell his annual conference in Bournemouth today that new research shows that property crime such as theft and burglary will surge by nearly 25% over the next two years as a result of the economy going into recession.Police numbers in England and Wales are at record levels, with a total strength of 145,300 and a further 15,700 community support officers. But the federation argues that the number of police officers per 100,000 population has fallen steadily since 2006.
