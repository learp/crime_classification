No police officer is to be prosecuted as a result of the controversial incident in which a young woman was arrested outside a Sheffield nightclub last year, according to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.The incident, which involved a number of members of South Yorkshire police, was captured on closed circuit television camera footage which was obtained by the Guardian and broadcast around the world.The IPCC said yesterday that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided no officers would face criminal charges in relation to an allegation of assault made by Toni Comer. She claimed she had been assaulted by two police officers during her arrest on suspicion of causing criminal damage outside the Niche nightclub in Sheffield on July 30 2006. The IPCC carried out an inquiry and passed their findings to the CPS for consideration in November.Nicholas Long, IPCC commissioner for Yorkshire and Humberside, said: "The CPS has delivered a quick decision which confirms our view that no criminal offences had been committed in relation to the assault allegations."The IPCC must consider now whether there are any disciplinary matters which need to be considered against any of the officers involved in the incident. I intend to make this decision quickly and at that point the findings of the IPCC's independent investigation will be made public."Toni Comer, 19 at the time, remembered nothing of what happened but the events were caught on the club's security cameras. The film shows her and PC Anthony Mulhall at the top of a fire escape. During a struggle, they roll down the stairs and the events unfold.In a statement after the arrest, Mulhall acknowledges he struck Comer but said he only did so in self-defence and after extreme provocation.In March, the Monitoring Group North, a local rights group, called for an investigation into what had happened. Comer was not available for comment last night.
