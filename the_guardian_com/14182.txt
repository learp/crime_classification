Public relations guru Max Clifford is a "master in the art of intimidation and manipulation", a jury has heard.Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said the publicist was a "risk-taker" with an "arrogant confidence", as she delivered her closing speech at Southwark crown court in London.Clifford, 71, is standing trial accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven girls and women â€“ all of which he denies.Cottage said Clifford had "packaged himself" as a loving father for many years. She told the court: "He has managed to portray himself in different ways to different people, but don't be fooled. In every case his actions were sudden, unexpected and, frankly, in some cases so bizarre you may think these young women and girls have no idea how to react. He admitted the power he obtained in the press in the 1990s meant he would be able to kill any story about him."Cottage said in one alleged assault Clifford "launched himself" on a terrified woman in his office. "Thankfully she was a strong woman and she kicked him where it hurts," she said.The court has heard about another alleged incident in which Clifford is said to have put a 12-year-old girl's hand on his penis in a jacuzzi in Spain in the early 1980s.Cottage said: "It shows he will take outrageous risks and place the hand of a child on his penis, knowing he had power and control over this girl."Another of Clifford's alleged assaults, in a London nightclub toilet, was "evidence of an arrogant confidence he could get away with almost anything", the prosecutor said. "He is a master in the art of intimidation and manipulation."Cottage told the jurors to use common sense when they retired to consider their verdicts. She said: "Sympathy has no part to play in your consideration of the evidence. Clear and calm logic. You need to decide between truth and lies."Clifford listened from the dock with the aid of a hearing loop.The trial continues.
