The mistress of a judge who died in a fierce blaze in his garden shed moments after arguing with his wife about their future yesterday claimed she was close to proving that her lover did not die accidentally.A fresh inquest into the death of Andrew Chubb, who died in 2001, is to begin today following a determined campaign by Kerry Sparrow to have the case re-examined by a coroner.New witnesses and evidence will be presented at the inquest in Glastonbury, Somerset, which is expected to back up Ms Sparrow's claim that the original police investigation was botched.She said: "Everybody deserves justice and I believe that the outcome of this inquest will bring closure. I'm convinced Andrew did not die accidentally and now I am even closer to proving that."It is believed that Chubb's widow, Jennifer, will not give evidence. Mrs Chubb, who was at one point arrested in connection with her husband's death but never charged, has moved to Australia and cannot be forced to appear at the inquest.Mrs Chubb was pictured in a tabloid newspaper yesterday at a fair in New South Wales with a male companion.When the Guardian phoned her home, a woman with a clipped English accent answered but put the receiver down as soon as a question was posed. Her lawyer has written to the coroner, Sheriff Payne, to say she can "envisage no circumstances in which she could contribute further evidence to assist in your inquiry".During a high court hearing last year at which Ms Sparrow's team argued for a new inquest, Mrs Chubb's barrister, Tim Nesbitt, said there was a "lingering cloud of suspicion generated against her".The high court quashed the finding of the original inquest that Mr Chubb's death had been accidental, accepting that not all the relevant evidence had been considered.But the court also said there was not a "shred of evidence" that Mr Chubb was unlawfully killed.The court was told that Mr Chubb, 58, a lead prosecutor in the Rosemary West case, was having an affair with Ms Sparrow while he worked in Portsmouth during the week, and would go back to the family home, a 19th century farmhouse, near Chard in Somerset, at the weekend.
