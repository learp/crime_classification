The attorney general has bowed to media concerns about the threat to press freedom posed by a measure aimed at preventing jurors from seeking online material related to trials.A clause in the criminal justice and courts bill, which is now going through its parliamentary stages, creates a new criminal offence for jurors, punishable with up to two years' jail, should they conduct research prohibited by a judge.But the clause also gave the attorney general the power to require publishers to take down material from their website archives. Publishers would be issued with a notice ordering them to remove material that was deemed by a judge to prejudice criminal proceedings. If they failed to do so they would face prosecution for contempt of court.But representations to the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, by the Society of Editors, the Newspaper Society and the Media Lawyers Association the Attorney General have led to the withdrawal of the offending clauses.A statement on the Society of Editors' website states: "The proposals for the new defence counterbalanced by the AG's notice powers are to be removed by government amendment."Its director, Bob Satchwell, said: "When we met the attorney we said it would be wrong in principle for a member of the government to have power to order media organisations to take down material. "We also told him that it would cause huge practical problems if defence lawyers sought blanket orders to taken down material which could be seen by jurors. We are very pleased that the Attorney has listened to our concerns".The Times's legal editor, Frances Gibb, reported in early June  that eight media organisations had warned of the potential "chilling effect" on the operation and accessibility of news archives.At that time, Grieve argued that the measure did provide a defence for publishers who faces contempt prosecutions.Source: Society of Editors
