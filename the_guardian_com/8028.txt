Safe houses need to be set up for young people who want to escape from gang violence but need protection to do so, an influential committee of MPs recommends today.The report on young black people and the criminal justice system also warns that boys and young men who lack the involvement of a father in their lives can develop "father hunger" - a trauma that leaves them vulnerable to peer pressure and involvement in gang culture.The MPs also challenge radio and television broadcasters to tackle concerns that rap, grime and hip hop music glamorise violent, criminal lifestyles.The inquiry by the Commons home affairs select committee comes after three black teenagers were shot and killed in 11 days in south London in February and two black schoolboys were stabbed to death in the space of six days. In London in 2006, 75% of the victims of gun crime and 79% of the suspects were black.The MPs say the over-representation of young black people at all stages of the criminal justice system poses a "serious crisis" for all sections of the black community. They are particularly concerned at the prediction - confirmed by ministers - that three-quarters of the young black male population will soon be on the DNA database as a result of disproportionate arrest rates and the alarming growth in the numbers in custody.John Denham, the chairman of the committee, said the primary cause was social exclusion, including educational underachievement, school exclusion, deprivation and poor housing.The report says these factors "interact in a 'web of disadvantage' compounded by other trends within black communities, such as lack of father involvement and the lack of positive role models, and the presence of powerful alternative negative role models in media and popular culture"."There needs to be closer attention on the way we can enable young people to escape from involvement in criminal groups and activities," said Mr Denham. "There is a practical challenge about how we support a young person who wants to move out of it, if they are living in a community where varying factors work to draw them back." Safe houses run by community groups, not the police, should form a key element in the development of gang exit programmes, the MPs say.The committee also heard evidence about the effect of absent and disengaged fathers on the development of young black men. Barnardos and the Babyfather Alliance told the MPs that the trauma of "father hunger" could contribute to involvement in gangs. However, many witnesses stressed that the fact that a father did not live in the same home as his children did not in itself indicate insufficient parental support.The MPs' proposals to extend mentoring and to increase funding for prevention, rehabilitation and gang exit programmes were supported by Nacro, the crime reduction charity, but it criticised their opposition to setting targets to produce more equal outcomes for young black people in the criminal justice system, saying discrimination remained.Crime trapYoung black people and crime路 2.6 times more likely to be a violent crime victim; 1.6 times more likely to be robbery victim; and 5.5 times more likely to be murdered路 Six times more likely to be stopped and searched by police and three times more likely to be arrested路 Three quarters of the young black male population will soon be on the DNA database路 8% of young black people arrested were remanded in custody, compared with 4% of young white people.
