A man has been charged over the death of a lorry driver whose body was found in a cement mixer more than a decade ago.Lee Balkwell, 33, was found dead at Baldwin's Farm in Upminster, Essex, on 18 July 2002. His head and shoulders were lodged in the mixer.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has now authorised Essex Police to charge Simon Bromley, 44, of Baldwin's Farm, with manslaughter and a charge under health and safety legislation of failing to protect somebody in his employment.At the time of the death Essex Police said its investigation established that the death was accidental. But last year the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which intervened after a series of complaints by Balkwell's father Les, found the inquiry was "seriously flawed".As well as the IPCC inquiry, West Midlands Police were asked to investigate how Balkwell died, making more than 90 recommendations for further action.Bromley will appear before Basildon magistrates court on January 27.
