Home Office ministers were kept in the dark for more than 10 years over the failure to properly process more than 27,000 overseas convictions of British criminals, an internal Whitehall inquiry concluded yesterday.The Home Office inquiry said the "collective failure" by officials to recognise the significance of the foreign conviction data and to take "sustained action" to deal with the backlog was "in retrospect, difficult to understand and very regrettable".The disclosure that more than 27,000 foreign convictions of crimes committed by British offenders abroad had not been logged on the police national computer triggered a massive political row in January. The fiasco set back attempts by the home secretary, John Reid, to demonstrate that the Home Office was on the road to recovery.One senior Home Office civil servant remains suspended on full pay over the debacle, with the case expected to be dealt with in the next few weeks.The Conservatives last night described the report as a whitewash. But Dusty Amroliwala, the Whitehall department's senior personnel director, who headed the inquiry, said she could find no evidence that "existence of the accumulated records or their content were brought to ministerial attention at any time prior to January 9 2007".However, the report exposes the extent of the shambles within the Home Office, with officials telling each other that somebody ought to do something and raise the issue with ministers.For more than 10 years, since Britain ratified an international treaty, the overseas conviction files arrived but were left to gather dust at the Home Office until the task was contracted out to the Association of Chief Police Officers last year.The inquiry says it was only last August and September that the significance of the accumulated data began to be realised by Home Office officials.The 27,529 cases, including 540 serious offenders convicted of crimes including murder, rape and robbery, were not entered on the police national computer. Emails released under freedom of information laws showed civil servants and police knew last autumn there were potential "horror stories" waiting to happen as a result of the failure to log the files.But the inquiry shows that although there were "significant opportunities" for senior civil servants to warn ministers, they were diverted by other events or "an absence of lateral thinking".The report clears Tony McNulty, Home Office minister, and his colleague, Joan Ryan, criminal records minister, over an Acpo letter to ministers in October, saying it did not and was not intended to brief ministers on the backlog or the police bid for extra resources.But the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said the report was a "glorified form of buck-passing" and it beggared belief that the October Acpo letter did not set alarm bells ringing. The shadow home secretary, David Davis, also described the report as a whitewash, and as a crude attempt to manipulate the media by seeking to blame officials while exonerating ministers.Sir David Normington, the Home Office's most senior civil servant, said they were determined to learn the lessons of the affair, but insisted the department had already moved on from the picture painted in the report.The messages August 5 1998, Home Office to National Criminal Intelligence Service: "The [Home Office] has long agreed with Interpol London that without fingerprints the information submitted ... was worthless"October 31 2005, Association of Chief Police Officers' criminal records officer to Home Office: "Stacks of convictions relating to UK nationals have piled up in the UK central authority for the last six years without being input to the Police National Computer"August 15 2006, internal Criminal Records Bureau email to senior official saying he "may also wish to advise ministers before we act given the likelihood of what may result if this situation becomes more widely known. The inevitable questions will be asked as to why this information was not actioned before now ... you may wish to flag this issue up to your opposite numbers in the Home Office ... prior to taking the issue to ministers"September 25 2006, Home Office official to Acpo official: "I understand there is still quite a pile of papers inherited from the previous arrangements - I think you showed us some of the boxes"October 3 2006, Adrian McAllister, Hampshire's deputy chief constable. to police minister Tony McNulty, which he has denied seeing: "We have a significant number of UK nationals who commit serious offences whilst abroad. In most cases the police and other criminal justice partners, including the courts, are completely unaware of such offending"October 19 2006, Acpo official to Home Office on level of risk of failure to record overseas convictions: "The potential risk is enormous and we don't yet have any particular 'horror stories' but I am sure they will come out ... we have identified to date: 27 rapes and 47 serious sex abuse cases [50% on children] committed by UK nationals over the past 7 years ... Most offenders are not on the PNC [police national computer] and therefore not on sex offenders register, nor are their fingerprints on Ident1 [identification technology] and their DNA has never been searched on the national DNA database."March 2 2007, official inquiry report: "I have found no evidence that the existence of the accumulated records were brought to ministerial attention at any time prior to January 9 2007."
