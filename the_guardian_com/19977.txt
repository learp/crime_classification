The link between alcohol and violence against women is highlighted in a hard-hitting poster campaign being launched today.Posters with the strapline "Who's looking out for you?" are to appear in more than 500 pub toilets around the country over the next month. They will show a woman sitting in a pub with a man lurking in the background with the suggestion that she is at risk of violence. The drinks industry lobby organisation the Portman Group, which is behind the campaign, said it wanted to emphasise to young women the dangers of over-indulging. These include using an unlicensed minicab, going home with a stranger, having unprotected sex or even assault or rape. Jean Coussins, chief executive of the Portman Group, warned: "Alcohol affects your judgment."
