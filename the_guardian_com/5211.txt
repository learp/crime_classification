A British-based Tamil who illegally supplied electrical equipment and documents to insurgents in Sri Lanka was jailed for two years today.Arunachalam Chrishanthakumar, 52, coordinated the supply of materials for the Tamil Tigers between 2003 and 2006.Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for the prosecution, said the defendant procured equipment for the group with an "obvious terrorist purpose".Mr Justice Saunders said: "This was a protracted, deliberate breaking of a law. These are very serious offences which warrant substantial sentences."The terrorist law has to be obeyed as part of our obligations internationally."But the judge decided the case was "exceptional" as, at the time the offences were carried out, the Tamil Tigers were not banned in Sri Lanka and peace negotiations were taking place.He paid tribute to the defendant's "humanitarian" work, which he said he hoped would continue once he had completed his sentence.The judge told the Old Bailey: "He is a thoroughly decent man who deliberately broke the law in support of a cause he fervently believed in."
