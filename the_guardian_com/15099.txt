A murder investigation has been launched after a man in his 20s was stabbed to death in north London.The victim, who has not been identified, was found collapsed on a residential street in the Woodside Park area of Barnet on Tuesday afternoon.Police and the London ambulance service were called to the scene at the junction of Woodside Grange Road and Grange Way at 2.43pm. Paramedics treated the victim for a single stab wound and he was taken to hospital but died a short while later.A woman living near the scene, who did not want to be named, said: “Nowadays there are stabbings every day. When it’s close to you, it’s frightening, it’s scary. I feel so sorry for the poor boy who’s lost his life.”One witness who tried to save the victim told the Evening Standard that he arrived in a car with his girlfriend before having a row with a man over a £120 debt.They told the newspaper: “You could hear shouting. They were saying, ‘You were supposed to give me my £120, why didn’t you bring my £120?’ Then three men turned up in a car and they all got into an argument. One of them then slashed him across the chest.“I ran out with tea towels and tried to save him by putting pressure on his chest wound. By this time his girlfriend had got out of the car when she saw him staggering away, and was just screaming and screaming, ‘They have stabbed him’, and while he was on the floor, she was screaming, ‘Ali, I love you, I love you, Ali’.“She was praying there on the floor next to him and reciting the Qur’an while he was in and out of consciousness. It was terrible. I couldn’t sleep last night, all I can see is his face.”Detectives from the Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command are investigating the death and have appealed for witnesses to come forward.So far no arrests have been made. Officers are in the process of informing the man’s next of kin and a postmortem will take place in due course.
