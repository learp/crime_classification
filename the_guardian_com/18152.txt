A priest who repeatedly changed his story at the trial of Polish student Angelika Kluk's killer escaped jail today despite having been found in contempt of court.Father Gerry Nugent was sentenced to 100 hours community service and placed on probation for one year at the high court in Edinburgh after Judge Lord Menzies found him guilty of contempt due to prevarication.The 63-year-old priest failed to give full answers to a number of questions while giving evidence in the case, and also changed his story in three separate places. On Friday, the convicted child rapist Peter Tobin was jailed for life for raping and murdering 23-year-old Ms Kluk. He dumped her body in a crypt at St Patrick's in Glasgow, Fr Nugent's church. Fr Nugent - who admitted during the case that he was an alcoholic and told the court he and Ms Kluk had a sexual relationship - was repeatedly warned by the judge to give clear answers as he gave evidence.However, at the end of the evidence, Lord Menzies found him in contempt by prevarication. The ruling was kept from the jury and could not be reported until the end of the murder trial.Passing sentence today, the judge said he would normally impose a jail sentence for such an offence, but was taking into account Fr Nugent's "outstanding history" of helping others and apparent psychiatric troubles at the time."You were found to be in contempt of court by prevarication in a very important trial - a trial which could hardly have had a higher profile and a trial which could hardly have been more important, involving as it did a charge of murder and rape of a young woman who was staying in your own chapel house," Lord Menzies said.He told the priest he had answered questions with "different" and "contradictory" answers within a relatively short period of time, despite being given several warnings.However, he added: "I take account of the fact that you have no relevant previous convictions and indeed it appears that you have had an outstanding history as a parish priest, helping others over many years."He said reports appeared to show that Fr Nugent was suffering from a psychiatric disorder at the time he was giving evidence.The priest told the trial he felt "shame" and "disgust" with himself for having a sexual relationship with Ms Kluk, a language student who was working in Scotland to raise funds for her studies in Gdansk, Poland.She lived at the chapel house and helped out around the church in return for bed and board.Valerie Spacey QC, representing Fr Nugent, said he wanted to make an "unequivocal apology" to the court for his behaviour, adding that he had been "under immense strain" and did not properly consider his evidence beforehand.The Archdiocese of Glasgow said it "fully respects and understands the court's decision", and that Fr Nugent was responsible for his actions."The archbishop has already apologised to all who have been hurt or scandalised, and now repeats this apology," it said in a statement.
