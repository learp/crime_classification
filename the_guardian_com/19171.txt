The Duke of York's ex-girlfriend Koo Stark appeared in court on Friday accused of stealing a painting worth £40,000 from a former partner.The 56-year-old actor, photographer and artist, who dated Andrew in the early 1980s, appeared at west London magistrates' court under her real name of Kathleen Stark.It is alleged she stole the painting from the flat of her former partner Warren Walker, father of her daughter Tatiana.Stark, who lives near Sloane Square in central London, denied stealing the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting, which depicts a moonlit coastal landscape.American-born Stark, then aged 26, dated the Duke of York after his return from the Falklands War in 1982. They went out together for 18 months. He went on to marry Sarah Ferguson in 1986.In February last year, Stark was made bankrupt at the high court over an unpaid hotel bill of £38,680.The bankruptcy petition was brought by the Jumeirah hotel group over her stay at the five-star Jumeirah Carlton Tower Hotel in London's Knightsbridge area in 2008.Stark will next appear at west London magistrates' court on 16 November before the case is sent to the crown court.
