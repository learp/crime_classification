Babysitter Suzanne Holdsworth was today cleared of murdering toddler Kyle Fisher, marking the end of a long campaign to clear her name.A jury at Teesside crown court acquitted Holdsworth, 38, of Seacroft, Leeds, of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter, following a retrial.The mother-of-two was originally convicted of the two-year-old's murder in March 2005 and jailed for life but the court of appeal overturned her conviction after doubts were raised about medical evidence presented in the first trial.During the retrial the jury was given the stark choice of deciding whether Holdsworth or Kyle's mother, Clare Fisher, 24, caused the child's severe head injuries.During Holdsworth's original trial she was accused of repeatedly banging Kyle's head against a wooden banister with as much force as a 60mph crash, after losing her temper. However, doubts were first raised about her conviction by journalist John Sweeney in a report for BBC Newsnight.The programme interviewed a leading neuropathologist, Dr Wainey Squier, who later gave evidence for the defence in the retrial. She said it was "unlikely" Kyle had suffered a massive blow to the head.In May the appeal court overturned Holdsworth's conviction after ruling it unsafe and ordered a retrial.The jury heard that the doctors who gave evidence at the trial "got it wrong" and collectively failed to diagnose that Kyle had a "highly unusual brain", with abnormalities that predisposed him to epilepsy.Fresh evidence established there was a reasonable possibility that the toddler suffered a prolonged epileptic seizure.During the retrial, which began on 1 December, the prosecution maintained that the former supermarket shelf stacker had attacked Kyle after his single mother, Clare Fisher, had gone out for the night drinking.Holdsworth said the two-year-old suddenly "went floppy" and collapsed at her then home in Hartlepool, on 21 July 2004 as they sat on her sofa watching television. He died two days later after suffering bleeding in his skull and brain swelling, caused, the prosecution said, by severe head trauma no more than 15 minutes earlier.The defence relied upon two medical experts who said an epileptic seizure was most likely to have led to the death of the two-year-old.Squier said the prosecution's case that Kyle was repeatedly banged against a banister "would fly in the face of a large amount of clinical evidence". The consultant said she could not agree with the assertion that Kyle's injuries could only have been caused by him having his head smashed against the wooden banister.Squier, now based at the University of Oxford, told the jury that her opinion was that an epileptic seizure was "far more likely".Kyle suffered from a number of brain abnormalities, some of which on their own would have left him predisposed to epilepsy, she said. The jury was told that 80% of children with any one of the abnormalities would develop epilepsy.
