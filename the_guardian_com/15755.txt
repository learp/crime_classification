The landlord arrested on suspicion of the murder of Jo Yeates has criticised police for wasting "time and attention" on him.Former public school teacher Christopher Jefferies was held for three days by detectives investigating Yeates' murder.In an interview with ITV news, Jefferies said: "A lot of their time and attention was taken up with me. It's absolutely clear that the focus should have been elsewhere."Jefferies, who was landlord of both Yeates and Tabak and lived in the same building, said he felt "numb" on arrest, and then angry."I knew that I was innocent. I was required to go through these very protracted series of interviews during the course of three days."Whether they were making other inquiries at the same time or not, I don't know."Jefferies said he was very upset at the way sections of the media portrayed him. "This was an entirely foreign personality that was being foisted on me," he said.After he was freed, he tended to stay inside, only going out occasionally under the cover of darkness. "It was certainly the most difficult time of my life," he said.During the trial it emerged that Tabak had tried to shift blame on to Jefferies by telling police the landlord had moved his car on the night of the killing. The judge, Mr Justice Fielding, said it was an "aggravating feature" of the case that he had tried to blame Jefferies.Avon and Somerset police reject the suggestion they should have got to Tabak sooner, pointing out that he left the Bristol area for Cambridge and Holland before Yeates' body was found. They declined to comment on Jefferies' criticism.
