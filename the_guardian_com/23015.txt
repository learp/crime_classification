Prisoners are to be offered soothing massages and relaxation treatments, it was revealed today.A new prison in Peterborough has advertised for two part-time holistic therapists to provide inmates with a range of treatments like those offered at health and beauty salons. United Kingdom Detention Services (UKDS), which runs the 840-bed, category B prison, wants to offer its inmates reflexology, aromatherapy and Indian head massage. The move has angered MPs, who have accused the prison of pampering inmates and sending out the wrong message. The MP for Peterborough, Stewart Jackson, said: "It is wrong prisoners are treated in this way. Are they using it as a Butlin's holiday camp? "It reflects badly on hard-working families in the city that prisoners, men and women guilty of committing serious crimes, are being pampered instead of punished. "Inmates should be taught the basic skills, such as reading and writing, to aid their rehabilitation." But a UKDS spokesman, Nicholas Hopkins, said the treatments would not be available to all inmates. He said: "We will be working alongside other health-care operators to assess whether certain prisoners are considered suitable for alternative therapies. "Part of the prison's role is to assist prisoners, whether that is helping with educational difficulties, vocational skills, drug dependency or self-harming. "Indications from other establishments have shown there are prisoners for whom this would be an excellent alternative treatment."
