The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby triggered the second major review of counter-terrorism in Britain since the coalition government came to power.The first led to the early abolition of control orders and the scaling back of the use of counter-terror stop-and-search powers as Conservative and Liberal Democrat ministers implemented their pre-election commitments to civil liberties.The second looks likely to introduce new "terror asbos" to "silence preachers of hate" and ban groups that "seek to undermine democracy". Ministers want to sharpen the struggle against "the distinct ideology of Islamist extremism" in universities, on the internet and in prisons.This drive is to be underpinned by a new official definition of extremism that specifically includes "a distorted interpretation of Islam".And it marks a break from the last Labour government's drive against "violent extremism", which was aimed at disrupting extremist organisations that espoused violence whether they were Islamists inspired by al-Qaida, the extreme right, or those motivated by single issues, such as animal rights.The review of counter-terror laws, however, marked a much more muted response to Rigby's murder than those that have followed previous terrorist atrocities on the streets of Britain. The official reaction was in sharp contrast to Tony Blair's 12-point plan to show "the rules of the game are changing", which followed the London bombings of 7 July 2005. Some of those measures, such as 90-day pre-charge detention, banning the non-violent pan-Islamic political group Hizb ut-Tahrir, extending control orders and new powers to close mosques have since been abandoned or were never implemented.In recognition of the civil liberties roots of the coalition, David Cameron and the home secretary, Theresa May, conscious of Blair's legacy, went out of their way to avoid any "kneejerk" reaction to the murder, despite strong pressure from her former Conservative and Labour predecessors to revive the "snooper's charter" during the immediate aftermath.The prime minister forestalled any hurried move towards new counter-terror laws by announcing that the intelligence and security committee (ISC), made up of senior parliamentarians, would investigate the wider role of the police and intelligence services, including what MI5 knew about Rigby's killers, particularly Michael Adebolajo, who claimed he had been asked to work for the security services six months before.At first Cameron and May embraced the push to revive the "snooper's charter" – the legislation needed to require the internet companies to store and track everyone's internet use and phone data for up to a year – but they quickly acknowledged that it was not a practical political proposition without the support of the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats.Instead Cameron set up his counter-terror taskforce – which was chaired by Clegg and included May, the head of MI5 and the Metropolitan police commissioner – to carry out the review of legislation. Its report proposing limited changes, including the terror asbos and new definition of extremism, came out this month. The ISC report may yet prompt further demands for changes.There was considerable ambivalence at the highest levels of Whitehall on the day of the Rigby killing whether or not it should be treated as an act of terrorism rather than "simply" as a particularly barbaric murder.The Met's counter-terrorism command quickly took over the investigation. Although it was treated as an act of terrorism as the motivation of the killers quickly became clear, they were not arrested or investigated under counter-terrorism laws.As Cressida Dick, the Met's head of counter-terrorism, has pointed out, the normal criminal law allowed the police greater leeway than the counter-terrorism legislation would have done. For example, criminal law enabled the police to arrest the two suspects while they were in hospital without "starting the clock" on the time limits on their pre-charge detention.The view that this was a one-off barbaric murder rather than part of a wider terrorist campaign was also underlined by the national threat level from international terrorism remaining unchanged at "substantial" in the wake of the killing.A substantial threat level means an attack is regarded as a strong possibility rather than highly likely or expected imminently and suggests officials do not believe Britain faces a wave of similar attacks.
