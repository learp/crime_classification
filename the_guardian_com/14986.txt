A long-serving police officer left blind in one eye after being shot with a rubber bullet has taken to YouTube to chronicle his ordeal.Sgt Jon King of Staffordshire police was one of the police and ambulance officers who attended an address in Rugeley last month to detain a man under the mental health act.The 34-year-old man used a gas-powered handgun to shoot King at least twice.In the video, he tells viewers how the first shot struck his right eye and “smashed my eyeball. I’ve had surgery on it, but am completely blind.”A second “little hard rubber bullet” struck his left eye a glancing blow, but his vision has not been impaired by the attack.A man the officers were attempting to detain was later held and taken to a psychiatric unit for treatment.King, 48, is part of the Cannock Chase district local policing team in Staffordshire, and has served for 26 years.In the upbeat recording, he reveals: “I think I’m going to have a prosthetic eye. I want to post some videos as we go along. I’ve got an appointment in two weeks with the plastics team and I’ll see what they can do for me.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Jon King describes his injuries in a video posted on YouTubeHe described the shootings as “just one of those things” that police officers could face in the course of their duties.“I’m not going into the shooting side of it,” he said. “I’ve got 26 years’ service and those sort of things just happen, I think”.A spokesman for Staffordshire police said the force was proud of King and his decision to share his personal prosthetic eye journey on YouTube after being shot while on duty.Serious injured suffered by police officers on duty are reasonably rare, with the total for most forces in single digits each year. In 2009/10, Staffordshire recorded none, while there were 133 for the Metropolitan Police, 39 in South Wales, 33 in Lancashire and 20 in Merseyside, according to Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary figures.
