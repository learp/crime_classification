The government must take a fresh look at policy if over-representation of people from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in the criminal justice system is to be addressed, according to a new study published today.Less Equal Than Others: Ethnic Minorities and the Criminal Justice System, carried out by Race for Justice, a new coalition of voluntary organisations working with BME offenders, ex-offenders and their families, found that across the criminal justice system people from BME backgrounds were treated differently from their white counterparts. This included when suspects, defendants, victims and witnesses, the report concluded.Around 26% of the prison population in England and Wales is from a BME background when the same groups account for 9% of the broader population, the report said. Looking at the direct experience of BME communities of the system, it found they were more likely to be prosecuted, less likely to be cautioned, less likely to get bail and more likely to serve longer prison sentences for similar offences.A spokesman for Race for Justice said pooling the resources of a number of voluntary groups working in the BME and criminal justice sectors would help with areas such as crime prevention, but that a lack of funding and resources continues to make long-term impact on over-representation difficult."While the BME voluntary sector can play a crucial role in helping to develop crime prevention strategies, according to the report, many of these organisations feel their contribution is undermined due to inadequate funding and a failure by statutory agencies to engage with them effective," the spokesman said.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "Reform of the criminal justice system is at the heart of the government's priorities. The system is employing more people from black and minority ethnic communities than ever before and we have new measures in place to ensure that any local issues of concern are dealt with quickly and effectively. "We are committed to creating a system that is working for, and representative of, all sections of the community. There will be no let up in driving forward the improvements still needed."Today's report makes a number of recommendations for how the government could work with the voluntary sector to improve the situation. These include government departments identifying best practice in the BME voluntary sector and publicising findings, making criminal justice agencies more accountable, and monitoring specific targets to reduce over-representation. It also suggests urgent action to deal with the high levels of female BME prisoners.
