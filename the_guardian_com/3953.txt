The jury in the trial of two men accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence has retired to consider its verdicts.Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, both from south-east London, deny murdering the black teenager, who was killed in a racist attack in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.The trial, which began at the Old Bailey in London on 14 November, is now in its seventh week.The court was opened especially this week during the holiday period so the case could continue between Christmas and the new year.Earlier, Mr Justice Treacy told the panel of four women and eight men that they must "reach verdicts on the basis of cool, calm consideration".Finishing his summing-up on Thursday, the judge continued going through forensic evidence found on clothing seized from Dobson and Norris's homes, and the testimony that they gave to the court.The judge also summarised the prosecution and defence closing speeches, before reiterating key steps that the jurors must go through to reach a verdict. He stressed that they should take as long as they needed to come to a decision. "You should take as long as you need to be faithful to your oath. You took an oath to consider the evidence and to return true verdicts according to the evidence. So you take as long or as little as you need."The jury was sent out at around 2.40pm.
