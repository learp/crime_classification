A 15-year-old boy has been remanded in custody today charged with the murder of schoolboy Luke Walmsley at Skegness magistrates court.The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address, and was remanded into custody until next Wednesday, when he will reappear at a youth court. Luke, 14, was stabbed through the heart at Birkbeck School, in North Somercotes, Lincolnshire on Tuesday morning.During today's 20-minute hearing, the accused stood in a glass-panelled dock flanked by two security guards. He was wearing blue jeans, a shirt and blue sweatshirt. The clerk of the court asked the defendant to confirm his personal details before reading the charge to him. He stood silently with his head bowed throughout the hearing. Martin Kirby-Sykes outlined the nature of the charge on behalf of the Crown and asked magistrates to remand the youth in custody. The boy's father was in court to witness the proceedings and sat alongside dozens of press and television reporters who filled the public gallery. The youth's solicitor, Lloyd Edwards, did not apply for bail and presiding magistrate Phillip Key remanded the youth, who lives in the north Lincolnshire area, into secure accommodation until next Wednesday. Birkbeck School, which had been closed since the incident, was reopening today for a "fellowship day". Lessons will resume on Monday, Mr Loveridge said.Teacher leaders have called for a government investigation into school security following the tragedy.
