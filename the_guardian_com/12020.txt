A quick-thinking bank worker helped put a robber behind bars by slipping red dye into bundles of cash, Cambridgeshire police have said.Brian Murphy, 52, walked calmly into a NatWest branch in Cambridge wearing sunglasses and a hat and demanded cash. He took more than £6,000, but only after a worker put the dye among the banknotes.Police followed the trail left by the man as he went on a spending spree, and he was subsequently caught and jailed for six years following a trial at Cambridge crown court.Murphy had approached a cashier and placed a note on the screen saying: “Give me all the money. This is a robbery.” He said someone would get hurt if the money was not handed over and pointed to his bag as if it contained a weapon.Hours after the robbery on 27 April, he spent some of the dyed notes in a local bookmaker’s and then travelled by train from Cambridge to Great Yarmouth.Police followed the dye trail around Norfolk and Suffolk until they caught him spending some of the cash in a casino in Great Yarmouth in the early hours of 30 April.While on the run, Murphy tried to disguise his identity by using different names and booking into a local caravan site. A search of the caravan revealed a stash of dyed banknotes inside a holdall. Clothing he had worn was also stained with red dye.Murphy, of Crowland Way, Cambridge, denied robbery but was found guilty following a two-day trial on 22 September.DC Sean Denby, who led the investigation, said: “The red dye pack was key to identifying Murphy, and the cashier showed true bravery while being threatened by him.“Murphy was desperate to obtain money by whatever means and refused to account for his actions throughout the investigation and trial.”
