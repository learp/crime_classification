A wealthy businessman and publisher was jailed for two years today after admitting stealing pages from about 150 rare and priceless books at the Bodleian and British libraries.Iranian-born Farhad Hakimzadeh cut leaves out of the books at the libraries and inserted the pages into his own copies of the same books, Wood Green crown court in north London heard.In mitigation, his barrister, William Boyce, said that as a wealthy man Hakimzadeh had no need to steal the items for financial gain and was instead motivated by obsessive compulsive disorder.The court heard that Hakimzadeh, who has an American passport, boasted his personal library was the fourth best of its kind in the world, behind only the British Library, the Bodleian and a university library in the United States.The 10 British Library works he admitted defacing were worth £71,000 alone. They dated from as early as the 16th century and all concerned European interaction with the Middle East. A map worth £30,000 was cut out of one of them.Passing sentence, judge Peter Ader said the offences were very serious whether or not they were motivated by financial profit."As an author, you cannot have been unaware of the damage you were causing," he said. "You have a deep love of books, perhaps so deep that it goes to excess. I have no doubt that you were stealing in order to enhance your library and your collection."Whether it was for money or for a rather vain wish to improve your collection is perhaps no consolation to the losers."Police found the altered editions along with several loose pages in the large library at his home in Knightsbridge, central London.British Library staff believe he smuggled a scalpel into the building and positioned himself out of the sight of security cameras to commit his crimes.Experts found that around 150 books he accessed were defaced.The head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, said: "Obviously I'm angry because this is somebody extremely rich who has damaged something which belongs to everybody, completely selfishly destroyed something for his own personal benefit which this nation has invested in over generations."Some of the objects which we believe are damaged have been cared for by the nation for centuries."Hakimzadeh, who is a director of the Iranian Heritage Foundation and a published author, pleaded guilty to 14 counts of theft in May.Jensen said some of the stolen pages were in a significantly better condition than those in Hakimzadeh's books, leaving him with what appeared to be a much improved copy.His crimes came to light when a reader alerted British Library staff that a book had been damaged.From there, two teams meticulously examined 842 books he had accessed, some in multiple volumes, to see if they had been defaced.Some of the cuts Hakimzadeh made were so precise they were barely visible, Jensen said. He called the vandalism "an attack on the nation's collective memory of its own past".Detective Chief Inspector Dave Cobb, of the Metropolitan police, said Hakimzadeh avoided detection by choosing rare material that only an expert would spot had been damaged.Hakimzadeh first became a member of the British Library in 1998. His reader card was suspended in 2006 when the damage was discovered.His thefts from the Bodleian, in Oxford University, dated back to 2003.The businessman, 60, of Knightsbridge, south-west London, is director of a company that publishes books on the Middle East. Separate civil proceedings have been launched by the British Library against him.
