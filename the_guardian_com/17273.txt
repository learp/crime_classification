A man walked free from court yesterday after he admitted setting alight an RAF pilot who was dressed as a sheep for a fancy dress party. Phillip Buckingham, 24, set fire to the costume, made from cotton wool and pillows, at a graduation party at Linton-on-Ouse airbase in North Yorkshire in November.His victim, Martin Geraghty, 26, suffered burns that required skin grafts in the incident, which followed a traditional piano-burning ceremony, Teesside crown court heard. Buckingham, of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, admitted causing grievous bodily harm as part of a "stupid, drunken prank which went very badly wrong", the court heard.The judge, Brian Forster, handed him a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for a year, and ordered him to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and to pay his victim £7,500 in compensation. Buckingham must also pay £900 prosecution costs. The judge described it as a "reckless prank". Buckingham, who works in research and development for a water company, was a guest of two trainee pilots at the party, which had a rural theme. They were watching the piano-burning ceremony, the court heard. Dan Cordey, prosecuting, said: "It led to a discussion about what would happen to Martin Geraghty if he attempted the feat in his fancy dress costume. The consensus was it was a stupid idea."Buckingham took a lighter from his pocket and set fire to Geraghty's costume. Geraghty threw himself to the ground and rolled on the floor, trying to put out the flames, while people threw drinks over him. Buckingham was arrested at the base and in interviews said he had been so drunk he could remember little about the incident. Geraghty, who was in training at the time, was off work for six weeks but managed to graduate in March despite his injuries, which required skin grafts.
