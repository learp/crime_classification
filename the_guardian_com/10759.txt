Elliot White was raised by a single mother on the tough streets of west London. When he was just a year old, his mother served a 15-month jail sentence for organising a sex party. And yet for a while it seemed White might make something of himself. He did well at school, passing 10 GCSEs. At the age of 15, he was one of a dozen pupils from schools in Kensington and Chelsea to attend a two-week basketball camp in Budapest run by the then England coach, Laszlo Nemeth. It gave the boy a glimpse of the sort of life a normal teenager might aspire to.But it was not to be. His early promise squandered, he soon started smoking marijuana and was financing his habit by selling heroin and cocaine.This addiction led him to criminal activity and in 2001 he was given 18 months in custody for possession with intent to supply class A drugs. In 2003, he was sentenced to 12 months' community rehabilitation for the possession of cocaine and heroin. A year later, White became the subject of a six-month drug treatment and testing order which required him to attend a day programme in Munster Road in Fulham.In February 2004 he claimed to be clean, but by September he had tested positive for cocaine, morphine, cannabis and opiates. In November 2004 he tested positive for cannabis.Unable to pay for his drugs and by now owing thousands of pounds to dealers, White told his resourceful accomplice Damien Hanson that he desperately needed money and found that his old friend had a plan. They took knives and a postman's jacket and headed off to the Monckton home in Upper Cheyne Row.White maintained that he did not know Hanson carried a knife, and though he moved to restrain John Monckton, he said he did not realise Hanson was stabbing him. But with its manslaughter verdict, the jury held him partly culpable for the financier's death.
