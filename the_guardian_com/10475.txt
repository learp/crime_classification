A bar manager who claimed voices in his head ordered him to kill his girlfriend and their 10-month-old daughter was today told he will spend at least 26 years in prison for their murders.Anthony Marsh stabbed Stephanie Bellinger, 24, more than 30 times as she slept in the bedroom of their home in Totton, Hampshire, in February. Their daughter, Lili Marsh, was stabbed once through the head as she lay on the same bed.Marsh was found guilty of the two murders by a jury yesterday and the term set by Mr Justice Holroyde is the minimum he will serve before he can be eligible for parole.The prosecution said the killing of Bellinger, a receptionist, had "powerful elements of sexual motivation and revenge".During the two-week trial the jury heard that Marsh suffered from bipolar disorder and the family were in £13,000 debt, partly because he lost his job after he stole from a pub he worked in.He often fled the family home and went to other cities, sleeping rough before handing himself in at hospitals.Marsh told police he heard voices telling him to kill his girlfriend and daughter. He did not kill the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old son, whom he left locked in the house after the murders, because he was able to resist the voices, he claimed.He said he had counted to 50 several times before he started the attack but continued as Bellinger screamed and tried to fend off the blade. He then killed Lili.At the end of the attack, he left the knife embedded in Bellinger's mouth and fled the scene.Bellinger's mother and sister discovered the "truly distressing scene" when they broke in and found the son unharmed but alone.The judge called the murders "deliberate, dreadful and selfish". He said the surviving child had been left in a "scene of dreadful bloodshed" and faced a life as "an orphan of one parent by the crime of another"."He probably took the cordless telephone to his dead mother as it rang as family tried to contact her," the judge told the court.He said he had inferred that Marsh deliberately left the body of Bellinger in such a way, with the knife plunged into her mouth and half-naked, to leave "a most dreadful scene for whoever found the bodies"."You must have known that it was likely that first to see the bodies would be a close family member – probably Stephanie's mother," Holroyde said."She and Stephanie's sister have to live with the loss of two loved ones but also with the memory of finding the bodies. For a mother and sister to find a loved one in such a position is truly appalling."As an intelligent man, I can only conclude you must have thought about that at some stage."After Marsh's conviction, the family issued a statement in which they said: "We believe that Anthony Marsh is a dangerous and violent person, particularly towards women and female children, and he should be kept in a secure environment for the rest of his life."The impact on Stephanie's family and friends is huge. Like a huge boulder, crashing into a pond, those closest feel the biggest impact of this awful incident."The statement said the surviving child was a special little boy with a wonderful sense of humour but the murders by his father would affect him throughout his life.
