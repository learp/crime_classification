A senior police officer hit back today at David Cameron's description of "anarchy" on Britain's streets. Mr Cameron, the Conservative party leader, has highlighted high-profile gun and knife crimes as part of his attack on the government over social breakdown.Ken Jones, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers' (Acpo), said he was "baffled" by the description of crime levels and called for political leaders to be more "calm, measured and objective" in public statements about crime."You talk about the London murder rate and it's a real problem, but if you look at similar cities in the US it's about five times lower," he said in an interview."People are distorting the figures for their own ends and I think we need to try and rebuild trust."Mr Jones said he did not think it was a deliberate attempt to go out and distort, but displayed "a lack of trust in the data". "We are facing the lowest risk of being a victim of crime for over a quarter of a century. Violent crime is at the lowest it has been since the mid-90s," he added.He told told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the "vast majority" of people lived in "secure confident communities", but added: "There is a minority which don't and it is those that need our leadership, and they need people in leadership positions in politics, government and the media to actually show some leadership and be more calm and measured and objective over this."Mr Cameron has linked a failure to tackle yob culture to a spate of murders that have hit the headlines in recent weeks. Including the fatal shooting of 11-year-old Rhys Jones and the murder of Garry Newlove, 47, a father of three who was killed after challenging a gang of yobs outside his Warrington home.He has accused Labour of "knee-jerk" law and order reforms and suggested possible curbs on violent video games, saying "anarchy in the UK" would flourish unless families and communities were strengthened.Rhys' murder has sparked worldwide revulsion and a national debate on youth and gun crime in Britain.
