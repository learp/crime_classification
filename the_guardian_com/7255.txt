A jury was today discharged after failing to reach a verdict in the trial of a financial adviser accused of murdering the reclusive 84-year-old writer Allan Chappelow.Wang Yam, 46, who claimed to be one of the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in China that led to the Tiananmen Square massacre, was accused of killing Chappelow at the author's dilapidated £2.5m home in Hampstead, north-west London, in May 2006.Parts of the two-month trial at the Old Bailey were held in secret for national security reasons, allegedly at the request of MI6, although no further explanation for such sensitivity of the trial was given.Chappelow, a biographer of the playwright George Bernard Shaw, was found dead, with severe head injuries, beneath a metre-high pile of his own page proofs from Yale University Press, in June 2006.His face and head had been smashed with a heavy implement. Blood was spattered a metre and a half up the walls and his clothed torso was covered in wax and burns.For about a month before Chappelow's body was discovered someone had been stealing his post and using information from it to gain access to his bank and credit card accounts.Yesterday Yam was found guilty, by an 11-1 majority, of obtaining a £20,000 money transfer by deception and of stealing £20 from a bank machine. Today a jury also convicted him of handling stolen goods in relation to a mobile phone, four blank cheques and cash. But they were unable to reach verdicts in relation to charges of murder and burglary, as well as a count of stealing mail, and were discharged by the trial judge, Mr Justice Ouseley. Yam, a British citizen born in China, who was extradited from Switzerland to face trial, is expected to face a retrial at a later date.The prosecution alleged that Yam killed Chappelow to steal his identity and defraud him of his wealth. But the defence claimed a criminal gang murdered the author and Yam, who lived a few streets away from Chappelow in Hampstead, denied knowing the writer or ever having been to his home.Both sides said that there was no forensic evidence linking Yam to the murder.
