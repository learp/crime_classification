The Liberal Democrats will today tackle criticisms of their law and order policies by pledging to put 10,000 more police on the streets as part of a "tough and smart" approach.Opponents see the issue as one of the party's main weak spots, with the Tories last week unveiling a poster branding the Liberal Democrats "soft on crime".But in a bullish speech, the party leader Charles Kennedy will stress the importance of visible policing in the party's overall strategy, also promising to recruit 20,000 more community support officers. In total, that would put an average of 50 additional law and order personnel on the streets of the average constituency. The Lib Dems say they would pay for the extra police by scrapping the government's proposal to introduce a national identity card system.
