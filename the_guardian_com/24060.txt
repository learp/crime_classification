A man who held up a sex shop at gunpoint while wearing a red dress and wig is being sought by police in Liverpool.The man threatened a member of staff with what appeared to be a black handgun at the Nice’n’Naughty adult shop on Colquitt Street in the city centre at 5.40pm on Sunday. Merseyside police said he took money from the counter and left after a brief struggle.The force has issued CCTV images of the man. DI Steve McGrath, of Liverpool CID, said: “We are keen to speak with the man pictured to assist us in our inquiries. The staff at the shop were thankfully unhurt but understandably distressed to be threatened with what had the appearance of a firearm, regardless of whether it was real or fake.”He added: “I would appeal to anyone in the Colquitt Street area around 5.30pm who saw a man dressed as described and acting suspiciously to contact police at once. We have spoken with the owners and staff to offer reassurance but I want to assure all businesses that we will do everything possible to identify this offender and bring him to justice, and ensure Liverpool city centre is a safe place to live, work and visit.”
