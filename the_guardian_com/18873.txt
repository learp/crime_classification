A unit dedicated to improving rape investigations across London has had a dramatic impact, according to the Metropolitan police.Sir John Stevens, the Met commissioner, said that since April last year there had been a 13% rise in victims reporting allegations of rape - 277 more had come forward compared with the previous year. The Met also reports a 23% increase in the numbers arrested for rape. And the force has solved 100 more rape cases in the nine months up to January than it did during the 12 months to April 2002. In a study last year it was revealed that only one in 13 women reporting a rape eventually saw the assailant convicted. The report, produced by the inspectorates for the police and the crown prosecution service, found failures throughout the system and demanded more sensitive treatment of rape complainants. The Met had previously set up Project Sapphire, led by Detective Chief Inspector Richard Walton, to review strategy in rape investigations and victim care. One innovation was the establishment of the Haven, in Camberwell, south London, the capital's only sexual assault referral centre, where people reporting offences consult specially trained officers. Two further centres, in Paddington and Whitechapel, are now planned. Yesterday, Sir John also reported "extremely positive news" about other crime trends in London, though he warned that anti-terrorism operations would affect efforts to tackle some of the offences, particularly street robberies.
