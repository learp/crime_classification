Online child abuse images are becoming more extreme, more sadistic and more violent, with a higher proportion depicting the abuse of younger children, a Home Office minister has said.Damian Green, the minister for policing and criminal justice, said the number of individual children depicted in online abuse images, and therefore in need of protection, was estimated to run into the tens of thousands.Green raised the issue at an event with policing and online experts to plan the creation of a child abuse image database by the end of the year. The project is designed to produce a single, central, secure database of illegal images of children to help find the victims, as well as prosecute their abusers."We need to free up valuable police time from having to repeatedly view the same images found over and over again on seized computers," Green said. "Instead the police need to be able to search seized devices for illegal images more quickly, to know what colleagues across the country are investigating, and have technical assistance to ask where is the child, and how quickly can he or she be safeguarded?"Green said he had heard of cases where the sharing of an image between international police partners one afternoon had led to a child being found and protected on the other side of the world by the following morning.Green said that in 1990 there were an estimated 7,000 hard-copy images of child abuse in circulation. The development of the internet meant there were now millions of such images online, with the number of individual children depicted running into the tens of thousands."They are photographs and videos that record children being abused and raped," said Green. "Even more disturbingly, the research shows that these images appear to be becoming more extreme, more sadistic and more violent, with a greater proportion depicting the abuse of younger children."It's why I don't use the phrase 'child pornography'. It has got nothing to do with pornography. There is no legal 'child pornography'. These are vile, disgusting images."The database project builds on the initiative developed at a Downing Street summit last November when Google and Microsoft agreed to make changes to their search engines to prevent images and videos of, or pathways to, child abuse being returned from a blacklist of search terms, to make it harder for offenders to find the material.Now, whenever somebody searches for a blacklisted term, clear warning messages appear on screen outlining the consequences of the offender's action and encouraging them to get help. The messages appear against 13,000 search terms on Google alone.
