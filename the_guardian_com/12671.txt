A single mother put police and journalists to shame in their attempts to unravel the mysterious reappearance of the canoeist John Darwin by using a simple Google search, it emerged today.The woman found the picture that apparently shows Darwin with his wife, Anne, in Panama City in July last year.When confronted with the picture, which was printed in the Daily Mirror yesterday, Anne Darwin is reported to have admitted: "Yes that's him. My sons will never forgive me."The photograph was available on a website of the firm Move to Panama.It was found by the anonymous woman after she tapped in the words "John, Anne and Panama" into Google. She then forwarded the picture to both Cleveland police and the Mirror.She said when she forwarded the picture to detectives, she was told: "You're joking."She turned to the internet after becoming suspicious about the story, which has gripped the world's attention, and she admitted her scepticism had paid dividends.She told the Mirror that the Darwins should be nominated for a "World's Dumbest award".She said: "Not only were they photographed, but the date was actually on the picture."I'm a sceptic. Nobody can simply vanish in this day and age, there has to be something, some sign."Mrs Darwin, who sold her home in Seaton Carew, Hartlepool, and moved to Panama around six weeks ago, broke down as she told reporters in the Central American republic that her life had become a "nightmare".She confirmed that the picture did show her husband, who was officially declared dead in 2003.Yesterday, Mr Darwin was arrested on suspicion of fraud. Detectives investigating the case said they would examine the validity of the picture. But they said they had no immediate plans to travel to Panama.Darwin walked into a London police station on Saturday and announced: "I think I am a missing person."He was declared dead after his disappearance in March 2002 during a canoeing trip within sight of his home.Mrs Darwin, 55, claimed she had initially thought her husband had died in the canoeing accident, but realised he was still alive when he got in touch "years later".She said she had known he was going back to Britain but had not expected him to hand himself in to police.Mr Darwin was held at a Cleveland police station overnight and will be questioned this morning.
