An HIV-positive woman who infected her boyfriend has been jailed for 32 months. Sarah Porter, 43, kept her condition secret while having regular unprotected sex with a 31-year-old man with whom she had a two-year relationship. He attempted suicide after being diagnosed as HIV-positive.Porter, a receptionist from Kennington, south London, admitted one count of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent in May 2003. Inner London crown court heard that she was in denial about having the condition.After the hearing, police said Porter had refused to cooperate in tracking down her former sexual partners. Detective Sergeant Brian McClusky said: "We located four. One was infected, and the quality of his life has been severely curtailed. For the others, there was still heartbreak and stress for them and their partners as they waited for test results."Detectives began an investigation after a former boyfriend, referred to in court as Mr B, reported Porter to the police last May. He told officers he had been having regular unprotected sex with her, but had then heard rumours that she was HIV-positive. Mr B did not contract the virus.Police searched her flat and traced a previous boyfriend, Mr C, who told them Porter had given him the virus. The court heard that Mr C, a disc jockey and promoter from south London, had been in an exclusive relationship with Porter when he developed a sexually transmitted disease. He went for a check-up and discovered he also had HIV. Porter did not tell him that she had been diagnosed HIV-positive in February 2000. Instead she agreed to go for a test herself. Her boyfriend blamed himself for her positive result, the court heard. The couple stayed together, but her boyfriend then bumped into another man who told him that she had acquired the virus years before.
