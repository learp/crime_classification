Judges, magistrates and MPs were warned yesterday not to overreact to the overwhelming media coverage of recent horrific murder trials and drive the record prison population to even higher levels.The justice secretary, Jack Straw, also warned that media reporting of crime in general gave such a partial picture that it distorted the public mood and fuels the rise in the prison population.He told the Guardian criminal justice summit that the coverage of recent trials such as the Ipswich murders and the Sally Anne Bowman case, and calls in some quarters for a return of the death penalty, appeared to have had "a tangible impact on the prison population".Straw said magistrates and judges should be celebrated for their independence and impartiality but they did not operate in a vacuum, nor were they immune to the prevailing public and media climate."I think this has been particularly felt in the recent [Gary] Newlove and [Garry] Weddell cases, both of which involved crimes committed whilst on bail. It would be unrealistic to think that sentencers could be completely inured against the coverage of these cases. A free press is part of any effective democracy ... but there is a responsibility on politicians and sentencers not to overreact in such circumstances."Straw said he was not criticising the decision of the judges in the Newlove and Weddell cases but was using them to highlight how there are factors outside "our direct control" which can affect an already crowded prison population.He said the "confluence of events" appeared to have had a direct impact on the prison population, which was only 36 short of the 82,000 mark again last Friday.Newlove was beaten to death by drunken youths - including one who was on bail - after complaining about vandalism to cars parked in his street in Warrington. Weddell murdered his mother-in-law and then committed suicide after being released on bail while he was awaiting trial for the killing of his estranged wife.Straw said the sustained and substantial reduction in crime as measured by the British Crime Survey, with crime down by more than 30% over the past decade, had not been reflected in the media.He said the public believed what they read in newspapers or heard on television and when that story was partial it was no wonder that perceptions were out of kilter with the reality."He said all the polling evidence showed that when the public were asked what would most cut crime, only 6% said sending more offenders to jail was the answer: "So when I hear journalists saying that they are simply reflecting the views of their readers I have to question their interpretation ... When presented with the alternatives, very few people want to send more people to prison."
