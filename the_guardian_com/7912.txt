An "angry and aggressive" man who was arrested carrying an axe in a crowd waiting for Queen Elizabeth was jailed for a total of six years today.Plainclothes officers intercepted 34-year-old Daniel Bleazard close to Huddersfield railway station in May last year. Members of the public had tipped off uniformed police about a man pushing towards the front of the crowd, into an area where children had gathered. Officers handcuffed the struggling Bleazard and pulled him over the barrier. They found a felling axe in his bag with a 3ft long shaft. Father-of-three Bleazard, from Huddersfield, was given a three-year sentence for having an article with a blade and a further 18 months for breaching an antisocial behaviour order. He was also found guilty of another charge of having an article with a blade and one of going equipped for theft - relating to a different incident - and jailed for a further 18 months. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall said this should be added to the rest of his sentence to make a total of six years in prison. Hall told Bleazard his actions could have endangered innocent children if officers had had to open fire to protect the royal visitor. "You wanted to brandish that weapon in as close a proximity to Her Majesty as was possible," he said. "There cannot be any other legitimate explanation for your being in that crowd."You wanted to see how close you could get before you provoked a reaction from the armed police." He described Bleazard as an "angry and aggressive" man who had a string of minor convictions and a "deep, idiosyncratic hatred of authority". Bleazard had claimed in court that he needed the axe to chop wood at home because his chainsaw was broken and he had simply gone to take a photograph of the Queen.Hall said it was "bewildering" that CPS officials "at the highest levels" had tried to discontinue the case against Bleazard. Bradford crown court heard that the prosecution only continued following protests from the local police inspector.
