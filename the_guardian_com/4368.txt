His body was discovered in his bedroom on Wednesday, police said.Terry, a father-of-two, served as the honorary consul in Montego Bay, a popular tourist destination.A police spokesman said today: "The investigation into the murder of John Terry is progressing well and the police have received several important pieces of information from the public which are currently being acted upon."The investigators have not ruled out any motives at this time although they are prioritising a specific line of investigation."He said reports of a homophobic attack were "not consistent with the facts identified by investigators at this time", and were potentially misleading.The JCF said the "major person of interest" was seen near Terry's house on Tuesday evening. He is of slim build, brown complexion and is believed to be in his early 20s, according to police.He was last seen wearing a brown shirt, brown trousers, a brown cap with white on the peak and was said to be carrying a black and grey rucksack.Terry's lawyer Gordon Brown paid tribute to the honorary consul yesterday.He said: "John Terry was not only a client but also a friend. He was an extraordinary human being. He was quick-witted, very engaging and had a ready smile."He did extraordinary work for the British High Commission and in the interests of British citizens in Jamaica."Terry, who lived alone, was separated from his wife and leaves a son and daughter.Terry, who was born in New Zeland, was found in the bedroom of his Montego Bay home with cord and clothing round his neck, according to police.He worked in the tourism industry for around 30 years and was made an MBE in 1992.Honorary consuls are volunteers who help British nationals and others for whom the UK government has consular responsibility abroad.
