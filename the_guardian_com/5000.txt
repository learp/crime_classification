Detectives have arrested a 55-year-old man in connection with the murder of a "totally selfless" pensioner who was killed after going to the aid of a neighbour.Graham Buck, 66, was fatally stabbed on Saturday afternoon when he responded to cries from the home of 86-year-old Francis Cory-Wright in the village of Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, police said.Cory-Wright, who was jailed for 30 months in 2011 for indecently assaulting a 10-year-old boy in the 1970s, is thought to have been the target of a robbery.Hertfordshire police said Ian McLoughlin – also known as Ian John Baker – had been arrested in London at around 1am on Wednesday and was being questioned on suspicion of murder and robbery.Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff Hill said Buck, described as a retired financial industry worker, had paid the "ultimate price" for intervening during the robbery at the home of his neighbour."Mr Buck's actions were totally selfless and illustrate a deep sense of community spirit which deserves recognition and respect," he said."His family are receiving support from specialist officers and we extend our deepest sympathies to them at this truly dreadful time."Buck's family released a statement paying tribute to the father and grandfather."We have no words to express how much Graham will be missed," it said. "We were all in such a happy place as a family. We were all so settled, with growing numbers of grandchildren whom he adored being around."We haven't seen him happier than being around his grandchildren, he was so proud. We cannot get over that we have lost him."He's going to be missed by so many people."Hill said Cory-Wright was injured during the incident, but had since been discharged from hospital and was now in a "place of safety".
