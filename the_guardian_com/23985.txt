A 10-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of shooting an eight-year-old boy at a Traveller site in South Tyneside.The victim was undergoing surgery last night at South Tyneside district hospital for gunshot wounds to his arm and chest. His condition was described as serious.Hospital staff informed police that the child had been admitted at 1pm, and the older boy was arrested shortly afterwards on suspicion of wounding.The shooting is believed to have taken place at the West Pastures Travellers' camp, a permanent site near Gateshead. Northumbria police cordoned off the camp to allow officer and forensic investigators to gather evidence and establish the sequence of events leading to the incident. Superintendent Jim Napier of Northumbria police said: "It's too early to speculate at this stage. We are working with the hospital, the boy's family, and residents of the site to establish the facts. What we do know is that the injury was caused by some sort of firearm, a gun."Investigating officers were convinced important evidence remains at the site."If there was anybody in or around that site who saw or heard anything suspicious between 12 and 1pm today, I would urge them to please contact us," he said. "They might have a vital piece of information which could help us build together what happened."I would like to reassure the public that we do not have someone wandering around with a gun shooting children."
