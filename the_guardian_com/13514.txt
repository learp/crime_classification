Eight people were in custody last night after the fatal shooting of a man at a Travellers' site.The incident occurred shortly after 10am yesterday at a site in Pennypot Lane, Chobham, Surrey. The police released few details but said a man of 45 had died from a gunshot wound and a murder inquiry had begun. Seven men and a woman were arrested last night. The death was being treated as an isolated incident and the police said the site, which is thought to have about 125 people living on it, was generally regarded as "peaceful". Nearby residents described hearing gunshots in the morning, followed by the sound of police helicopters. A woman who declined to be named told reporters: "We knew they had guns, we told the police they had guns and that they had even aimed at us with them. But no one listened. "From what I understand, it all happened over some internal rivalry. "How long before one of us gets shot?" A public inquiry is being held into the Travellers' appealed against Surrey Heath borough council's decision to refuse them planning permission for their development of the site. The result is expected later this month. A council spokesman said: "It is an illegal site. It was a field when they bought it, but they have since put a hard surface over it. There are concrete bases for caravans and Tarmacked roads."
