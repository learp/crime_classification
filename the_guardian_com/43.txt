Police have named a man whose naked and badly-injured body was found washed up on a beach in Cornwall.He was identified as 64-year-old Alan Jeal, from Wadebridge in north Cornwall, after officers published an artist's impression of him.The death is being treated as suspicious because unexplained multiple injuries were found on the body not consistent with drowning.As part of their appeal, Devon and Cornwall police also released a black and white photograph of a small boy found in a wallet close to where the body lay. The picture has the date 13 April 1952 on the reverse and officers believe it shows Jeal at the age of two at his family home.The body was found on Perranporth beach, north Cornwall, on 25 February. The artist's impression was published a week on as officers struggled to identify him. Callers, including family members, rang police giving Jeal's name after seeing the artist's impression.The investigation is now focusing on Jeal's movements in the days before his body was found. A CCTV image has been released showing the last known sighting of Jeal on 24 February, shortly after midday, in Wadebridge town centre.Detective Chief Inspector Dave Thorne said: "Firstly, our thoughts are with Alan's family and friends at this upsetting time and we will do everything we can to support them. Now that we know his identity, we can progress with the investigation and try to find out exactly what happened to him."He was last seen on Monday 24 February, the day before his body was found, and I would welcome information from anyone who knew Alan, or who saw him in the days leading up to his death."Police believe he was in the water for no more than 24 hours. Jeal lived alone and was not reported missing to police.
