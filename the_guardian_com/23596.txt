A meeting to consider whether Richard Barnbrook, one of the most senior elected members of the British National party, had brought his office into disrepute was cut short today after he failed to turn up on stress grounds.Barnbrook, who is both a London assembly member and sits on Barking and Dagenham council, could be suspended amid charges that he brought his office into disrepute by falsely claiming three murders had taken place over a three-week period in the Barking and Dagenham area.But the meeting was cut short after Barnbrook telephoned just before his hearing was due to begin to say that he had been signed off for stress for two weeks by his GP.Barnbrook's failure to submit written evidence to the hearing resulted in the panel ruling it would be unfair to continue in his absence.Today's meeting will be reconvened on either 12 August or 4 September.Barnbrook faced a grilling before the standards committees of both the Greater London authority and the council to explain his position and take questions over comments he made in an interview posted on the internet, which were subsequently removed.An investigation, conducted for the standards committees of the GLA and Barking and Dagenham council concluded that Barnbrook brought his office and the respective authorities into disrepute after falsely claiming in the interview that three murders had taken place over a three week period in the Barking and Dagenham area.If the committees rule there was a breach of the code, Barnbrook faces a range of possible sanctions, including up to six months' suspension from elected office.The complaint against Barnbrook was first lodged last September after he claimed in an interview posted on YouTube and his own website that a girl had been murdered within the borough within the past three weeks. "We don't know who's done it. Her girlfriend was attacked inside an educational institute," Barnbrook said in the prerecorded interview, in which he sought to highlight failings in tackling knife crime.He also said that two weeks previously "there was another attack by knives on the streets of Barking and Dagenham where two people were murdered".Valerie Rush, a Labour cabinet member at the local authority, accused Barnbrook of "openly and outrageously" lying to "whip up fears in the London community".In her complaint to the GLA and the council, Rush said Barnbrook had acted in a way that brought his honesty and integrity as a councillor into disrepute.Barnbrook, who is one of 12 BNP councillors in Barking and Dagenham, said that he knew at the time that he made the statements that "there had been no fatalities in Barking and Dagenham", according to a report documenting the investigation into the complaint.Barnbrook nevertheless refused to apologise for the statements "until knife crime is over".This meant that the interview – filmed by Simon Darby, the BNP's deputy leader, who works part-time for Barnbrook in the London assembly – was posted on the internet despite Barnbrook knowing the statements were incorrect, the report noted.The Metropolitan police confirmed that there had been no murders or incidents resulting in critical injuries requiring intensive care in the time period cited, and that murders in the area were actually decreasing.By the time the draft investigation report was published, Barnbrook said he did not accept that "the inaccuracy of my statement was deliberate". He also stated: "I did not know that the data in the recording was incorrect. I would not have posted the recording if I had known that it was incorrect."Barnbrook also insisted that "once I realised that the data was incorrect, the recording was removed from the internet on my instruction within 24 hours".The final report into the investigation found that Barnbrook's original claim that he knew what he was saying was untrue "seems at odds" with the principles of honesty and integrity.The report said: "If the public were aware that Mr Barnbrook was in fact putting out statements that he knew were false, we consider that his could reasonably be regarded as undermining public confidence in both members and the authorities as a whole in being able to fulfil their function."Any sanctions meted out to Barnbrook can be challenged on appeal to the president of the Adjudication Panel for England.If an appeal is accepted, the body can overturn the finding or vary the sanction.
