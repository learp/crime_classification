Church authorities are taking legal advice about the estate of a vicar who stole £40,000 from a church roof fund before he died of a heart attack.Proceedings may be taken to recover as much of the cash as possible after police confirmed yesterday that the Rev James Booth would have been charged with theft had he lived. The vicar, who was 58, was in charge of the rural parish of Wansford and Nafferton in the East Riding of Yorkshire for 20 years until his death in October. When an audit was carried out, local people were horrified to discover that two local trust funds and the church accounts were short of the money. Humberside police said yesterday that statements from parishioners and financial evidence had been examined in detail. A spokeswoman said: "After lengthy investigation and consideration of all the evidence, officers have concluded that nobody else is responsible for the missing funds which total nearly £40,000. In the light of the Rev Booth's death, three separate allegations of theft will now be classed as detected and the file has been closed." Martin Sheppard, communications officer for the diocese of York, said: "Our hopes that the missing money had been moved legitimately are at an end." The Archdeacon of the East Riding, the Ven Peter Harrison, said: "Many people have trusted James Booth as their vicar over the past 20 years. Now, we know, they will be feeling betrayed." No one is yet sure why Mr Booth took the money or what became of it.
