The Georgian billionaire and opposition leader Badri Patarkatsishvili died from "natural causes", initial tests showed today.Patarkatsishvili was found dead in his Leatherhead mansion on Tuesday night, prompting widespread speculation that he was murdered.In December he claimed that a plot to assassinate him had been hatched by the Georgian authorities.Yesterday Surrey police said they were treating the death as "suspicious" but today the force revealed that interim results of a post-mortem showed that the 52-year-old died of natural causes.Toxicology tests to establish whether any poisons were present in his blood stream have yet to be carried out. An inquest into his death will formally open tomorrow.Earlier police sources said officers found no trace of radioactive materials at the scene.Patarkatsishvili, who has been charged with plotting a coup in Georgia, came third in last month's presidential elections.He spent Tuesday in meetings in London.One of those who saw him said there was "no evidence" he was unwell.The PR guru Lord Bell, who acted as his spokesman, said: "He was absolutely fine, although he was a bit tired - he had been sitting in a very hot office for a long time in a previous meeting."He was anxious to get out into the fresh air."Lord Bell said Patarkatsishvili "always looked 10 years older than he was" but had no history of illness, although his father died of a heart attack at an early age.Patarkatsishvili, who was Georgia's richest man with an estimated Â£6bn fortune, feared for his safety. He employed up to 120 security guards and employed Andrei Lugovoi, who is suspected of poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, as a security consultant.Patarkatsishvili was a long-time business partner of Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky, an outspoken Kremlin critic who now lives in exile in London.Berezovsky released a statement in which he spoke of the "terrible tragedy" of losing his "closest friend".Neighbours reported that extra security equipment - including cameras, gates and high fences - had recently been installed at the property.Patarkatsishvili - who founded opposition TV channel Imedi in 2002 - backed mass street protests against Georgia's government in the capital, Tbilisi, in November.He also owned the football team Dynamo Tibilisi and in 2006 was linked to an attempted take-over of West Ham United.
