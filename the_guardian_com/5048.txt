A man has been remanded in custody in connection with the death of a police officer in a suspected hit-and-run collision.The defendant, who was charged under the name Gary Bromige but appeared at South Western magistrates court, Lavender Hill, south London, on Monday under the name Gary Cody, is accused of causing death by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene of an accident, failing to report an accident and driving without insurance.PC Andrew Duncan, a traffic officer, died in hospital on Sunday morning after being hit by a car during a speed enforcement operation in Sutton, south London, in the early hours of Friday.Cody, 25, of South Norwood, south London, will appear at Kingston crown court on 7 October.Two men aged 19 and 20 who were arrested on Sunday evening in connection with the investigation remain in custody at a south London police station.A woman who was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of perverting the course of justice has since been bailed.Britain's most senior police officer led the tributes to Duncan, 47, a married father of two who joined the Met in 1990 and had been a member of the south-west traffic unit for nearly 10 years.The Met commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said: "Andy was a hard-working and courageous policeman. He served the community as both a police officer and as a Scouting volunteer."The night he was injured he was doing a job that he loved and we all had every right to expect he would return safely to his home and family â€“ tragically that was not the case."The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: "PC Duncan was an officer of vast experience who had dedicated his working life to the Metropolitan police service."His death is a tragedy and a reminder of the courage and sacrifice shown daily by the men and women who keep London safe."My thoughts and those of every Londoner are with Andrew's wife and children at this time."
