Yesterday's corruption conviction of two Metropolitan detectives is good news - not bad - for the country's largest police service. The lengths to which they went to catch the two crooked officers - including setting up a sophisticated sting operation in a Guildford hotel - demonstrate the determination behind the service's anti-corruption drive. It took two further years of legal argument before they could be brought to trial.It is now four years since the Guardian exclusively revealed the return of serious corruption within the Metropolitan police. The problem was not on such a large scale as it was in the early 1970s, when Sir Robert Mark swept away almost 500 officers, but the latest corruption is more serious and the ability of bent officers to cover up their crimes more sophisticated. Senior sources spoke of officers actively involved in robberies, drugs deals and even contract killings. They had learned to stow away their illicit earnings less ostentatiously than by buying flash cars or houses. Even in Sir Robert's day, convictions were difficult. Although he removed hundreds of officers, only 13 were jailed. A second corruption drive in the late 1970s, Operation Countryman, collected 200 separate allegations of corruption and sent 41 names to the Director of Public Prosecutions; yet only four were prosecuted. Yesterday's convictions followed those of three other corrupt officers in August 2000.There should be no surprise that corruption has returned. All police services suffer from it. Drugs have only increased the wealth - and influence - of criminal as well as creating more opportunities for bent officers. The rise in maintenance awards - 50% of detectives are divorced - is another driving force. But the problem is being taken seriously by the Met. Its anti-corruption squad has been increased to 200, making it one of the largest squads in the force. History suggests, alas, that although corruption can be curbed, it cannot be eliminated.
