I read with interest the view of Professor Canter on a potential IT solution to improving performance in the detection of burglary (Report, 25 May). There is no question that psychological profiling of offenders has made a significant contribution to policing and it is because of this that the Metropolitan Police Service invested significant funding in the Interactive Offender Profiling System to try and develop the use of this capability and apply it to volume crime types such as burglary. Professor Canter has been involved with us in that project. While the MPS is continuing its development and investment in the systems you describe, any assertion that a 10% to 20% increase in burglary detection rates is achievable with the technology significantly overstates both the likely potential and current capability of the system.Maxine de Brunner Commander, Serious Acquisitive Crime, Metropolitan Police Service
