The poor and the unemployed are twice as likely to become victims of violent crime and nearly three times more likely to suffer emotional damage as a result of being attacked, according to research published today.The study by the Institute of Public Policy Research shows that people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods are more than twice as likely to be mugged and feel "very worried" about being physically attacked as those who live in the most affluent neighbourhoods.The research, Crimeshare: the unequal impact of crime, shows that almost half a million victims of violent crime started to avoid certain places, used public transport less, and felt unable to take on paid or volunteer work if it involved coming home after dark. About 32,000 people change jobs every year and 180,000 move home as a direct result of being attacked. More than 850,000 people say they lost earnings as a result of becoming a victim of violent crime.The IPPR study says these often unrecognised impacts of violent crime hit the poorest households and unemployed people the hardest. It suggests that the government should have a new target of reducing the impact of crime instead of simply reducing the overall volume of crime by a further 15%.Nick Pearce, IPPR director, said: "People living in poorer households have less choice about where they live, cannot afford to pay for expensive alarm systems or take taxis home in the evening. They are less able to control the risks they face and often have no option but to expose themselves to greater danger." Repeat victimisation was particularly worrying, having a much larger impact than would be predicted. The study says that despite a 44% fall in crime over the past decade, the impact is not equally distributed.
