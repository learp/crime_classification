David Cameron came close to calling for junior minister Joan Ryan's resignation today, as the Tory leader kept up the pressure over the foreign criminal records fiasco at the Home Office.At prime minister's questions the Tory leader demanded to know why Ms Ryan was still in her job, after apparently being aware of the problem of the backlog of foreign offences yet to be added to the police database.Mr Cameron said: "Last week the junior Home Office minister responsible told us that she knew nothing about the fiasco of the foreign criminal records."Now we know she was receiving and signing letters about the issue as long ago as October. Why is she still in her job?"Mr Blair said: "The backlog, as the permanent secretary indicated in his evidence yesterday, was not drawn to her attention."The home secretary, John Reid, also faced fresh embarrassment last night when he revealed that an urgent police manhunt had begun for a suspected terrorist who disappeared within four days of being placed on an anti-terror control order. Today's Times reports that the suspect is a 26-year-old of Pakistani origin who evaded police by taking shelter in a mosque.The newspaper says the man lives in Manchester and is thought to have escaped after saying he wanted to undertake terror training in Afghanistan.The disclosure is a further blow to the government's anti-terror policy and an embarrassment for Mr Reid, who is already under intense pressure over other failings in his department.
