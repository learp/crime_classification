Staff at a G4S-run private prison for sex offenders, where nearly half the inmates are over 50, have been warned that they need to be more alert to the risks of older inmates sexually grooming younger prisoners.The chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, issued the warning in an inspection report of Rye Hill prison, near Rugby in Warwickshire, which became a jail purely for sex offenders in July 2014.Ten prisoners, who make up 6% of those who completed the survey, told prison inspectors they had been sexually abused since arriving at Rye Hill. This is three times higher than the 2% average recorded at similar category B prisons. More than 45% of Rye Hill’s 600 inmates are over 50 and three-quarters of the population are serving sentences of 10 years or more.“Prison staff were generally aware of the particular risks associated with the sex offender population but there was no strategic approach to ensuring that all staff were aware of the potential for prisoner-on-prisoner sexual grooming and targeting, especially in relation to some of the younger prisoners held at the prison,” says the official report of the August inspection published on Friday.'Reality of consensual and coercive sex in prison' exposed by review The emergence of sexual grooming of younger prisoners by older inmates as a major issue reflects the ageing of the prison population, with more than 8,000 prisoners in England and Wales above the age of 50. This has been largely driven by the increase in convicted sex offenders, particularly those jailed in historical cases such as those involving Rolf Harris and Gary Glitter.Rye Hill is the second prison in three months where the chief inspector has felt it necessary to issue a warning about older sex offenders exploiting and abusing younger inmates. The chief inspector of prisons issued a similar warning in November in a report of an inspection of the public sector-run Isle of Wight prison, which includes the old Parkhurst jail, and whose population is also almost entirely made up of convicted sex offenders.Inspectors found an unusually higher than normal rate of sexual abuse among Isle of Wight inmates during their regular survey of prisoners.“We were not confident that all staff were sufficiently alert to the risks of prisoner-on-prisoner sexual grooming and targeting. Not enough staff had completed the conditioning, manipulation and corruption prevention training (58% were trained) or a specific police-led training package in working with child sex offenders (44%),” said the report of the inspection that took place this June.Prisons 'at their worst level for 10 years' The chief inspector’s report for Rye Hill says the private prison is performing very well in most areas. The inspectors say its 600-strong population is a complex mix of serious offenders and some frail older men who need significant levels of care. Richard Stedman, the G4S director for Rye Hill, said in response to the report: “There is an acute awareness that many of the prisoners we look after at Rye Hill are often highly capable of coercing and influencing those around them. Part of our work to repurpose the prison has been to educate staff about these changing risks, as grooming is hard to identify.“We conduct a weekly complex-case meeting, focused on vulnerable prisoners, which involves colleagues from across the different prison disciplines, to pool intelligence on the behaviour of prisoners whom we suspect might be attempting to manipulate others.”
