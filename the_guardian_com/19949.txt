A young London footballer who dreamed of turning professional died in the street today after he was stabbed in the neck.The 17-year-old, named locally as Â­Jahmal Mason-Blair, was found by police officers on a routine patrol of Hackney shortly before 1am.Medics battled to save the boy but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Friends today said he dreamed of becoming a professional footballer and was rarely seen without a ball at his feet. Local resident Connie Drew said Jahmal was "a great kid"."He liked football and you never saw him without a football and he wanted to become a professional footballer," Drew said."That's the worst thing: he had a goal in his life and he was pursuing it and he wanted to make something of himself."He was a lovely young boy and never even got into any arguments. A friend of mine called me this morning and told me and I'm just in shock."Jahmal's friend Eddie Munnelly said they met at the Tottenham Hotspur development centre for young players."He was a good player but always struggled with his size and only really shot up recently," Munnelly said. "He had another trial recently at Reading as well."Jahmal died from a puncture wound to the neck; police have not yet said what instrument was used.Jahmal's half-brother Shaun Mason, 30, said he was woken in the early hours of this morning and told something had happened to his brother. "He was meant to be coming to stay with his cousin last night but he never made it."I've asked to go and identify him because I want to be able to do that for him." He said their mother, Tetela Rafeal, was flying back from her home in Florida after his sister Maria called to break the news to her.Jahmal showed off his ball skills in a competition against another teenager on a video posted on YouTube a year ago. A message from Jahmal said: "I won."More than 100 people have joined a Facebook group in memory of Jahmal. The group's creator wrote: "Jahmal was a great son, great brother and a great friend and he will be dearly missed."Knowing that we're not going to see your play football, or see that smile again. It will truly hurt us."One resident who did not want to be named said she thought she heard a fight start in the street some time after midnight.The woman, who lives off Amhurst Road, said: "There were about 20 boys; it looked like there was a little one trying to have a fight with somebody else."I just heard lots of shouting, then they all split off into different directions. I don't know what happened next."Scotland Yard said officers on a routine patrol found the injured teenager in Amhurst Road near the junction with Bodney Road shortly before 1am.London Ambulance Service and the air ambulance attended but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Acting Detective Chief Inspector Phil Rickells, who is leading the investigation, said: "Amhurst Road is quite a busy road with shops and flats so there is a chance someone may have been driving past and saw what happened."In particular we would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a black male aged between 14 and 18 wearing dark clothing running away from the scene."People laid floral tributes today as forensic teams and police continued their examinations. No arrests have been made.The scene is close to Hackney Downs open space and several local schools.Large sections of Dalston Lane and Amhurst Road are taped off and trains are not stopping at nearby Hackney Downs railway station.A post-mortem examination will take place tomorrow at Poplar mortuary.
