A public school teacher has been jailed for 15 months over an affair with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.Helen Goddard, 26, was also banned from working with children for life and will be registered as a sex offender for 10 years.Goddard, a music teacher, admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child. She befriended the girl when they met for coffee after lessons. Southwark crown court in London heard that the affair included a sleepover at the teacher's home and a weekend in Paris.The relationship continued for five months but remained secret until an anonymous tip-off to the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons.Goddard wept today as the judge, Anthony Pitts, sentenced her to 15 months. Pitts said the girl had made it clear she consented to sex. The judge said it had been a "difficult case"."The evidence showed you were having a full-on sexual relationship with the girl for many months," he told Goddard."It is, of course, against the law to engage in sexual activity with a person under 16, even with her consent. But the particularly aggravating feature evident here of course is that you were her music teacher throughout this period and from well before the sexual relationship started."This case is so serious that an immediate prison sentence is inevitable."The court heard that a former colleague had warned Goddard of the "dangers of being over-friendly and too popular" after noticing girls "flocking to her room at break times".The school contacted care workers and alerted police after being told of the relationship. Officers raided the teacher's maisonette in Greenwich, south-east London, and arrested the 26-year-old. They seized sex toys from the house.Pitts said: "Pupils are susceptible to abuse by those who teach them."The teacher's position of authority, their influence on the class, pupils' admiration of them, pupils' desires to be liked, their desire to impress or to be a special favourite makes it easy for a teacher, who so wishes, to take advantage of their pupils and start a relationship."
