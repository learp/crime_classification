It was alleged that the attack was staged so that Cunningham and his accomplice, Clifford Hobbs, could escape. A third man, not known to the pair, also escaped but handed himself in shortly afterwards. Hobbs was arrested in the Costa del Sol region of Spain in 2007 and received a life sentence in February 2008.Detectives had thought Cunningham was living in Spain but he was traced to the Netherlands after Soca uncovered the false identity he was using.
