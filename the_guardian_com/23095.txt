Prison officers will be banned from going on strike under plans announced by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, today.Straw said the government wanted to legislate to avoid a repeat of the wildcat strike action by the Prison Officers Assocation that hit the service last August.The move would reinstate a ban imposed by the Conservatives in 1994 but subsequently repealed by Labour in 2005.Straw told MPs that he had "no alternative" because of the need to protect the public and inmates.But he said that the measure, which was tabled in the form of an amendment to a bill currently going through Parliament, would be held in reserve and only used if the Government and the POA failed to agree a new voluntary no-strike agreement."Our judgment is that we will have no alternative but to seek this reserve power," Straw said."I don't want it to be used. I have been extremely reluctant to bring this forward, and I hope we can avoid using it."The government already has a voluntary no-strike agreement with the union, but this is due to lapse in May.Brian Caton, general secretary of the POA, reacted angrily to the announcement, saying his members would not be "intimidated" by the government.It was reported that inmates caused damage worth Â£220,000 on a juvenile wing at Lancaster Farms prison during last year's unofficial 12-hour walkout.But Caton said that claims about the amount of damage caused at the jail were "absolute rubbish".
