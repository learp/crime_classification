A woman who falsely accused her lover of rape has been jailed for two years.Keeley Horrocks, 20, of Grant Street, Burnley, Lancashire, accused the 59-year-old man, who was arrested and his home searched by police, Bolton crown court heard.He was interviewed and denied the accusation. He said the pair had been in a consensual sexual relationship for nine months. The man, from Rochdale, was released on bail after spending up to 20 hours in custody.Horrocks had a medical examination, was video interviewed by trained officers over several days and gave a lengthy and detailed account of her claims, all of which proved to be false.When evidence was reviewed it emerged the report of rape had been made shortly after the man sent a text message to Horrocks's former boyfriend, with whom she was trying to rekindle a relationship.The man from Rochdale suspected Horrocks was lying to both him and her former boyfriend.Horrocks later pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice after her initial report of rape to police on 3 January 2010.In a statement, the man said: "This whole affair has changed my life. I should not have been in court today and I should not have had to hear what was said. I should not feel the way I feel. I am still traumatised."When this happened I was put through a humiliating and traumatic ordeal and I am still suffering from the indignity of that experience now.Detective constable Chris Whalley of Greater Manchester police said: "Horrocks embarked on a path of deceit and told a series of malicious lies to the police and other parties involved in the investigation in a bid to try and save her own relationship with the man she was trying to get back with."It was not only an utterly selfish thing to do, it was also criminal. This made a mockery of the experiences suffered by genuine victims."
