When discrepancies over the former Labour MP David Chaytor's expenses came to light, he explained it as an "unforgivable error in my accounting procedures".Unforgivable it certainly proved to be – today, he was sentenced to 18 months by a criminal court.The 61-year-old former MP for Bury North – a seat he had held since Labour's 1997 landslide election victory – fought hard to escape a criminal trial.He argued the ancient right to parliamentary privilege which, through the ages, has protected MPs from legal action arising from events in parliament, should apply to his expenses error. His case, he claimed, should be heard by parliament, not by the courts.It was an argument rejected by the judiciary, from Southwark crown court – where he was sentenced today – through to the court of appeal and finally, shortly before his trial was due to begin, by the supreme court.All legal avenues exhausted, a chastened Chaytor appeared at the Old Bailey on 3 December, to plead guilty to three counts of false accounting totalling £18,350.It was an ignominious end to a solid, rather than glittering, political career.Chaytor, a father of three who seemed not to have aspired to life beyond the backbenches, had a reputation for steadiness and reliability, according to sources in Westminster who were genuinely shocked at his self-inflicted downfall.He had referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, John Lyon, when the accusatory finger was pointed.He had brushed away allegations in the Daily Telegraph's exposé of expenses, arguing that he was the victim of "selective reporting and outlandish claims". He had not, he claimed, received "to the best of my belief any payment in excess of that for which I was eligible"."Throwing a few people to the wolves," he told his local paper, the Bury Times, "won't solve the deeper problem of the parliamentary expenses system", adding that he had worked in public service for 25 years before becoming an MP without ever "being accused of any financial irregularity".Chaytor, who gave his address as exclusive Lumbutts, on the outskirts of Todmorden, on the West Yorkshire and Lancashire border, has stayed loyal to his northern roots.Born in Bury, it was his ambition to return as MP. He attended East Ward primary school, then Bury Grammar, before graduating from the University of London in 1970.He emerged from subsequent stints at Huddersfield Polytechnic, then Bradford and Leeds universities, as a qualified teacher in 1976. Three years later, he returned to the University of London to complete a master's in philosophy, then did further postgraduate work at Bradford University.Working first as a college lecturer, he was appointed as senior staff tutor at the Manchester College of Arts and Technology in 1983, shortly after taking his first steps into active politics by serving as a councillor for Todmorden on Calderdale borough council.Seven years later, he was the head of continuing education at the Manchester college, a position he retained until his election to parliament.Chaytor finally realised his parliamentary ambitions on his third attempt, having stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in the 1987 and 1992 general elections.Once in Westminster, he stuck close to an education brief, campaigning on the right to paid educational leave for all workers, and sitting on the children, schools and families committee.His interest in the environment saw him serve on the environmental audit committee and he was an enthusiastic supporter of the campaign to reduce carbon emissions.According to listed interests, any spare time was devoted to cycling, tree-planting, dry-stone walling and restoring old buildings.Suspended from the parliamentary Labour party, he declared his intention not to fight the 2010 election in June 2009, saying he would quit so his "self-inflicted problems" would not jeopardise Labour's election chances.
