Metropolitan police officers are being fined close to £900 a day for speeding, illegal parking and driving the wrong way up one-way streets, culminating in a bill of £325,563 in the last financial year.Police believe that the increase in fines - up by more than one third on the previous year - could stem from the use of unmarked vehicles in covert operations which make it difficult to trace the circumstances of fixed penalty notices.Senior officers in London are working with local authorities in an attempt to reduce the fines, which have increased from £245,377 in the previous financial year, according to budget documents.While local authorities cancel tickets issued to police who are responding to an emergency, there are no exemptions for police in other circumstances. They have also been fined for driving in bus lanes and red route offences."The number of fines paid on fixed-penalty notices has increased in the last financial year and there are factors which may contribute to this, for example the increase in our fleet size," a Metropolitan police spokeswoman said."In particular, the number of unmarked hire and lease vehicles which would not be recognisable to the council when on covert operations."It is understood that some fines are paid by the officers and staff concerned, but senior officers deal with penalties on a case-by-case basis.A spokesman for London Councils said an agreement was in place to exempt emergency vehicles on operational duties but drivers behind the wheels of vehicles in normal circumstances were subject "to the rules of the road like anyone else".Transport for London is responsible for maintaining red routes, the key routes through the capital used by a third of the city's traffic, and offences on these routes can incur a £120 fine.
