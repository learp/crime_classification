A pensioner is facing a jail sentence after being found guilty of involvement in a doorstep acid attack that left his teenage ex-girlfriend with horrific injuries.Mohammed Rafiq, 80, was convicted by jury at Wolverhampton crown court of organising the attack on 19-year-old Vikki Horsman, who was left with serious burns to her face and neck.Horsman had told Rafiq she was leaving him due to his controlling behaviour shortly before the attack on 15 April. During a three-week trial the prosecution detailed how Rafiq, of Smethwick, West Midlands, masterminded a revenge plot and enlisted the help of Steven Holmes, 25, of Smethwick, and 23-year-old Shannon Heaps, of Tividale.Initially Rafiq was treated as a victim, having suffered minor burns when he was splashed with the corrosive liquid, but his part in the plot later became clear to investigating officers.DC Jason Moseley said: “This was a horrifying and complex case which centred around a controlling relationship. Rafiq’s young ex-partner was seriously injured and left with devastating, lasting scars, which one can only presume was his intent given the nature of the planned attack.“He recruited two people to carry out the attack on his behalf and then tried to claim that he was also a victim. His victim now has to rebuild her life and move on from a relationship that she paid a high price to leave.”Horsman, now 20, said in a statement: “What happened that day changed my life forever. I have had to undergo lots of treatment for the burns and the damage those people caused. I still have sleepless nights and keep leaving my home to stay with friends and relatives as I can’t bear to be on my own. This is what those people have done to me – all because I had the courage to be my own person and escape a controlling man.“I know I have to be strong and am pleased that justice has been done but no matter how satisfied I am to see Rafiq and the others go to jail, that won’t turn the clock back and take away the scars they have left me with.”Rafiq, Heaps and Holmes will be sentenced for grievous bodily harm at the same court next Friday.
