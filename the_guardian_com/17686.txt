The Soham case gave a rare insight into some of the secret techniques used by police to gather evidence.In legal argument, unusually heard in open court, it emerged that the police used new laws to secretly tape a meeting between Huntley and his mother, Lynda, in his cell at Woodhill prison. During the meeting Huntley admitted that Holly and Jessica had been in his house. Detectives believe the recording boxed him into a corner, forcing him to admit in court that the girls had died in his home. Huntley's defence team argued that the jury should not have been allowed to know about the conversation. They claimed police had been granted permission to carry out "intrusive" surveillance - in other words surveillance of someone in what is effectively their own home - on the basis that it was going to be used for "intelligence" purposes. Huntley's lawyers argued that the information, obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, should not be used in court in evidence. The trial judge, Mr Justice Moses, disagreed. The Soham trial also heard details of two phone conversations between Maxine Carr and Lynda Huntley while Carr was in Holloway prison. She admitted in the conversations that she knew the girls had been in the house. Prisoners' phone calls are routinely monitored and recorded, though they are used relatively rarely as evidence in court cases . There was a third instance of surveillance. The day before Huntley and Carr were arrested, they were questioned but allowed to walk free. Officers from the National Crime Squad were tasked to follow them, in the hope they might have led officers to the girls, if alive, or their bodies.The operation was aborted when in the early hours of the next day Huntley went to his father's house. A Daily Mail and Daily Mirror journalist were there. Fearing that the investigation could be compromised, the surveillance operation was halted and Huntley and Carr were arrested.
