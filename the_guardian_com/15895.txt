You drove them to a secluded area and then you raped them."You knew, because they had told you, that they were only 13."You subjected these two vulnerable, naive 13-year-olds to a terrifying ordeal – an ordeal that had, and continues to have, a very substantial impact on both girls and their respective families."Lakin said Ali had been "devious and manipulative" throughout the case."Not only have you made serious and deeply unpleasant allegations against the two girls, you also concocted a defence to fit the prosecution evidence against you," he added."Your attempts to pull the wool over the eyes of the jury failed – and rightly so."Detective constable Lindsey Morgan said outside court: "Both the girls have basically lost their innocent childhood, and they are traumatised by what's happened to them."What they have got to do now is try and build and put this behind them and move on with their lives, but the whole family has been traumatised by the ordeal. They're going to have to work together to overcome what's happened."Asked what she thought about Ali, she said: "I think he was a sly, evil person that knew full well what he was doing, and he went out on this evening knowing that his intention was to get vulnerable girls into his car and rape them."She said his insistence on his innocence had further upset the families.
