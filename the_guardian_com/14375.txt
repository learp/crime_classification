The government is to forge ahead with police force mergers despite opposition from a number of forces, the home secretary, Charles Clarke, said today.New "superforces" will be created in East Anglia, the Midlands, the south east and Yorkshire and Humber, as the minister announced the first wave of confirmed mergers earlier today.Local forces and police authorities will have until August 11 to submit objections, but Mr Clarke said he expected to begin merger procedures in the autumn.The new forces would then come into operation on April 1 2008, he said in a written statement.The minister's decision contradicts reassurances given by the prime minister, Tony Blair, earlier this year that the government would listen closely to the views of forces up and down the country over merger proposals.Mr Clarke confirmed that the streamlining of the police forces in question would go ahead regardless of local opposition."Norfolk police authority has volunteered to merge, but in the absence of a similar request to merge from Cambridgeshire and Suffolk police authorities this merger is unable to proceed on a voluntary basis," he said."North Yorkshire police authority has volunteered to merge, but in the absence of a similar request to merge from Humberside, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire police authorities this merger is unable to proceed on a voluntary basis."I am satisfied, on the basis of the protective services assessment undertaken by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and our evaluation of the financial and other aspects of the business cases submitted to us in December, that it would be in the interests of the efficiency or effectiveness of policing for the following forces to merge."Currently there are 43 police forces. As a result of the review, new superforces will be created in a number of areas. The minister is still considering further mergers in the rest of the country.Some forces - Hampshire, Kent and Thames Valley - will remain as standalone forces but will reconfigure as "strategic forces". Greater Manchester will not face a merger, Mr Clarke said."I am accordingly today giving written notice to all the police authorities, local authorities and chief constables in the affected areas of my intention to merge the above police force areas, setting out my reasons for proposing the merger and specifying the general nature of the provisions to be made," Mr Clarke said."I will carefully consider any objections received."The shadow police reform minister Nick Herbert said there should be a series of local referenda on the mergers. "These amalgamations are being forced through with insufficient debate and oblivious to the views of the communities affected," he said. "This is a matter of constitutional significance and the public should be given their say through a local referendum. "By proceeding with mergers while letting some forces stand alone, the home secretary has missed an important opportunity to achieve far greater cooperation between forces, which would have strengthened the fight against serious crime while maintaining local accountability." He added: "The Home Office has belatedly said that it will finance the cost of mergers, estimated at Â£500m, but with Home Office spending frozen from next year it transpires that this money will be raided from the existing police budget. "People don't want to see cuts in neighbourhood policing to pay for management consultants, IT systems and new headquarters for regional forces."
