A powerful committee of MPs and peers today urged the government to beef up measures to tackle the "extremely worrying" surge in people trafficking in the UK.Although the government has taken some significant steps to improve the protection of victims, the current level of protection as a whole is still far from adequate, according to a report by the joint committee on human rights.The report concludes that the trafficking of women and children has become "one of the most serious human rights issues in the modern world" as it pressed for tougher action from government.The panel called on the government to sign and ratify the Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings.The convention was launched in 2005 and commits signatory countries to protect victims of all forms of exploitation and implement measures to safeguard their rights.This includes giving victims periods of automatic stay in the country once they escape. But the UK government has so far refused to sign up on the grounds that this protection could be abused by bogus claimants.Earlier this year, the home secretary, John Reid, announced the introduction of serious crime prevention orders, which give police sweeping powers to target people traffickers where there is insufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution.But the committee is urging the government to step up action and sign up to the treaty, arguing that it could see "no convincing argument against this course of action".The report also calls for a wholesale review of immigration laws and policies in the context of their impact on human trafficking.Other recommendations include providing specialist support for victims of sex trafficking and children, and revising proposed changes to help domestic workers from abroad seeking to escape their violent employers.The committee recommends that the government publish the research into organised crime markets currently being conducted by Home Office researchers, which it said may help in providing a clearer picture of the scale and extent of human trafficking into the country.The report also reveals confusion over official statistics in this field.Unpublished government research shows there were an estimated 4,000 victims of trafficking for prostitution in 2003 at any one time, according to the inquiry report.But no reliable estimates exist for the number of children or adult men who have been trafficked into the country for labour exploitation purposes.The suggestion that the number of women being trafficked for prostitution into the UK is on the increase seems to be corroborated by the fact that "whereas 10 years ago 85% of women in brothels were UK citizens, now 85% were from outside UK".The report said the protection of victims should be the starting point from which all other policies relating to trafficking should flow, in accordance with human rights standards.Committee chairman Labour MP Andrew Dismore said: "We should recognise women trafficked for prostitution through deception, fear and violence as victims of this serious crime and not immigration offenders or criminals themselves.""Of even greater concern is the lack of knowledge we have of the extent of the trafficking of young children, for domestic servitude or, even worse, labour in the drugs trade."Domestic workers can find themselves trapped by violent and abusive employers. We must take immediate action to protect these victims, and take urgent measures to get a clear understanding of the scale of the problem."The UK must sign up to the Council of Europe convention, if we are serious about tackling this appalling crime and protecting its victims properly."In a statement issued today, the Home Office welcomed today's report."There are no time limits within which signature must take place and a decision has not yet been taken," the statement said."We have made clear on a number of occasions during the negotiating process that we have concerns that some of the provisions, such as the automatic granting of reflection periods and the issue of residence permits in certain cases for trafficking victims, may lead to abuse of any proposed system by some, with no right to remain in the country, claiming to have been trafficked in order to prolong their stay in the country."This would lead potentially to a waste of resources which would otherwise be used in assisting genuine victims of human trafficking."Daniela Reale, exploited children advisor at Save the Children, echoed the call for the protection of victims of trafficking to be a government priority."At the moment there are no adequate systems in place for these children. Any child who has been trafficked will have had a deeply traumatic experience and will need crucial specialist support including safe house accommodation, access to education and basic services and support to address the trauma they have experienced."
