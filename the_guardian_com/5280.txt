Founded in 1971 at the height of the Troubles the Democratic Unionist party has been traditionally the hardline voice of unionism.The party was, until last month, synonymous with the Rev Ian Paisley, the loyalist firebrand who opposed every initiative aimed at reaching compromise between nationalists and unionists.Until the middle of this decade Paisley's DUP was the second force of unionism languishing behind the Ulster Unionist party. But having eclipsed the UUP and in 2006 securing itself as the dominant force in Northern Irish politics the DUP felt it was able to reach a settlement with nationalists and republicans including their former bitter foes, Sinn Féin.The DUP straddles two social forces in the north of Ireland. Its base and many of its representatives have emerged from the evangelical anti-Catholic wing of Ulster Protestantism.But the party has also attracted support in recent years from the more secular and well-heeled unionist middle class who wanted more robust negotiators dealing with Sinn Féin.The strategy of broadening their appeal has yielded them nine MPs. But from time to time religious fundamentalism within the party raises its head as was the case last week when Iris Robinson, DUP MP for Strangford, got into trouble over remarks on local radio that homosexuality was an "abomination" and could be "cured" by psychological counselling.Her comments triggered calls for her to resign as chair of Stormont's health committee. The accusations of homophobic and fundamentalist politics also overshadowed her husband and fellow MP Peter Robinson's finest hour last month when he succeeded Paisley as DUP leader and first minister.
