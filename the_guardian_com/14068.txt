The government's anti-terror watchdog yesterday called for a greater effort to be made to mount criminal prosecutions against terror suspects who have been placed under control orders.Lord Carlile said yesterday that continuing investigation into the actitivies of some of the 18 terror suspects who are being held under virtual house arrest could provide evidence for criminal prosecution and conviction. In his annual report on the operation of the terror laws, Lord Carlile warned ministers that the possibility that they could face accusations of abuse of judicial process for failing to prosecute terror suspects in the criminal courts could not be written off.His warning follows the high court ruling last Friday which temporarily quashed one of the 18 current control orders because of the failure to prosecute the suspect, identified only as E, in the light of judgments from the Belgian courts.The warning prompted opposition MPs to demand an urgent review of all control order cases with an explicit intention of prosecution wherever evidence allows.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: "We always feared that control orders would be used to circumvent due process and avoid bringing people before the court. This report suggests those fears were well-founded."Lord Carlile advises ministers to consider an exit strategy for those individuals who have been placed on control orders which are supposed to last only for 12 months. "There has to be an end of the order at some point, in every case."His report was published in an advance of the annual vote in parliament on Thursday to renew the provision of the 2005 Prevention of Terrorism Act, including the controversial control order regime.
