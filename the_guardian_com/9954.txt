The Metropolitan police today arrested an African pastor following allegations that he had diagnosed children in London as witches and encouraged their parents to beat them.In one case, a nine-year-old boy was said to have been burned with a steam iron and beaten by his father after the pastor said he was possessed by evil spirits, according to an investigation by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.One man, an asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo, was said to have committed suicide after his wife and child were branded witches, the report said.The 40-year-old pastor, based in London, was arrested three hours after the broadcast on suspicion of inciting child cruelty.A police spokesman said: "We are looking into the allegations raised in the Today programme broadcast, and any appropriate action will be taken in due course."We must maintain an open mind during these inquiries and are liaising closely with social services, the Immigration Service and health and education authorities."Over the past five years, police in London have identified more than 30 cases of children being identified as witches and they fear that belief in "ndoki", African black magic, is becoming more widespread.
