Will the government's reforms to homicide laws end the "bias against women driven to kill violent partners", or are they "feminism gone mad"? That depends on which paper you read. Writing in the Guardian, Julie Bindel said the reforms would "bring about polarised opinion". She is not wrong. The Mail sums up its attitude to the plans with the headline "Go soft on the killer wives". It says: "Women who kill abusive partners in cold blood could escape a murder conviction if they prove they feared more violence."The paper is baffled by the reforms. "On the one hand, a husband who kills an unfaithful wife in a fit of jealousy will no longer be allowed to plead he was provoked," it says. "On the other, a wife who kills her husband because he has subjected her to a 'slow burn' of abuse may be charged only with manslaughter."The Mail also takes the chance to have another swipe at its least favourite politician, Harriet Harman, asking: "Can it be safe to let this deranged feminist loose on the law of the land?" Whipped up by such a prospect, mostly male Mail readers vent their fury on the paper's website.The Guardian comes to Harman's defence, saying the reforms "deserve support for achieving even-handedness".It backs downgrading homicide from murder to manslaughter in cases involving the threat of serious violence, and welcomes plans to ditch the provocation defence used by some men who murder their wives. Bindel agrees, writing: "Why should women such as the late Emma Humphreys, the victim of horrendous abuse by the man she killed, be labelled a murderer?"And even the Sun appears to see the logic of the plan. "Nagging's not a murder defence" it says, adding that change will "bring an end to courts letting thugs off with murder on flimsy grounds".
