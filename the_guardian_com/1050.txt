The son of the former health secretary Patricia Hewitt has been fined £250 after pleading guilty to possessing cocaine.Nicholas Hewitt Birtles, 21, apologised to his family and said he was "deeply distressed" about the consequences of his actions for them.He was ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge.Birtles was sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in Camden Square, north London, when it was approached by police on 19 September, Highbury Corner magistrates court heard.Emily Maunders, prosecuting, said: "As the officers approached the vehicle they noted the defendant threw something out. This landed on the ground."This was retrieved. It was found to be a blue and white plastic bag wrap. This contained a cube-sized lump of white powder."Maunders said Birtles, whose father is a judge, William Birtles, admitted it was cocaine and later tested positive for the drug.Addressing the chairman of the magistrates, Lady Ruth Lipton, she said he had no convictions but "relevant cautions".Birtles's solicitor, Anthony Burton, said his client "immediately fell on his sword" when caught, admitting it was a controlled drug.He said Birtles was a recreational but not regular user. "On this occasion he had purchased this small quantity of cocaine. He apologises to the court for the offence and underlines that through his plea."What is particularly distressing to him is that, as a result of this matter, significant publicity has been attracted that has fallen on his family and he is deeply distressed about the consequences of his actions so far as his family are concerned."If I may, through me, he apologises to them publicly."The court heard Birtles had £150 worth of cocaine in his possession at the time. Burton said Birtles had started work two weeks ago in telesales.A second man arrested with Birtles has been bailed until 6 November.
