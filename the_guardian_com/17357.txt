Police have launched a murder investigation and arrested a 50-year-old man after a body was found in a flat in Pontypridd. South Wales police said one of their officers found the body at 3pm on Friday and they were working to identify the deceased and were seeking witnesses. Officers have cordoned off an area near the town’s rugby ground.“No matter how insignificant the information may seem, we would like people to contact us,” said DS Paul Hurley. “In particular, we want to speak to anyone who noticed anything suspicious in the vicinity of Andrews Court, Rickards Street, where the body was found, and also to anyone who may have seen something suspicious near the rugby ground on Sardis Road in the past couple of days.“We have a team of detectives and the support of specialist resources working on this inquiry and, while we understand it will alarm the community, this is an isolated incident and we do have somebody in custody.”Officers were seen searching undergrowth and the force’s helicopter was spotted hovering overhead. At one stage, at least four police vans and about 10 officers were seen between Sardis Road and Lanelay Crescent as well as a cordon around a block of flats. A statement from Pontypridd RFC said: “Supporters, partners and neighbours of Pontypridd RFC are advised that the Sardis Road stadium is currently not accessible. This is due to a police investigation into a major incident in the vicinity.“The club will keep all concerned informed regarding access to the Sardis Road stadium as further information is received from the relevant authorities.”
