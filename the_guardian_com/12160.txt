A second Yorkshire city is to install high-definition cameras after the "exceptional" results of trial in Bradford which police have compared to DNA-profiling as a crime-fighting weapon.The cameras read the numberplate of every vehicle entering the city and automatically alerts police when cameras pick up details of wanted or stolen cars. Leeds will install the Automatic Numberplate Recognition System after the Bradford trial more than covered the Â£120,000 installation costs in eight weeks. Twenty stolen cars have been recovered since March and 24 were people arrested in connection with serious offences including rape.In the past four weeks no vehicles have been stolen in the city centre and robberies between February and May fell to four from 32 in the same period last year. The system, which can read up to 80,000 plates a day, effectively bars known criminals from the area. West Yorkshire police have given assurances that the cameras will not be used to "spy" on vehicles not logged on the national police computer.
