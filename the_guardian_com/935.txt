It was bad enough being sent to sleep in the garden shed for arguing with his parents, but when Andrew Bitmead yesterday pleaded guilty to a burglary things took a turn for the worse: a judge ordered him to live in it for the next four weeks.Judge John Neligan ordered the 26-year-old security guard to live in the garden shed as a condition of his bail at Exeter crown court after Bitmead pleaded guilty to a Â£250 burglary. He admitted the charges after he broke into an Exeter convenience store where he was employed, but was caught after leaving a bloodstain on a window he had smashed to gain entry to the shop. His defence counsel, Nick Bradley, made the bail application after Judge Neligan said he required a pre-sentence report. The court was told that after the raid Bitmead went to live with his parents at Chacewater, near Truro, Cornwall. However, after having a row with his parents he was banished to live in the garden shed, where he continues to sleep. The judge ordered he must continue to live there while on bail until he is sentenced in four weeks' time. In addition to the condition of residence, Judge Neligan imposed a curfew on Bitmead, banning him from leaving the shed between 9.30pm and 7.30am.
