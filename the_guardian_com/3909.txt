A four-year-old boy has suffered a fractured skull after being battered around the head with a brick on waste ground near his home in Hull.Charlie Davis was found in a pool of blood with part of his ear hanging off. Police were last night still searching for the attacker, though they played down reports he had been abducted and tied to a tree beforehand.A brain scan yesterday revealed Charlie had a slight fracture to the skull and would need plastic surgery to repair the damage to his ear.The incident is thought to have happened in the Hessle area at about 11.45am on Thursday after Charlie went to play with a friend. Police have yet to establish a motive for the attack, describing it as 'totally unprovoked'.
