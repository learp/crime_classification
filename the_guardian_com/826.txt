Police are investigating a spate of incidents in which cyclists riding along London canal towpaths have been pushed into the water, with one victim saying officers told him it could be a gang initiation rite.The Metropolitan police said they had identified five incidents in just over two weeks in which cyclists were pushed into the water, which they believe to be linked.None of the victims, all men aged from 35 to 49, were badly injured, but they were shaken up, police said.“These incidents have been very unpleasant for the victims, who may have not suffered particularly serious injuries, but have been left frightened and highly traumatised by what has happened to them,” Insp Anna Brennan said. “I would appeal directly to the persons responsible for these attacks to give serious thought to what they did, and just how dangerous it is. Pushing strangers into a canal is not funny, and could have very serious consequences.“While the water is not particularly deep, it is still very dangerous for anyone who cannot swim or anyone who has suffered an injury. One victim had his feet clipped into his pedals which made getting out of the water very difficult.”The inquiry began after Peter Bettell, 53, was pushed into a canal in west London on 23 February while returning to his houseboat, which he has now moored outside the capital. He said officers told him the attack may have been a gang initiation. “I was surprised by that,” he told the Press Association. “Normally gangs and youths attack each other, they don’t normally attack other people. I didn’t think they did.”Bettell was helped out of the canal by passersby and treated in hospital for cuts and bruises.Police have subsequently linked four other similar incidents, taking place between 5 and 17 February. There have not been any attacks since that on Bettell.Police have increased patrols along the canals. They describe the suspects as black males in their late teens or early 20s.
