Our local community has been aware for years that clothing placed in clothing banks in the local supermarket car park, or in bags on the doorstep, is rifled through by "entrepreneurs". But apparently, charities are finding it very difficult to convince the police that the crime of charity clothing theft exists, and is organised and lucrative. The British Heart Foundation believes that it alone will lose Â£3m to bogus doorstep collections this year, and expects the figure to double next year. It and Oxfam are cross enough about the situation to have arranged a meeting with the Cabinet Office to discuss the matter next week.I can't help feeling that the police probably see this as a victimless crime, and therefore not too troublesome. They are always boasting about how such worryingly up-close and personal crimes as mugging, burglary or car-break-ins are down, and this retreat from violence does indeed make life more pleasant. Yet at the same time there's a suspicion that criminals have just got more clever. There is every sign that after a nadir in which children were getting hold of guns and using them all too effectively, the drug trade has become more disciplined. I'd bet someone else's bottom dollar that the banks are more than keen to conceal the scale of identity or credit card theft, in order to keep their customers feeling secure, as well.Crime, I'm sure, has become less intimate. I suppose the "progressive" side of VAT is that even criminals are paying more tax (if they aren't using someone else's debit card, of course).
