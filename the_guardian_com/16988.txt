An inquest heard yesterday how a suicidal man wanted to "go out in a blaze of glory" and confronted police marksmen with a gun and a samurai sword before they shot him.Officers did not know that the gun pointed at them by Jason Gifford, 27, as he emerged from his former marital home only fired rubber bullets, a coroner heard. He was shot by armed police outside the house in Aylesbury, Bucks, and died of his injuries two hours after the incident in June 2002. The coroner in Aylesbury heard that after his wife Carol, 35, filed for divorce, Gifford had told friends he could not bear to live without her and their five-year-old daughter. He held his wife hostage and tried to get her to shoot him. He told her that he could not do it himself, so he would have to get someone else to do it. Police received a 999 call from Gifford in which he said he had a gun and if anyone went to the house he would kill people, the coroner heard. Diane Jones, a communications officer at Thames Valley police, said that Mrs Gifford also called 999 in hysterics after her husband cut his finger off and covered her in blood. Sergeant Keith Thompson said that Gifford had carried a sword and a gun and was shot after ignoring all warnings: "He went down but got up with two large knives which he got from his waistband." Neighbours said two shots were heard. Mrs Gifford had earlier told the inquest that her husband "loved watching films with blood, guts and killings - he always wanted to be a Kray". The inquest was adjourned until today.
