A prosecution witness in the Damilola Taylor trial was jailed for life yesterday for the gangland killing of a teenager.Pepe Brown, 21, was one of the inmates of Feltham young offenders' institute in west London who gave evidence against two brothers accused of killing the 10-year-old boy.The brothers and two other juveniles were found not guilty of the murder after the trial in 2002. Police were criticised by the defence for the way in which they sought witnesses from Feltham, where the brothers were held after their arrest.Brown, from Islington, north London, was convicted at the Old Bailey of the June 2003, murder of Jadie Brissett, 18.Brissett was gunned down after masked men attacked him as he played a game throwing coins at a wall with friends in Hackney, east London. He died despite emergency surgery outside a block of flats.Orlando Pownall, QC, prosecuting, said: "Jadie Brissett was hit twice, once to the left upper thigh and once to the chest. He was seen to get up and run around to the back of the estate where he collapsed near some dustbins."Brown, Aaron Salmon, 18, of Plaistow, and Robbie Thomas, 22, of Hackney, were convicted of murder after a series of trials.Judge Peter Beaumont jailed them for life with a minimum term of 15 years. A fourth man, also convicted of the murder and who gave evidence against Thomas, will be sentenced next week.
