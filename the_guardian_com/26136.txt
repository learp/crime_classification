Five years before the current concern about bobbies on the beat, Northumbria police opened a mongrel building in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea - half housing office, half police station.Crispian Strachan, the chief constable, joins regular patrols from the station. His experience makes him cautious about the snapshot nature of the new figures, but not surprised that Northumbria is top. Good ratings for tackling the fear of crime are the key. Actual offences are down in most categories, but the fall in local concern about burglary and violence is steeper. "We got the resources under the government's crime-fighting fund to make sure we could really 'localise'," says Mr Strachan. "It took time to train our 254 extra new constables, but a lot are now out there as community beat managers." The term "manager" is used because the bobbies liaise with government agencies, neighbourhood watches and community groups. The resulting local trust has been helped by the force's target of keeping a community officer on the beat for three years. Yet Northumbria is no doddle to police, with 1,800 square miles of countryside and 200 square miles of urban streets presenting different challenges. The root of the success is thoroughness, says Mr Strachan. "A lot of our policing is based on long-standing practices, but we are following them very thoroughly," he says.
