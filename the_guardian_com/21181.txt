Leeds university moved to quell a growing racism row yesterday when it revoked permission for one of its academics to make a speech attacking the Stephen Lawrence inquiry to one of America's most influential far right organisations.Frank Ellis, a lecturer in the Russian and Slavonic studies department, was told he would not now be given leave to address the American Renassiance conference in Virginia this month after the Guardian revealed the organisation's racist ideology and the subject of Dr Ellis's speech. Dr Ellis was originally told he could make the trip on work time as long as he made clear he was speaking in a personal capacity. But amid mounting concern from students and staff the university reversed the decision. In a statement, it said: "The event is not an appropriate academic conference for Dr Ellis to attend during working time. Dr Ellis has been told that he does not have leave to attend the conference, and that he will be expected to discharge his normal academic commitments at Leeds during this period." The matter is unlikely to rest there, however. The lecturer could not be contacted for comment yesterday but there was speculation that he still intended to address the conference. Student leaders were seeking meetings with the university management to discuss the implications of Dr Ellis's views. In his speech Dr Ellis's was intending to attack what he terms the anti-white "racial hysteria" which has gripped Britain since the murder of the black teenager and the publication of the Macpherson report on the botched police inquiry. Previous conferences have attracted supporters of white supremacist organisations, including the Ku Klux Klan. The Guardian and the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight revealed yesterday that Dr Ellis has written articles for the hard right British publication Right Now! in which he supports racist theories.
