A murder investigation has been launched after the discovery of a woman's body on the royal family's estate in Sandringham.Norfolk police said they did not yet know the identity of the woman, whose remains were found in a copse by a member of the public on New Year's Day.Police have said that the body had been at that site for between a month and four months.The area was sealed off as forensic officers carried out a detailed examination of the area.A spokesman said: "The pathologist believes it is highly unlikely the death was through natural causes. There is no evidence of accidental injury, damage due to firearms or bladed weapon."Samples have been taken which should provide a DNA profile within the next 24 hours."Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry told a press conference at the scene in Anmer, near King's Lynn: "The circumstances suggest this is a murder case and we are looking at missing persons reports and cold cases both locally and nationwide."Anmer is on the 20,000-acre (8,000-hectare) estate, about three miles from Sandringham house, where the Queen traditionally spends Christmas.Fry said: "How far back this investigation goes depends on what the experts say. We are looking at missing persons reports nationwide as well as cases we have been working on more locally for potential links."Entomology and pathology work is under way and we expect the body to be recovered and taken to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King's Lynn later today."The body has been in situ for some time but I can't comment on whether that is weeks, months or years. It is the body of a female but I cannot comment on her age."I cannot confirm whether she was clothed because, at the moment, only my staff, the person who found the body and the person or people who put it there know that and I would like it to stay that way."The body was found by a dog walker and was not underground. At this stage we do not know who the victim is."Fry said it was not yet clear if the woman was killed at the scene or taken there after death.Pathologist Nat Cary arrived at the site on Tuesday morning to examine the body.
