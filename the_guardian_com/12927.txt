Police recruits employed on full pay have been sent to work as gardeners because there are not enough places for them in training schools, the Police Federation's annual conference heard yesterday.Rookie officers in an unnamed force found themselves tending the flowers instead of learning the ropes because training centres were "bursting at the seams", John Harrison, head of the Police Federation sergeants' division, said.He told the conference in Blackpool that the training infrastructure at the six colleges in England and Wales was struggling to cope with the inevitable influx which followed the government's recruitment drive last summer. In some cases recruits were being taken on and then asked to do gardening chores while they waited for a place at a training centre to become available on a salary of Â£18,000, he said. His comments followed similar criticisms by David French, chairman of the federation's constable's division, who said last week that the recruitment system was in chaos. Mr French also claimed to have heard "strong anecdotal evidence" about recruits being taken on at training schools without going to interview. Jack Straw, the home secretary, is expected to repeat a pledge to increase numbers to 130,000 officers when he addresses the conference today. Mr Straw set up a specific crime fighting fund in September 1999 in an effort to force the police to boost numbers, earmarking funds to ensure there would be 9,000 more police recruits between 2000 and 2003.
