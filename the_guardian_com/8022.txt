It was the two word phrase that shamed the police, challenged public and private organisations and launched a debate that still rages four years on.Sir William Macpherson's inquiry concluded that the failings in the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation were in part due to "institutional racism".He defined it thus: "Institutional racism consists of the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. "It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantages minority ethnic people." Sir William made it clear it did not mean all police were racist but some officers took it to mean that and police leaders said morale was damaged. The police accepted the finding, despite denying they could be prejudiced during the inquiry. Right wing commentators mocked it and the home secretary, David Blunkett, said the phrase risked letting managers duck responsibility to tackle prejudice in their organisations by blaming it on processes or systems. One tool against institutional racism was the Race Relations Amendment Act. This became law last year, placing a duty on public bodies to promote equality and tackle prejudice. It was the biggest change in race relations law in 25 years.
