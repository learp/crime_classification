A car was stolen in Wigan with a seven-week-old baby boy in the back.The baby's father was standing next to the vehicle chatting to a friend when he suddenly realised another man had sneaked into the driver's seat. The keys were in the ignition.The thief drove off, as the distraught father tried to open the car door, shouting: "My baby is in the car!"Around 15 minutes later, Merseyside police were informed of a baby being left in an abandoned car close to the Billinge Arms pub on Main Street in Billinge. The baby was found safe and well, and reunited with his parents shortly afterwards, Manchester police said on Thursday.Police were called to the scene by an anonymous caller who phoned 999 near to where the abandoned car was found.The incident happened at 7.35pm on Tuesday as the blue Subaru Impreza car was parked on Moor Road in Orrell, a town in the borough of Wigan.The offender drove off on to St James' Road in the direction of Billinge. He is described as a white male in his 20s wearing a dark coloured woollen hat, a dark hooded top and lighter coloured trousers or tracksuit bottoms.Detective Constable Brendan Greally from Wigan CID said: "We can only imagine the distress that the parents of this young baby must have gone through after their son was taken from them in this manner. Thankfully, their nightmare was only short-lived after the baby was found safe and well inside the vehicle around 15 minutes later."He added: "We are urging anyone who saw the incident, or who witnessed the car being abandoned in Billinge to call police."Merseyside police was alerted by an anonymous call from a telephone box just a few yards from where the car was left on Main Street. We are very keen to speak to this man, or anyone who saw a man making the call at around 7.45pm to 7.50pm."
