The criminal justice bill, the 60th Home Office bill since Tony Blair came to power, implements the prime minister's pledge to "rebalance the criminal justice system in favour of the victim" and create a system of "smarter justice". It is expected to be introduced in April or May next year and will be accompanied by three other anti-crime bills with new powers to tackle organised crime, open up the probation service to competition and scrap the use of juries in serious fraud trials.The Home Office said the new criminal justice bill will include the shake-up in sentencing outlined last week and the new "instant justice" powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, including evicting rowdy neighbours, proposed yesterday.A battery of new powers are to be included, among them violent offender orders that will impose restrictions on violent criminals after their sentence ends, such as where they can live and who they can associate with.It will also create a new offence to deal with violent pornography, cut compensation for those who have suffered a miscarriage of justice and introduce a generic community sentence for young offenders.Changes to the sentencing powers of the courts will include restoring discretion to judges over sentence reductions for early guilty pleas and requiring unanimous parole decisions before life-sentence prisoners can be released.The organised crime bill will break new ground by introducing a "super-asbo" - a serious crime prevention order - which will be used to disrupt the activities of major gangsters in the run-up to their trials, or minor players by freezing their assets and other measures.The fraud (trials without jury) bill, which is to be the first Home Office bill to be published, will scrap the use of juries in serious fraud cases on the approval of the lord chief justice. In the past four years there were 26 fraud trials that lasted more than six months.The final piece of Home Office legislation, the offender management bill, will abolish local probation boards and allow regional offender managers to commission probation services from the voluntary and private sectors as well as the probation service. It will also strengthen the law against smuggling banned articles into prison.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said there had already been 59 Home Office bills creating more than 3,000 new offences since 1997, yet reoffending rates had risen and fear of crime remained alarmingly high."More than 50 sections of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act haven't been put into effect, and yet John Reid has proposed new legislation to replace it altogether. This is panic, push-button government at its worst."Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust added that prison numbers had risen from 60,000 in 1997 to almost 80,000 today. Despite Mr Blair promising social inclusion and public safety in 1997, he had ended up seeking solutions in prison and punishment instead of health, education and communities.But Roger Howard of Crime Concern, the national crime prevention organisation, welcomed the measures: "We've long believed that the answer to the criminal justice system is to become smarter, rather than tougher. Today's criminal justice bill promises to put the victim at the heart of the criminal justice system. Anything that helps the offender to understand better the effects of their actions must be welcomed."He said the probation legislation also made sense as it would contract out the work to the best service provider, after years of suffering a 60% reoffending rate.The legislation was also welcomed by Paul Cavadino of Nacro, the crime reduction charity, who said the involvement of charities in rehabilitating offenders would improve law and order much more than toughening sentences or fining the parents of badly behaved children.
