Complex police guidelines on the use of firearms should be simplified, a coroner has told the home secretary, Theresa May, in the wake of the Mark Saunders inquest.Dr Paul Knapman, who oversaw the three-week inquiry into the death of the 32-year-old family lawyer, said reams of paperwork detailing firearms protocol left police marksmen unable "to see the wood for the trees".Police should also consider bringing in a "very senior" and experienced officer, from any force, and give them "huge authority" to take overall charge of difficult and prolonged incidents such as that which led to the death of Saunders.That officer could review tactics, take a fresh look, and have the confidence not to be too "risk averse", he said.His recommendations come after a jury at Westminster coroner's court found that Saunders was "lawfully killed" when shot by Metropolitan police snipers as he waved his shotgun from a window of his London home.The talented lawyer, who struggled with alcoholism and was drunk, had fired his legally-held shotgun out of his window several times after an afternoon drinking binge. Seven officers fired on him, with five bullets hitting and three causing fatal wounds to his head, heart and liver.The jury highlighted major failings in the police operation during the five-hour siege in Chelsea on 6 May 2008, including confusion among senior police ranks and a lack of consideration for the barrister's vulnerable state.Writing today to May, Knapman outlined six manuals detailing protocol for firearms officers. "My perception is that 'not being able to see the wood for the trees' may be a problem", he said. Senior officers must encourage "more common sense rather than slavish adherence to written documents and protocols".He said the home secretary might take the view that these documents, which run to hundreds of pages in total, could be "amalgamated, simplified or dispensed with"."It may be that there is merit in encouraging one or two shorter documents and all documents set out in simple and unsophisticated language minimising jargon."Knapman's exasperation over the length of police manuals and complicated language used was evident during the inquest as an Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) expert tried to explain firearms tactics and guidelines to the 11 jury members.The inquest heard that Acpo guidelines to deal with vulnerable people, including drunk people such as Saunders, were not employed on the night he died. These guidelines suggest that officers could take effective cover, back off (if safe), seek early negotiation and allow "time and space" to the subject. This could encourage "tension to diffuse", the effects of alcohol or drugs to wear off, and the subject's mental or emotional state to stabilise.Saunders's home was surrounded by 59 armed officers with more than 100 guns. A police helicopter was hovering overhead and powerful halogen lights were turned on, flooding his flat with light in the minutes before he was shot.Knapman also wrote to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, underlining the jury's verdict that there was "confusion" in police ranks during the operation and that "insufficient weight" was given to Saunders's vulnerable state, although these factors were not found likely to have contributed to his cause of death.Drawing Stephenson's attention to the "blurring" of the distinction between the key roles of firearms tactical adviser and firearms bronze commander on the night, he said: "I do so for any action you may think appropriate."Stephenson had initially denied any confusion, but after evidence at the inquest acknowledged there was confusion on this point.Of the police's failure to fully consider Saunders's drunken state with regard to the "nature, proximity and numbers" in the police's containment positions around his home, Knapman said: "I bring this to your attention realising it is a very difficult area for whatever action you may think fit."The Acpo president, Sir Hugh Orde, and the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Denis O'Connor, have in the past highlighted the issue of unnecessary and often confusing police guidelines, and said they must be cut. Senior members of the coalition government have also campaigned on giving police discretion to make decisions away from rigid guidelines.
