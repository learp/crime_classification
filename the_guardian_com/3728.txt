An international hunt was launched yesterday for two men wanted in connection with the horrific, racially motivated murder of black teenager Anthony Walker.Anthony, an 18-year-old student who was hoping to be a lawyer, was bludgeoned to death with an axe in a park in Huyton, Liverpool. The axe was left embedded in his head.Murder squad detectives say they want to speak to Michael Barton, 18, and Paul Taylor, 20, from the Huyton area. Michael Barton is the younger brother of the Manchester City player Joey Barton, 22, who was fined after a late-night brawl during a pre-season tour of the Far East last month.It is thought that the two may have fled the country to Europe. Sources suggest they have made for Amsterdam.A spokeswoman for Merseyside police said: "We would like to speak to two men, Paul Taylor and Michael Barton, who we believe could assist with the ongoing police investigation into the death of Anthony Walker."Detectives believe the two men could have travelled abroad."The two are believed to live on neighbouring roads on a council estate half a mile from McGoldrick Park where the attack took place.There was no answer at either of their modern, semi-detached homes, both of which had the curtains firmly drawn.Merseyside police refused to comment on or off the record about the family connection between Joey and Michael Barton.Police were yesterday questioning three other men, a 17-year-old, a 26-year-old, and a 29-year-old, over the attack on the devout Christian.An 18-year-old man who had been arrested by police was released on bail in connection with the murder investigation.Anthony and his girlfriend were with his cousin Marcus Binns when they were racially abused by a group of white men near the Huyton Park pub.They had been walking Anthony's 17-year-old girlfriend, Louise, to a bus stop for the 10-minute journey to her home in Kirkby.In an interview yesterday, Marcus said: "I wish I'd done something different. I wish I could have saved him." He said the three were so worried about the racist taunts that they walked on to the next bus stop.But they were followed, and as they walked through the park, they were confronted by a gang of up to four men. When Marcus and Louise realised the men had an axe, they ran off to get help, frantically flagging down taxis and banging on doors.They returned minutes later and found Anthony slumped on the ground with the axe embedded in his head.Anthony's sister Dominique, 20, said: "Everyone who came into contact with him loved him. He blessed so many lives in his unique way. His life was stolen from him and his family and friends are devastated."
