A hundred police officers from across Italy have been brought in as part of a massive manhunt for the killer of Meredith Kercher, the British student whose semi-naked body was found in a bed on Friday with her throat cut.As tributes poured in, Meredith's parents, Arline and John Kercher, were believed to have left their home in Coulsdon, Surrey, and flown to the Umbrian city of Perugia where their daughter was studying.An official from Leeds University, where her course was based, also travelled to Italy yesterday to comfort students who knew Meredith. A spokeswoman said a whole department was dedicated to supporting students moving abroad and all received guidance before going.The officer leading the investigation said he had no suspects for the murder, which was committed between 10pm Thursday and 10am Friday, after Meredith returned home from a friend's house. 'We have 100 officers on this case and are not ruling out any possibilities,' said Marco Chiacchiera, head of the Perugia flying squad, who has been joined by forensic police from Rome.Police found Meredith on her bed covered by a duvet and wearing only a T-shirt, her throat cut by a sharp object or knife thrust just once in an upward motion with great force. There was no evidence of a sexual attack, said Chiacchiera, who added that the killer may have entered the bedroom by a window before leaving by the front door, stopping to wash off blood in the bathroom, where blood traces were found.Meredith's bedroom window was broken, leaving a shard of glass as possible murder weapon, while her body was left locked in the bedroom with no sign of the key. Nothing appeared to be stolen.Police were alerted after Meredith's two mobile phones were found near the house by an elderly local woman who said she had received threats; that line of inquiry was later abandoned.Meredith's flatmates, an American woman and two Italian women, have told investigators they were not sleeping in the house on Thursday and returned there Friday. They were being questioned yesterday.There were reports that Meredith may have known her killer because the door of the cottage had not been forced and her bedroom window was 30 feet from the ground. 'We are now questioning all Kercher's friends, male and female,' added Chiacchiera.Claims that Meredith had been attacked by a boyfriend were dismissed by friends yesterday, who said she was not in a relationship.'She did not have a boyfriend and is unlikely to have brought a boy home that night,' said Pasquale Alessi, 32, co-owner of the Merlin pub in Perugia, which she visited with friends taking the course. Another bar owner said the murder had rocked the town. 'We tell girls who are studying in Perugia not to walk home by themselves, but this has really shocked us,' said Estaban Garcia Pascual, owner of the La Tana del Orso.Last night Meredith's webpage on the social networking website, Facebook, was being filled with tributes from friends across the world.The picture Meredith had chosen to use on the website showed her smiling into the camera, dressed in a shiny red top and leaning into her close friend, Noita Sadler, whose own Facebook page simply said she was 'lost without her'.
