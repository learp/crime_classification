A Fathers4Justice campaigner has been found guilty of defacing a portrait of the Queen with purple paint while it was hanging in Westminster Abbey.Tim Haries, who told jurors he had vandalised the picture to highlight the "social justice issue of our time", had denied a charge of causing criminal damage of more than £5,000 but was found guilty by jurors at Southwark crown court, London.The father of two smuggled a can of purple spray paint into the abbey on 13 June before scrawling the word "help" on the painting, worth £160,000.Haries, 42, looked straight ahead as the verdict was announced in front of a public gallery full of supporters, many of them dressed in purple, the colour adopted by the campaign group.Jurors heard that, moments after committing the act, Haries told a steward at the abbey: "Sorry mate, I've got nothing against the Queen," before telling a police officer he was "guilty as charged".The prosecutor Allister Walker said Haries had shouted "fathers for justice" as he applied the graffiti to the large oil painting before being tackled to the ground by the steward Peter Crook.Photographs of the incident were later posted on a Fathers4Justice Facebook page.Haries, who was wearing a "prominent" Superman buckle on his belt, told officers who arrived at the scene: "It's for Fathers4Justice," and when asked if it was he who had sprayed the painting he replied: "Guilty as charged," the court was told.On Wednesday, before being sent out to deliberate, jurors were addressed by Haries, who said he had now decided to represent himself.Haries told them he had carried out the act as a protest against the "social catastrophe" of fathers not being allowed access to their children."The pain of losing my children has been like a living bereavement for me," he said."I believe that contact denial is a hate crime and an abuse of children's fundamental rights."But as he summed up the evidence heard in the day-long trial, Judge Alistair McCreath, recorder of Westminster, directed the jury that direct action or civil disobedience could not be used as a defence in law.The portrait by the artist Ralph Heimans was cordoned off by a rope in the abbey's Chapter House as part of a wider exhibition to celebrate the Queen's diamond jubilee.The 340cm x 275cm (11ft x 9ft) oil painting was bought by Westminster Abbey for £160,000 after previously being on display in the artist's native Australia, and cost £7,300 to repair.The oil on canvas depicts the Queen in the sacrarium of Westminster Abbey, also known as the Coronation Theatre, standing at the centre circle of the Cosmati pavement, on the exact spot where she was crowned.
