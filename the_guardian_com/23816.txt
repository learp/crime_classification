The Land Registry, the government department that logs land and property ownership in England and Wales, has paid out more than £26m since 2006 compensating victims of a recurring property fraud.The con – called property title theft – involves criminals taking out mortgages on properties they do not own, pocketing the money and leaving the real owner thousands of pounds in debt.Last year, the Registry paid out compensation for frauds of £4.51m, the second-highest loss on record, as well as costs of a further £440,000, according to the department's annual report. There were 53 cases of the fraud compensated in 2009/10, down from 62 incidents in 2008/09 when the loss totalled £4.23m with costs of £815,000.Patrick McCloy, director of title theft experts Gatekeeper Protection, said: "Payouts may rise exponentially as victims often do not know they have been victims of fraud until they come to sell their property, which may be many years later. As such, it is likely that victims are 'building up' and gradually more and more are becoming aware of the problem and discovering they are victims."The compensation figures, which relate to all frauds but much of which are believed to relate to title theft, have been growing steadily each year, with the exception of the £8.63m loss the Registry sustained in 2005/06. Almost all of that was paid to the Candy Brothers and their bankers HBOS after the luxury property developers were swindled by four pensioners who sold them a 47-acre Berkshire estate that they did not own.That claim dated back to 2004 when Nick and Christian Candy paid £6.5m to a quartet of fraudsters in their sixties and early seventies, believing they were purchasing King's Beeches in Sunninghill, an estate that actually belonged to a billionaire Saudi sheikh, Khalid bin Mahfouz. Forged paperwork lodged with the Registry suggested that the pensioners were the real owners.A spokesman for the Registry said: "Fraud has grown generally in the financial sector in recent years and there has been a growth in identity theft – almost two million people are affected by ID fraud every year."But we believe the majority of property frauds are perpetrated before registration: for example by impersonating the registered proprietor and obtaining a mortgage, a transaction which Land Registry would have no involvement with until after the money had been forwarded by the lender and the fraud had been successfully completed."Before 2003, the Registry used watermarked land certificates to prove a person owned a property, but they were abolished as the records went paperless and were then made available online to the public in 2006.Now, all that is needed to sell or remortgage a property is an identity and an address: so if the registered owner is one John Smith, then any John Smith can deal with the property. Experts say it is easy for a potential imposter to adopt a new name, while buy-to-let properties without a mortgage are thought to be most at risk, as tenants can intercept post that might alert the owner to a fake mortgage application.The Registry said: "We do not believe that abolishing certificates caused more fraud."However, according to internal Registry emails, released under the Freedom of Information Act, the department has been avoiding publicly addressing the issue of land certificates. The confidential emails state that questions on the subject could lead to "unwanted questions of whether [their abolition] has contributed to registration fraud itself, which we have evidence to say it may have done".
