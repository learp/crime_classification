A security consultant who was once paid £300,000 to help find Madeleine McCann and is wanted by US authorities in connection with a $2m (£1.2m) case has been arrested in Oxford after a tip-off by the manager of the hotel in which he was staying.Kevin Halligen, 48, whose private detective agency, Oakley International, had its contract for the McCann search cancelled last year, was arrested at the Old Bank hotel over a separate alleged discrepancy concerning his hotel bill.Today the hotel revealed he had been staying under an assumed name for several months, but the hotel manager had tipped off police after recognising his picture in weekend newspapers.Metropolitan police officers from London are expected to travel to Oxford on the US matter.David Harris, finance director of the boutique hotel in Oxford's High Street, said: "On Tuesday, the manager of the Old Bank contacted local police concerning this man called Kevin Halligen. He was known to us as Richard Hall. He had stayed at the hotel for several months with us. He had an outstanding bill of less than £5,000. To us, he was just an ordinary, well-behaved guest until the newspapers disclosed more at the weekend."He would not comment on reports that Halligen had been staying at the hotel with a girlfriend, and added: "In line with all our guests, we never disclose any details about them to anybody."A major benefactor of the McCanns had raised concerns over the quality of his firm's work, and the Sunday Times reported he owed £100,000 to others involved in the McCann search.The US department of justice issued an indictment for Halligen, alleging he tried to defraud a London law firm of money supposed to be used to lobby for the release of two executives from the Dutch firm Trafigura arrested in Ivory Coast. Halligen is accused of using the funds for his own benefit, including buying a mansion in Virginia.The Washington-based Oakley International was paid around £300,000 by backers of Madeleine McCann's parents to help look for the child after she went missing from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007. The six-month contract saw the firm hire other private detectives, set up a hotline and process information, but it was not renewed.A spokesman for the McCann family said: "Our association with Halligen and Oakley International ended well over a year ago. Given that an arrest has been made it would be inappropriate for us to comment."
