Gordon Brown pushed the right buttons for police officers in his speech at the Association of Chief Police Officers' conference today.Acknowledging the multiple responsibilities of today's police - international terrorism, organised crime and the more local issues of guns, gangs and knives - Mr Brown appealed to both senior officers and the grassroots.He pledged new money for technology to reduce time spent carrying out paperwork, a hardline, zero tolerance approach to gangs, knives and antisocial behaviour, longer sentences for criminals who commit violent crimes on public transport and a sympathetic ear to calls for more police powers.Senior officers believe that the police service is at a crossroads with a long period of investment ending and officer numbers beginning to fall while at the same time the police's remit has widened to take in high-tech crime such as online paedophile gangs, terrorism which crosses national borders and organised crime being carried out by foreign gangs.Mr Brown acknowledged their concerns and made clear he was putting his faith in a review by Sir Ronnie Flanagan - a first draft of which should be published in August - to address the changing nature of the police service.In his first speech on law and order, the chancellor steered clear of controversy or agenda-setting policies.Outlining a "radical review" of anti-drugs strategy he went on to describe measures which were neither radical nor new - for example talking to children at primary schools about the dangers of drugs, something which is done already at the discretion of headteachers.He also spoke about getting addicts into treatment programmes earlier, a much-repeated call from those working in the drug-addiction field.His pledge that every community will have a neighbourhood police team patrolling the streets is in line with the policy of Sir Ian Blair, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, who is a strong advocate of community policing teams made up of men and women who are not fully trained police but specially recruited community officers.That pledge is likely to cause grumblings in the police canteen, where fully trained constables make clear their dislike of community officers brought in on lower wages to patrol the streets.
