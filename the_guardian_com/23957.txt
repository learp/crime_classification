Earlier this year, the Home Office mantra when confronted with concerns about knife crime was that while every death was a tragedy, violent crime had "fallen steadily".But as the death toll has increased it has been difficult for the government to maintain that stance without appearing insensitive. Over the past weekend alone, two men were stabbed and at least another six required hospital treatment.In 24 hours last week, four people were stabbed to death in London, including a 19-year-old man who became the 20th teenager to die in a violent attack in London this year.The parents of the murdered 16-year-old Shakilus Townsend, who had himself posed in photos brandishing a knife, yesterday became the latest to issue a heartfelt plea to other youths to "leave knives alone".Despite the headlines, conclusive figures on whether there has been an increase in knife crime are difficult to obtain. The number of teenagers murdered in the capital in the first six months of the year was 17 - exactly the same number as last year.The British Crime Survey, which is based on the public's exposure to crime, should provide some context when it releases its 2006-07 figures on Thursday.The latest survey revealed that there were 169,000 violent incidents involving knives in 2005-06, around half the 340,000 in 1995, although the number has been increasing since 2003–4. But under-16s are not included in the survey, and the government is reviewing that potentially significant anomaly.Other figures suggest knife crime may be on the increase. Department of Health statistics show that almost 14,000 people were treated in hospital for stab wounds last year (446 of them aged 14 and under) - an increase of nearly 20% in five years.Since Labour came to power in 1997, the number of people prosecuted for possessing knives has increased by 72%, to 7,699 in 2006.In May, after the death of one of his constituents, the Dewsbury Labour MP, Shahid Malik, called for tougher implementation of the government's sentencing guidelines, which provide for a maximum sentence of four years for possession of a knife.But in April, with the UK's prisons full to bursting, the Sentencing Guidelines Council said many of those caught with knives should receive a community order.Yesterday, the government announced it would employ "shock tactics", making youths caught carrying knives visit stab victims in hospital. But it was widely criticised by many who feel Gordon Brown is softening his professed "zero tolerance" approach to knife crime.With the government under pressure to act quickly, David Wilson, a criminologist from Birmingham City University, fears it may be led down the wrong path. He believes that there are two reasons for youths carrying knives. One is that it makes them "feel grown up [and] manly" but the other is that they are "scared".Wilson says young people have reacted to a world in which adults demonise young people outside their own families – "they are all chavs and hoodies" – and no longer trust adults to protect them.He is dismissive of the idea of knife amnesties, sentencing crackdowns and metal detectors at schools. "The solutions are to think much longer term - how do we deal with a generation that no longer trust adults?" he told theguardian.com.But in a climate in which headlines about violent deaths are cropping up with alarming regularity, he acknowledged that time was not on the politicians' side."Politicians can never afford to think longer term," he said. "They want to be seen taking action, and taking action quickly."
