  Jack Tweed leaves Snaresbrook crown court in east London after being cleared of raping a teenager. Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PAJack Tweed, the widower of the reality TV star Jade Goody, was today cleared of raping a teenager he had met in a London nightclub.The 22-year-old club promoter and his friend Anthony Davis, 26, had denied raping the student at Tweed's east London home in last September.A jury at Snaresbrook crown court in east London unanimously found the pair not guilty after deliberating for less than half an hour.Tweed, who married Goody, 27, shortly before she died of cervical cancer in March last year, accepted he had sex with the 19-year-old woman but said he had no idea Davis was in the room at the time.He told the jury the sex had been consensual.Tweed denied using the teenager "like a sex object" and told the jury he felt there was "a strong mutual attraction" between them. He also denied changing his version of events to help Davis.Under cross-examination, the young woman denied making up the rape accusation because she was ashamed of sleeping with two men.She also denied she was "excited" to be in a celebrity's house and said she was not going from room to room looking for photos of Goody. The student told the court she had gone from being a bubbly, active teenager to a vulnerable young woman who only felt safe in her own home.The verdict brought cheers from friends and family of the defendants who packed into the public gallery of the court.In a statement read by his solicitor, Philip Smith, Tweed said: "I'm relieved that the jury have taken a matter of minutes to see through these scurrilous and completely groundless allegations. I now want to put the last eight months behind me and rebuild my life as a 22-year-old young man." Tweed interrupted his solicitor to add: "I'd first like to thank my family and friends and everyone who stood by me."
