A travel agent was abducted by a fake taxi driver and fell or jumped from the car to her death because she was terrified of being raped, a court was told yesterday.Stephanie Hammill, 20, was driven off at speed in a black Mercedes with her leg still sticking out of the open rear door, the jury at Sheffield crown court was told. After 50 metres, the door slammed shut.At the wheel, said Alistair MacDonald QC, prosecuting, was Ioannis Revenikiotis, 28, who had been working in Wakefield after graduating from Huddersfield University. Following the death of Ms Hammill in November 2003, his Mercedes was found in Greece and he was tracked down and extradited.Mr Revenikiotis denies kidnap and manslaughter. Mr MacDonald told the court the graduate had been involved in a series of incidents; though not reported to police, they showed a "tendency to act in an indecent and intimidatory fashion towards women."The jury was told that Ms Hammill and her fiance had tried to flag down taxis late at night. She had called out to him, and he to her, as the Mercedes drove off before he could get to it. Mr MacDonald said: "Revenikiotis then drove out of Wakefield, terrifying Stephanie because he went past her home without stopping."The car headed on into open countryside, where she opened the door and either jumped or fell into the road, and was struck by a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction.The trial continues.
