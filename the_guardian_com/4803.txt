Mark Bridger, the 46-year-old man being questioned by detectives hunting for the missing five-year-old April Jones, has lived in the small town of Machynlleth for more than 25 years.Born in Sutton, south London, Bridger has lived in several properties in Machynlleth. The Ministry of Defence is checking reports that Bridger is a former soldier. Locals said he worked as a lifeguard at Machynlleth leisure centre, where hundreds of volunteers gathered on Monday night to hunt for missing April.Born in November 1965, Bridger moved to Machynlleth in the 1980s, and married in 1990.He is the father of at least three children; one with his ex-wife – a boy who is now 20 – and another boy and a girl, now aged 12 and 10, with a girlfriend with whom Bridger lived in Machynlleth from the late 1990s after his marriage collapsed.Bridger has two adult siblings who both live in the south-east of England. He recently lived with another girlfriend and moved between addresses in Machynlleth with her.Police took the unusual step on Wednesday of confirming the identity of the man they had arrested on suspicion of abduction, and issuing a picture of Bridger.Detectives also released an image of Bridger's car, a blue Land Rover Discovery with the registration L503 MEP.As the hunt continues for April, Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan of Dyfed-Powys police said he was releasing the images to appeal for information from the public about any sightings of the car or Bridger from 5pm on Monday night to 3.30pm on Tuesday, when the 46-year-old was arrested as he walked down the A487 north of the Dyfi bridge outside the town.Bevan revealed the car – a left-hand drive – had been found in a repair shop in the town on Tuesday and was now the subject of fast-track forensic examination.Bevan said his detectives were pursuing a number of lines of inquiry, one of which was Mark Bridger. He asked for the public to think about whether they had seen the car or Bridger, who was wearing camouflage green jacket, black overtrousers and camouflage trousers when he was arrested.Bevan said: "Even if you have the smallest of information it could be crucial."
