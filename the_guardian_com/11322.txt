Each held one set of human remains. A paediatric expert will carry out tests to find out how old the children were when they died.A postmortem examination will be held today to find out how the children died, and the relative will be DNA-tested to discover if there was a familial link between them and the elderly woman. No names have been released by police.Investigators are examining the possibility that the occupant of the house on Rowcon Close, a 1960s council maisonette in Audenshaw, Greater Manchester, was the mother of the children and kept the deaths a secret for decades.A police spokeswoman said: "The bones are believed to be from two babies and had been at the address for some time. A postmortem will be conducted to try and establish a cause of death. Inquiries are continuing."
