Prosecutors have recovered more than half a million pounds in assets from Anne Darwin, whose husband faked his own death in a sea canoeing accident so they could claim more than £600,000 in life insurance money.The Crown Prosecution Service has recovered assets including the couple's apartment in a leafy suburb of Panama City and a dense patch of jungle by Lake Gatun which they brought with a view to opening a bed and breakfast after they fled to the central American state in 2007.John Darwin paddled out into the freezing North Sea at Seaton Carew near Hartlepool to fake his own death on 21 March 2002, camping rough on a beach before moving back in with his wife, who acted as a widow. She even took their two grown-up sons, Mark and Anthony, to grieve on the beach on the anniversary of their father's faked death without telling them he was alive and well. After netting the insurance money the couple started a new life in Panama, but were jailed after John returned to Britain and handed himself in claiming to be a victim of amnesia. Anne pretended she was astonished to see her husband alive, but the pretence crumbled when a photograph emerged showing them smiling together in an estate agent's office in Panama, and in 2008 the couple were jailed at Teesside crown court.Darwin, a former prison officer turned landlord, was sentenced to six years and three months after admitting fraud. His wife, a former doctor's receptionist, pleaded not guilty and received six and a half years after a trial. They were released in 2011.Darwin last year said he moved back "because I've got two sons and I wanted to see them and be a family again". He has returned to Seaton Carew where the Staincliffe hotel has capitalised on his notoriety with the Darwin restaurant and the Canoe Bar."It has taken some time to sell the property in Panama but we are extremely pleased to have got through the very complex process of recovering this money from overseas," said Kingsley Hyland, head of the CPS's north-east complex casework unit. "It is important that fraudsters see that not only will we prosecute them wherever possible, but we will also make every effort to retrieve their ill-gotten gains to return them to those they have defrauded."They also recovered cash from six bank accounts in Panama and the UK bringing to £501,641.39 the assets recovered from the scam.The recovered money will be repaid to the insurance companies and pension funds that were defrauded, the CPS said.
