Harold Shipman, the bearded and bespectacled family doctor, sat through four months of evidence at Preston crown court and spent much of the time listening intently or furiously taking notes.In the oak-panelled courtroom with its brass-railed dock, the 54-year-old GP from Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, was accused of being Britain's most prolific serial killer.He faced 15 charges that he murdered his women patients, aged between 49 and 81, and forged the Â£386,000 will of one of them, former Hyde mayoress Kathleen Grundy, a wealthy widow who lived alone.Throughout the trial, Shipman remained convinced of his own innocence, though few agreed with him as the evidence unfolded in court one.He denied that he knew anything about the deaths of the 15 women, despite a barrage of evidence which suggested otherwise.No, he did not inject any of the women with morphine. Yes, he had called ambulances, despite grieving relatives' evidence to the contrary. No, he had not forged the will of Kathleen Grundy, but she had occasionally borrowed his battered Brother typewriter from the surgery.When the time came for him to give evidence, the trial had to be adjourned twice as he broke down.Once while giving evidence about one of the murders, Shipman was so overcome by emotion that he began to cry. Then, several days later when prosecution counsel Richard Henriques QC rose to cross-examine him, he looked across at the judge, Mr Justice Forbes, and muttered: "I don't feel well." The trial was adjourned once more.Shipman's voice appeared shaky when he started to give evidence and he apologised for his slurred speech, which he blamed on the tablets he was taking.A hushed courtroom listened in disbelief as he outlined his suspicion that Kathleen Grundy, 81, had been abusing drugs, although she had denied it.The public gallery was often filled with Dr Shipman's former patients, friends and family as well as those who were merely curious about how a seemingly unassuming GP could murder 15 patients.Shipman's wife Primrose was there in the front row every day, loyally supporting her husband. Occasionally their four children were in court next to her.On several occasions Mrs Shipman smiled wanly at her husband as he was led away from the dock into the cells.On the first day of the trial, the pensioners and middle-aged men and women in the public gallery remained silent as the charges against the doctor were read out. Throughout the trial they queued to watch Britain's most prolific serial killer deny murdering any of his patients.But after four months of evidence, nobody seemed any the wiser as to why the apparently normal GP had become a mass murderer.
