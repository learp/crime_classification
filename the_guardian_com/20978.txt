6.06pm BST18:06Israeli victim identifiedThe Israeli woman injured in the Russell Square stabbings is an 18-year-old from Tel Aviv on a pre-enlistment trip to London, according to an Israeli news report.Yuval Labkovsky was returning to her hotel with her grandfather, after eating in a Thai restaurant, when she was set upon. Labkovsky was lightly injured in her hand during the stabbing attack and released after treatment in hospital. According to a report on the Hebrew version of the Ynet news website Labkovsky described witnessing the attack and then being injured herself. “On the way back from the hotel, I heard screams and saw two men running toward me,” she told the site. I was afraid that it was a terror attack and was sure the two men were running away from the incident.“I approached the first and felt a pain in my hand. I thought I was just hit, but it turned out he was the stabber. The second man, who was chasing him, was the man who tried, and later succeeded, in catching him.“I saw a woman lying on the floor, covered in blood. Her husband supported her. Suddenly I realized I was also bleeding,” she added.“I’m not afraid in Israel, so I have no reason to start being afraid in London,” she says.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.37pm BST14:37Jo Loughran, interim director of Time to Change, the mental health anti-stigma campaign run by Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, has urged the media to ensure any reporting of a mental health element to the Russell Square attacks is “informed and balanced”. She points out that the overwhelming majority of people with mental health problems will never pose a risk to others. She said: We understand that the police have released an update about the tragic incident at Russell Square stating that mental health is an increasingly significant factor in this case. The media must rightly report on this angle but we encourage them to do so responsibly. There have been a number of horrendous acts of violence committed across Europe over recent weeks. As the media look to unpick these extremely complex incidents to explore motivations and reason we urge journalists and editors to provide well informed and balanced coverage of mental health.Millions of people experience mental health problems every year and the overwhelming majority will never pose a risk to others.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.28pm BST14:28Another victim likely to be discharged from hospital soonA spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said two Australians were injured - a man who is already out of hospital and a woman who is expected to be discharged shortly.

Witnesses, many staying at local hotels, described hearing screaming, seeing a woman being given CPR and a man being arrested by police. Jodie Parry told the BBC she looked out of her window after hearing a commotion to see a man being pursued by officers. She said: “He just wasn’t prepared to stop ...He was actually carrying a knife in his hand and he had blood on his hands.”The number of police officers, including armed officers has been increased on the streets of the capital in the wake of the attacks as “a precautionary measure”. Police said that would continue “for as long as we need it to”.The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, urged Londoners to remain “calm and vigilant”.
