A member of the Nation of Islam led an 'explosion of violence' at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry on the day when the five murder suspects were due to give evidence, Southwark crown court was told yesterday. Rasaki Yesufu-Muhammad, of Northolt, Middlesex, who denies a charge of affray, beat a policeman 'black and blue," said John Dodds, prosecuting. He said the incident happened when some of the 30-strong group from the Nation were refused entry to the inquiry at Hannibal House in the Elephant & Castle shopping centre, south London. Police used CS gas to break up the scuffles. Two members, dressed in black suits and red bow-ties, were in the foyer like 'sentries' guarding the lift, Mr Dodds said. But their restraint turned to violence after other members who had been attending the hearing were not allowed back in. Mr Dodds explained that the chamber could only seat 250 people. He said the group filed into the building in an orderly way but because it was full some were asked to leave. Outside there were 200-300 members of the public queuing to get in and Chief Insp Robert Kelly told those excluded they had to go to the back of the queue. Mr Dodds told the jury: 'Members of the Nation of Islam decided they would go straight in. The group forced themselves past into the foyer. Then there was an explosion of violence.' Their leader, known as a 'sergeant', argued with Chief Insp Kelly at the front door before Yesufu-Muhammad surged into the building with fellow members 'shouting and screaming.' Chief Insp Kelly and two officers were allegedly assaulted and one, PC Steven Dukamp, said it was Yesufu-Muhammad who had beaten him 'black and blue'. He told the court: 'My cheek was badly bruised and my teeth and gums were black and blue.' Another officer, PC Richard Shuttleworth, also claims he was assaulted but does not know by whom. He said: 'I felt a very large blow to my face...I was stunned...and at the time I thought my nose was broken.' The case continues.
