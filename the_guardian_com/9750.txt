It was an event that might strain the resolve of the most scrupulous teenager: the discovery of more than £3,000 in neatly folded bills in a bank's unlocked night safe.This was the tantalising tableaux which confronted two boys, aged 14 and 17, when they were hanging out in a bank's foyer one Friday evening in January next to the cash machines. One of them idly tried the safe's handle and felt it give. After a few moments conference they were filmed by security cameras "legging it" away with the handily bagged-up cash. Police yesterday characterised the raid of Lloyds-TSB bank in Stamford, Lincolnshire, on Friday January 4 as opportunistic. A spokesman said: "They were hardly master criminals but they have both ended up with criminal records." The theft was discovered on the following Monday morning and the teenagers arrested within the week. "They both admitted it but we only recovered £1,200," the spokesman said. The rest was spent or given away. At Stamford juvenile court they were each ordered to pay £300 compensation. A third youth, a 16-year-old boy, was reprimanded by officers for handling stolen money. Among the pair's punishments is an order to write apology letters to the bank and the customers they stole from. Lloyds-TSB said that they had reimbursed those customers affected and were reviewing security. Police said local youths often went to the foyer to "keep out of the rain and cold".
