A murdered teenager found buried in a garden 16 years after she disappeared was last seen being driven in a green car by a man with "mild West Country" accent, a court heard today.David Tremlett, a friend who hitchhiked with 18-year-old Dinah McNicol just before she vanished, said the A-level student was on her way home the last time he saw her.David Tremlett met McNicol at a music festival in Liphook, Hampshire, in August 1991. The pair spent the night together before deciding to hitchhike to their respective homes.McNicol, who lived in Tillingham, Essex, disappeared after Tremlett left her alone in the car with the driver, Chelmsford crown court heard.Her remains were found in November 2007 in the garden of a house in Margate where Peter Tobin, who is on trial for McNicol's murder, lived at the time of her disappearance.According to the prosecution, Tobin was the driver of the green car. He is already serving a life sentence for the rape and murder of 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton in February 1991. Tobin denies killing McNicol.Tremlett told the court that he and McNicol hitched two lifts, getting them to a spot on the A3 near a pub called the Devil's Punchbowl.He said he and McNicol were picked up by a man driving a four-door car that he recalled as being green.Tremlett said McNicol got in the front passenger seat while he climbed in the back where he sat next to a child's seat.He said the driver was a man in his late 30s or early 40s with straw-coloured wavy hair and blue-grey eyes.Tremlett told the court he found it odd that the driver insisted on taking the motorway rather than an A-road."The best route from the location of the festival would have been along the A25 so I would have hoped we would have been dropped off near to Reigate or Redhill, but the guy who was driving wanted to go along the motorway which was a lot of extra distance," he said."I couldn't understand why he wanted to go along that route and I was dropped off at Junction 8 of the M25."I found it very difficult to hear what the man was saying because the conversation was in the front and we were travelling at some speed."The windows were wound down and it was a warm day."Tremlett said he heard a brief conversation about music, adding that the driver of the car said the Cambridge folk festival would be "more my style".He said he left McNicol alone in the car with the driver and she was planning to go home.She had given him her phone number, said Tremlett, but every time he tried to call her he got no answer.He said he realised she was missing only when a friend told him about a Crimewatch appeal. He was interviewed by police in May 1992, almost three years after her disappearance.Tobin's ex-wife, Cathy Wilson, told the court that he used to visit their son at weekends and had a child's seat in his car.Wilson, who married Tobin in 1989 and left him the following year, said he used to drive from his home in Margate to her home in Portsmouth to see their son, Daniel."There was no formal arrangement set up but he saw him quite regularly at weekends," she said. "They would stay in Margate. He would usually come and collect my son and take him in the car."He would collect him on a Friday and bring him back on a Sunday more often than not, he always came alone."Wilson, who spoke quietly and did not look at her ex-husband as she gave evidence, said that although Tobin changed his cars regularly, he always bought vehicles worth about Â£100 and kept a child's seat in them.Wilson told jurors Tobin spoke with a "very heavy Scottish accent".The trial continues.
