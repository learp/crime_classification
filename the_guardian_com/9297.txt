Police failed a teenage girl who was stabbed more than 60 times by her jealous and controlling ex-boyfriend by not taking seriously reports by her family about their worries, an inquest has concluded.Arsema Dawit was 15 when Thomas Nugusse killed her at a block of flats in Waterloo, central London, in June 2008.Her family had reported Nugusse to the police about five weeks before she died, saying he had threatened to assault and kill her, but they did not feel their concerns were taken seriously enough.A jury at Southwark coroner’s court criticised the police investigation, saying the family’s complaints were not treated with sufficient urgency because they were inadequately recorded.Returning the jury’s verdict, its spokeswoman said: “The principal offence was recorded as ABH and the investigation followed this line on inquiry.“Had the principal offence been recorded and verified as a threat to kill, a risk assessment would have been carried out, which would have recognised and proritised the threat to kill as urgent.“The subsequent police investigation of ABH was inadequate to a threat to kill.”The jury also criticised the police for not carrying out its investigation in a timely manner, and highlighted the insufficient measures taken to communicate with the family.“There was minimal supervision of this case as it had been given a lower priority,” the spokeswoman said.The judgment follows a lengthy legal battle by the Dawit family for justice.In 2012 they won the right to have a full inquest heard, two years after an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation found “collective and organisational failings” in the police’s handling of the case.Dawit and Nugusse, who were both originally from Eritrea, met through their local church choir.In a 999 call Nugusse made immediately after he stabbed Arsema, and which was read to the inquest, he said he had been going out with her for two years and that he killed her because she had been cheating on him.Nugusse, who was 21 at the time and was repeatedly described during the inquest as controlling and jealous, stabbed Dawit almost 60 times after she rejected his advances.Her body was found by neighbours in a lift in flats at Matheson Lang Gardens on 2 June 2008.Nugusse attempted suicide while in custody, leaving him severely mentally impaired.The family are suing the Metropolitan police.
