The mother of Clare Bernal, who was murdered by a former boyfriend while working at Harvey Nichols, has joined the second wave of alleged victims of News of the World phone hacking suing News International for damages.Patricia Bernal has lodged a high court claim against the publisher after she was shown notes kept on her by the private investigator at the centre of the scandal, Glenn Mulcaire.The notes were made available under legal disclosure by the Metropolitan police and it is understood they show that Patricia Bernal's voicemail was hacked into within hours of her daughter's death in September 2005.Stories about Clare Bernal appeared in the News of the World and other newspapers shortly after her death and her mother is understood to have been doorstepped by a number of reporters at the time.Clare Bernal was murdered by ex-boyfriend Michael Pech, a former Harvey Nichols security guard, who then shot himself. In 2007 Westminster coroner Dr Paul Knapman said the 22-year-old was unlawfully killed by Pech.The Slovakian former soldier had begun stalking Clare Bernal, from Dulwich, south London, following the end of their brief relationship. Since her daughter's death Patricia Bernal has been active in campaigning for stalking law reforms.She appeared alongside David Cameron earlier this year at Downing Street when the prime minister announced plans to make stalking a crime.Patricia Bernal joins at least 50 others, including Cherie Blair and footballer Wayne Rooney, who have lodged high court claims against News International over alleged News of the World phone hacking. This number is expected to double to about 100 claims.Nearly another 80 individuals have applied to News International's own voluntary compensation scheme.News International has already settled more than 50 phone-hacking civil claims.Patricia Bernal is being represented by solicitor Charlotte Harris, a partner at law firm Mishcon de Reya.News International declined a request to comment.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
