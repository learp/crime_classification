A man who sold a teenage girl to lorry drivers for sex in return for diesel today received an indeterminate prison sentence.David Chaney, 58, was also found guilty at Cardiff crown court of raping the girl.The judge, David Wynn Morgan, told Chaney, of Cwmbran, south Wales, that he was "a wholly contemptible human being".The judge said he was imposing an indeterminate sentence for public protection because Chaney was "a thoroughly dangerous and unscrupulous man". The sentence means he will not be considered for parole for at least five years. Chaney was also placed on the sex offenders' register and barred from working with children.The jury found Chaney guilty of raping the girl, procuring her to become a prostitute, living off the profits of prostitution, five counts of indecently assaulting the girl, and three counts of supplying controlled drugs.The girl, now 20, told the court that Chaney spiked her milkshake with ecstasy, causing her to black out, and then handcuffed her to a bed and raped her.She said Chaney would take her to meet and have sex with lorry drivers in lay-bys in return for an average of five drums of diesel, which he would sell on. If the driver had no fuel, Chaney would be given Â£20 instead, she said.The judge said Chaney had identified the girl at the age of 15 as someone he could groom and supplied her with cannabis, manipulating her into taking part in sexual activities."When you realised she was able to be manipulated, you seriously abused her, you drugged and raped her," the judge said."You realised you could use her not just for your own pleasure and perverted sexual gratification but as a commodity, something to be bartered for cash or diesel fuel."Yours is a case of rape committed by a mature adult against a very young girl, one young enough to be your granddaughter, as one of the witnesses believed to be the case."He said there was a serious risk to the public of Chaney committing further offences. "Given the opportunity, you would do it to others in a like position in the future."The judge said: "Your sexual appetite is voracious and your sexual interests perverted. You are a man with an unhealthy interest in sex and its more unsavoury aspects, including with very young adult females, sex between females and in small groups of people."The victim said she had been taken to have sex with lorry drivers about 40 times on the A449 between Newport and Monmouth, and more than 40 times at Ross-on-Wye. She said she was also taken to have sex with drivers parked in lay-bys in Abergavenny, Raglan and Magor. She said the same man was involved in most of the incidents, but she had been coerced into sex with another four men.The offences happened between April 2002 and April 2005. Chaney had denied all of the charges.
