A man has appeared in court charged with the murder 14 years ago of Vikki Thompson in Oxfordshire.Mark Weston, 34, was arrested on Tuesday. Thompson, a mother-of-two, disappeared while walking her collie dog down a country lane in Ascott-under-Wychwood. Weston is from the same village.The judge, Julian Hall, remanded Weston in custody after a 30-minute hearing at Oxford crown court.In August 1995 Thompson was hit over the head with a rock, dragged across a field and dumped near the Oxford to Worcester railway line, where she was attacked again.She was found unconscious and died at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford six days later.Her family said in a statement that Thompson was still "desperately missed".Her husband, Jonathon, and mother, Margaret Simpson, said: "Vikki was only 30 years old. She was a loving wife and mother to Matthew and Jennifer. She was much loved by all her family and friends."Time has passed by now, but still we never forget the loss we suffered when Vikki was taken away from us."Four years ago Thames Valley police launched a fresh appeal for information about the death. Detective Superintendent Barry Halliday, head of the major crime review team, said other unresolved cases were being similarly followed up.
