The home secretary, John Reid, apologised today after figures he gave to MPs yesterday on the foreign prisoners fiasco proved to be wrong.In an update on the situation, he had reported that four murderers and 23 other serious offenders were detained in prison.In fact, one of these murderers, one rapist and one child sex offender have actually been released on bail by the asylum and immigration tribunal, he revealed today.In addition, a further eight offenders have also been bailed including four in the more serious category.The home secretary said that one senior civil servant has been immediately moved from his current duties in the wake of the blunder.Plans to "change significantly" the duties of another senior official had been "advanced", he added.Speaking to the home affairs select committee only yesterday, Mr Reid seemed particularly irritated by being placed in situations where he quoted statistics which were almost immediately found to be wrong."I don't remember a figure over the last fortnight that hasn't been revised very quickly," he told MPs in the committee hearing.In letters to the committee chairman, John Denham, and the Commons Speaker, Michael Martin, Mr Reid said he was informed of the mistake late last night.The letters said bail hearings had taken place over the last 10 days - meaning they happened since the scandal first emerged and even after his predecessor, Charles Clarke, was sacked.More bail hearings are due in the coming days, he added."You will recall that I said during the course of my evidence session yesterday that caution should be attached to all of the information which I had been given to provide to the committee," he wrote to Mr Denham."As if to confirm that statement, I am afraid that I have to write to you to correct information that I was supplied with in respect of the number of offenders currently detained in prison."To be put in a position where information was wrongly given to your committee - in spite of the caveats that I put around that information - is not acceptable and I apologise to you and your committee."He added that he had asked officials to "re-check" all the facts provided to the hearing. A Home Office spokesman said: "Application for bail was opposed in all cases and the home secretary has today instructed that all further bail applications should be opposed as vigorously as possible. "Furthermore, he has instructed that where bail is granted the Home Office should apply for the most stringent bail conditions available."The home secretary has asked officials to ensure that all those released on bail are immediately subject to the probation licensing arrangements appropriate to their case."He added that Mr Reid had asked for information on bail hearings to be included in all future reports to him from the special incident room in Portsmouth, which is handling the inquiry into the original 1,019 cases.
