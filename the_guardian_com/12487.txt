All 43 police authorities in England and Wales said last night they had rejected a deadline of today set by the home secretary, Charles Clarke, to submit voluntary plans for force merger.Bob Jones, chairman of the Association of Police Authorities, said an attempt by Mr Clarke to "divide and rule" by offering extra money to those forces that volunteered for merger by today at the expense of those that did not had failed. "No police authority has submitted a full business case to the Home Office. Police authorities have unanimously rejected the home secretary's plans to force these proposals through with indecent haste, and we believe there are also credible alternative options which should be considered very seriously," he said.But as local politicians on police authorities raised their banner of rebellion, chief constables in the West Midlands unveiled their plan for the biggest regional force outside of London - albeit in the face of opposition from one of their amalgamation partners, the highly rated West Mercia force.The Association of Chief Police Officers has said that most chief constables are in favour of the restructuring plan. Mr Clarke is expected to informally extend today's deadline until the middle of next month to give the authorities and forces more time. Cleveland and Gloucestershire police are expected to emerge as the strongest opponents of the merger plans.The merged West Midlands regional force would include the West Midlands, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and West Mercia forces, and would have 14,000 officers and 7,000 staff, making it second only in size to the Metropolitan police.Northumbria and Durham police chiefs said yesterday they were prepared to amalgamate, but the opposition of Cleveland appeared to have left the idea of a north-east regional force a dead duck.Mr Clarke has said that the plan to merge forces in England and Wales into as few as 12 regional forces is essential to help meet modern challenges of terrorism and organised crime. He insists that it will not undermine moves to develop neighbourhood policing. Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary has said forces with fewer than 4,000 officers are not equipped to fight sophisticated modern crime.Resistance is expected from small forces in the south-west, East Anglia and Cumbria. Local political battles are likely up to May's local elections with Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs gearing up for "save our local force" campaigns.West Midlands chief constable Paul Scott-Lee said the merger in his region would be the best way forward. "West Mercia were asked for their opinion and they came to a professional judgment. We think it will be better to serve the region with one force."Warwickshire police said that a number of recent murders meant that 80% of their detectives had to be taken from local policing to deal with them.A merger would mean more emphasis on local neighbourhood policing and specialist teams to deal with major incidents and serious crimes.The merger would cost £45m to put through, but those involved claim that savings of between £25m and £30m would soon emerge.
