A man has been jailed for plotting to have his pregnant lover attacked so as to kill their unborn child. Jamie Smith, 23, devised the plan with two friends after learning that the woman had become pregnant while they were having an affair.After deciding he did not want the child Smith recruited Steven Blades and another man to carry out a vicious assault on the woman with a crowbar and a knife. They planned to lure her to a secluded park in Peterborough under pretence of wanting to discuss the pregnancy.Smith, of Athena Close, Stanground, Peterborough, planned to make the events look like a robbery and be injured during the attack, Cambridgeshire police said. But the third man decided he did not want to get involved and tipped off the police.Officers arrested Smith and Blades shortly before the attack was due to happen on 21 February.Detective Constable Vicky Speirs, who investigated, said: "This was a sickening and extremely dangerous plot to cause a young woman to lose her unborn child. It is incomprehensible how anyone would want to carry out such a hurtful and violent act. It was an incredibly selfish act by Smith, who gave no thought as to what effect his actions could potentially have on the victim."Given the level of violence they were prepared to use, we could quite easily have been dealing with a murder. Thankfully, one of those men recruited by Smith to carry out his dirty work saw sense and contacted the police, so we could intervene and prevent such a serious incident taking place."Blades, 23, of Wells Court, Peterborough, pleaded guilty to conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm. Smith denied the charge, claiming others had come up with the plan. But he was convicted following a five-day trial at Peterborough crown court.Smith was jailed for seven years and Blades for 12 months at a hearing on Tuesday. The judge, Sean Enright, gave each man a 10-year restraining order in relation to the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
