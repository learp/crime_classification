The parole board is urging the Home Office to pay for the reintroduction of interviews with serious offenders seeking early release from prison, a spokesman said yesterday.The issue has become politically charged following a spate of high-profile crimes, including two murders in 2004, that of the financier John Monckton by Damien Hanson, and that of the teacher Robert Symons by Yousef Bouhaddaou. Both killers were freed by parole panels who sat in their absence, after the government took away 90% of the parole board's funding for such interviews."When funding was withdrawn we were very much against it, but the Home Office said research suggested [interviews] were not necessary. We had to accept that," said a spokesman. "Given the cases we have seen, we think they are necessary."Edward Garnier QC, a Tory home affairs spokesman, welcomed the move but said funding should never have been withdrawn and that the terrible crimes committed by some offenders on early release had been foreseeable. "If you take away from the parole board the resources they need to do a good job, it's inevitable that the level of mistakes will go up."David Cameron, the Conservatives' leader, yesterday went further. In an interview with the News of the World he promised to scrap the early release scheme altogether.A Home Office spokesman said: "All parole decisions are based on a full dossier of reports, including from prison staff, probation staff and specialists, such as psychologists, where appropriate. Every dossier includes a risk assessment." Any funding request would be decided on its merits.The government is already working on a package of measures to stem public concern caused by cases where offenders should have been under supervision.
