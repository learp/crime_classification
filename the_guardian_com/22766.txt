The government's use of control orders faced renewed criticism yesterday over what is believed to be the first jailing of a terrorist suspect for allegedly breaching his restrictive regime.Mahmoud Suliman Ahmed Abu Rideh, 33, who was one of 10 suspects released under the controversial orders last month, is now understood to be under 24-hour watch in the hospital wing of Brixton prison, south London.The father of five appeared before Bow Street magistrates court in London on Wednesday and was remanded in custody for a week. He was charged with failing to comply with "any of the obligations" imposed on him under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 "without reasonable excuse".His arrest follows a decision last Thursday that he could have his electronic tag removed while he received hospital psychiatric treatment and he was told it would not be reattached while he was receiving the treatment.He is alleged to have breached his control order when he visited a police station on Tuesday and told officers he did not want to have the tag refitted and would prefer to be returned to custody.Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights organisation Liberty, yesterday accused the Home Office of "chopping and changing" the terms of his regime and adding to the "cruelty and confusion suffered by this man"."The Home Office confirmed that for a period of time that [it] had agreed to take the tag off," she said. "The faulty and cruel nature of control orders has been once again exposed."We are deeply alarmed at the suggestion that a man driven to the point of repeated self-harm may now be prosecuted for going to the police in a cry for help."Mr Rideh, who was born in Jordan, was held in Belmarsh prison, south-east London, and Broadmoor high security hospital in Berkshire for 3 years without charge.His supporters say his mental health deteriorated because of his time in custody.Under the control order regime, designed to prevent terrorist activity, suspects may face a night-time curfew and are required to stay at home monitored by electronic equipment.Other restrictions include bans on using phones and the internet and on whom they meet or allow into their homes.The precise details of the 10 orders have not been revealed by the Home Office.A Home Office spokeswoman said: "The whole point of this [legislation] is that if somebody breaches a control order, we can take them to court and the ultimate sentence is a prison sentence. We never gave details of what were the particulars of their control orders."We are not going to go through in detail what he has breached or hasn't breached because we don't reveal what control orders he was under."Another Home Office spokeswoman added later: "This is a matter before the courts so we are not commenting on the case at all."Breaking a control order carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment.
