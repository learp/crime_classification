A bank worker appeared in court in Belfast today charged in connection with the Â£26.5m Northern Bank robbery carried out last December.Chris Ward, 24, denied the charges and accused police of "hounding" and "torturing" his friends and family in order to frame him.Mr Ward was one of two staff members held by gunmen during the raid last year, which is believed to be the biggest bank robbery in British history.A detective told Belfast magistrates court today that Mr Ward had allegedly manipulated the bank's work rota so the raid could be carried out.Mr Ward, of Poleglass in west Belfast, read a lengthy statement of denial in court. He said: "Police have bugged my house, a holiday in Spain, went through all my phone records, my bank accounts, hounded my friends, even going as far as Australia, and have tortured my family in an attempt to frame me with the Northern Bank robbery."Police have failed in all of these counts. They have held me longer than the hostage-takers who seized me last year, and indeed have held me in a police station for longer than anyone else in the history of the north of Ireland."But Detective Inspector Sean Wright said he was able to link the accused with the crime.The judge ordered Mr Ward to be held in custody until his next court appearance, on January 4.Mr Ward says gunmen burst into his home in December 2004 and threatened to kill his family if he did not obey their instructions.He says the robbers kept his family captive in the house while he was driven at gunpoint to the home of the bank's supervisor, Kevin McMullan.The two men were then ordered to go to work as normal the following day, while Mr McMullan's wife was taken from her home by gang members.The two were ordered to let gang members into the bank so they could begin clearing the cash into rubbish bags.The vaults at the bank's headquarters were emptied during the multimillion-pound robbery.Mr Ward was arrested last month and held for eight days, during which period detectives investigating the theft interviewed him around 50 times.None of the money from the robbery has ever been recovered. The bank was forced to issue redesigned banknotes and withdraw the earlier issue to make the robbers' haul worthless.A month after the robbery the chief constable in charge of the investigation, Sir Hugh Orde, blamed the IRA for it.
