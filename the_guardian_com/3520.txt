A nursery school worker was today charged with seven offences, including sexual assault and distributing indecent images of children.Vanessa George, 39, from Plymouth, is accused of four offences of sexual assault and one count each of making, possessing and distributing indecent images of children.George is in custody at Charles Cross police station, where she will be detained until she appears before Plymouth magistrates court tomorrow.Police were continuing to speak to staff at the Little Ted's nursery in Plymouth and the parents of children who attend the centre.At a press conference this afternoon detectives revealed that some of the images they were examining had allegedly been taken inside the nursery. The investigation was described as "significant and serious".Plymouth district police commander Chief Superintendent Jim Webster said identification of the children in the images was "very difficult" and that none had been identified so far. In many cases the photos only showed a torso.Webster said they were concentrating for the moment on images taken on a camera phone but "hundreds, perhaps thousands" of images could be examined during the inquiry.About 100 people attended a meeting on Tuesday night at St Paul's church, where Webster spoke to parents and those associated with the nursery along with Plymouth city council's director of children and young people's services, Bronwyn Lacey."We continue to talk extensively with members of our community who are naturally concerned about these charges," Webster said today."Last night's meeting was well attended by those people associated with the nursery, and we took the opportunity to allay their fears where possible and also further the police investigation into the allegations."We will continue to liaise with local groups and people associated with the nursery and are committed with our partners to update concerned and interested parties at the earliest opportunity."George, who is understood to have worked at the unit for about two to three years, was arrested by police at midnight at her home in the Efford area of the city.The nursery has remained shut since then and parents were handed letters explaining what had been happening.Social workers and police family liaison officers are visiting all parents of children who attend the nursery and a hotline has been set up to try to help concerned families.
