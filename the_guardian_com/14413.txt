A man has been jailed for life for stabbing his father to death, dismembering him and placing his body parts in storage boxes he used as a television stand.Nathan Robinson, 27, was told he would serve a minimum of 30 years when he was sentenced at Winchester crown court on Wednesday for the murder of William Spiller at the flat they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset, in May 2013.Robinson used a Stanley knife, a hacksaw and a saw to cut up the 48-year-old taxi driver’s body and put the parts in the boxes, with a television placed on top, in the victim’s bedroom. His head was placed in a box and put in a filing cabinet.Robinson denied murder but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. Last month it took the jury just 90 minutes to find him guilty of murder.Dorset police said Robinson had gone to great lengths to try to mislead officers and Spiller’s partner Glenys Molyneaux.Robinson stole his father’s mobile phone and thousands of pounds in cash before travelling to Glasgow, Birmingham and Bristol to visit friends and relatives, police said.While he was in Scotland, he gave one of his friends a boxset of the Saw horror films, the court was told.Robinson claimed that he had only limited memories of the killing and that he had been abused as a child by his father and by another man on a separate occasion, the trial heard.He said his mother, Elaine Robinson, worked as a prostitute and he had found an advertisement that she used to offer her services.But prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC said the likely motive for the killing was financial as Robinson owed his father £36,000.He also took almost £8,000 of Spiller’s cash, which he used after the killing to go out with his friends and to take his mother to a vegan weekend.Police only discovered Spiller’s remains a month after the killing after receiving a “concern for welfare” call from Molyneaux, a force spokesman said.Robinson was arrested at his mother’s home in Birmingham in June 2013 and admitted killing his father and cutting up his body.The court was told a carpet cleaner and steamer found in Spiller’s home had been used to clean up the crime scene and Robinson had posed as his father, sending texts to Spiller’s partner.Following the sentencing, Molyneaux said the past 18 months had been “extremely traumatic from first receiving the dreadful news of Will’s death until the trial which revealed the full horror of what happened that day”.She said: “Will was a loving, caring man with a hilarious sense of fun and humour. No sentence can bring him back but we are satisfied that the verdict of guilty was the appropriate one for this heinous crime. As a family we would like to thank people for their love and support during this dreadful time.”
