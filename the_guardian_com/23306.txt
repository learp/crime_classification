The man who killed headteacher Philip Lawrence, due to be released from prison within days, has said he will live "quietly and decently" after his release.Learco Chindamo, now 29, was 15 when he stabbed Lawrence outside his London school in 1995. He was convicted of the murder in October 1996 and jailed indefinitely, with a minimum tariff of 12 years.The parole board have given the go-ahead for Chindamo's release and he is expected to be freed within days. In a statement, Chindamo said he has reformed and wants to live a "quiet and decent" life, but says he is aware that some people will not be able to accept that he has changed and deserves freedom."I did a terrible thing when I killed Mr Lawrence," Chindamo said in the statement, published by the Daily Telegraph."I have been rightly punished and I have always understood that I should not be released until I had changed and was no longer dangerous."I know that some people will not be able to accept that I have changed or that I should be allowed my freedom. I also know that I will spend the rest of my life atoning for my crime, and mean to do so by living quietly and decently."Chindamo came to the UK when he was six, and has an Italian passport. His father is Italian, his mother is from the Philippines.Three years ago he won an appeal against being deported to Italy after his lawyers argued it would breach his human rights. They successfully argued that deportation to Italy would have been illegal as Chindamo was from an EU country and had already lived in the UK for 10 years by 1995.It was the second time the government had tried to remove Chindamo. An attempt in 2001 was blocked because it began too soon after he had been sentenced.Chindamo was 15 when he stabbed Lawrence as the teacher defended a pupil outside St George's Roman Catholic comprehensive school.A parole board spokesman said yesterday that they could not comment on or confirm decisions or reasons in individual cases."Once a life sentence prisoner's minimum tariff has been served, the court regards him or her as having served the necessary period of imprisonment to reflect the gravity of the offence and the need for punishment," he said."The only legal question which has to be answered to determine the justification for detention thereafter is whether or not the prisoner is a risk to the public."The statutory test to be applied by the parole board is whether it is satisfied that the risk to life and limb to the public is no more than minimal."If it is so satisfied, it is required to release the prisoner."He said the board would take a number of things into account, including the offence, the prisoner's offending history and progress in prison, statements on behalf of the victim, and reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers.
