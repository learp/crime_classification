A barrister became the first member of his profession to be jailed for perverting the course of justice yesterday after sending bogus court documents to his client's opponent.Bruce Hyman, a radio and theatre producer who retrained as a barrister, engineered a sting in an apparent effort to discredit the former husband of a friend he was representing in a family court case.Bristol crown court was told that Hyman, 49, a father of four, committed the offence while he was suffering a depressive illness because he was struggling to make a success of his new career.No fewer than 25 friends and colleagues from the media and the law, including Sir Mark Potter, the president of the high court's family division, and Denis Nowlan, network manager of BBC Radio 4, gave character references for Hyman. The actor Maureen Lipman consoled members of his family outside court.Judge Tom Crowther said Hyman's behaviour was so appalling that he had no choice but to jail him. Hyman was sentenced to 12 months in jail.The court heard that Hyman had agreed to represent a friend, Karen Young, in a court dispute over the custody of her child. He sent emails to Ms Young's former husband, banker Simon Eades, containing a court judgment that seemed to support his case. When Mr Eades tried to use the judgment during a hearing, Hyman claimed the document was a forgery.The case was adjourned and, fearing he could be arrested, Mr Eades set out to discover who had sent the bogus document. He found the emails had been sent from a shop in central London. He was amazed when CCTV footage from the shop showed it was Hyman who had sent them.Paul Dunkels, defending, said Hyman had sent the bogus documents to try to get the case adjourned because he could not cope with it. Outside court, Mr Eades said: "I was accused of a heinous crime ... There was a real possibility I could go to prison and never see my child again. It was horrifying."
