New powers allowing police to clear the streets and create "no-go" areas for the public are being considered, the home secretary, Theresa May, has said.May said it was time to consider whether the police needed a power "to impose a general curfew in a particular area" in the aftermath of last week's riots.The home secretary said the government was also contemplating tougher powers to impose curfews on individual teenagers under the age of 16.In a speech in London, she said the power to declare a general curfew was needed because existing dispersal powers only allowed the police to declare a "no go" area with advance notification."In the fast-moving situation we have seen in the last week, we need to make sure the police have all the powers that are necessary," she added.Asked about the curfew powers, May said: "It's something that we're going to look at to address whether, and to what extent, we may need to change the law."There are two issues – one is the availability of curfew powers in relation to individuals who are under the age of 16, and the other is whether … at the moment the curfew powers are specific in terms of individuals and attached to individuals, and it's whether more general powers are needed."I think we need to look at dispersal powers as well, because those do require an upfront designation of an area."It's clear to me that, as long as we tolerate the kind of antisocial behaviour that takes place every day up and down the country, we will continue to see high levels of crime, a lack of respect for private property and a contempt for community life."She said the police "need to have the legal powers to take robust action against criminals", adding: "They also need strong leaders – single-minded crimefighters who get to the top and measure their own performance on nothing but taking the fight to lawbreakers."I want police officers to hear this message loud and clear: as long as you act within reason and the law, I will never damn you if you do."May praised officers who put themselves in harm's way during the riots, saying everyone owed them "a debt of gratitude".She added that controversial proposals to replace police authorities with elected police and crime commissioners from next year, and the introduction of a new National Crime Agency, were now more important than ever.The home secretary also defended her decision not to delay the appointment of the new Metropolitan police commissioner to enable a foreign national, such as Bill Bratton, to apply for the job.She is also writing to Sir Denis O'Connor, the chief inspector of constabulary, saying forces should be given clearer guidance on tactics, pre-emptive action, the number of officers trained in public order policing, the need for forces to assist others, and the appropriate arrest policy.O'Connor warned earlier this year that more than two in five forces were unprepared to help police major protests.May rejected calls from senior officers to reconsider the government's 20% cuts to police budgets in the wake of the riots."I am clear that, even at the end of this spending period, forces will still have the resources to deploy officers in the same numbers we have seen in the last week," she said."It's clear to me that we can improve the visibility and availability of the police to the public."It's more important than ever that we do so, because we are asking the police to fight crime on a tighter budget."
