This morning Neil Acourt and David Norris will wake up in prison, fearing that the trial judge will jail them for their assault on a black police officer when they return to court next month for sentencing.But at the back of their mind will be an even greater fear. That the Scotland Yard squad still investigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence, has got enough evidence to charge them or the other three members of their gang - Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight - over the 1993 racist murder.A decision expected in May has repeatedly been put back as the prosecutors weigh up if there is enough evidence to charge some of the gang for murder, and others for lesser offences. But, with the criminal justice shake-up last week, they could decide to let the scrapping of the double-jeopardy rule take effect, meaning all five could be charged with murder. As the law stands Neil Acourt, Knight and Dobson cannot be charged with murder. They were cleared of the charge at the Old Bailey in 1996 after a private prosecution brought by the victim's parents. That trial failed largely because the evidence of the surviving eyewitness to the attack, Duwayne Brooks, was ruled inadmissible. Prosecutors had hoped to play the jury a covert video of the gang members which allegedly showed their violent and racist behaviour. At yesterday's trial, Norris denied being a racist, but the video reportedly captured racist rants by him fantasising about killing and torturing black people, with Neil Acourt stabbing furniture with a large knife. The Metropolitan police were castigated by the official report into the Lawrence case, with Sir William Macpherson branding them institutionally racist for the way they handled the investigation.
