A 42-year-old man held hostage in Liverpool for nine days has been freed at the end of the longest operation of its kind the Metropolitan Police has ever run.The man, so far unnamed, was kidnapped in London at 5am on March 13 as he was on his way to work by car. He was freed on Wednesday after police raided a property in Liverpool at the end of an operation managed by the Met's kidnap unit. It involved up to 200 officers, some armed.Detective Chief Superintendent Sharon Kerr, of the Met's specialist crime directorate, said: "Not only have we saved this man's life, we have got a lot of intelligence and ripped the heart out of one of the most significant criminal networks in this country."A spokesman for the force said: "It is believed the man was taken because of a dispute between criminal networks involved in drugs."The hostage was taken to hospital where he is being treated for injuries to his upper body and face. His condition is not described as critical.The spokesman added: "The kidnap unit also engaged colleagues from across the Met, including CO19 [the specialist firearms unit], as well as colleagues in other forces. [On Wednesday], following several tense days of building up intelligence, officers were in position to act."As the man was freed police raided addresses in Huyton, Merseyside; Denham, Buckinghamshire; and Brentwood, Essex, and arrested 10 men and one woman. They also seized 1kg of cocaine, a large quantity of amphetamine, two guns and about Â£200,000 in cash.Residents in a cul-de-sac in Huyton said they had seen police cars parked outside a house believed to be linked to the kidnap plot, but not thought to be where the hostage was held. Neighbours said a man in his late 30s lived there but no one was at home yesterday and there was no sign of police activity.One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: "There were some police around last night and on Sunday but nobody knows what's been going on. The guy who lives there keeps himself to himself and nobody knows much about him."Ms Kerr said the kidnapping operation had been "totally covert" and had involved officers from several forces.It was the longest-running kidnap the Met had ever investigated. and had been "incredibly difficult" to track.Earlier kidnap operations had lasted for up to a week, with most running for two to three days."Officers from the kidnap unit are used to working in some of the toughest policing conditions, with investigations invariably involving violent criminality on both sides," added Ms Kerr. "That makes the risks extremely high and the threat to life real and constant."We are rightly proud of our track record when dealing with kidnaps, but we never take it for granted and no matter the background of those involved we take our duty to preserve life extremely seriously."In this instance, not only have we saved the life of a man, but with the intelligence gained we have the opportunity to tackle an organised criminal network and reduce harm to a number of communities."The Metropolitan Police has the country's largest team of trained kidnap and hostage negotiators, although the actual number of trained personnel in this field is not made public for operational reasons.The special unit investigated 41 kidnaps last year. The unit was developed because of the growth of kidnappings, both in domestic arguments and for financial gain in recent years.A total of 172 kidnap offences were reported to the Met last year, a drop from 235 the year before.
