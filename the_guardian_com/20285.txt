A man wanted by detectives in connection with last year's Â£53m Securitas raid, Britain's largest ever cash robbery, is to be extradited to the UK, after permission was granted by the Moroccan supreme court yesterday.Paul Allen, 28, faces charges over the Securitas depot robbery in Tonbridge, Kent, last February, with Lee Murray, 27, a cage fighter from Sidcup, south London.The Moroccan supreme court in Rabat granted approval for a request from the UK authorities for Mr Allen to be extradited to Britain, but Mr Murray's case has been adjourned until May 30.Kent police said Mr Allen would remain in the custody of the Moroccan authorities until a date for his extradition was set. "It is expected he will be extradited in the near future, though no date has been set."It has been reported that Mr Murray's case may be somewhat more complex as his father is Moroccan and local laws prohibit the extradition of Moroccan nationals to another country.Mr Murray was arrested in Rabat on an international warrant last June, and later sentenced to eight months in jail for assault, resisting arrest and drug possession.Eleven people denied involvement in the robbery when they appeared at the Old Bailey in March. Their cases are to be heard in two trials this year.
