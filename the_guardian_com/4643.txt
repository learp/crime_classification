The trial of Harold Shipman, the family doctor charged with the murder of 15 of his women patients, began in Preston, Lancashire, yesterday and came to a temporary halt after just 14 minutes.Mr Justice Forbes adjourned the hearing. The next three days will be filled with legal argument and most of the media and public will not return until Monday, when a jury is likely to be sworn in and Richard Henriques QC, will make his opening address for the crown. The trial is expected to last at least three months Dr Shipman, known to his friends and colleagues as Fred, was driven to the court in a white prison van almost two hours before the hearing began. He wore a light brown suit, white shirt and dark tie as he stepped from the cells into the dock. He stood impassively beneath a skylight facing an dais on which the judge sat beneath a framing arch with carved pillars. Behind him, in the public gallery, sat his wife, Primrose, and two of their four children. During the short hearing, Dr Shipman cleared his throat, cleaned his glasses and made a couple of notes on a pad. Dr Shipman, 53, whose practice was in Hyde, Greater Manchester, and who lives in nearby Mottram, is accused of killing 15 women aged 49 to 81 in the three years between 1995 and 1998. He is also charged with one count of forgery. Because of the intense media interest the trial has been transferred from the modern crown court 100 yards away to the rarely-used old quarter sessions house, which was also the setting for the trial of the two 10-year-old boys convicted of the murder of James Bulger in 1993. The court, faced with local Longridge stone and boasting a 170ft tower, was built between 1900 and 1903 to impress citizens with the majesty of the law. It was described by Nikolaus Pevsner, the authority on the buildings of England, as "English baroque with a dose of Italian baroque".
