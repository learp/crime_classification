A former police community support officer who sent confidential intelligence to criminals for profit after becoming addicted to gambling was jailed for 15 months today.Sonuc Mehmet, 24, helped known criminals raid cannabis factories by finding the addresses of potential targets and sending them the details by text.Judge David Radford, the honorary recorder of Redbridge, said Mehmet grossly abused his position of trust in the Metropolitan police as he set out to make money by helping criminals.Mehmet carried out more than 250 searches of the force's criminal intelligence systems for cannabis factories across the London area in one month, Snaresbrook crown court in east London heard. He then sent the confidential information to criminals by text.After one search identified a property in Harrow last July, two men allegedly raided the house and escaped with 2.9kg of cannabis valued at £17,000. Both men face trial later this year and cannot be named for legal reasons.Sentencing Mehmet, the judge said: "It is indeed a sad day that you find yourself where you are."He told Mehmet he sent the information to "those who you well knew were going to use it to commit serious criminal offences concerning the burglary or robbery of suspected cannabis factories."The inference that I draw is that your involvement was for reasons of financial gain."Mehmet searched the force's systems again after the raid to establish whether the burglary had taken place and what information the police had, the court heard.The judge said Mehmet, who was based in Havering, east London, had been an exemplary PCSO after joining the force in November 2006 but his attitude and behaviour changed when he developed a serious gambling problem in December 2008.After previously winning three commendations and high praise from his superiors, he became lazy, had problems with attendance, and concerns were raised about his associations with known criminals, the court was told.By then he was "pathologically" addicted to gambling and was in considerable debt, the court heard. No further details were given.In mitigation, Valerie Charbit said Mehmet, of Stoke Newington, north London, hoped to gain £200 by providing the information to the criminals, but was never paid."This defendant is genuinely remorseful," she said. "He committed a grave error of judgment in conducting himself the way he did. He has completely turned his life around since his arrest."Earlier, Mark Fenhalls, for the prosecution, said Mehmet originally told police in an interview that he was accessing the force computer systems every day because the official briefings were "very poor" and he needed the information for his personal safety.But as the evidence against him mounted he pleaded guilty in May to misconduct in public office between 29 June and 21 July last year.His family and friends gasped in the public gallery as he was sent down.Mehmet, who has a 10-month-old son, resigned from the Met last October and became a bus driver.
