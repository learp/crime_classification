Kaliningrad, with its frontier atmosphere, is a dangerous place to ask questions about smuggling. But this isolated Russian enclave on the Baltic is now alleged to be the home of a novel phenomenon which is alarming western authorities.Russia is accused of allowing Britain and Europe to be flooded with a wave of cut-price smuggled cigarettes. The most recent UK seizure was this month, at Coventry.An incriminating video, extracts from which are published by the Guardian today, was shot by undercover journalists at a huge cigarette factory in Kaliningrad.The video is likely to lead to diplomatic repercussions, worsening already strained relations between Russia and the UK.It shows that the Baltic Tobacco Company (BTC), apparently Russian-owned, is manufacturing on a large scale a previously obscure cigarette brand called Jin Ling. The firm is selling them by the container-load to smugglers at 20 US cents a packet. Smuggled Jin Ling, resembling the US Camel brand in appearance, are coming to light across Europe from Lithuania to Venice. They have been seized in Dover, Chelmsley Wood in Birmingham and Heanor in Derbyshire. Last year 500,000 were found in Denmark on a ship bound for the UK. This month's UK Jin Ling seizures were hidden in a truckload of reels of cable in Coventry, British Customs said. A Polish citizen was among those arrested."Jin Ling is the most disturbing new development anywhere in the world in the illegal tobacco trade," said Luk Joossens, a World Health Organisation specialist. "They are flooding into Europe."EU countries seized 258m smuggled Jin Ling cigarettes last year.Officials at the EU's anti-fraud office in Brussels have set up an international task force as a result.Austin Rowan, who heads the unit, said: "The smuggling of Jin Ling has become a huge problem in the EU, causing substantial losses to both national and EU budgets."Evidence has come to light that British American Tobacco (BAT), the giant UK firm, was selling Brazilian tobacco to the Russian factory.BAT now said this was an "oversight" which "has immediately been put right".A BAT spokesman said: "Our anti-illicit trade team is aware of allegations around the Jin Ling brand made by BTC. "Regrettably, our subsidiary Souza Cruz was not aware until now ... We can confirm consequently that no more tobacco will be supplied."Video evidence about what is going on in Kaliningrad has been obtained by the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a non-profit group which includes East European reporters.They went in to the factory under cover, posing as would-be Romanian buyers. A container-load of Jin Ling, which are never officially marketed in Europe, was offered for less than £60,000.It would be worth at least £1.5m in the UK, if smuggled packs of cigarettes were sold at half the legitimate price in Britain.The reporters were told that provided they paid in advance, the container could be delivered to the quayside ready for shipment and were told: "We're not interested in what you're doing with them."BTC did not respond to requests to comment on the allegations.Kaliningrad, the former home of the Soviet Baltic fleet, is sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania and cut off from the rest of Russia.The enclave went into cataclysmic decline after the break up of the Soviet Union, but has since profited from its close proximity to the EU.Russian journalists working in Kaliningrad have learned that to openly ask about the cigarette contraband trade is a risky business. In 2005, local newspaper Novye Kolesa criticised the protection given to smugglers by local officials.The paper also said that a police commander's family was operating a duty free shop supplying smugglers plying the Polish border. In response, the newspaper was raided and closed down.Ironically, the development of a smuggling route between Kaliningrad and Britain may have been first stimulated by mainstream British tobacco firms, according to MPs.In 2003, commons public accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh said of Imperial Tobacco's former activities: "They persisted in exporting large volumes to places like Kaliningrad when they must have known that the cigarettes could not possibly be for those domestic markets."• Duncan Campbell is a freelance investigative journalist and not the Guardian journalist of the same nameLinksThe full ICIJ report: publicintegrity.org/investigations/tobaccoThe tobacco manufacturers association: the-tma.org.uk
