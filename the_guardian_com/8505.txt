Thusha Kamaleswaran was a carefree, playful five-year-old in a pink dress and red cardigan, dancing and skipping in the aisle of her dad's shop, when a bullet struck her in the chest and passed through the seventh vertebra of her spine.In an instant, her life was changed. "Within seconds," prosecuting counsel told the court, "Thusha was on the floor, saying she could not feel her legs."A year after the shooting, Thusha, now six, remains in hospital. Although she is likely to be discharged next week, she will have to wear a brace and leg splints permanently, and may have to undergo repeated operations to prevent her spine curving.She will spend the rest of her life reliant on a wheelchair and requiring round the clock assistance.Thusha – "a baby", as Det Sup Gordon Allison described her – lived with her parents and siblings, a 12-year-old brother and three-year-old sister in Hainault, east London.Her father, Jeyakumar Ghanasekaram, worked on the till at Stockwell Food and Wine, and Thusha's mother Sharmila Kamaleswaran had brought the children to the shop to collect her husband, when the shooting took place."'She was a playful child, always happy and smiling and was a good student at school," Kamaleswaran told the court in a statement. "It's hard for all at home to see an innocent child [who had been] hopping around like a rabbit, now paralysed."
