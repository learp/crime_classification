However, he added that, although he had supported his wife's dream of becoming a special constable, he had become anxious over the level of crime in the area.'I encouraged her, but I had my worries for her safety. When she dressed up to go to work she would ask "Do I look cute?" She was proud to wear the uniform,' Nasri said.His wife was stabbed, and she died in his arms on their third wedding anniversary after she ventured outside their home to investigate a disturbance. The couple had recently been discussing starting a family.His spoke as police appealed for help from young people who may have seen the suspect running down Sudbury Avenue away from where Patel-Nisra was attacked last Thursday night.
