Cherie Booth, QC, called for steps last night to tackle the crisis of overcrowding in prisons.The prime minister's wife pressed for more use of community sentences, saying the soaring prison population was frustrating attempts to rehabilitate prisoners and break the cycle of reoffending. "The huge increase in numbers and the prevalence of short term sentences is crippling any attempt at a constructive approach to prison," she said. Home Office figures this week showed the number of prisoners at an all time high of 71,360, only 293 short of capacity. Delivering the inaugural Longford Lecture in central London on The Law, the Victims and the Vulnerable, Ms Booth said many women offenders could be classed as vulnerable. Her insights come from visits to prisons in Liverpool and London, where she talked to inmates, staff and chaplains. She was shocked to discover at Holloway women's prison in north London "the enormous numbers of women prisoners who report having suffered a history of violence and sexual abuse". Ms Booth drew attention to the serious impact of women's imprisonment on families "not least because nearly half of all women prisoners have children living with them before coming to prison". The latest estimates indicate that more than 13,000 children a year are separated from their mothers by prison. "A third of these children are under the age of five and two-thirds are under the age of 10," Ms Booth added. "A significant number of these families are permanently broken as a result of the mother's imprisonment." Her remarks, at an event sponsored by the Prison Reform Trust in honour of the late prisoners' champion Lord Longford, echo those of Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, who this week called for more resources to ensure that community sentences were effective penalties.
