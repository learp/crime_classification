Theresa Riggi, the mother jailed for killing her three children in Edinburgh, has been found dead at Rampton secure hospital in an unexplained death.Riggi, in her late 40s, was convicted in April 2011 of killing her eight-year-old twin sons, Austin and Gianluca, and her daughter Cecilia, who was five, after pretending they had been killed in a freak fire at their home in west Edinburgh.Sentenced to 16 years in prison, she had been put under psychiatric supervision soon after being arrested, with several initial court hearings held at her bedside in an Edinburgh hospital.She was transferred to Rampton secure hospital, in Nottinghamshire, last year, but details about her death remain scarce.A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: "We're aware that a Scottish patient has died at Rampton hospital. It would be inappropriate to comment further in light of the ongoing investigation."Riggi had stabbed each child eight times and then attempted to cover up their deaths by setting up a gas explosion in the property after tampering with the gas cooker, before trying to kill herself by leaping out of their second-floor flat.A Rampton spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that there was a patient death in the early hours of this morning. We cannot confirm any details because of patient confidentiality but the next of kin have been informed. There is an investigation into the circumstance of the death."Riggi, originally from California, had been facing court action for custody by her estranged husband, Pasquale Riggi, an oil industry engineer in Aberdeen, after a protracted custody battle.She was convicted of culpable homicide, the Scottish version of manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility.Sentencing her at the high court in Glasgow, Lord Bracadale told Riggi she suffered from a "genuine but abnormal and possessive love" for her children. She had subjected her children to "a truly disturbing degree of violence", and was guilty of a "ghastly and grotesque" act.Her trial had heard that Riggi suffered from narcissistic, paranoid and hysterical personality disorders, had refused to allow her husband to share a bed with her and the children, and had become increasingly possessive.
