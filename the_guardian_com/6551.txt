Police arrested more than 300 people at this year's Notting Hill carnival during a crackdown on violent gangs.Knives, a Taser gun and a baseball bat were among weapons seized by officers aiming to prevent a repeat of violence that has dogged the weekend-long west London event for years.Last night, police fought a two-hour running battle with about 40 youths after the end of the carnival. Troublemakers threw bottles and bricks at dozens of riot police who struggled to contain the disorder.Chief Inspector Jo Edwards, of the Metropolitan police, said today: "It's disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who don't come to the carnival until later. "They don't come to enjoy the floats and the music; they come to fight and commit acts of violence."For two hours our officers came under attack from bottles, bricks and any debris that was on the ground. "These people are intent on fighting but innocent members of the public get caught up in it and their carnival is spoiled."Police made 330 arrests within the Notting Hill area during the carnival, which was attended by about 850,000 people. Last year, 246 people were arrested.Authorities said another 151 people were prevented from reaching the site after a planned police swoop on organised gangs gathering at the Oval, south London.Edwards said officers acted on information to confront the gangs at 4.20pm yesterday. "We had intelligence to suggest that people at the Oval were from a variety of gangs and that they were on their way to the carnival to commit crime, engage in disorder and potentially violence," she said."Some members were arrested for substantial offences such as possession of weapons. Others were detained to prevent a further breach of the peace." Edwards said teams of specialist dog handlers worked with the RSPCA to seize 21 dangerous dogs taken to the carnival in response to concerns raised after last year's event.
