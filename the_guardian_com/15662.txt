Some denizen of Derby deliberately and efficiently set fire to a home in which a couple and their family were asleep. Mick and Mairead Philpott have been subjected to an inconceivably harsh and cruel loss, of six children in one act of calculating malice. It has been suggested that this act of immense barbarism was in response to Mick Philpott's perverse "celebrity status".He had appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show, enjoying a kind of limelight as a man on benefits who had fathered 17 children with five women. It really says something that commentators are able to tout this theory, as if such a reaction, such an act, is somehow comprehensible, or amenable to reason. The person who did this can only be a psychopath, with motivations far outside the general run of human understanding. Those who claim to see logic behind this heinous crime, however warped, do nothing but shameÂ and degrade themselves.
