A man has been arrested over an attack that left a talented teenage ballet dancer critically ill.Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered serious back and neck injuries in the assault in Cardiff and it is feared that even if he recovers he may never dance again.South Wales police said on Wednesday that a 23-year-old man had been arrested in the Roath area of Cardiff on suspicion of assault and robbery.He remained in police custody.Detective Chief Inspector Andy Davies said: "I wish to thank the press and the community for their support and assistance in relation to our ongoing investigation. It is very much appreciated."Widdowson, an apprentice dancer with Bern:Ballett in Switzerland, was visiting his brother, Mark, in Cardiff.During a night out the brothers became separated in the Cardiff Bay area and Widdowson was later found lying unconscious. His iPhone was missing.Widdowson was in a critical condition at the University Hospital of Wales with his family at his bedside.Before the arrest the dancer's family appealed for people to come forward with information about the attack, which happened in the early hours of Saturday.The teenager's father, Dr Julian Widdowson, said: "He left school in August and was thrilled to have been chosen as one of the youngest ever members of Bern:Ballett, where he had the privilege to dance one of the lead roles in the company's winter production."We are all appalled by this unprovoked, mindless, violent attack in this great city where I was born. We continue to be by Jack's bedside hoping and praying for recovery."Widdowson, head of sports medicine at the Aviva Premiership rugby club Bath, said his son was a "determined and strong-willed boy" who had worked hard to make the best of his natural talents.He added: "Jack is a very entertaining person who is very well loved by all who know and work with him. He has a polite and easy manner with a great sense of humour."
