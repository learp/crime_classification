A judge whose snooze during a rape trial led to it being abandoned at a cost of Â£35,000 was reprimanded yesterday by the lord chancellor and told to keep his eyes open in future.Judge Gabriel Hutton, 69, of Chestal, Gloucestershire, accepted that he must have dozed off during the fifth day of the case at Gloucester crown court last December, and apologised for his behaviour. At the time, he said he was not aware he had dozed but ordered a retrial at the request of defence counsel, who argued his client would not have received a fair trial. At a retrial in February the accused was cleared of raping a woman at Sharpness docks in Gloucestershire. The Lord Chancellor's Department said that an inquiry had been conducted, and the judge had been reprimanded and warned to watch his future conduct. A spokeswoman said: "The judge has accepted in the face of the evidence that he must have fallen asleep, and very much regrets that he did so. He has given the lord chancellor an assurance that he will not do so again. "The lord chancellor...has formally reprimanded the judge and has warned him there can be no repetition." Judge Hutton was unavailable for comment yesterday. He was said to have dropped off twice as defence counsel Chris Austin was making his final speech. Mr Austin applied for the jury to be discharged and a retrial ordered, on the grounds that the judge could not give a proper summing-up of the case. Judge Hutton agreed and stopped the trial. At the time a spokesman for the court service said: "The judge said he was thought to have nodded off. He was not aware that he had, but, because he gave that impression, he has ordered a retrial."
