Two high court judges today overturned the acquittal of a police officer who drove at "eye-watering speeds" while familiarising himself with a new vehicle and "honing his driving skills".PC Mark Milton, 38, from Telford, Shropshire, was cleared last May of speeding and dangerous driving after driving at up to 159mph on a motorway. He now faces a retrial.The director of public prosecutions, Ken McDonald, challenged the ruling in the high court yesterday.Edmund Lawson QC told Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Owen that PC Milton had not been using blue lights or sirens when he drove at excess speed in the early hours of December 5 2003.The police car's on-board video camera recorded that, during a two and a half hour period, the advanced driver and armed response officer with West Mercia police drove at 150mph or more on the M54, which has a speed limit of 70mph.He reached 131mph on the A5, which has a 60mph speed limit, and drove at up to 91mph in urban 30mph areas.Mr Lawson said district judge Bruce Morgan had been wrong to acquit the officer at Ludlow magistrates court after describing him as the "crème de la crème" of police drivers.Today, the judges agreed Judge Morgan had erred in law in his decision. Lady Justice Hallett said he had taken into account irrelevant matters, including the opinions of senior officers that PC Milton's driving was not dangerous.She said that evidence was "simply inadmissible" and an appeal by the director of public prosecutions against his acquittal would be allowed on that basis, and added that speed alone was not sufficient to found a conviction of dangerous driving."It has to be a question of speed in the context of all the circumstances," she said. "It's not for this court to attempt to lay down hard and fast rules that driving at X time at any particular speed is so excessive as to amount to dangerous driving per se."Lady Justice Hallett said she was "very conscious of the need to ensure that police officers are properly trained for their own safety and that of the public", but that there had to be a "better way" of doing it.After today's ruling, PC Milton's solicitor, David Twigg, said: "Obviously, we are disappointed - we just have to take stock of the judgment."I think it must be said that, in the terms in which it was delivered, it's likely to have a substantial impact on the way police driving training is conducted on a national basis."He added that, although the court wasn't aware of it, the training in PC Milton's case had followed a national pattern.Addressing the court yesterday, Mr Lawson said: "This case raises issues of real public interest concerning whether a police officer can, with impunity, drive a police car at eye-watering speeds, in excess of twice the relevant speed limits, when not responding to an emergency or otherwise engaged in the prevention or detection of crime."He said Judge Morgan had described the speeds as "eye-watering", but was wrongly sympathetic to PC Milton's defence that he had been honing his driving skills and familiarising himself with his vehicle.The judge concluded that, with regard to PC Milton's advanced driving skills, knowledge of the locality and the fact that the driving occurred on relatively deserted roads in good conditions, "dangerous driving was not established".
