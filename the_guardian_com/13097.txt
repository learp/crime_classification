Senior Home Office civil servants met police chiefs at least four times between September and December to discuss the crisis over the 27,500-strong backlog of criminal record files of Britons convicted abroad, it emerged yesterday.The home secretary, John Reid, expects to learn today the results of checks by the Criminal Records Bureau to make sure that none of those involved - including 540 murderers, rapists, and other serious offenders - have been cleared to work with children or vulnerable adults.The police revealed this week that the vast bulk of the 27,529 case files, which mostly date back to a period from 1999 to early 2006, had sat in box files at the Home Office instead of being entered on the police national computer. The backlog was exacerbated by the fact that some entries were indecipherable or lacked basic details of identity or offence.The repeated meetings between the Association of Chief Police Officers and senior civil servants in the Home Office's crime reduction and community safety group raise concerns over why ministers were not told about the failure to put the conviction records on to the police national computer.The Home Office insisted that "to the best of our knowledge" no ministers, including the home secretary, John Reid, the police minister, Tony McNulty, or the minister overseeing the Criminal Records Bureau, Joan Ryan, had been made aware of the backlog problem until it was disclosed publicly by senior police officers this week.Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs yesterday pressed for the publication of a letter sent by Acpo to Mr McNulty in October amid claims that it contained a "smoking gun" showing that ministers did know three months ago but failed to act on the problem.However, both Acpo and the Home Office have insisted that this letter, which was replied to by Ms Ryan, as the responsible minister, did not refer to the problem of the backlog or that an approach for extra resources for the three-strong Acpo unit working on the problem from the police had been rejected in October."The purpose of the letter was to update him [Mr McNulty] on the work of the new unit and indicate continuing difficulties around the exchange of criminal records across the EU," said the police statement. "Acpo received a reply from Home Office minister Joan Ryan. She acknowledged in her letter the points that had been raised and asked that we keep her officials updated on the issue of the relevant European processes."Subsequent meetings with Home Office officials took place in October and December," it added.Both the shadow home secretary, David Davis, and the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, lodged Freedom of Information Act requests yesterday demanding the release of the October Acpo letter to the Home Office ministers. Mr Clegg said that media reporting of the contents of the letter had discredited Ms Ryan's claim that she knew nothing."Listening to Mrs Ryan in the media, she increasingly resembles a scapegoat who has deliberately been set up to fall. Her boss should now have the courage to take responsibility for this farce and publish the letters immediately," said the Liberal Democrat spokesman.The Home Office, however, said the request to publish the exchange of letters would be considered as part of the inquiry into why ministers had not been told about the problem, which is expected to report within six weeks.An announcement is also expected shortly on who will conduct the inquiry into the blunder. It is believed that David Normington, the permanent secretary at the Home Office, is looking to find someone outside the department.
