Main points:Most prisoners have been socially excluded before entering prison and have often missed out on mainstream public services, according to the social exclusion unit (SEU). Inmates are:· 13 times more likely to have been in care as a child  · 14 times more likely to be unemployed · 60-70% were using drugs before they were imprisoned · more than 70% suffer from at least two mental disorders · 20% of male and 37% of female sentenced prisoners have attempted suicide in the past  · 10 times as likely to have been a regular truant  · two and a half times as likely to have a family member convicted of a criminal offence · more than half of all male prisoners and more than 70% of female prisoners have no qualificationsKey recommendations:The SEU has called on the government to develop a national rehabilitation strategy for prisoners to bring about a more effective, cross-government approach to reducing re-offending. They say that this should include:· a "going straight" contract that sets out what is expected of prisoners both inside and outside of jail, which will address all the factors associated with their offending behaviour  · more advice for prisoners on getting benefit, housing and jobs before they are released  · increasing the discharge grants paid to prisoners on their release to help tide them over before they receive their first benefit payment · giving prisons the ability to secure emergency housing for ex-prisoners who would otherwise be homeless  · increasing the availability of offending behaviour and drug treatment programmes, mental healthcare, education and training, and encouraging family support  · a "reparation fund" for the victims of crime funded by payments from prison wages.
