A musician has been reunited with her stolen antique £5,000 violin after it was spotted on sale for £10 in a secondhand shop. The 1898 Stradivarius copy was taken while Heather Cowan was performing at the Theatre Royal in Bath on 6 June. The musician had been taking part in The Frog Princess and had left the instrument, one of three she had with her, at the side of the stage. It was later spotted by a shop assistant, who had seen an appeal in the local paper, in the window of a secondhand shop in Bath, which had bought the instrument without knowing it was stolen.
