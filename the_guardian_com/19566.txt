A man who admitted four murders lost an appeal yesterday against an order that he must spend the rest of his life behind bars. At the court of appeal, Lord Phillips, the lord chief justice, rejected a challenge by Mark Hobson, now 36, on his whole life tariff.Hobson pleaded guilty to murdering Claire Sanderson, 27, and her sister Diane in Camblesforth, and pensioners Joan and James Britton at their home near York.At Leeds crown court in May, Mr Justice Grigson gave him a whole life tariff. The case set a precedent as such a tariff had not previously been imposed on someone who pleaded guilty.
