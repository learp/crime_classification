Detectives hunting one of the most prolific sex offenders in British criminal history have charged a 52-year-old man in relation to a series of rapes and assaults across south east London, the first of which happened almost two decades ago.Delroy Grant, of Brockley, is due in court later today charged with five rapes, six indecent assaults and 11 burglaries.He was arrested as part of Operation Minstead which was set up to find the sex attacker, dubbed the "night stalker", who is thought to have carried out dozens of sex attacks over the last 17 years.Police arrested Grant as he returned to his car in south east London in the early hours yesterday.The investigation into the series of attacks, which involved rapes and sexual assaults, is the largest operation in the Metropolitan police's recent past. It has involved thousands of police hours, specialist ancestral DNA analysis, and DNA tests on more than 2,000 individuals.Police believe the attacker has carried out attacks on more than 108 elderly people, aged between 68 and 88, which were carried out in south-east London and date back to the early 1990s.The incidents took place in clusters in south and south east London, including Dulwich, Orpington, Norwood, Downham, Lee, Croydon, West Wickham and Bickley.During the past 17 years, the rapist has offended in patterns of a concentrated series of attacks, followed by a lull, which led detectives to speculate that he may have lived abroad.One profiler advising the police said the man was a "gerontophile", after some victims described how, even after horrific attacks, he had shown them tenderness and, in some cases, even apologised for his actions.
