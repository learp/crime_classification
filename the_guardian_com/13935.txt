Detectives hunting the dissident republican group behind a murder in Northern Ireland last month believe a gunman used a BMX bike during the shooting.The "New IRA" claimed responsibility for murdering Kevin Kearney, 46, in north Belfast on 9 October. His body was found dumped in an artificial lake at a park in the city.The Police Service of Northern Ireland released pictures of a BMX bicycle as part of their investigation into the killing and appealed for more information from the public.DCI Justyn Galloway, who is leading the inquiry, said officers needed help on specific points. "We believe the Vortex Scorpion bike may have been used by someone involved in the shooting," he said.Police have conducted further house-to-house inquiries in the area around Alexandra Park.On Tuesday, the PSNI confirmed it used a drone to locate a suspected bomb also in north Belfast. Residents in the republican Ardoyne district noticed the drone hovering above the area on Monday afternoon.The PSNI later said it used the drone to locate a suspected pipe bomb in Jamaica Street."The police service obtained approval to purchase unmanned aerial systems (UAS) earlier this year," the police said."These systems are flown in accordance with Civil Aviation Authority approval."Army bomb disposal experts later made the device safe after a number of homes were evacuated.The PSNI spokesperson added: "The use of an unmanned aerial system assisted in this clearance operation and minimised disruption to the local community by bringing the incident to a safe and satisfactory conclusion."The security operation in Ardoyne is the first time the PSNI have used drones in an urban environment. In June the force confirmed its use as part of the massive security operation for the G8 Summit in Fermanagh.
