When I started teaching philosophy in the prison it was a bit of a leap in the dark. "They'll love it," Gwen, a full-time tutor, kept on saying. Gwen, after donkey's years with these guys, really does believe in their goodness. "He just wants his mum really," is a typical Gwenism when some shaven- headed 18-stoner has shuffled off, pouting after one of her bollockings. So I shuffled off, obedient myself, to get philosophy launched on the sea of scepticism that I was sure awaited me. Most of the guys were as unsure as I was about what was going to happen, although, as I found out later one or two of them, who had Open University degrees on the walls of their cells, were being a bit disingenuous. Philosophy: it does have a bit of a ring to it, especially doing it in prison; it sounds rather wise, stately, a little bit superior. It didn't take long for us to leave that kind of nonsense behind. Wayne, direct as ever, gets us started. "Come on then, Al, what's it all about, philosophy? How would you define it?" I'm tempted to ask him, "What do you mean, definition?" but some merciful instinct for self-preservation stops me. They don't want some clever undergraduate posturing, these guys want an answer they can get a grip on right here and now so I tell them a bit about Socratic method, the method of the idiot child. "You know," I tell them, "when some daft kid keeps on asking, why? why?" Yes, they know about that. "Well that's all that philosophy is. Philosophers just ask why." There is a certain amount of storm to weather here. "Is that it then? Is that all there is to it?" "Well, yes," I say, suddenly fearful that they will walk out on me and leave me to face Gwen with the ruin that I have made of her bright idea. All this was months ago now and I have settled down with a regular group of 12. People come and go as sentences end and new guys are shipped in and this means that there are quite regular crises as philosophy virgins are seduced into our strange ways. Philosophy has attracted men who have long sentences to serve and they bring into class the hard-faced generosity that gets them through the years. They say things that frighten me to death. Wayne on abortion: "If we could turn back the years, Mark, wouldn't it be better, knowing as we do now that you were going to turn out to be a murdering nut-case who's been nothing but a drain on society, wouldn't aborting you have been a good idea?" Dear God, I think, head in hands, he's gone too far this time. I ought to have warned him about all the trouble that Socrates was landed in by philosophy. But these guys are neighbours on the wing. They smile at each other. Sometimes, less often now, I get a bad time for being a weakling. "For God's sake Al will you use your authority and sort these bastards out." "I have no authority, I repudiate it, I spit on authority." "Don't start all that shit," Pete tells me, knowing my game. "Right," says Wayne, brusquely, "come on let's get on with this." "I'll read this next bit shall I," says Pete. I shrug and away we go. Wayne is a real asset; he just keeps on asking the obvious questions that no one else will ask for fear of looking stupid. He knows nothing. Or does he? Are his questions just a bit too good naturedly naive? I promise myself to get someone to have a peek in his pad where I suspect there are walls full of philosophy books. "Hold on," he says, the devious Yorkshire simpleton, "what's metaphysics then?" Before I can tumble into his trap, Isaac turns to him and treats us all to a lucid, delightful explanation. Isaac is the youngest by far and can get terrible stick, but I suspect that he has just done himself a power of good. "Right, OK," Wayne says, nodding gently into Isaac's beaming face. We have been talking about aesthetics for the past month or so. This has led us into censorship and this week we have been reading JM Coetzee on Taking Offence. Coetzee suggests that taking offence is a transaction where the powerful and the powerless exchange roles and potencies. Far too late it dawns on me that making this explicit could get one or two of the more idealistic guys into trouble back on the wings where shifts in power, suspected or real, can have swift and devastating consequences. "Now don't try this at home," I keep on saying, panic mounting as I wish more and more that I had stuck to Epistemology or Philosophy of Mind. Fortunately I have Mo and Pete in the class. These are the steadiest men you could hope to meet, both well into their second decade of imprisonment. Men I admire. Both of them scholars who put me to shame. They try out the idea and try its fit into various contexts: apartheid South Africa, family, prison. Wayne, who has really taken a shine to my version of Socratic method harries them into explanations, forces the occasional pursed- lipped concession. Johnny and Steve are quiet, ironic observers, dropping in occasional gems or deflating absurdities. They watch me struggle to get a word in and smile as they see my temper going and language deteriorating. I was so unpleasant last week that I brought in a bag of sweets by way of apology. They are not impressed. "He only bought these," Mo points out, "because he was such a right bastard last time." After two hours of this I feel drained and buzzing all at once. I can't for the life of me see the point of locking up my philosophers. When I say this to my wife she gives me a very old-fashioned look indeed and warns me about going native. Too late.
