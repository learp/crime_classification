A legal precedent has established that deliberate bugging of conversations with lawyers constitutes such an affront to the rule of law that trials should be halted and any convictions obtained overturned.The ruling, in the court of appeal in 2005, may mean that dozens of terrorist trials could be aborted and the Soham murderer, Ian Huntley, go free if allegations by a whistleblower that lawyers' visits with clients were routinely bugged at Woodhill prison are substantiated.The source, who spoke to the Daily Telegraph, may have communicated with Mark Kearney, the former detective sergeant who exposed the bugging of the Labour MP Sadiq Khan on a prison visit to a constituent. Kearney is due to appear at Kingston crown court today on unrelated charges of leaking information to the media. At least 10 solicitors were bugged at Woodhill, where Huntley was held in the run-up to his trial in 2003, the source has alleged.A retrial would be ruled out because the whole prosecution would be tainted. If deliberate police bugging of Huntley's conversations with his lawyer were proved, he would almost certainly be freed by the appeal court and escape a retrial, according to criminal lawyers.The whistleblower has claimed that solicitors including Gareth Peirce and Mudassar Arani, who act for a number of terrorist suspects, had their conversations with their clients recorded by police.Last night Peirce, also the solicitor for Babar Ahmed, the constituent Khan was visiting, said she had written to the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, and the justice minister, Jack Straw, demanding to know whether any of her visits to clients in prison had been bugged. She has also written to the chief surveillance commissioner, Sir Christopher Rose, who is inquiring into the bugging of the MP.The court of appeal ruled in 2005 that a lower court should have stopped a prosecution where police deliberately bugged solicitors' consultations with their clients at police stations, even if the information gained added nothing to the evidence against the accused and even though the crime was a heinous one. In that case, a husband given an 18-year sentence for hiring hitmen to murder his estranged wife's lover walked free after the appeal court ruled that the trial judge should have stopped the case. "We are quite clear that the deliberate interference with the detained suspect's right to the confidence of privileged communications with his solicitor, such as we have found was done here, seriously undermines the rule of law and justifies a stay on grounds of abuse of process," said Lord Justice Laws, delivering the appeal court's judgment.The case was one of three major prosecutions - the other two were the gangland-type killing of a 23-year-old man and a heroin trafficking case - which were derailed because judges ruled that Lincolnshire police had deliberately bugged solicitors' visits.Suspects who were bugged could also claim damages for a breach of their human rights.The European court of human rights has ruled in a Northern Ireland case that a suspect's rights were violated when a police officer was within listening distance of the defendant's solicitor. Geoffrey Robertson, a leading human rights QC, said: "Those whose [lawyers] have been subject to bugging will apply on the grounds of fresh evidence to appeal their convictions and the court would be very likely on present authorities to quash their convictions, and maybe serious offenders will then walk free."
