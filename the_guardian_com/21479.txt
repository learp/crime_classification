Two boys suffered broken bones while staff forcibly restrained them at a privately run young offender institution, prison inspectors have revealed.A report by Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, confirms a high level of violence at the Serco-run Ashfield young offender institution, near Bristol, with 43 serious fights recorded last year.The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, announced earlier this year that Ashfield would no longer hold young offenders, and would instead specialise in sex offenders.The youth jail was already being run down when inspectors carried out their unannounced inspection in February. It was only a third full, with 123 teenagers aged 16 and 17, at the time.They found a high level of violence, with 351 fights, 43 of which were classified as serious, and 377 assaults recorded in 2012. Five staff were assaulted over the same period. Use of force by the staff was also high, with 453 recorded cases in the six months before the inspectors' visit.The two incidents involving broken bones were referred to the police, and inquiries were carried out internally as well as by the local authority."Young people's safety was compromised because they were exposed to unacceptable levels of violence â€“ and there is some evidence the situation has deteriorated since the closure decision was announced," Hardwick said.
