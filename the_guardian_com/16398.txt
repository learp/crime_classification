A group of footballers took pictures of themselves sexually assaulting a drunken 19-year-old woman, the Old Bailey has heard.The Brighton and Hove Albion players wanted to have "a permanent record of their conquest", the court was told. They took the woman back to their hotel room and assaulted her after celebrating victory for their club in the Sussex Senior Cup, it was alleged.Anton Rodgers, 19, Lewis Dunk, 21, and George Barker, 21, and their former team-mate Steve Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, deny charges of sexual assault and voyeurism at the Jury's Inn hotel in Brighton in July 2011.Richard Barton, prosecuting, said: "This case concerns how a group of young professional footballers, intoxicated after a night out together celebrating a cup final victory, took advantage of a young woman who herself was intoxicated and who was obviously in a vulnerable condition."After taking her back to a hotel room, they waited until she had fallen asleep and so was unable to resist, and then sexually assaulted her in a deliberately humiliating way. They compounded the humiliation by taking photographs of themselves doing so in order to have a permanent record of their conquest."He added: "They did so for their own gratification, intending to share the photographs between themselves, and they may have done so to share with others at their football club."These were the actions of a group of arrogant young men labouring under the misguided belief that by reason of their privileged position they could with impunity take advantage of a young woman in this way, because even if she realised what they had done to her, she would not dare report it."He said the woman did not tell police for six months "through fear of repercussions". She finally made a complaint after being repeatedly taunted about the incident by another footballer at the club, jurors were told.Relatives of the accused, including Rodgers' father, Brendan Rodgers, manager of Liverpool FC, were in the public gallery as the case was opened. The trial continues.
