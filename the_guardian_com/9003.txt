Convicted drug users should not be sent to prison because it does more harm than good, a report from the influential UK Drug Policy Commission will say tomorrow.Up to 65,000 prisoners in England and Wales are thought to be problem drug users and, of these, two-thirds are convicted of less serious crimes such as shoplifting and burglary. The commission believes these offenders should not be jailed. Although the report accepts that almost a third of heroin and crack users arrested admit to committing an average of one crime a day, it says that community treatment programmes would be more effective than prison.The UK Drug Policy Commission, chaired by Dame Ruth Runciman, is expected to express concerns that drug treatment programmes in prisons have not worked and that inmates risk infection from blood-borne viruses. The report arrives as the problem of drug use in prison appears to be increasing, with results from random tests revealing that heroin use is now more widespread than cannabis.This week's report is also expected to be highly critical of how little known is about the effectiveness of drug treatment programmes in prisons, despite a Â£330m investment by government. No evaluations have been conducted to establish whether drug-free wings and programmes based on cognitive behavioural therapy work. With the prison population at a record high of nearly 82,000, the commission says that the inherent pressures have created an environment unlikely to be 'conducive to recovery'.
