The haul of weapons confiscated at the weekend's Notting Hill carnival included knives, a Taser gun, CS spray and a baseball bat, police said yesterday.Officers patrolling the annual event arrested 330 people and stopped a further 151 potential troublemakers from travelling to west London.Although the Metropolitan police said their "proactive" approach had worked well, and more than a million people celebrated, the end of the street party on Monday night was marred by battles between police and 40 youths throwing bricks and bottles. Chief Inspector Jo Edwards said the crackdown - which included deploying knife scanner arches around the tube network - had helped ensure most of the weekend's 850,000 visitors enjoyed the event peacefully."It's disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who don't come to the carnival until later," she said. "They don't come to enjoy the floats and the music, they come to fight and commit acts of violence. We have seen serious incidents in previous years. "For two hours our officers came under attack from bottles, bricks and any debris that was on the ground. These were officers who had been working hard all day." Police had been planning their operation to combat violence at the carnival since May.Tactics included sending letters to more than 200 suspected troublemakers warning them about their conduct and using warrants to search their homes for weapons.
