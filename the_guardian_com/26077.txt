The Sunday Times has lost a court battle to force the commissioner of the Metropolitan police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to disclose confidential documents which the newspaper could use as evidence in a libel trial in October.Times Newspapers, the publisher of the Times and Sunday Times, is being sued for libel by David Hunt over the accusation of committing "very serious criminal offences" and who the paper claims "has not been brought to justice". According to a high court judgment made public on Tuesday, Scotland Yard and Soca have "admitted that [Hunt] is the head of an organised crime group".The Sunday broadsheet is accused of libelling Hunt stating he was "guilty of very serious criminal offences committed by himself and others whom he organises".The Sunday Times wants to use the confidential documents, some of which are alleged to have been leaked to the paper by a police whistleblower, as part of its defence in the libel trial, listed to be heard at the high court next month.However, Mr Justice Tugendhat on Tuesday refused to order Scotland Yard and Soca to disclose the police files – which relates to whether the police knew of Hunt's alleged involvement in the crime group – in a hearing at the high court.Tugendhat said: "In my judgment, as matters stand today, it is not possible for the court to be satisfied that disclosure of any documents which are the subject of this action is necessary in order to dispose fairly of the libel claim ... For these reasons I will not order the disclosure sought by the publishers at this stage."Stephenson and Soca have accused the Sunday Times of receiving the confidential documents after they were leaked "unlawfully by one or more officers or civilian employees".The newspaper has declined to disclose the source of the documents. It contends that the information was lawfully received in the course of legitimate newsgathering on matters of public interest or for the purposes of defending the libel proceedings.In its public interest defence of the libel action, the Sunday Times alleged that Hunt was a crime boss "who had not been brought to justice and was seeking to benefit financially from business dealings" as described in the disputed article.The libel trial is listed to be heard at the high court on 17 October.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
