A teenager who escaped through a window as her mother was shot dead has said she will be reunited with her in heaven.Laura McGoldrick, 19, was injured when her mother's partner, Michael Atherton, went on a shooting rampage at their home in Horden, Peterlee, County Durham.Her 47-year-old mother, Susan, her aunt, Alison Turnbull, 44, and her 24-year-old cousin, Tanya Turnbull, died in the shootings, which happened on New Year's Day.On Friday, McGoldrick said words could not describe how much she missed her mother. "As you can imagine, this week has been extremely traumatic and upsetting," she said. "Not only have I have suffered the loss of my fantastic mam and a lovely auntie and cousin, I have been involved in a very frightening situation."I would like to say a few words about my mam and what she meant to me. To my beautiful and gorgeous mam, I love you with everything I have got. Words cannot describe how much I miss you. See you in heaven."McGoldrick, who was hit by shotgun pellets, added: "It is now extremely important to me that my family and I are left in peace to grieve our loss and to comfort one another."The detective leading the inquiry discounted claims that Atherton, a 42-year-old taxi driver, was depressed when he murdered the three women before turning the gun on himself.On Thursday, after inquests were opened briefly, Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry said officers had spoken to Atherton's GP and other health professionals but there was no indication that he was suffering from any mental illness.Atherton carried out the killings with a shotgun – one of several firearms he held legally – which is being examined by ballistics experts.Detectives believe the shootings were not planned and were prompted by a "relatively trivial family argument".
