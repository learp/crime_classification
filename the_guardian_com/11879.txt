In your report (31 March) of Tony Blair's speech in Sedgefield he is quoted as saying that the DNA database "provides incontrovertible evidence of innocence or guilt". What the DNA database can do is to show that there is, or is not, an incontrovertible link between a suspect and a crime scene or individual. There may be a perfectly innocent explanation for that link to have occurred, ie blood from a victim of an assault may be present on a "suspect" because they came to the aid of the victim, and therefore what the DNA database cannot do is provide an incontrovertible link to innocence or guilt. DNA evidence needs to be considered in the context of the circumstances of the case, as indeed should any type of evidence. Statements like this, from someone with a legal training, which is a prime example of "the prosecutor's fallacy", give rise to concerns to the way in which juries will approach information from the DNA database when it is presented in court.RE Ardrey, AR Allan and PG AshtonDirectors, Triple A Forensics
