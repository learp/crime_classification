 Harry Redknapp "condemned himself from his own mouth" when he described to a News of the World journalist the $145,000 (£92,000) paid into his Monaco bank account as "a bonus", the jury in Redknapp's trial for tax evasion was told on Friday. Making his closing speech, the barrister for the prosecution, John Black QC, said the tape recording made by the journalist, Rob Beasley, of his conversation with Redknapp was "the most compelling and important evidence in the case".Redknapp and the former Portsmouth owner Milan Mandaric, who both deny two counts of cheating the public revenue, have told the court that the $145,000 paid in May 2002 and a further payment of $150,000 in May 2004, were paid by Mandaric as "seed money" for investments to be made on Redknapp's behalf.When called by Beasley to explain the account in February 2009, Redknapp had said the $145,000 was a bonus for having sold Peter Crouch at a profit in March 2002. Mandaric has said the further $150,000 (£95,000) was paid in to the Monaco account after $100,000 invested had been "a disaster", to replenish the seed money and provide Redknapp, then the manager of Portsmouth, with "a nominal profit" of £50,000. The prosecution charge is that both payments were bonuses paid to Redknapp as part of his employment and therefore tax and national insurance should have been paid, and were not."In one unguarded moment on a tape with a News of the World journalist, Mr Redknapp told it as it was," Black told the jury of four women and eight men at Southwark crown court, "and that, in a sense, condemns him from his own mouth."Of the interview Beasley conducted with Redknapp, a recording of which has been played in court, Black said to the jury: "You can't really imagine a case in which you have got the most compelling evidence from the defendant himself about what all this is about."Redknapp had told the court that he lied to Beasley because his main concern was to emphasise that the $145,000 payment was not a bung and that he did not have to tell the truth to the News of the World. He has said he never knew that Mandaric had later paid in a further $150,000.Black said that on the tape – "the most important and compelling evidence in the case" – Redknapp was telling the truth to Beasley, that the payment was a bonus of 5% above what he had already been paid after the £4.5m sale of Crouch to Aston Villa in 2002."He could not make it plainer," Black said. "The £100,000 [the approximate sterling equivalent of $145,000] was a bonus in respect of the shortfall of the 5% – the words come from Harry Redknapp."The Tottenham Hotspur manager repeatedly denied the charges over two days of evidence on Wednesday and Thursday, maintaining he had no motive to evade the tax.At times he had the jury laughing at references to his late bulldog, Rosie, whose name was attached to the account. Redknapp said the name was a security code, not the name of the account. Other witnesses, including the former Arsenal goalkeeper and television presenter Bob Wilson, testified to Redknapp's charity activities.Telling the jury that Redknapp is guilty of cheating the public revenue, Black said: "It may not be popular to say that of a man respected in his business, a fantastic football manager, a man of very many qualities. But the fact remains this money was paid into an account in Monaco and no tax was paid on it."Black suggested to the jury that they should ask themselves a series of questions about the credibility of Redknapp's and Mandaric's accounts of what the payments represented.He added: "The sad and simple truth which faces us all at the end of the day is that these were bonus payments. Tax was not paid on them, and these men intended to conceal and hide that fact from the tax authorities year after year. And if that is right, whatever the background, integrity, history, activities, jobs of either of these defendants in the past, I am afraid the verdict must be one of guilty."The trial continues on Monday, when the barristers defending Redknapp and Mandaric will make their closing speeches to the jury.
