Pressure was growing last night on Lord Woolf, the lord chief justice, to withdraw draft sentencing guidelines which would mean that murderers who enter an early guilty plea could cut their time in prison by up to a third.The Commons home affairs select committee endorses criticism, backed by the home secretary, David Blunkett, that the discounts in murder cases do not reflect "the wishes of parliament or public disquiet". The MPs' response to the first proposals to emerge from the sentencing guidelines council also argues that those who commit crimes while drunk or under the influence of drugs should get heavier sentences. They want drink and drugs treated as an aggravating factor instead of an excuse by defendants. The report criticised the way the reduced sentence proposal was inserted in the most recent criminal justice act with little scrutiny by MPs or peers. The recommendations came as the government announced plans to cut the number of children in juvenile jails by 10% or about 280 over the next three years. Mr Blunkett said that contrary to some media comment he did not believe that "locking up more and more young people" was the answer to the problem of juvenile crime.
