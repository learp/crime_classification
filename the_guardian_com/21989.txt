We are grateful to the community for the enormous amount of assistance they have provided in the past few days and would ask for their continued support.“We are following a definite line of inquiry. A 39-year-old man remains in custody being questioned about withholding information. Other inquiries are continuing.“We are particularly interested in the movements and whereabouts of a man seen leaving Jennifer’s home at 4.20am on Sunday. We believe he walked from Hazel View, through Lagmore to Poleglass. We believe he was wearing a grey T-shirt or sweat top and a light-coloured bomber jacket.“At some stage, we believe he got rid of the grey top and light-coloured jacket and obtained a red and gold sports jersey.“We are appealing to anyone who lives on the route between Hazel View and Poleglass and who has knowledge of any of these items of clothing or the knife to contact us.”
