The home secretary today ordered a review of the sentence given to the convicted paedophile Craig Sweeney for sexually assaulting a three-year-old girl after complaints by her family that the jail term was too short.The home secretary, John Reid, is to ask the attorney general to consider referring the jail sentence - under which Sweeney could get parole in five years - to the court of appeal as "unduly lenient", according to the Home Office.Sweeney was today given a life sentence for the kidnap and assault of the girl, which happened only weeks after his release from prison for an earlier child sex offence. The recorder of Cardiff, judge John Griffith Williams QC, said he could be eligible for parole after five years, but added that an early release was "unlikely".A Home Office official spokesman said: "Life sentences are the ultimate sanction a court can make. "However, the home secretary is concerned that the tariff Craig Sweeney has been given does not reflect the seriousness of this crime, and is writing to the attorney general to ask him to consider referring the sentence to the court of appeal as unduly lenient."The chief crown prosecutor for south Wales, Christopher Woolley, said he also intended to refer the sentence to the attorney general. The victim's family described the sentence as "an insult", and called for tougher jail terms for child sex offenders."The family believes today's sentence is an insult to their three-year-old daughter and that there are grave failings in the criminal justice system that need to be urgently addressed," a statement released through their lawyer said."Although the family was not aware at the time of the attack, Craig Sweeney was already a convicted paedophile. The victim's family is now calling for the government to urgently review sentencing guidelines for crimes of this type and to significantly increase the prison sentences given to paedophiles."Sweeney abducted the girl from her home in Rumney, in the Llanrumney area of Cardiff, on January 2 this year. He bundled her into his Ford Escort and drove her to his accommodation on Caerleon Road in Newport, south Wales, where he sexually assaulted her.After driving from the south Wales area, Sweeney sexually assaulted the girl again after parking in the Swindon area. He was apprehended by Wiltshire police after crashing his car between Marlborough and Hungerford in the early hours of January 3.Officers pursued the convicted paedophile - who had been sentenced in April 2003 for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl - after they noticed him driving through a red light with his lights turned off.Judge Williams told Sweeney he was a "devious" man and that what he had done "beggars belief". He disqualified him from ever working with children and ordered him to be placed on the sex offenders' register for life."Clearly, real care must be taken in future to ensure you will not be released where there is a significant risk of any reoffending," he said.After the hearing, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children called for more resources and training to enable the police and probation services to improve their management of sex offenders in the community "as a matter of urgency". The organisation said more money and staff were needed for offender rehabilitation and treatment programmes.It also voiced concern about the multi-agency public protection arrangements panels set up across the country to coordinate the work of the police, probation and social services in monitoring and managing sex offenders in the community.A statement released on behalf of the board of Gwent panel - which had been responsible for monitoring Sweeney at the time he assaulted the three-year-old - said: "Offending by individuals being monitored as part of the MAPPA process is rare. "That said, we are currently reviewing the responses of agencies involved in managing the risk in this case and are determined that any learning will be used to enhance our existing processes."
