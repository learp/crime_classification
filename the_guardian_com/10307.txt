Figures show the proportion of successful prosecutions to the number of reported rapes has fallen dramatically over the last few years and is now only one in 20.Thirty years ago the rate of prosecutions to rape allegations was one in three, so it is plain to see there has been a significant deterioration in the prospects of a reported rape leading to a conviction.Questions are being asked over the efficiency of the court and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and women - and sometimes men - are often accused of making up allegations.But just how complex are the reasons behind this huge fall in the number of convictions, and what is being done by the authorities to address the situation?The answer goes to the heart of the way courts in this country work and how juries look at rape allegations.There is a growing frustration amongst prosecutors that juries have not caught up with an increased awareness that many rapes take place in relationships where the two people may have had a sexual history.Following publication of the Home Office figures showing the rate of convictions two years ago, the CPS appointed 520 specialist rape prosecutors to improve its methods for handling rape allegations. In London, the Metropolitan police had earlier set up "Sapphire units"' based in each of the capital's boroughs and staffed by officers with expertise in dealing with sexual crimes.Kay Scudder is one of the CPS rape prosecutors tasked with the job of liaising with Sapphire teams to decide whether an allegation of rape should go to court. She is often involved from the moment an allegation is made and authorises the paperwork leading to a charge being made.She believes the relationship between the CPS and Sapphire teams is working extremely well, pointing to a number of examples of how cases were sustained when they would not have been before the changes in policy were made.Ms Scudder quotes the example of a recent case where a man was convicted of raping a homeless young woman working as a prostitute. The Sapphire officer closest to the case had made sure he kept in continuous contact with the victim by giving her a mobile phone so that she wasn't lost as a witness, and Ms Scudder found a hotel for the victim during the three-day hearing to ensure she could attend court.Ms Scudder told SocietyGuardian.co.uk the case probably wouldn't have gone ahead in the days prior to Sapphire, which was introduced in 2001.But with this better support system in place to ensure cases get to court what is going wrong once they get there?For Mark Fenhalls, a barrister based in London who handled the case mentioned above, there can be an issue with juries not believing the victims, especially in "acquaintance cases" where the victim knew his or her attacker."Since specialist rape prosecutors were appointed and Sapphire was established, the quality of the cases we are getting coming forward are often much better," he said."And women are distressing themselves by putting themselves up there [on the witness stand], but the difficulties of cases where the accused and the victim knew each other means there might not be a conviction."He is particularly frustrated because when a case ends in a not guilty verdict the police or prosecutors are sometimes blamed because it is too uncomfortable to point the finger at the public who make up the jury.The law has now clarified - through the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (which came into force in May 2004) - the situation where a victim was drunk at the time of an attack. An accused now has to show that he or she could have "reasonably believed" what the alleged victim said was consent to sex.The CPS is now taking many more difficult-to-prosecute cases to court, Ms Scudder said. These cases might involve men as victims who are reluctant to come forward and have often been abused when they were very young many years previously."Often these cases are within the family and there is no forensic evidence, obviously. Historical allegations might not have made it to court 10 years ago, but do now."She said there was a recent case involving a man who met another man through an internet site and agreed to meet him for casual sex, but was raped. The case went ahead and the offender was convicted even though he absconded during the trial.Other cases involving victims with learning difficulties or mental health problems are also very difficult to proceed with. "For example, women with learning difficulties are often more vulnerable and can be suggestible in interview," Ms Scudder said."Previously these victims were often told it was probably for the best if they didn't have to go through the ordeal of a court appearance."New measures to make it easier for victims to give evidence in court, such as video links to enable them to avoid actually appearing in person to face their attacker, were introduced under the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.These measures have helped to persuade reluctant victims to give evidence, but can have the effect of weakening the prosecution case, Mr Fenhalls said."People don't necessarily believe what they see on television and so the video link may not be so effective," he said.Mr Fenhalls hopes the message that there are many reasons why a case may fail will get through to the public. "Society needs to know the complexities of it," he said.For Ms Scudder it is important people know that every rape allegation is taken very seriously, and her message is clear: "Anybody can be a victim, but factors such as poor housing and lack of social services support may make people more vulnerable than others to attack."We are very conscious of not letting victims become just a statistic."
