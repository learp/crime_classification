A woman who claimed she murdered her young son and daughter because she was terrified they would be taken away after her partner was arrested on sex offence charges has been jailed for 30 years in Spain.Lianne Smith, 45, admitted smothering 11-month-old Daniel and five-year-old Rebecca with a plastic bag at the Miramar hotel in Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava in May 2010.Although her lawyers argued that she had been in a state of "psychiatric disturbance" and suffering insurmountable fear when the tragedy happened, a jury at the provincial court in Girona, north-east Spain, decided last month that she was criminally responsible for the deaths.In a written sentence issued to the media on Tuesday, Judge Adolfo Garc√≠a Morales jailed Smith for 15 years for each of the murders.The killings took place shortly after Smith's partner, Martin Smith, was arrested in Barcelona by Spanish police acting on a European arrest warrant.The family had been living in Spain since 2007 after fleeing Lichfield, Staffordshire, because Smith's eldest daughter by her first husband had accused Martin Smith of sexually abusing her.After her partner was deported to the UK, Smith thought British social services had travelled to Spain to take her children away.Smith made several failed suicide attempts after killing her children. She went down to the hotel reception at 1.30pm the following day and asked for police and an ambulance to be called. She let an officer into the hotel room, pointed to a bed where the dead children lay covered by sheets and confessed to killing them.Seven months later, Martin Smith was found guilty at Manchester crown court of using hypnotism, bullying and violence to groom and sexually abuse Smith's eldest daughter, Sarah Richardson, who has waived her right to anonymity. He was found hanged in his cell at Strangeways prison in Manchester last January.The Spanish judge wrote that he was imposing the minimum sentence for murder because he considered that, although responsible for her actions, Smith was suffering a degree of "mental disturbance" when she committed the crimes."The jury stressed that this mental disturbance was not as important as the defence had argued," he wrote. "This was based on facts such as several suicide attempts made by Smith, a statement she gave during which she appeared normal and did not make any significant mistakes as she described what had happened and how it happened, the composition of several coherent notes, and calculations she made in order to pay what she believed she still owed to the hotel."The judge dismissed the defence's claim that Smith had been suffering "insurmountable fear" when she murdered her children because she thought British social services would take them away from her."It would have been consequent with insurmountable fear if she had attacked or even killed the members of English social services who she felt were threatening to take her children away. It is illogical that out of insurmountable fear of losing her children she decided to kill them."In court, Smith had refused to answer questions from the prosecution, as is her right under Spanish law. The jury was shown a video of a statement she made to police the day after the children died, filmed in a room next to where the killings took place.She told police: "I gave my children a three-day holiday, a perfect holiday, we were very, very happy. We came here with nothing, we had left everything again. This was the end of the road, I knew my children would be taken back to England. My daughter didn't want to go, she didn't want to leave me."So I know it's not right to take another life, but I felt I was in a corner and my intention was for me and my children to go. It was not just the children, it was me as well."
