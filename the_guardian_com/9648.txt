A long-serving coroner and respected solicitor has admitted stealing more than £1m from a farmer's estate to keep his ailing law firm afloat.William John Owen, 79, of Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire, took the money after being made executor of John James Williams's will.Owen pleaded guilty to 17 charges of theft and false accounting dating back to 2003 at Newport crown court and was told he faced a prison sentence.Janet McDonald, prosecuting, said: "The deceased was a longstanding client of Mr Owen and he made him the executor of his estate. Mr Owen would bill for work, charging it to the estate. He would then take the money without doing any work."The money was taken out of Owen's law firm's account, and investigators have not been able to establish what happened to it thereafter.Owen was arrested following an investigation by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. He was suspended from his post as coroner for Carmarthenshire, in south-west Wales – a role he held for 25 years – and resigned after the regulatory body handed over a file to Dyfed Powys police.The judge Tom Crowther said: "This was very serious, in breach of trust of the grossest sort. It seems to me that a custodial sentence is likely in this case."Last year the former Gloucestershire coroner Alan Crickmore was jailed for eight years for stealing more than £2m from clients.
