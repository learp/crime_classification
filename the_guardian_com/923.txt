A man accused of snatching a six-year-old girl from her bath and raping her wrote in his diary on the day of the attack: "Phew, it's over, chill now," a court heard today.Peter Voisey, 37, of Blyth, Northumberland, denies abduction, rape and sexual assault of the girl in north Tyneside on December 27 last year.In a police interview, Mr Voisey explained that the diary entry referred to his relief that Christmas was over."Was it, however, a reference to what he had done that day, something about which he had been thinking for some time?" James Goss QC, prosecuting, asked the jury at Newcastle crown court.A major police investigation was launched after the girl was found naked in a freezing street in North Shields, Tyneside. The abduction caused public outrage at the time. Three people were arrested in March on suspicion of hampering the investigation by providing the inquiry team with false names. Mr Voisey was arrested in April.Mr Goss told the court that the girl was taken from the bathroom of her mother's ground-floor flat."At about 6.50pm a man entered the bathroom, told her to be quiet or he would hurt her, lifted her out of the bath, put his hand over her mouth, carried her to a car outside and drove off," said Mr Goss.After he had sexually assaulted her twice in 20 minutes, the man drove her to a back lane about 300 metres from her home where he left her naked, telling her to face the wall, the prosecution said.A nearby resident heard the girl's cries and found her shivering in the back lane, the court heard.The resident, Geoffrey Brown, saw the girl had blood on her legs and wrapped her in a dressing gown.Before the abduction, the girl had joined her brother in the bath. She was then left alone and could be heard talking to her toys.The girl's mother at one point heard her say, "What are you doing here?", but she had not sounded distressed, Mr Goss said.Soon after, the mother heard a screech in the back lane which sounded like a car. She called out to her daughter and found the bathroom empty.Later the girl told police that the car was dirty and had dog hairs in it, and her attacker wore a hat, coat and gloves.The jury was told that the defendant was familiar with the area because he had previously lived nearby and that mobile phone calls linked him to the area around the time of the abduction.The prosecution alleges that partial footprints found in dirt on the floor of the bathroom matched a pair of Diadora training shoes belonging to the defendant. It also alleges that Mr Voisey spoke about details of the case which had never been made public to a friend's girlfriend.The trial continues.
