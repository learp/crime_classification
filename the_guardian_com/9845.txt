Tony Blair moved last night to neutralise Michael Howard's decision to back greater self-defence powers for householders after the Tory leader revealed that the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens had given the plans his "total support".The prime minister ordered the speeding-up of a review designed to clarify "confusion" in the law after Mr Howard said he had met the outgoing police chief and gained his backing for a higher threshold under which prosecutions could be brought. At present householders can be found guilty if they use more than "reasonable force" in defence of their property. The Tories' proposed threshold would be "grossly disproportionate force". Previously officials had lumped the issue into a wider review of murder and manslaughter not due to report back until 2006. With Mr Howard intent on making political capital out of crime during the election, a separate review, due next year, has now been ordered. The prime minister's official spokesman also refused to rule out backing the measures - contained in shadow homeland security minister Patrick Mercer's private member's bill. In an interview with the Telegraph at the weekend, Sir John made it clear that he backed a change in legislation. "My own view is that people should be allowed to use what force is necessary and they should be allowed to do so without any risk of prosecution." Yesterday, Mr Howard revealed that Sir John was happy for his support to be made public. He added: "This morning I discussed [Mr Mercer's bill] with Sir John Stevens who told me that this proposal has his total support."Ministers admit that they will need to finesse their response if they refuse to back such a populist bill. "It's very politically clever of Howard," said one.
