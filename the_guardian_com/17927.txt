The communities secretary, Ruth Kelly, will deliver her first speech on race today, as a Conservative MP came under fire for appearing to suggest that most criminals were black.In a step away from the previous consensus on multiculturalism, Ms Kelly is expected to talk about how to use "shared British values" to bring about a "common sense of belonging" in the speech at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in central London.Her speech at the CRE conference marks the abolition, after 30 years, of the Commission for Racial Equality, which will be merged next year into a new anti-discriminatory super-body, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights.But the two-day conference has been overshadowed by remarks made by Bob Spink, Tory MP for Castle Point, to a constituent in an email exchange leaked to the Daily Mirror.He was asked: "Are you saying that a lot more criminals are black than white - or that there are more black people in jail than white because they are stopped more often?"According to the Daily Mirror, Mr Spink replied: "The former, and that's what people don't seem to like. But I didn't enter a beauty contest when I became an MP!!!!"Mr Spink insisted today that the way the comments had been portrayed was "disingenuous" and "politically mischievous".He said: "In fact, I was simply repeating to my constituent the answers that the home secretary had put down to me in the House of Commons."I asked a range of questions of the home secretary to establish the facts about crime."He told the House of Commons that, pro rata, many more young black men are known to the criminal justice system than young white men."That is simply a statistical fact."According to Home Office statistics, in 2004-05 14% of the prison population in England and Wales was black, with 77% being white.The 2001 census showed that 2% of the population of the UK was black (92.1% was white).The Home Office's report, Race and the Criminal Justice System (November 2006) said that "people from BME [black and ethnic minority] groups are overrepresented at each stage of the criminal justice process".The report contends that this "is not because people from BME groups are more likely to offend", and suggests a number of alternative explanations.Mr Spink told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he wanted to have a "serious debate" about the issue without "silly charges of racism being thrown around".There was no immediate reaction from Conservative Central Office. A spokeswoman said Mr Spink was "expressing his personal view."The CRE conference has been criticised, and even boycotted, by groups complaining at the ticket prices, which reach up to Â£700 per delegate.The 1990 Trust, which is planning to demonstrate outside the venue, said that it was angry that the cost of the convention priced out ordinary members of the black community.It is also worried that the merging of the CRE into a wider body will see a loss of focus on black issues.A spokeswoman for the group said: "We believe the CEHR will set race relations back 30 years, as the government's one-size-fits-all policy of lumping all equalities subjects together will mean race will be sidelined."The 1990 Trust is planning a rival event this evening at London's City Hall entitled The Race & Faith Leadership Summit.Ms Kelly's address will be followed by a speech from the current CRE head, Trevor Phillips, and then two days of talks, workshops and debates featuring 150 speakers from the worlds of politics, media and academia.Billed as the first conference of its kind in the UK, the CRE Race Convention marks the passing of the 1976 Race Relations Act, the legislation which established the CRE.One group attending both the CRE's conference and tonight's City Hall event is the Muslim Council of Britain, which has criticised the CRE for not speaking out enough against "Islamophobia".Mohammed Abdul Bari, the MCB's secretary general, said: "We have been unhappy with the CRE but that doesn't mean that we don't take part in their events. We express our unhappiness by engaging, not by boycotting."The convention opens a day after Tony Blair expressed his "deep sorrow" for Britain's role in the slave trade.His personal condemnation, which stopped short of a full apology, precedes next year's bicentenary of slavery's abolition.In comments published by the Observer, Mr Blair said: "It is hard to believe what would now be a crime against humanity was legal at the time."I believe the bicentenary offers us a chance not just to say how profoundly shameful the slave trade was - how we condemn its existence utterly and praise those who fought for its abolition - but also to express our deep sorrow that it could ever have happened and rejoice at the better times we live in today."The statement is also due to appear today in New Nation, a newspaper aimed at the black community.
