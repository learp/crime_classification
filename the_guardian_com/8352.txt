Britain's most persistent motoring offender was jailed for eight months today after his 51st conviction for driving while disqualified.Jamie Manderson, 35, was also given another driving ban, this time for five years, after he pleaded guilty before magistrates in his home town of Swindon.The chief magistrate, Norman Ames, said: "You have a flagrant disregard for the law. This the worst case of driving while disqualified, in total, we have come across." He sentenced Manderson to 24 weeks in prison, plus eight weeks from a previously imposed suspended jail sentence.Manderson, a former nightclub bouncer, was first banned from driving in 1988 at the age of 15. He has never had a driving licence.He has 51 convictions for driving while disqualified, and 51 more for connected offences of driving without insurance. A raft of other previous convictions include aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving in 2004 and 2005.A decade ago, Manderson ran over a 12-year-old cyclist as he drove a robbery getaway car.At the time of his most recent offence, he was serving a community-based sentence for other car-related matters. The court was told he was driving in the Roughmoor area of Swindon on Saturday when police officers spotted him. Rob Ross, Manderson's solicitor, told the court: "He still has a problem with motor cars. He always will." In the past, Ross, who describes his client as a "likeable idiot", has said Manderson suffers from "a serious addiction to cars".Manderson is awaiting trial on two further charges of driving while disqualified in February. He denies the offences. Ames said a pre-trial review hearing would take place on May 7.
