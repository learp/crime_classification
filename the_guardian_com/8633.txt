So are we really in the grip of a knife-crime epidemic? Is it true that "blade violence" is spreading everywhere, or as the Daily Mail front-page put it yesterday: "Knives: why no part of Britain is safe."The latest annual crime figures from the police and the British Crime Survey (BCS) present a picture of a number of declines in the overall level of violent crime - drops of between 8% and 12% across England and Wales, depending upon your chosen measure.We had it officially confirmed, for the first time yesterday, that in more than 22,000 offences (over 12 months to March this year) of attempted murder, grievous bodily harm, and robbery, a knife or other sharp instrument was involved. To put that in context: one in five serious violent incidents involved a person using, or threatening someone with, a knife or broken bottle. But that is only one year's figures and as it is the first time they have been collected we have nothing to compare them with. What a "force by force" breakdown of the figures shows us is that more than half the serious knife crime attacks were in London, Birmingham and Manchester. The shadow of "blade Britain" cannot be said to reach Dorset [47 incidents], Norfolk [67 incidents] or North Yorkshire [66].The BCS, which has the limitation of small sample sizes concerning victims, suggests knives were involved in 6% of all violent incidents in 2007-08 - little change since the 7% of the year before. The national murder figures, which are up by 25 to 784, do not suggest a big surge in knife slayings.This does not mean that there has not been highly concentrated localised increases in the number of knife attacks at a time when violent crime is rapidly falling in the rest of the country. But don't mistake those highly publicised and horrific incidents for the national crime picture.
