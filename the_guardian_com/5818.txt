Police in the home secretary's constituency are pressing for a trial scheme which would charge local nightclubs and pubs for the extra workload caused by their clientele.Frustrated at having to man a nightly public order van with a sergeant and five constables just to cope with rowdy drinkers and drugtakers in Sheffield, senior officers in South Yorkshire police are pressing for a "pay for the trouble you cause" experiment. Informal talks have been held with David Blunkett, whose Sheffield Brightside constituency includes some of the city's 20 big club venues which can hold an estimated 17,000 people. Superintendent Steve Hicks, head of Sheffield's West Bar police division, said that the need to use private finance had become acute. The situation came to a head after a recent raid and 13 arrests at the Republic nightclub, in which 160 officers were deployed. Supt Hicks said: "Like other city centres around the country, we are beset by huge policing problems. These difficulties are stimulated by alcohol and drug intoxification, almost exclusively by businesses which realise vast assets." Sheffield police recorded 248 assaults at city centre clubs last year, along with 69 allegations of attacks on bouncers and door staff and 49 complaints of wounding. There were also 224 drugs-related arrests including 14 involving alleged dealers.
