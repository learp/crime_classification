Key targets to reduce the number of hate crimes that do not lead to a conviction have been missed this year, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service has admitted.Ken Macdonald, director of the CPS, said in a speech last week that the service had fallen below the set figures by almost 1,200 crimes involving racial, religious or homophobic offences.Macdonald had given the CPS a goal of lowering the proportion of hate crimes that do not lead to a conviction to 36 per cent. But in a speech to the crime reduction charity Nacro, Macdonald said they were still 2 per cent - 1,180 more hate crimes - above target. 'We have decided to retain this target and renew our commitment to reducing unsuccessful outcomes to 36 per cent by March 2007,' said Macdonald.The disclosure comes days after the murder of 18-year-old Christopher Alaneme in Sheerness, Kent, which is being treated as a race crime. Detectives are still hunting a suspect they have named, 29-year-old Peter Connolly, following the arrest of four other men on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.New CPS figures reveal a rise to 59,250 reported hate crimes last year compared with 41,937 crimes for 2004 and 2005.
