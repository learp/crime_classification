Police chiefs and prison governors would face charges of corporate manslaughter for negligent deaths in custody under changes to the law being proposed tonight by two prominent Labour backbenchers.John Reid, the home secretary, who is opposing the measures, could even face a surprise defeat tonight over the proposals brought forward by John Denham, former Home Office minister, and Andrew Dismore, chair of the joint Commons and Lords human rights committee.The two, neither of whom is considered a serial rebel, have tabled amendments to toughen up the government's corporate manslaughter bill, which gets its third reading tonight.Mr Dismore cites the death of Zahid Mubarek in Feltham young offenders centre as a prime example of the need to change the law.Mr Mubarek, 19, was bludgeoned to death by psychopath Robert Stewart in 2000.A public inquiry costing Â£5.2m found that a catalogue of "systemic" failures at the centre led to the murder.Mr Dismore said yesterday: "There is a very strong case for the law being changed. Hopefully, these cases will never arise but the prison authorities should not be exempt from prosecution when they do occur."Mr Denham, who is now chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the committee had unanimously wanted the law changed. "The present system, which says that ministers are ultimately responsible, is unworkable."Normally the minister in charge of prisons has moved on by the time the investigation is completed."The Home Office is to oppose the change to the law, arguing that the present system is adequate. Government whips have tried to put pressure on both MPs to withdraw the amendments to avoid an embarrassing defeat.The reason is that both MPs have attracted strong support from a range of Labour backbenchers, including the leftwing Campaign group, and will receive the full support of the Tory frontbench, including Dominic Grieve, the shadow attorney general, and David Davis, the shadow home secretary.The Home Office has even threatened to withdraw the bill if it is amended.However, the threat is not being taken too seriously by MPs because it would contravene the Warwick agreement between Tony Blair and the trade unions, which committed the government to introducing the corporate manslaughter bill.Such a move would lead to a huge row between all the major trade unions, who are the Labour party's main fundraisers.Separately, the TUC is campaigning for another major amendment to the bill, which would make directors of individual companies personally liable for deaths caused by negligent management, including the prospect of jail sentences for the most senior staff.The Home Office is opposing this as well.Typical of the unions' view is Amicus, which represents 1.2 million workers. Derek Simpson, the Amicus general secretary, said: "Although we welcome the bill, which will make it easier to bring prosecutions against companies that kill their employees, we want to see a much wider range of penalties."All the evidence shows that the threat of prosecution and imprisonment is the main incentive for companies to improve their health and safety standards."Meanwhile, lawyers for the RMT union have said that the new law would not make a practical difference to the outcome of the four major rail disasters since 1997.For the Southall, Ladbroke Grove, Hatfield and Potters Bar crashes, which killed a total of 49 people and injured 700, the draft law would have made no practical difference in sanctions or establishing individual accountability, says Thompsons, the law firm employed by the union.The union has called on MPs to support amendments making directors personally liable.
