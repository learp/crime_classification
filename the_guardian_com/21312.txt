A mother tried to kill her newborn daughter by dropping her more than 40ft (12 metres) down a towerblock rubbish chute, a court has heard.Jaymin Abdulrahman is alleged to have tidied up her flat after dumping the six-day-old baby, who had been completely swaddled in a piece of material, down the chute last September.The 25-year-old, who denies attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and inflicting grievous bodily harm, initially told police that her child had been kidnapped by strangers.But prosecutor Andrew Smith QC told Birmingham crown court it was anticipated that Abdulrahman would accept during the hearing that she was the person who put the baby into the chute at a block of flats in Wolverhampton.The infant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered severe head and brain injuries, including several skull fractures.Opening the case against Abdulrahman, Smith said the jury would hear evidence from two psychiatrists who had assessed her in recent weeks.After outlining how a crash test dummy had been used to reconstruct the events at the centre of the case, Smith told jurors: "The prosecution contend that Miss Abdulrahman knew what she was doing when she carried the baby from the flat and dropped her those five floors down the chute."The crown alleges that the defendant's "reason or capacity" to understand the consequences of her actions had not been removed by any mental illness at the time of the incident, Smith added. At the conclusion of his opening speech, Smith said: "The reason why she decided to place her daughter in the rubbish chute may be never be known or understood."However, the prosecution say that her intention can be clearly identified from her actions on that September afternoon last year. There is unlikely to be any dispute that Abdulrahman did cause [the baby] undoubtedly serious injuries."The focus, the prosecution anticipates, will be on the defendant's state of mind in those crucial minutes."The prosecution anticipates that the key issue for you in this case will be what did Jaymin Abdulrahman intend, if anything, when she put her into the rubbish chute. The prosecution submits in this case that her intention was to kill."It is alleged that the baby was placed into the chute at about 6.30pm and was found, apparently lifeless, by her father later the same day. Pieces of a broken Moses basket were found in a bin at the bottom of the chute, the court heard, and bits of wood were discovered inside the flat.Jurors also heard that the baby struck a metal deflector plate placed at the foot of the chute to slow down items of rubbish.The court was shown computer-generated images of efforts to reconstruct the child's fall, which caused fractures to the right, left and back of her head.Smith told the seven men and five women on the jury: "As the police investigation developed, an expert in accident reconstruction was instructed to examine how she fell and what type of forces would have been involved."Experiments had been undertaken with a crash test dummy of a nine-month-old child, Smith said, revealing the vertical drop inside the chute to be 44ft (13.4 metres) and establishing the estimated impact speed with the metal plate as 32mph (51.5kph)."In summary, the expert who carried out these tests was able to conclude that the force with which the baby would have struck the metal deflector was comparable to having been in a 30mph (48kph) car crash without wearing a seatbelt," Smith submitted.The trial continues.
