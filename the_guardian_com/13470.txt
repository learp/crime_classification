Scotland Yard is targeting more criminals who smuggle women in to Britain's underground sex trade than ever before, a senior detective said today.Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland said a reorganisation of the London force's vice and trafficking units has led to a flood of fresh information.More victims were coming forward to report they were being exploited by criminal gangs and brothel owners, he said.Hyland was speaking after a couple were convicted of making more than £1m in six months by running four brothels around the capital.Former police informer Michael Dalton and his partner, Nikki Chen, trafficked women from China to work in Sunbury, Egham, West Drayton and Surbiton.The couple, from Leatherhead, face lengthy jail sentences after they were convicted of controlling prostitution for gain at Croydon crown court.Hyland said: "We have got more operations running now than there has ever been before in the Met. We are able to identify more victims, we have got a focal point for them to report to."There are more people investigating trafficking than there were under the old system. We have got more staff investigating trafficking than there has ever been before."Detectives arrested Dalton, 44, and Chen, 56, and rescued seven women in a series of raids last July. Several others were also detained.During a lengthy undercover operation police looked on as at least a dozen customers visited each of the brothels every day.The minimum payment for services from prostitutes working in the premises was £60, ranging up to £120 an hour.The women were forced to work to pay off debts they owed the couple and told their families they would be at risk if they tried to escape.Dalton and Chen owned properties in Gloucestershire and Surrey, and drove a luxury Mercedes and a Lamborghini sports car.Hyland said men who use prostitutes must realise that they were fuelling human misery. "In April we arrested three men for purchasing sex from exploited women. We only have to prove there is exploitation, not just trafficking but women who are controlled or subjected to degrading behaviour," he said."It needs to be put out there to people that they have to understand this is exploitation of people in the worst way. Lives are ruined just because people want to use what is seen as just a brothel selling prostitution. They do not see the horror story behind it."
