Children as young as 10 could be electronically tagged and their parents jailed as part of a crackdown on youth crime by the Scottish executive.The proposals, which are to be unveiled this week, form the centrepiece of the new Holyrood administration's legislative programme. Under the plans, Scotland's children's hearing system will have the powers to order that under-16s be tagged to curb their anti-social behaviour. Tagging would be done as a last resort if a child had already broken an anti-social behaviour order. The proposals also include orders to force parents to take responsiblity for their children's offending. Failure to do so could mean a fine, or a jail sentence. Margaret Curran, the Scottish communities minister, who will oversee the policy, said she had been overwhelmed by complaints from constituents about anti-social behaviour and a comprehensive effort was needed to tackle the problem. "We need to do what has to be done," she said. "If that's tough, then that's tough. We are not helping these young people at all if we don't try to deal with their behaviour." The move coincides with a Mori study which found that 68% of children in Glasgow felt unsafe because of gangs in their area, and more than half had experienced crime in the previous year.
