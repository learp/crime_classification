A man who shot a police officer has been found dead at his home following an 18-hour siege.Officers had been called to the house in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, on Monday afternoon to talk to Stephen Hensby about antisocial behaviour.Hensby, 54, had been involved in a long-standing dispute over eviction following the death of his mother, Emily, about three years ago.Police said he opened fire on them and hurled petrol bombs out of the window.PC David Lomas, 34, from Bury, near Manchester, was shot in the upper body.Despite the ferocity of the attack, a fellow policeman ran to save PC Lomas, who was lying injured on the ground.He was airlifted to the Royal Preston hospital, where he is in a comfortable condition. His injuries are not life threatening and his family is at his bedside.A blue car parked near the house had its windows shot in the attack, but the second officer escaped without injury.At 6.30am yesterday, police stormed the house and found Hensby's body in an upstairs bedroom.They also found a dead rottweiler dog. No one else was in the house at the time. Police were unable to confirm how Hensby died. Speaking from his bed at Royal Preston hospital last night, PC Lomas said: "I know that my colleagues showed a lot of bravery to get me away from the scene yesterday and I am very grateful." Chief Superintendent Jerry Graham, of Lancashire police, said it had been a "difficult operation" where the safety of the public and police officers was paramount. "This has shaken PC Lomas's colleagues up, not only because he is a very effective officer, but also because he is a very popular officer with his colleagues," Ch Supt Graham said.Nearby homes were evacuated after the siege began and a shelter was set up for residents at a local school.The half-mile cordon was lifted after 8am, but the road remained blocked off while police carried out their inquiries.Meanwhile, a man who was arrested in Merseyside following a six-hour siege at a house in Liverpool has been named by locals as John Kerfoot.His former girlfriend, Janet Kilty, was later found dead inside the house and a five-year-old child was recovered safe and well. A postmortem examination was being carried out yesterday.Merseyside police confirmed that a 38-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder. He will be interviewed by detectives after he has been declared fit by a doctor.
