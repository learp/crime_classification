A hotel is planning to turn the site of the £53m Securitas depot robbery in Tonbridge, Kent, into a tourist attraction, it emerged yesterday.The Rose and Crown Hotel, in Tonbridge, said it would offer guests a guided tour of the key locations in Britain's largest robbery, which took place last month.Lisa Buttigieg, a manager at the hotel, told the Guardian: "It's a good price. For £100 you get a nice dinner and a full English breakfast included."But Andrew Buckingham, of Victim Support, said the tour was insensitive towards the family who were abducted during the raid.
