The son of Michael Atherton, who shot dead three family members on New Year's Day before killing himself, said he could not understand why "such a good man" would do such a thing.Atherton, 42, shot his partner, Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and her niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, in the village of Horden, County Durham, before turning the gun on himself.Michael, 17, released a statement on behalf of himself and his sister, Laura McGoldrick, 19, who managed to escape the slaughter by climbing out through an upstairs window."We are truly devastated," he said. "Me and my sister have lost the best mother in the world."We don't understand why my dad would do anything like this as he was such a good man."At the end of the day, we have lost four loved family members and we hope they are all at peace now."Atherton's parents, Peter and Christine, said they loved him and could not understand why he had done what he did."We and our whole family want to express our sympathies to the families of Susan, Alison and Tanya. Although we loved Michael, we are sorry for his actions and don't understand why he did what he did."We dearly loved Susan as a daughter for over 20 years and are devastated by the loss."Relatives of the three women paid individual tributes to them. They said they were shattered by the death of McGoldrick, saying she was "so caring" and adored by family and friends.Alison Turnbull, the mother of two children – Bobby and Tanya – was described as a fantastic mother, sister and partner and her family said they were "destroyed" by their loss.The family described Tanya Turnbull as a "funny" young woman who was always smiling and was planning to buy her first home with her boyfriend.A postmortem examination revealed they died from shotgun injuries.Police found a weapon next to Atherton's body and all their bodies were found in different rooms in the semi-detached property.A Durham police spokesman said Atherton had been out drinking locally in the hours leading up to the shootings.His partner was out drinking separately with a group of friends, which included her sister and niece.Det Supt Paul Goundry, who is leading the inquiry, said: "Mr Atherton produced a shotgun and in a matter of moments shot dead Susan, Tanya and Alison before turning the gun on himself."Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.Police confirmed that the weapon used was a shotgun that was legally registered to Atherton.They said the force took away his guns following an incident in 2008 but the weapons were later returned.The government said on Tuesday it had no plans to tighten or review gun laws after the shootings, saying UK legislation on firearms was "arguably the toughest in the world".Downing Street said it needed to protect public safety and ensure gun controls were practical.The police investigation is likely to focus on why Atherton was allowed to hold gun licences for six weapons – three shotguns and three "section one" firearms, such as rifles.Section one licences are subject to further scrutiny. Both types of certification are reviewed every five years, although fewer than 1% of applications to renew a shotgun licence were rejected in 2009/10.An inquest is due to open on Thursday but will be adjourned until a later date.
