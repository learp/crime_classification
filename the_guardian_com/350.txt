Ian Huntley became site manager of Soham village college on November 26 2001. He and Maxine Carr moved into the caretaker's house at 5 College Close a few months later after it had undergone major refurbishment.The court was told that the property was a two-storey three-bedroom house rented to Mr Huntley as part of his employment package. Richard Latham QC, for the prosecution, gave a few details about Mr Huntley and his family circumstances. He said that Mr Huntley's parents had separated some years ago, and by 2002 his father, Kevin Huntley, was living in Littleport, a few miles north of Soham, with a woman called Sandra Brewer. When that relationship ended Mr Huntley got back with his wife. The prosecution said Mr Huntley senior had also lived at two addresses in Suffolk and his mother, Lily Gollings - Huntley's paternal grandmother - lived at Lakenheath, in Suffolk. The girls' bodies were found in that area. The jury was told that until May last year Ian Huntley was known as Ian Nixon. He changed his name by deed poll. But Mr Latham said the prosecution did not attribute a sinister motive to the change of name. The court was told that he owned a red Ford Fiesta. Mr Latham said the car was "one of the keys to this case".
