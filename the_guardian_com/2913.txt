The murder rate in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest in 20 years, with 648 homicides recorded in 2008/09 â€“ 136 fewer than the year before.The annual crime figures published today appear to show that the economic recession has had a limited impact, with a lower than expected 1% increase in domestic burglary.The overall crime rate in England and Wales is officially declared to have been stable in the past year with an estimated 10.7m offences, according to the British Crime Survey (BCS). The separate measure of police-recorded crime said the rate fell by 5% last year.There were some signs of "underlying upward pressure" on the crime rate, with a 5% rise in fraud offences, including credit card and online fraud, and a 10% increase in shoplifting recorded by the police.An apparent 25% surge in pickpocketing and other theft from the person on the BCS was discounted when set against a 12% fall in the same category of crime recorded by the police.Over the past 20 years, the number of murders peaked in 2002/03 when Harold Shipman's victims inflated the annual total to 1,047. The 17% fall this year, including a drop in the number of fatal stabbings from 270 to 252, brings the level to its lowest since 1987.This fall in the murder rate is matched by a 7% fall in the number of attempted murders, but overall violent crime is reported to have remained stable. A 17% fall in gun crime was not matched by similar progress on knife crime where, despite a high-profile government campaign, the number of robberies involving knives fell only 2% to 16,702 cases.According to the BCS, the risk of being a victim of crime rose for the first time for several years from 22% to 23% but remained substantially down on the 40% recorded when crime peaked in 1995.The Home Office said the long-term trend in England and Wales according to the BCS showed crime rising steadily from 1981 through to the early 1990s before peaking in 1995. Since then crime had fallen by 36%.Despite the figures, 75% of the public believe crime is rising nationally. Fewer though, 36%, say it is increasing in their own neighbourhood.Public confidence in the ability of the police and local councils to deal with antisocial behaviour has risen from 45% to 49% in the past year, apparently contradicting recent comments by the home secretary, Alan Johnson, that the government had been "coasting" on the issue.Johnson welcomed the figures, saying they demonstrated that reductions in crime were being maintained.He said ministers were not being complacent and expected the economic downturn to push up certain crimes. "The government is determined to keep these crimes down by continued investment in preventative measures; tough, targeted policing, and historically high numbers of police officers."But the shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, said: "We've seen some high profile and alarming murders and near-murders involving knives. These figures lay bare the problem we have with knife crime in Britain."It looks like the government is trying to cover up the scale of the problem we face with knife crime; little wonder given its policies have failed to get to grips with the challenge."
