The 16-year-old boy who murdered teacher Ann Maguire has lost a challenge to his 20-year minimum term.Will Cornick stabbed Maguire, 61, seven times from behind as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April last year.Maguire had taught there for more than 40 years and was due to retire that September.In November, at Leeds crown court, Mr Justice Coulson told Cornick, who was 15 at the time of the killing, that he must serve at least 20 years before he is eligible to seek parole but warned him: “It’s quite possible that day may never come.”Today, a panel of three judges at the court of appeal in London, headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, rejected Cornick’s appeal against the minimum term, saying that on the “disturbing” facts of the case, the sentencing judge came to “entirely the right decision”.Cornick attacked Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her.After the killing, he told psychiatrists that he “couldn’t give a shit” and added: “Everything I’ve done is fine and dandy.”The crown court heard that Cornick winked at another boy before he launched into a savage assault in front of a terrified class full of pupils.Maguire was left with stab wounds that the paramedic who attended said were the worst she had ever seen, including one wound which went straight through her neck and another that cut her jugular vein.Despite the injuries caused by the eight-inch-long kitchen knife, she managed to leave the classroom, pursued by the teenager, until a colleague bundled her into a room and held the door shut.The judge heard that Cornick, who pleaded guilty to murder, had never shown any remorse and had since spoken of his pride in what he had done.Paul Greaney QC said there was nothing to indicate to the boy’s parents or teachers a risk of “homicidal violence”, but he had told other children that he hated Maguire and wanted her dead.He added that Cornick has “an adjustment disorder with psychopathic tendencies” but “that does not reduce his culpability”.Lord Thomas, sitting with Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Globe, were told by Richard Wright QC, for Cornick, that it was a complicated sentencing exercise and an exceptional case.The minimum term had to be a significant one, but 20 years was “simply too long” bearing in mind Cornick’s youth, plea and lack of previous convictions.In his ruling, Lord Thomas said there could be no doubt of the devastation which the murder had caused Maguire’s family.There had been extensive premeditation and other aggravating features included the level of violence used, Maguire’s suffering and the total lack of remorse.“We consider, looking at the matter and giving due weight to each of those factors, that the deduction which the judge made of five years [from a starting-point of 25 years] was correct.“We then stood back and asked: was this the right and proper sentence?.“In our view, it was, and on the disturbing facts of this case, 20 years was entirely the right decision.”Maguire’s widower, Don, who was in court on Thursday with other members of the family, earlier described the killing as a “monumental act of cowardice and evil”.Cornick was not present for the hearing. The family said they would not be making any statement.
