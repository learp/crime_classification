Home Office officials are considering a plan for the early release of 2,500 prisoners in an attempt to ease overcrowding in Britain's jails.Whitehall sources last night confirmed the existence of the scheme, but said there were no present plans to activate it. They said it would be used only as a last resort and was only one of many options being considered.The Home Secretary, John Reid, has consistently opposed any such moves and has ruled them out on his watch, but The Observer understands that senior figures in the Home Office now believe they may have no choice but to put the plan into effect later in the year, if the prison population continues to rise.Last Thursday it reached more than 80,000, around 800 below its usable operational capacity. Internal Home Office estimates suggest that, if present trends continue, it will touch 83,000 by June, triggering the need for drastic action unless more places are found.Under the new proposals, about 2,500 prisoners would be freed a fortnight early under what is known as a release on temporary licence. They could be recalled for breaching the terms of their release. This proposal differs from the standard early release scheme that carries no sanctions and which Reid rejected last year for fear that he would be seen as 'too soft'.Home Office sources stressed that only non-violent prisoners would be released under the plan and that those considered for it would be subject to strict eligibility criteria and supervision.Critics of the Home Office are likely to accuse ministers of political meddling to solve a crisis of their own making, if they choose to activate the plan.'The release of these prisoners early would be a direct consequence of Labour's failure to address the chronic lack of capacity in our prisons, despite warnings from ourselves and their own advisers going back to 2001,' said David Davis, the shadow Home Secretary.'Any claim that these offenders will be under any kind of supervision will not fool the public. They know all too clearly that Labour's idea of "close supervision" bears no resemblance whatsoever to what anyone else would expect.' The Home Office has pledged to find more than 2,500 prison places by the end of this year, but the prospect of the majority of these coming into operation soon appears remote. Problems relating to planning permission, health and safety issues and a cash shortage suggest the department's room for manoeuvre is severely constrained.In a separate attempt to ease the crisis, the Home Office minister, Baroness Scotland, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Phillips, and the head of the National Offender Management Service, Helen Edwards, will tomorrow summon magistrates to a private conference to discuss alternatives to jail. But any suggestion that magistrates should imprison fewer offenders is likely to be greeted by claims of government interference and prompt an ugly row between the politicians and the judiciary.The mounting crisis comes as independent research to be published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies warns that the government's sentencing regime could be leading to more custodial sentences.'Home Office officials hoped a reconfigured community sentence and the new suspended sentence order would address the ratcheting up in sentencing tariffs which has resulted in community penalties displacing financial penalties and immediate custody displacing community penalties,' said Enver Solomon, the centre's deputy director. 'Our analysis shows this is not happening and the government is having to resort to desperate measures.'And prisoners are now spending longer in jail than before Labour came to power. The probation service union, Napo, claims that, although the numbers being received into prisons are not increasing, sentence lengths have risen over the last five years by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.In addition, fewer prisoners are being granted parole because the Parole Board is more cautious following a number of disturbing incidents involving violent offenders out on licence. There has also been more than a threefold increase in offenders recalled for failing to keep to their licence conditions, while the number of prisoners on home detention curfews has fallen because fewer fulfil the eligibility rules.
