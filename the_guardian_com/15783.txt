The British drug smuggler Melissa Reid is on her way back to the UK after spending the last three years in a Peruvian jail.Reid, 22, was photographed with her father, Billy, at Lima airport on Tuesday evening and it is understood the pair will travel back to Glasgow via Amsterdam. Reid, from Lenzie in East Dunbartonshire, along with Michaella McCollum, from Dungannon in County Tyrone, was jailed in 2013 after 11kg of cocaine worth an estimated £1.5m was found in their luggage at Lima airport.McCollum, 23, was freed in March under new legislation, but was required to remain on parole in Peru.But Reid has been allowed to return home after a judge in Lima last month granted an order to expel her because she met the legal requirements for release.Reid and McCollum originally faced a maximum of 15 years in prison if found guilty but decided to plead guilty in the hope of getting a lighter sentence. They were sentenced in December 2013 to six years and eight months in jail.McCollum’s solicitor, Kevin Winters, had described the conditions in which they were held as horrendous. The pair had been in Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima, but were moved to the Ancon 2 prison where McCollum was reportedly crammed in a cell with extremely poor sanitation and toilet facilities with 30 other prisoners.Reid’s father said the impact of her crime on his family had been traumatic and warned in a video of the consequences of drug offences abroad.“It’s horrendous to see your daughter in handcuffs and the living conditions that she has to put up with. Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru,” he said.“She missed the significant event of her only brother’s wedding. Events such as Christmas are non-existent for us. There’ll be no celebrations in our house, there’ll be no Christmas tree until we get her back home.”A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “We continue to provide assistance to Melissa Reid and remain in contact with her family and local authorities.”
