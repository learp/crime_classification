The wife of former Scottish socialist MSP Tommy Sheridan believes she is the victim of police harassment, her lawyer said yesterday.Gail Sheridan, 44, has been arrested over allegations of theft. She has been suspended by British Airways as a result of the allegations, which are reported to involve miniatures of alcohol.She was arrested and charged by police after a raid on the couple's home in Glasgow. She has denied the accusations.'Gail Sheridan has a 23-year unblemished record with British Airways, whom she has represented as part of their promotional team, as well as serving as a shop steward and now as a senior cabin crew member,' said Amer Anwar, the couple's lawyer. 'She understands British Airways employment procedures but firmly believes she is now a victim of harassment and intolerable behaviour from Lothian and Borders Police and sections of the press. Both Mr and Mrs Sheridan are determined to prove their innocence and will not be intimidated or bullied by Lothian and Borders Police.'There was no official confirmation yesterday of reports that the thefts are alleged to involve miniature bottles of spirits and perfume found in her home by officers investigating perjury allegations. BA is believed to have taken action after being contacted by Lothian and Borders Police.Mrs Sheridan was charged with perjury on Tuesday, following an investigation by officers into evidence given in court under oath during her husband's defamation case against a Sunday newspaper in 2006. Mr Sheridan, 43, was charged with perjury in December, about 16 months after he won a Â£200,000 action against the News of the World at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, over claims he was involved in sex orgies and took drugs.His father-in-law, Angus Healy, 71, and three colleagues who backed him in the trial have also been charged.Yesterday a British Airways spokesman refused to comment on individual employees but confirmed that a member of cabin crew had been suspended as part of a continuing investigation.A Lothian and Borders Police spokeswoman confirmed: 'A 44-year-old woman has been arrested and charged, and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.'
