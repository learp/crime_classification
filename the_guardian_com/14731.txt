Rising knife crime is being caused by a cocktail of a reduction in stop and search, increased sales on the dark web of weapons such as the foot-long “zombie knife”, and a burgeoning culture of youth violence, Scotland Yard police chiefs have said.Knife crime is up by at least 18%, after years of falling, and 10 youngsters have been stabbed to death in the capitalin the past nine months.Last week in London, a young person was chased and stabbed to death, and two teenagers were convicted of killing other youngsters in knife attacks earlier this year – including for the stabbing of 15-year-old Alan Cartwright to death as he rode his bicycle.In an interview with the Guardian, commander Dean Haydon, head of Scotland Yard’s homicide and major crime command, and commander Duncan Ball, head of combating gang crime, said four key factors were behind the rise:The dark web being used to purchase weapons, such as the zombie knife which has a foot-long blade. A cultural change among young people that is encouraging them to use knives, even for trivial disputes or minor theft.Reductions in the use of stop and search.Improved recording of knife crime statistics.Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howeordered a reduction and better targeting of stop and search in 2011 in an effort to use it more effectively. Its overuse, sometimes unlawfully, returned few arrests but has often caused anger among communities by leading to thousands of innocent people being searched.But Haydon said gang members and young people had told police that reducing stop and search meant it was no longer such a deterrent for those thinking of carrying weapons: “They are not being stop and searched as much as they used to be so the deterrence is less.“I’m not advocating we go back to the random stop and search of large numbers. If we are targeted and intelligence driven and we have the confidence of communities, it can be used effectively.”The police chiefs say officers are seizing not just kitchen knives found in homes, but hunting knives ordered from the internet where there are no checks on who is buying them, such as the zombie knife which Haydon said were “one foot long, with multiple sharp edges, designed to maximise damage if not death.“There’s been a growth in knives bought off the internet, from the dark web, over the last few years.”Ball said there may be a trend among some to carry bigger, more dangerous knives. More perplexing for police chiefs is a cultural shift, with people using knives now after a dispute, where previously there would have been a fist fight.Haydon said: “There is a general change in society, whether violence in the home or on the streets, violence is increasing in society. There is a cultural change.”Young peoplewere more prepared to carry a knife than before either for what they consider for their personal safety or for use in crime. “We need to change the culture of young people,” he said.On Friday, Joshua Williams, 18, was jailed for life for stabbing Alan Cartwrightto death as he rode his bicycle on Caledonian Road, north London, in February.CCTV video police released of the attack show the seemingly casual stabbing of the teenager. Williams, who was holding a knife in his left hand, stepped out in front of Alan and plunged a blade into his upper chest with what police said was a “swinging movement”.On Thursday, a schoolboy was convicted for manslaughter after stabbing to death Bilal Mirza, 18, in north-west London, in January. The 16-year-old, who is too young to be named, claimed he armed himself with a knife to defend himself against being robbed of his iPhone and cash.Ball said: “This is not an issue we will ever arrest or enforce our way out of,” adding that police, schools, parents and communities would need to tackle the underlying causes of what Ball described as young people seeing life as cheap on Britain’s street.Police estimate there are fewer than 300 who carry a knife on a regular basis in London and Haydon said police would be helped by a new law introduced this summer which jails those caught carrying a knife twice.Ball said knife crime figures fell over the past few weeks following concerted police campaign that resulted in 2,700 arrests which recovered 500 knives and 63 firearms.Police have sent letters to those suspected of carrying knives warning them of the new “two strikes” law introduced in the summer. Those caught with a knife twice and convicted will be sent to jail, even if they have not used it to commit another crime.
