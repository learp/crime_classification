Detectives investigating the abduction of a six-year-old girl from her bath last month were today examining whether the discovery of a man's body was linked to the case.Police last night found the body of a 30-year-old man at a flat close to the house in Willington Quay, North Tyneside, from which the girl was snatched and then assaulted before being left in a freezing street.The body of the man, who has not been named, was found at a flat in Bewicke Road, a few streets away from the scene of the abduction on December 27.It was reported that officers had removed a red Ford Escort - similar to one detectives wanted to trace - from outside the property.Detectives have carried out a high-profile investigation into the offence, describing the paedophile responsible as "extremely dangerous"."Police in North Tyneside are investigating the circumstance surrounding the sudden death of a 30-year-old man," a Northumbria police spokeswoman said. "The man's body was found at a flat in Bewicke Road, Willington Quay, late yesterday afternoon."It [the death] is not being treated as suspicious at this stage. However, due to the proximity of the flat to the scene of the abduction of a six-year-old girl on December 27, officers from the abduction inquiry are exploring any potential links."Police refused to confirm reports that the man had hanged himself.The girl's mother found her daughter was missing from the ground floor bathroom of their home, where she had been having a bath. She was discovered shivering and whimpering by a resident in Armstrong Road as little as 15 minutes after being abducted.The girl said her abductor was between 5ft 4in and 5ft 8in, possibly with sideburns or unshaven. He was wearing black gloves and a dark coat and hood.
