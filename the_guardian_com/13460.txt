According to an all-male court of appeal, short prison sentences for manslaughter are appropriate "where the killer has a defence of provocation arising from the faithless conduct or disenchantment of his partner". ('Lenient' jail terms for killers upheld, December 21).The three cases of men who had killed their wives or partners were brought before them by the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, and the solicitor general, Harriet Harman, because they were concerned that judges were imposing short prison sentences if they took the view that men were "provoked". Far from reversing this trend, the three lordships appeared to have thoroughly endorsed the 19th-century patriarchal approach of treating women as their men's sexual property. Apparently, a man may be provoked so that his killing of his wife or partner is to be punished no more than a punch-up outside a pub, and less than the sentences imposed on the Blackburn rioters, if she dares as much as say she was "disenchanted". In one case, a man who killed by punching his partner's head and was sentenced to three years was said not to intend her serious harm; in another, a wife was stabbed 12 times in front of their four children when she told her husband she had feelings for another man, and a sentence of seven years was found to be appropriate; and in the third case a sentence of four years was upheld when a man suffocated his ex-partner who had left him. No doubt the judges were told that 42% of all female homicide victims in England and Wales were killed by their current or former partners (as against 4% of male victims) or two women a week (Home Office, 2001). Would it be too much to ask that in cases such as these there is at least one female judge? There are at last some women judges in the court of appeal. They should be used.Tess GillLondongill@oldsquarechambers.co.uk
