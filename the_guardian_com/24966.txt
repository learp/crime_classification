The Crown Prosecution Service has been asked to begin an inquiry into why a disc holding DNA details of thousands of suspected foreign criminals was left unchecked for a year, Gordon Brown said today.The attorney general had asked the CPS to investigate the matter, the prime minister told the Commons.Whitehall last night admitted that the disc containing the details of 2,000 suspects wanted by the Dutch authorities for crimes such as murder and rape lay on a desk at the CPS for a year after being "ignored" by officials.Brown told prime minister's questions that 11 of the suspected criminals had gone on to commit offences in the UK, including serious assault and non-payment of fines, before the CPS looked at the information.In a heated exchange the Conservative leader, David Cameron, accused the government of "catastrophic failures" for putting the safety of the British public at risk."Why is it that this government is so incompetent when it comes to protecting information from criminals?" Cameron asked, referring to recent scandals over lost data that have dogged the government.Earlier this morning, the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the problem had "very grave" implications and would deal "yet another hammer blow" to public confidence in the government's handling of information."Of course the responsibility for this lies with the home secretary, but I think there is a more systemic political failure of this government to get to grips with the database culture it has created," he said. "It has created a database state which it doesn't seem to know how to handle in human terms." The Dutch authorities sent DNA details of 2,000 people believed to have been involved in unsolved crimes in January last year and asked the CPS to match data against British DNA records.But the checks were only carried out last month when the disc was spotted. They found that the records of 15 of the Dutch suspects were on the British database. A major police operation is now under way to find the 15.A CPS spokeswoman confirmed that the discs were sent by the Dutch police to the CPS for checks.However, she insisted that there had been no breach of security."It is not a data security issue, as this information was always in a secure building, and didn't leave the possession of the CPS."Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the House of Commons home affairs committee, told the Today programme: "If the disc was in the hands of the Home Office and nothing was done about it and therefore certain criminal people have not been traced down, it is something we need to look into. "One of the whole points of having this sharing of information is that criminals don't feel they can get away with committing crime and hiding from the authorities."The Home Office was unable to comment on the matter, saying: "It would be inappropriate for us to comment on this as it is an ongoing police investigation."The latest embarrassment for Whitehall comes after a series of blunders involving missing data.The most high-profile was the loss of two computer discs by HM Revenue and Customs containing 25 million people's child benefit details â€“ equivalent to almost half the population.Last month 6,000 personal details were lost after a Royal Navy laptop was stolen and the defence secretary, Des Browne, admitted there have been two more similar thefts since 2005.Earlier this month it was revealed that murder case notes were found in a Manchester pub and papers belonging to the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - one headed "threats to the UK" - were found strewn across a field in Manchester by a woman walking her dog.
