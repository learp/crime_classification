Two more "punishment rooms" have been found at the former Jersey children's home where police are investigating a major child abuse scandal.The two secret underground chambers were found by forensic teams at Haut de la Garenne, the home where 100 people claim they were physically and sexually assaulted from the 1960s. Search teams have already excavated two other cellars at the site. Victims said the chambers were "punishment rooms" where they were kept in solitary confinement and assaulted.The buried remains of a child were found on February 23 during searches at the former children's home. Jersey police said tests on those remains, which have been dated no earlier than 1920, are inconclusive and more will be carried out. Senior investigating officer Lenny Harper said: "We have now established that there are a further two rooms, and we have received evidence from another victim over the last few days which tells of abuse in one of these two new rooms. "A number of items have been recovered from the cellar [rooms], which tend to corroborate the statements of victims." Harper could not say what the items are as they may lose "evidential value" if the details are published. Work will not start on excavating the third cellar until forensic teams finish in the second chamber. So far one person has been charged in connection with alleged abuse at Haut de la Garenne. The home's former warder, Gordon Claude Wateridge, has been charged with three offences of indecent assault on girls under 16 between 1969 and 1979. The 76-year-old was remanded in custody and will next appear before St Helier magistrates on April 14. The police inquiry is focused on Haut de la Garenne, but a number of other care facilities on Jersey are also being investigated. Police believe there may be as many as 40 suspects in the inquiry. Haut de la Garenne closed as a children's home in 1986.
