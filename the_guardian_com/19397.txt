Patrick Carter (Response, October 17) seeks to put forward only one side of the true picture when he indicates that public spending on legal aid has risen from £1.5bn in 1997 to more than £2bn today. It should be noted that, first of all, this amount includes all services from mental health, housing, asylum, divorce, children in care, and criminal law cases.Defence lawyers, by being brought in to assist clients, simply react to what state agencies are doing. It is the budgets of these agencies that have gone through the roof and are causing a distortion in legal aid costs. Purely in terms of criminal law alone:· The police grant for 2005-06 increased from £3.9bn to £4.5bn (a 15% rise).· Total expenditure on the Crown Prosecution Service increased from £346m in 2001 to some £604m in 2006 (a 75% increase) and the number of full-time employees increased from 5,564 to 7,846 (a 40% rise in personnel).· Total expenditure on the Serious Fraud Office increased from £23m to a projected £41m (a 78% increase) in the same period.· Expenditure by the Revenue & Customs Prosecution Office is projected to be £38m for 2005-06. It recently doubled its personnel (to 1,000 officers) to investigate just VAT offences.In contrast, total defence payments are actually now falling.There have been a large number of government-dictated changes in the way in which the criminal justice system operates in the past 10 years in order to make law and practice more complicated. These changes have all contributed to substantially increasing the time necessary (and, hence, cost) to prepare a case (especially crown court cases). These costs drivers are all outside the control of defence solicitors and are in the hands of the government. Avtar Bhatoa Independent Defence Lawyers
