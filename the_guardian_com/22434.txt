Harriet Harman was today fined after admitting driving without due care and attention.The minister was fined £350 and ordered to pay £75 costs and a £15 victim surcharge after her lawyer entered a guilty plea at City of Westminster magistrates court. Her driving licence was also endorsed with three points.The court heard that a second charge of driving while using a mobile phone had been withdrawn.The 59-year-old minister did not attend today's hearing, and was instead at a cabinet meeting in Downing Street.Harman, the MP for Camberwell and Peckham, was at the centre of a police inquiry after she was allegedly involved in a minor collision with a parked car.The Crown Prosecution Service issued a summons accusing her of driving without due care and attention and driving while using a handheld mobile.Scotland Yard officers questioned Harman after the incident in Dulwich, south London, on 3 July last year – the day she visited the scene of a fire in a Camberwell tower block in which six people died.The special crime division passed a file to prosecutors, who decided there was sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to take her to court.The case is particularly embarrassing for Harman because she is a QC, a privy council member and a former solicitor general.Careless driving can be punished with a fine of up to £5,000, a licence endorsement of up to nine points and a driving ban.A spokeswoman for Harman said: "Ms Harman fully accepts the court's judgment."Ms Harman is pleased that the potential charges of leaving the scene of an accident without exchanging particulars and failing to report an accident to the police have been dropped."[She] is pleased that it has been established that this was not a hit and run accident, as portrayed in some media reports. It was a parking incident and no damage was done."Ms Harman has pointed out that she was in her constituency attending the emergency reception centre for residents who had been evacuated from the fire at Lakanal House in Camberwell."Prosecutor Michael Jennings said Harman was involved in a minor collision in Bushey Hill Road, south London.He said she had been attempting to manoeuvre her Rover 75 from between two parked vehicles when she reversed into one of them.The court heard that she was using her mobile phone when she got into the car and throughout the low speed incident.Jennings said the owner of the parked car was watching from his flat nearby and called police to report the bump.But he added that no damage had been caused to either car and no insurance claims had been made.The court heard that Harman already has six penalty points on her licence after being caught speeding in a 30mph zone twice. The first incident happened in April 2007 and the second in April last year.Motorists who accumulate 12 points on their licence face a ban. Harman now has a total of nine.
