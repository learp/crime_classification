The movements of high-risk sex offenders are not being monitored because police surveillance officers are too busy keeping watch on terror suspects, says an official report published today.The joint report by police and probation inspectors on the management of sex offenders says that "competing demands" on police time mean that generally surveillance is "difficult to obtain" when it comes to tracking sex offenders. The inquiry, which looked at the handling of 100 registered sex offenders living in five parts of England and Wales, also found that a legal loophole meant that some sex offenders were able to refuse the police access to their homes. The report says legislation needs to be introduced to ensure a right of access.The report, by the chief inspectors of constabulary and probation, Sir Ronnie Flanagan and Andrew Bridges, says that the management of sex offenders has improved immeasurably in the last eight years, with joint working and specially trained officers. However, it adds that many of its findings are "disappointing". The handling of high and very high risk offenders needs to be improved.Nearly 29,000 convicted offenders are on the sex offenders' register. Of those, 626 are regarded as high risk, and a further 547 are violent offenders who need close supervision in the community.But the report says that in general surveillance is difficult to obtain: "In one police area surveillance packages ... were rarely implemented due to a lack of resources and, if they were implemented on high-risk-of-harm sex offenders, it was rarely for the duration requested."Police officers working with sex offenders would have welcomed an in-house surveillance capability."Huw Jones, the deputy chief inspector of constabulary, said a surveillance team of between 10 and 20 officers was needed to mount a 24-hour operation."Whether it is counterterrorism or a sex offender, there are only a certain number of specialist officers to go round," he said.The inquiry team found that the way the police, probation and other agencies kept track of sex offenders in the community was "poorly coordinated and inconsistent", with a lack of clarity and purpose on home visits by the police, and questions over the effectiveness of the sex offenders' register.The research, which looked at the handling of offenders in Norfolk, Gwent, Merseyside, West Yorkshire and Devon and Cornwall, also found staff failing to record adequately all their contact with sex offenders and the work they and other agencies had done. It criticised the failure to integrate the minutes of meetings of multi-agency public protection panels with police and probation records: "Some staff were retaining too much information in their heads that should have been recorded in agency files."There were also unacceptable delays in getting offenders on to accredited programmes, with some unable to get a job until they had completed a programme.Sir Ronnie said: "This inspection makes clear that the oversight of high and very high risk-of-harm cases by police officers and probation staff needs to be improved. This is challenging and important work."But Harry Fletcher of Napo, the probation officers' union, said the report failed to highlight good working practice."Last year just 0.6% of sex offenders who posed a high risk reoffended," he said. "There are clearly not enough staff working in this area, but it is an example of the police and probation working well together to protect the public."The Home Office also defended the current management of sex offenders, saying the multi-agency public protection arrangements had only been in place for five years but had already made a significant contribution to public safety.
