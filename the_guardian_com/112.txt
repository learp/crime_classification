The second new prisons minister has been appointed in two months, following a cabinet reshuffle in the wake of Clare Short's resignation.Paul Goggins, a parliamentary private secretary at the Home Office, has been appointed as minister for prisons and probation, replacing Hilary Benn who only took over the post in late March.Mr Benn has been promoted to minister of state at the Department for International Development.Although Mr Benn had ministerial responsibility for children and young people, it is unclear whether Mr Goggins will take on this remit, which includes overseeing the Children and Young People's Unit (CYPU).Sue Lewis, deputy director of the CYPU which was set up to ensure that government policy takes the needs of young people into account, said: "Although the minister for children and young people is a Home Office post, they also report to the education secretary, Charles Clarke and the two departments have yet to decide who will take over the brief." Mr Goggins is the MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, he is also secretary for the all party parliamentary group on poverty.He worked as a social worker for 15 years, mainly with young offenders, and was later a project director for the children's charity NCH Action for Children and the director of campaigning group Church Action on Poverty.
