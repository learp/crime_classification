Victims of crime will be given additional rights under legislation announced by the justice secretary, Chris Grayling, on Monday.The new law will require advocates to undergo specialist training before they are allowed to cross-examine witnesses in rape or sexual abuse trials.The outline of the regulations has been revealed before the main party political conference season, during which Labour is expected to outline additional measures to support victims.From next year, victims will gain the right to tell the court how their crime has affected them, according to the justice ministry. A nationwide information service for victims will also be set up and extra funds will be provided to improve "the court experience".Grayling said: "This government has already significantly improved services and support for victims, investing more than ever in the help they are offered, but we are also the first to acknowledge that more can, and should, be done."Our criminal justice system can be daunting, and victims, especially the most vulnerable, can find it traumatic and difficult to know where to turn to for advice and support. For the first time we will create a system that puts the highest emphasis on victims' needs and sets out their rights clearly in legislation. We are also making it easier for them to find whatever it is they need by establishing one simple source of information and help â€“ be it tracking the progress of their case, applying for compensation, knowing what to expect in court, or understanding the range of support available to them."The new law will also include: the right to make a personal statement and ask to have it read it aloud in court; automatic referral to support organisations; information about individual cases at each stage; and an assessment of victims' needs at the earliest opportunity.The proposal to require advocates to undergo specialist training in rape and sexual abuse follows the suicide of the musician Frances Andrade, who was giving evidence about her ordeal, during a trial in Manchester two years ago.
