It's six years since I first met Ronnie Biggs in Belmarsh prison. He was a pitiful sight. After three strokes he couldn't say a word. All he could do was tap out words painfully slowly on an alphabet board. He was bent double and dribbled, and fed liquid food through a tube inserted into his stomach. Biggs was 73 then, and the notion that he posed a threat to decent people was laughable.I visited him with his devoted son Michael over the period of a year. Communication didn't get easier, but I did feel I got to know the man. It was strange that he was known as one of the great train robbers because if there was one thing Biggs wasn't great at, it was robbing. He was a useless robber, and that's why his accomplices had never let him on the train in the first place.In his time, Biggs had been crude, dishonest and foolish, but he was the ulitmate likeable rogue. How the establishment resented him for laughing in their face – for doing a runner, for revelling in the sun and fun of Rio, for lifting up a flute of champagne on the beach and crowing: "Here's looking up the Queen's skirt."He was convinced that's why they wanted to keep him in jail – not for his crime, but because he had made a laughing stock of the great and the good. In that sense, he argued, he was a political prisoner. Was he repentant? He wished he hadn't been caught. Has he served his time? He's done eight years in this stretch alone, at a cost of more than £2,000 a day to the taxpayer.My abiding memory is of his smile. On one visit, he played in blissful silence with a toddler visiting his dad. The boy was captivated. When I asked Biggs why people liked him despite his crimes and misdemeanours, he spelled out the answer: "M.Y C.H.A.R.M."
