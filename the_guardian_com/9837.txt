Two men described as professional burglars yesterday admitted killing a meditation tutor after he caught them breaking into the college where he worked.Darren Botchett and Ian Richards, who between them have up to 100 convictions for theft, attacked Lawrence Hart, the father of two children, after he disturbed them during a burglary at Hawkwood College in Stroud, Gloucestershire.Botchett, who was sentenced for theft two days before the attempted burglary but given a community order, also admitted attacking the caretaker, John Jordan, at the college. After the hearing, police said Botchett and Richards led "chaotic lives" and were trying to burgle the college to feed drug habits.Botchett, 34, and Richards, 29, appeared at Bristol crown court facing a charge of murder.But Nicholas Atkinson QC, prosecuting, told the court the crown had accepted a plea of manslaughter because they could not be sure a jury would accept the pair intended to murder Mr Hart.He said it was clear that both men, whom he described as professional burglars, had set out on the day of the killing - August 18 last year - to break into the college, which runs courses in yoga, alternative healing and shamanism.The court heard that both men had a string of previous convictions and Botchett had been sentenced for theft two days before the attack. But he had been given a community order and released.Mr Justice Lloyd Jones adjourned sentencing for reports to be prepared but told the two men: "You must understand that you have pleaded guilty to very grave offences and a substantial period of imprisonment is inevitable."Outside court Detective Chief Inspector David Sellwood, who led the investigation, said that describing the pair as "professional" was misleading. "They are lifestyle criminals, chaotic drug users who commit crime to suit their drug habit."He said that both men, who are from Gloucester, had 40 to 50 convictions for theft.The pair were remanded in custody.
