This week barristers stood up in a London court and started to challenge an attempt by the authorities to keep under wraps a miscarriage of justice.At issue is the public's right to know if, and how, an undercover police operation has caused the wrongful conviction.At the heart of the controversy are allegations - described in court as "serious misconduct" - that a police spy gave false evidence under oath during the prosecution.The challenge has been launched by lawyers representing an environmental campaigner. The Guardian is also mounting a challenge.The story starts in the 1990s when the campaigner, John Jordan, was convicted of assaulting a police officer and unlawfully possessing a police helmet during a demonstration.He had been part of a group of protesters who had been prosecuted after they occupied a government office.Many years later, in 2011, it was revealed that an undercover officer, Jim Boyling, was among the group, as part of his five-year deployment pretending to be an activist. (Some background on Boyling can be found here and here).In October 2011, the Guardian and BBC's Newsnight published evidence indicating that the spy had concealed his real identity and role from the court when he had been prosecuted alongside Jordan and the others.It was alleged that from the moment he was arrested, he gave a false name and occupation, maintaining this fiction throughout the entire prosecution, even when he gave evidence under oath to barristers. These stories are here, here, here and here.Following these disclosures, Jordan's lawyer, Mike Schwarz from the civil liberties law firm Bindmans, argued that he had not had a fair trial because of the alleged involvement of the police spy.In July this year, the body responsible for investigating miscarriages of justice, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, announced that there was a real possibility that the conviction was unsafe and so he would be tried again in a fresh hearing. (Their announcement is here).But here's the nub of the matter - the CCRC decided that it was not going to disclose to Jordan the reasons for accepting his appeal, arguing that they were too "sensitive".Jordan and his lawyers have argued that it is unjust for him to be cleared, but not to be told why.On Wednesday, Matthew Ryder, his QC, told Southwark Crown Court that Jordan had a right to understand what had gone on his case.Guy Vassall-Adams, the barrister for the Guardian, argued that there was an important principle of open justice at stake and so the newspaper should also be given copies of the document outlining why the conviction was unsafe.Prosecutors announced that they were not going to contest Jordan's appeal and so the conviction will be quashed. In court, they gave no further explanation for their decisions.The judge, His Honour Judge McCreath, said he recognised the possible public interest in the case.However he added that he may not have the legal power to order disclosure of the reasons for the quashing of the conviction as prosecutors were not contesting the appeal.The judge decided to give both Jordan's lawyers and the Guardian the opportunity of making their case for disclosure at a hearing in the future.The case conforms to the desire of the authorities to throw a tight blanket of secrecy around the activities of the undercover spies. This secrecy is being challenged elsewhere - for example by the group of women suing the police (see here for arguments over why the police are wrong to claim that they can neither confirm nor deny the identities of their spies).
