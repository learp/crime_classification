The attorney general yesterday called on the courts to impose tougher sentences on men convicted of manslaughter for killing their partners.In three test cases, Lord Goldsmith asked the appeal court to increase the sentences, to send a message to judges that they were being too soft in domestic violence cases. David Perry, counsel for the attorney general, said that over the past decade a sentence of up to seven years had become "almost the norm no matter how exceptional the case or great the culpability of the offender". He told Lord Justice Mantell, Mr Justice Bell and Mr Justice Andrew Smith: "In the year 2002, for people to kill out of jealousy or possessiveness is no great mitigating factor, albeit that it may give someone a manslaughter verdict rather than one of murder." A sentence should properly reflect the loss of life, he argued. It should be comparable to those in cases of serious violence which did not end with death, such as attempted murder, which brings a sentence of up to 12 years with a guilty plea. Mr Perry asked for a sentence of six years for Darren Suratan, 35, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, who was jailed for three-and-a-half years last May after being convicted of the manslaughter of his partner. She suffered a haemorrhage following punches to the head. The barrister urged 10 years for solicitor Leslie Humes, 40, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, who was jailed for seven years last July after pleading guilty to manslaughter by reason of provocation. He stabbed his wife, Madeleine, after she told him she did not love him. Mark Wilkinson, 27, of Liverpool, who was convicted of manslaughter by reason of provocation and jailed for four years in September, should have been given six to seven years, said Mr Perry. Wilkinson said he lost his self-control and suffocated his ex-partner after she spoke of her plans to start a new life with a boyfriend. The court reserved its decision.
