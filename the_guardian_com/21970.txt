They were accompanied by his cousin Marcus Binns. The student died from his injuries in hospital six hours later.Taylor was asked yesterday by the court clerk, for the second time in two days: "How do you plead?" He said: "Guilty." Then he was asked: "You wish to change your plea?" and he nodded.The jury foreman formally returned a guilty verdict under the direction of the trial judge, Mr Justice Leveson.The judge discharged the jury from returning a verdict on Taylor on a charge of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm towards Mr Walker and his 17-year-old cousin.Members of the Walker family, including Anthony's mother, Gee Walker, were in court yesterday. Today, Michael Barton, 17, also from Huyton, will go on trial at the court facing a charge of murder. He has earlier pleaded not guilty.
