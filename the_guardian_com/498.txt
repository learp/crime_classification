Representatives of Madeleine McCann's family have spoken to an entertainment and media company about turning the story of her disappearance into a film.Clarence Mitchell, the spokesman for Gerry and Kate McCann, said the meeting with IMG before Christmas was positive, but that no deal had yet been signed.Talks on a lucrative film deal were held amid concern the £1.2m fund dedicated to finding the four-year-old, who vanished in Portugal last May, is rapidly running out.The family have hired a Spanish private detective agency on a £50,000 monthly retainer, and a widespread advertising campaign is adding to the bill."We have had a preliminary meeting with some producers and directors from IMG with a view to discussing an idea for a film. We've not agreed anything, we're not about to sign anything," Mitchell said. "We like the proposal, we thought it was fair, but there are others."The board of Madeleine's Fund is due to meet this week and will discuss the proposal. Mitchell said the film may have a "cinema feel", and would be key part of replenishing Madeleine's Fund."If in theory a large film were to be made our lawyers would make sure our commercial interests are protected," he said. "Madeleine's Fund is just over £1m. The money is going on investigators and advertising. It's dwindling. The money is going. I would imagine we've got a few months left. It's not going to last the year unless we get more money in."In addition to a film deal, Mitchell said it was a book deal was possible "at some point down the line", as part of efforts to find Madeleine.Mitchell said he was still being inundated with offers for interviews with the McCanns, but added: "They cannot get involved in anything personally until their status [as suspects under Portuguese law] is lifted."
