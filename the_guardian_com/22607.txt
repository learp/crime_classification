The number of rape cases referred to prosecutors by police has tumbled to its lowest in five years, prompting fears that victims are not being taken seriously as under-pressure officers cut corners.In the last financial year police forces sent 5,404 rape cases to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration â€“ more than 2,700 fewer than in 2010-11, CPS figures released by solicitor general Oliver Heald showed.The fall came despite a steady increase in the number of rapes reported to the police in England and Wales between 2008 and 2013, prompting shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry to voice concerns about pressures on officers.Thornberry, who uncovered the figures using a written parliamentary question, said rape victims' charities had told her cases were being dropped that could have been sent to the CPS. She added: "I think on the face of it this is a very worrying trend." The CPS is doing a lot of work on trying to improve the way in which they prosecute these cases and that is to be applauded, but if they are not being given the cases to prosecute you have to ask why that is. I don't know the answer to that. I do, though, know the police have been subjected to 20% cuts and they are difficult cases to prosecute, with vulnerable prosecution, witnesses that take a lot of time. I'm seriously concerned that there may be corners being cut.""The police are under huge pressure to produce results, to get convictions. Targeting cases that are easier to get convictions on, I can understand that. I don't know whether that is the case or not but I worry that it may be."I'm obviously in close contact with a lot of organisations that help victims and their view is that cases are being dropped that shouldn't be dropped."The charity Rape Crisis expressed fears that police may not be taking victims in historic abuse cases seriously at a time when public understanding of sexual violence and the number of victims coming forward is at a high level following the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal and subsequent police investigations.Katie Russell of Rape Crisis said what appears to be a decrease in justice for rape victims was "counter-intuitive" and undermined efforts by police forces to improve their handling of such cases.She said: "We are certainly across the country seeing anecdotally a rise in particularly survivors of what is sometimes referred to as historic abuse coming forward, either to the police or to support agencies like Rape Crisis."If that's translating into reduced referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service obviously our fear would be that so-called historical cases and particularly cases where adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse come forward are not being handled as well or sufficiently or taken as seriously as they might be."It seems really obtuse at this current moment which is almost unique arguably in terms of how much public awareness and understanding of sexual violence has been generated over the last year by media coverage of the Savile scandal and the subsequent Yewtree investigation and other similar cases."The crime prevention minister, Norman Baker, admitted he was concerned by the fall in number of CPS referrals.He said the government had already met the director of public prosecutions and police leaders and agreed to establish a CPS-police scrutiny panel to look at how forces are dealing with rape cases.Baker said: "Police reform is working and crime is down. However, I am determined to drive through the government's commitments to improve the criminal justice system's response to rape, to encourage more victims to seek help and to bring more perpetrators of these terrible crimes to justice and to push up level of convictions."The CPS figures were released by the solicitor general, Oliver Heald, in response to a parliamentary question from Thornberry.The steady decrease since 2011 comes despite the number of rape complaints recorded by the police increasing steadily from 13,096 in 2008-9 to 17,061 in 2012-13.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt, the national policing lead on adult sex offences for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: "The police service has worked hard to provide a victim-focused response to rape investigations and this work will continue."There have been significant improvements in the specialist training of officers, the introduction of early evidence kits, greater access to sexual assault referral centres, and increased partnership working with support groups."The fall in the number of rape or domestic abuse cases that police are reporting to the Crown Prosecution Service is a concern."Along with other chief officers I have met with the director of prosecutions and Home Office officials to discuss this issue."We have commissioned work so that we can understand why this fall in referrals has taken place and find the best way of tackling any issues that are identified; until this work really allows us to understand what these figures are telling us, it is unhelpful to speculate on the possible reasons behind this trend."
