The Suffolk murders trial heard today that one of the five victims went out to earn money as a prostitute on the day she disappeared because her boyfriend would not give her money for drugs.A prostitute identified only as Miss F told how she had been with victim Paula Clennell at the home of Clennell's boyfriend in Ipswich in the early hours of December 10."He would not give us any more money," Miss F told the trial of Steve Wright at Ipswich crown court."She [Paula] got a bit upset. She got a bit mad actually. She said 'I'll show him'. He thought a lot of her. They were close. She went out to work."Miss F said they then walked around Ipswich's red light area.Clennell stopped at a friend's house in London Road, Ipswich - where forklift truck driver Wright lived - and the two women parted."I left her there on the street. London Road," said Miss F.Prosecutor Peter Wright, QC, asked: "Did you ever see her again?""No," she replied and began to weep.The court heard that Clennell, whose body was the fourth to be found, was still alive when the remains of Anneli Alderton were discovered by a dog walker at 3.15pm on December 10.A man identified only as Mr J said he was with Clennell in Ipswich shortly after 4pm on December 10 2006. Her body was discovered in nearby Levington on December 12.Earlier in the trial, the prosecution said Clennell's body had not been "posed" and had "all the signs of having been hurriedly dumped".Steve Wright, 49, of Ipswich, Suffolk, denies murdering Clennell, 24, Alderton, 24, Gemma Adams, 25, Tania Nicol, 19, and Annette Nicholls, 29.Miss F told the jury that a "weird" man called Tom Stephens who had "been with" all five of the murdered women had been questioned by police after the discovery of the bodies."I spoke to Tom Stephens after he was released from the police station," she said. "He was concerned about the way he was treated."She said Stephens had talked about Nicol: "I remember him saying that she shaved her legs in his bath."He was "worried" because he feared DNA would be found on his sheets and in his bath, she said.Giving evidence on Tuesday, Nicol's mother Kerry told the court that, after her daughter went missing, she discovered she had called a man by the name of Tom Stephens before her disappearance.Kerry Nicol said she subsequently had a series of telephone conversations with him.The trial was adjourned until Monday.
