A sous chef has been convicted of murdering a boyfriend before carving, seasoning, frying and chewing parts of his body.Anthony Morley, 36, from Leeds, slashed Damian Oldfield's throat before stabbing him repeatedly and cutting off sections of thigh and chest flesh in April.Morley, a former Mr Gay UK, later walked into a takeaway wearing a bloodstained dressing gown and told staff he had killed someone because he tried to rape him.A jury at Leeds crown court took two hours and 20 minutes to find Morley guilty of what was described as a "terrible, horrific and bizarre" murder.During the two-week trial, the court heard how Morley removed sections of flesh, including a nipple, from Oldfield, a 33-year-old magazine advertising salesman.Morley denied murder on the grounds of provocation or diminished responsibility. He will be sentenced on Monday."Damian loved life and he has had that taken away from him in the cruellest of circumstances," Oldfield's mother, Denise, said after the verdict.
