Every long-haul passenger who flew British Airways or Virgin Atlantic in 2005 paid more than they would have done if the airlines had not been operating an illegal cartel, a London court heard yesterday.Senior BA executives "sidestepped the proper process" and colluded with Virgin Atlantic executives to secretly fix the price of fuel charges in an attempt to make hundreds of millions of pounds, Southwark crown court heard.BA's former commercial director, Martin George, sales and marketing director Andrew Crawley, former head of communications Iain Burns, and UK and Ireland sales chief Alan Burnett deny a cartel offence under the Enterprise Act 2002.Fuel surcharges were worth £64m a year to BA in 2004/5, but both airlines found them "difficult to sell to customers".In one internal email, Burns said "whatever the timing we will get a media pasting" over any increases, and added that their "corporate reputation will take a very big and negative hit" at a time when BA was already facing industrial action.Richard Latham QC, for the Office of Fair Trading, told the jury: "These defendants, and those at Virgin, sidestepped the proper process and simply agreed what would be done by both airlines."With oil prices rising and airlines struggling to cope in 2004, the criminal cartel began, according to Latham, when Burns called Virgin's director of corporate affairs, Paul Moore, on 6 August, telling him: "This is a conversation we aren't going to have."Latham said Burns told Moore that BA would announce an increase in its fuel charge on 9 August of "£6 to £8 a sector".Moore replied: "Don't be surprised if we follow."Latham continued: "The passing of the information from BA to Virgin enabled Virgin to assess in advance its reaction to the BA passenger fuel surcharge increase."It also enabled BA to gauge Virgin's reaction to their proposed increase."Earlier, Latham told the jury the "crucial element" was that of dishonesty in a secret price-fixing arrangement."No one complains because no one knew what was going on," he said. "But every single purchaser is a victim."He said the four defendants dishonestly agreed with Virgin Atlantic executives Paul Moore, William Boulter and Steven Ridgway to fix the price of fuel surcharges between 1 July 2004 and 20 April 2006.But he said the three Virgin executives blew the whistle on the criminal cartel in March 2006 and would be giving evidence for the prosecution in exchange for immunity – a "necessary evil" in order to mount the case.The case continues.
