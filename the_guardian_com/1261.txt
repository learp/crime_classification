Your article ('Honour' killing: pressure grows on UK to extradite suspect from Iraq, November 22) criticises the Crown Prosecution Service for our apparent failure to seek the extradition from Iraq of a person suspected of involvement in the brutal murder of Banaz Mahmod.The criticism is misplaced. The CPS is determined to do whatever we can to bring to justice all those involved in this horrific killing. We have been working closely with the Metropolitan police and other government departments to achieve this.The legal issues are highly complex, made more so by the political and constitutional changes that have occurred in Iraq in recent times. We have sought and continue to seek expert legal advice to assist us in our efforts. The moment we can make a formal request for extradition, we shall do so.
