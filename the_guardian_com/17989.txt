One of a group of men accused of planning a huge terror attack said they were "suicide bombers driving around ready to take on England", a court has been told.Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid and Ashik Ali, both 27, were covertly recorded by police in September last year pretending to be Formula One commentators covering a race, talking about overtaking drivers including English former champions Jensen Button and Nigel Mansell, Woolwich crown court heard.But in the middle of the conversation, as they drove a VW Passat through Birmingham with Ali's brother Bahadar, Khalid said: "It's the four suicide bombers driving around ready to take on England."Oh my God … take them out."At the time the three men on trial are alleged to have been planning and fundraising for a series of suicide bombs in an attack that could have been bigger than the 7 July 2005 atrocities.Brian Altman QC, prosecuting, told the jury: "There you have, in the middle of the conversation, Khalid, clearly in his mind, it's 'the four suicide bombers'."The court previously heard allegations that the trio, part of a group of 11 men of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin and one woman, posed as collectors for the Muslim Aid charity in order to collect thousands of pounds of donations from members of the public to fund the attack. But they also lost a large chunk of this money after gambling unsuccessfully on the foreign exchange markets.The court heard on Wednesday that they and an accomplice also applied for loans worth a total of £33,000 from two branches of Barclays bank in Birmingham to boost their funds.The court heard that Ashik Ali tried to get £15,000 from one branch by claiming he was starting a double-glazing business.Altman added: "There, Ali was overheard by a surveillance officer who was inside the bank claiming dishonestly that he was registering a double glazing company called 'A Ali', which he told the personal adviser had started trading on the previous Friday."On another occasion, the court heard, they were recorded talking about Abu Bakr, also known as Ahmed Faraz. He was convicted of terrorism offences including distributing terrorist publications from the Muktabah bookshop in Birmingham and possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.Naseer, Khalid and Ali are accused of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, which they deny.Naseer is accused of five counts of the offence, Khalid four and Ali three, all between Christmas Day 2010 and 19 September last year.For Naseer, from Sparkhill, Khalid, from Sparkbrook, and Ali, from Balsall Heath – all in Birmingham – this is alleged to have included planning a bombing campaign, collecting money for terrorism and recruiting others for terrorism.Naseer and Khalid are also accused of travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism, and it is alleged that Naseer also helped others to travel to the country for the same purpose.Members of the Muslim community were putting pressure on the three men after finding out they were sending people to Pakistan for terror training, the court heard.Three out of four men sent to the country came home early after their families and a community leader known as "Jimmy" intervened and one relative, the court heard, even threatened to kill Naseer for his alleged role in the pipeline.The court heard that Naseer, fearing the news would reach police, devised a cover story.The case continues.
