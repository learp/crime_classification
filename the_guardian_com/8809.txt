Please visit this page for full coverage.The Moors murderer Ian Brady has applied to be transferred from Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, to an ordinary prison. The 75-year-old has been on hunger strike for more than a decade and is force-fed through a tube. This does not happen in ordinary prisons without the person's consent so the move would effectively allow Brady to starve himself to death, without intervention.Brady and the late Myra Hindley were jailed for the abduction and murder of five children, aged between 10 and 17, on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester between 1963 and 1965.The hearing is being held at Ashworth but relayed to a court in Manchester.
