The father of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence yesterday accused the last Tory government of hiding the truth about his son's death.Directly crediting Labour with the progress that had been made in finding out "some of the truth", Neville Lawrence warned that the alternative to a Labour government was a return to the days when people were denied "any kind of decent living". Speaking without notes, and often close to tears, he told a hushed conference hall: "When my son was killed, the people in power - and I don't have to call their names - did everything in their power to stop us learning the truth. We had to expose ourselves to danger in order to do this, but thanks to the Labour party we were able to find out some of the truth."
