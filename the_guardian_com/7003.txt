Only 965 arrests were made as a result of 200,444 stop and searches conducted under counter-terrorism powers by police across Britain in the 12 months to September 2009, according to Home Office figures publishedtoday .The total for stops carried out under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which does not require any grounds for suspicion, represents a 12% fall over the previous 12 months.Home Office officials said the 0.5% arrest rate for counter-terrorism stops compared with an 11% arrest rate for stops conducted under ordinary police powers.More than 97% of the encounters between police and public were carried out by the Metropolitan and British Transport police.The Met's use of the counter-terrorism powers appears to have halved since March 2009, from between 43,000 and 54,000 stops every 3 months, to between 22,000 and 27,000.The number is expected to fall further after a Met change of policy to carry out counter-terrorism searches in selected sensitive areas, rather than at random across London.Police suffered a blow last month when the European court of human rights ruled that using the powers was illegal if there were no grounds for suspecting a crime was being committed. The home secretary, Alan Johnson, is seeking to appeal against the judgment.The figures show that the proportion of people describing themselves as black or black British stopped under section 44 remains unchanged at 10%, with those defining themselves as Asian or British Asian at 15%, and those of mixed ethnicity at 2%.Latest Home Office statistics on terrorism arrests and outcomes show that 201 people were arrested in the year to September 2009, compared with 178 the previous year. A third of the 201 arrested – 66 people – were charged and 96 released without charge. Alternative action, such as deportation or mental health treatment, was taken against the remaining 39. Of the 66 charged, only 24 were directly charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offences as defined by the police. The remaining 42 were charged with non-terrorist offences.There were 29 terrorism trials during the period, of which 86% ended in a conviction. There are currently 132 terrorist prisoners in British jails.
