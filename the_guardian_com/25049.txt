A father who killed his two young children in a bath pleaded guilty to their murders today.Perry Samuel, 35, suffocated Caitlin, five, and Aiden Samuel, three, at the family home in Bodelwyddan, north Wales, on November 5 last year.He was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 35 years before being considered for parole.Samuel, who suffers from manic depression, appeared at Mold Crown Court where he admitted murdering the two youngsters, described by their family as "little angels".The children's mother, Sarah Graham, was at a pop concert in Manchester with a group of friends when Samuel murdered their children.Earlier that day he took Caitlin and Aiden to McDonald's as a treat before returning home for their routine Sunday evening bath before bedtime.At 11pm Samuel calmly called 999 and told operators "there's a problem with the children".Two officers arrived at the red brick terrace house in Coronation Close and found the children lying in the bath.They were taken to nearby Glan Clwyd Hospital where they died within an hour.A post mortem examination revealed they had both died as a result of asphyxiation after their airways were deliberately blocked. The pathologist also found Caitlin had suffered compression to her neck.Perry was arrested and questioned by police for three days but refused to acknowledge he had killed his own children or give any reason why.
