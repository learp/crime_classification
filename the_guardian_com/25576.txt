The family of the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium two years ago, have finally been given the keys to their house after the property was declared free of contamination.Litvinenko's widow, Marina, and son, Anatoli, who have been staying in a safe house since the murder, were told by Haringey council that it was safe to return to the house in Muswell Hill, north London. The former KGB agent was a political refugee, and a fierce and public critic of Vladimir Putin.Litvinenko died after drinking tea laced with the rare toxic isotope polonium-210 during a meeting at a West End hotel with two Russian businessmen in November 2006. He became seriously ill, inadvertently contaminating everything he touched, and died in hospital three weeks later. He had claimed that the Russian secret service was responsible for silencing him. After tests the Metropolitan police announced in December that it was treating his death as murder. It was the first known use of polonium, which is manufactured in nuclear reactors, as a poison.Experts found most traces of the polonium-210 isotope decayed naturally and little clean-up work was needed.Nilgun Canver, a Haringey councillor, said: "Scientists from the Health Protection Agency have monitored the radiation levels at the property and have advised that the property has been adequately decontaminated and the restrictions can be withdrawn. Much of the contamination found in earlier surveys has naturally decayed in the intervening time, so only minimal further remediation work has been necessary."
