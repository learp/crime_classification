Five members of an organised crime gang who brought women from Hungary to the UK to work as prostitutes have been jailed.The Hungarians Mate Puskas, Zoltan Mohacsi, Istvan Toth and Peter Toth, and Puskas's former girlfriend Victoria Brown, from Bognor, West Sussex, brought at least 44 women into the country over almost two years, setting them up in hotels and flats, including at the University of Sussex campus, and uploading their profiles on to a website which advertised sexual services for sale, the court was told.The defendants, including the Toth brothers, from Eastbourne, who are on the run and were sentenced in their absence, were found guilty of conspiring to traffic women into the UK for sexual exploitation after a seven-week trial at Hove crown court.Judge Richard Hayward told the remaining three defendants they had behaved in a way that "society finds repugnant".Puskas, from Croydon, was jailed for six years, Brown for three years, and Mohacsi, from Ilford, east London, for four years for conspiracy to traffic women into the UK.Istvan and Peter Toth were jailed for five years and four years respectively for the same offence, but both had nine months added to their sentences after being convicted of contempt of court for breaking bail.Hayward said the women, some of them barely adults, were brought into the country and put up in hotels and flats in East Sussex, Kent, Gatwick, Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff and Glasgow.Adverts were placed on an adult website offering sexual services including unsafe sex and extreme sexual acts and the charges were fixed, he continued.One woman who was sent back to Hungary because she was underage was forced to work in Austria and Germany as a prostitute to pay back her airfare to the UK, he said.Customers who were using the women thought they were texting them directly, when in reality they were texting the defendants who fixed times and charges, and decided where and how long the women would work for, he told the court.Puskas, 26, was told that even though he was younger than his co-conspirators he had "business acumen" and was undoubtedly at the heart of the operation.The judge said: "You were at the centre of the conspiracy and very much in control. This conspiracy was an extension of your career, which you had already chosen."Brown, 25, was described by Hayward as a "loyal lieutenant" to Puskas, who was drawn skilfully into the operation by her boyfriend over a period of time.She wept as he told her she had run an unattractive defence of duress, seeking to blame her actions on Puskas, the father of her 21-month-old son.He said: "It is very sad to see you in the dock. You are intelligent, you come from a respectable family, you had a good job, and you threw it all away for Mate Puskas."Nicholas Hamblin, representing Brown, told the court she had performed "secretarial activities" and "was acting to a certain extent under pressure".Hamblin added that she had made no personal gain from the trafficking and that loans of £21,000 taken out on behalf of Puskas had left her bankrupt.The court was told that Mohacsi, 36, was one of the middle conspirators whose common-law wife and sister-in-law both worked as prostitutes in Hungary and the UK.Hugh Mullan, mitigating on his behalf, said: "He preyed upon an economically deprived area of Hungary. It [prostitution] was rife in that area and he did not create the rifeness of that situation."His wife was an active prostitute and carried on after he was taken into custody. She is heavily pregnant and due to give birth to their first son in February."The court also heard from barristers representing 35-year-old Istvan Toth and his brother Peter.Aleksander Lloyd, representing 28-year-old Peter Toth, said he was not considered to be one of the leading actors in the case and that he had been referred to as the "gentleman pimp" by the prosecution because he acted with kindness and courtesy to some of the women involved.During the trial, jurors heard that many of the women had come to the UK to escape financial difficulties at home. Their flights were paid for by the defendants and the debts were used as a hold over the women, who were forced to work for up to 12 hours a day.The prosecutor David Walbank told the court that the women were seeing up to 15 men a day and charging £100 an hour.He said many of the women were victims of financial extortion, left with only 10% of their daily earnings while the defendants took the rest.Threats and force were used as forms of coercion and one woman was told that posters would be put up in her home town telling people about what she was doing if she did not comply, Walbank said.
