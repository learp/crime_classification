A former police officer who stabbed his estranged wife to death at her high street hair salon has been found guilty of murder.Ivan Esack, 38, knifed Natalie Esack, 33, up to 11 times in front of her horrified colleague because he claimed he could not cope with her being with someone else.The 8in (20cm) blade bent and the tip broke off under the ferocity of the attack at Esack Hair and Beauty in High Street, Ashford, Kent, on 30 April last year.Esack then turned to the colleague, Chelsea Ford, then 17, and said: "She deserved it, the bitch."In the period before the killing, he had told Mrs Esack she was a "dead woman walking" and added: "Tick tock, tick tock."At Maidstone crown court, the former detective constable with Kent police turned aspiring football agent, was found guilty of murder after seven hours of deliberation following a three-week trial.Esack, of Rosewood Drive, Ashford, declined to give evidence at the trial and had admitted manslaughter, claiming his responsibility was diminished and that he was suffering from a mental condition. Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said Esack was a "violent and controlling" man who, unable to deal with the separation, killed his estranged wife "because he didn't want her to be with anyone else".Esack bought the knife from a Sainsbury's store in Ashford moments before he stabbed Mrs Esack for starting a relationship with Justin Khadaroo after they split up.After buying the blade, CCTV footage showed him parking his car before he walked to the hair salon the couple set up in January 2008.He made sure she was working that day by earlier telephoning the salon and asking Ford, now aged 18, for the time of her first appointment.
