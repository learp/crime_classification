A man found stabbed to death near a Swindon cycle path was subjected to a "horrendous and frenzied" attack, police have said.The cyclist, in his 60s, was discovered by a passerby lying by an underpass 100 yards from the Wiltshire town's railway station, close to an industrial estate, shortly before midnight on Thursday.Police said there was no apparent motive and nothing to suggest the victim, said to be local, knew his attacker. Police have not released his identity and next of kin were being informed.Appealing for witnesses, Det Chief Insp Sean Memory, said: "It is an horrendous scene – the victim stood no chance. It would appear he suffered multiple stab wounds across the whole of his body.""There is no motive apparent for this murder and I'm very open-minded about what has taken place – but it was an extremely vicious attack that has taken place overnight."No weapons have been recovered.Extra officers were drafted in to patrol Swindon as the public were warned to be vigilant and take particular care.Police believe the attacker may have been injured due to the ferocity of the attack."I am convinced somebody knows who is responsible," said Memory. "It is likely they may have had blood on their clothing or received an injury during the attack and could be acting suspiciously either last evening or today".The cycle path, between Rodbourne and Swindon town centre, begins close to Swindon railway station and runs to the Oasis leisure centre. It was described as a busy route, and it was possible people had cycled past the dead man without realising his body was lying there. Anyone who used the route on Thursday evening to midnight, or who may have any information, was urged to contact police on 101.Supt Andrew Carr warned the public to avoid walking home at night, use well-lit routes and contact police if they see or suspect anything suspicious.
