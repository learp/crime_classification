Two gunmen have been jailed for life for the murder of a man who was caught in their crossfire. Rickel Adams, 27, will spend at least 35 years in prison while Shakah Anderson, 31, will serve a minimum of 32 years.The victim, Rico Gordon, 21, was shot in the head after being caught in a shoot-out between Adams and Anderson and a third, unidentified gunman. Three other people suffered bullet wounds when violence spread to the streets of Bristol last year, after the St Paul's Carnival.Bristol crown court heard Gordon died after a row between two rival groups from north-west London in the Black Swan pub, in Easton, on 3 July. Adams, from Neasden, London, and Anderson, of no fixed address, were convicted by a jury after a five-week trial. They were also convicted of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.Adams was also found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to passers-by Isabell Brant and Hezekiah Davies â€“ who were caught up in the gunfight. Jailing the pair, Mrs Justice Sharp said: "Gun crime has no place on the streets of Bristol and it has no place anywhere in a civilised society."At least 21 shots were fired by three gunmen; four people shot and one of them dead and two seriously injured. It is pure luck that more death and injury did not happen."She said it was unclear what sparked the confrontation in the Black Swan but it developed into a "very ugly incident" of verbal abuse and threats of guns being used."The shocking nature of what happened next leaves me in no doubt that Anderson and Adams intended to kill," the judge said.
