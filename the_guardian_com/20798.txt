The father of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence yesterday delivered his verdict on the inquiry into the police investigation by accusing the Metropolitan police of ignoring the lessons to be learned from his son's death.Neville Lawrence warned that if there were no changes to the way the police dealt with the black community, "people are going to turn more to violence."Speaking on the final day of the first part of the inquiry, Mr Lawrence referred to the case of Michael Menson, the black musician who died after being found engulfed in flames in a north London street in February last year.Police initially thought he had tried to commit suicide despite his claims of being attacked. This week an inquest jury found he had been unlawfully killed and Mr Menson's family accused the police of racism.Mr Lawrence said that this showed black families were not being listened to and nothing had changed since his son's death in April 1993. Stephen was stabbed to death on a street in south London by a gang of white racists, none of whom have been convicted.Mr Lawrence said he had been particularly disappointed with the closing submissions this week of counsel for the three superintendents in the original 1993 murder investigation.Sonia Woodley, QC, accused Mr Lawrence and his wife, Doreen, as well as their solicitor, Imran Khan, of hindering the police investigation and being partly responsible for the breakdown of family liaison."She was more or less not accepting things that had been given in evidence in the last 59 days," said Mr Lawrence. "For people to start to do anything about problems, they have to accept they have failed in order to make changes."If they're not doing that at all, the time we have spent here going into evidence will be a waste of time and money."Closing the session, the inquiry chairman, Sir William Macpherson of Cluny, said that some of the evidence that been heard had been "searing".He paid tribute to Mr and Mrs Lawrence and also to Stephen's friend, Duwayne Brooks, saying it must have been an "extraordinary experience" to have to relive events of the last five years.Earlier, Ian Macdonald, QC, on behalf of Mr Brooks, 23, said that the Met was still in denial over racism in the force.He said that Mr Brooks, a key eyewitness, had been racially stereotyped and the Crown Prosecution Service had tried to criminalise him.Mr Brooks was still suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome because of the racist way in which he was handled, Mr Macdonald said. "His life has been shattered."Mr Brooks picked out two of the five suspects in identification parades. But his evidence was fatally undermined when a police sergeant claimed that Mr Brooks told him he had been tipped off by friends about their appearance.The evidence of Sergeant Christopher Crowley led the Crown Prosecution Service to discontinue the case against the five.At the private prosecution trial of three of the suspects in 1996, the judge ruled Mr Brooks' account inadmissable. The trial then collapsed.Mr Macdonald claimed that Sergeant Cowley "was either lying about or misunderstood much of what Duwayne Brooks said to him."Next week, part two of the inquiry starts into the lessons to be learned for the investigation and the prosecution of racially motivated crimes.Sir William's report is expected at the end of the year.
