A lorry driver who crushed a cyclist while chatting on his mobile phone with "the most godawful hangover" was today jailed for seven years and disqualified from driving for life.Dennis Putz, 51, was over the legal drink-drive limit when he hit City public relations director Catriona Patel as he accelerated away from traffic lights outside Oval tube station in south London in June last year.Putz has a series of criminal convictions for offences including drink-driving and has been caught 20 times driving an HGV while disqualified. He said the night before the accident he had drunk almost a gallon of Guinness.Putz claimed he did not realise he had run over Patel, who had been wearing high-visibility gear. He also failed to check special HGV mirrors intended to help drivers see street-level pedestrians and cyclists near to the cab, Inner London Crown Court heard. He only stopped when pedestrians began hammering on his cab door.Putz admitted causing death by careless driving and making a call on his mobile phone at the time of the accident, which was captured on CCTV, but insisted he was using a hands-free kit. He pleaded not guilty to dangerous driving, but at today's trial he was found guilty of the more serious charge.Jonathan Polnay, prosecuting, said Putz was breath-tested 80 minutes after the crash, returning a reading of 39mcg in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mcg.He said: "A forensic scientist has concluded that at the time of the crash, his alcohol breath reading was likely to have been 49 micrograms – 50% over the drink-drive limit."Putz denied drinking that morning but said he had consumed seven pints of Guinness the previous day, stopping at about 9pm.Polnay dismissed the claim, saying the prosecution had calculated that his reading "should have been zero" if this was the full extent of his drinking."He either had a great deal more to drink that night or he had something to drink that morning," he said."Whilst this was an accident, we say this was an accident waiting to happen and an accident caused almost entirely by Mr Putz's dangerous driving."We say he must have known that he should not be behind the wheel of a tipper truck."Sentencing him today, judge Roger Chapple told Putz: "Since your first disqualification 34 years ago you have shown a consistent disregard for road traffic legislation and the law."Prison sentences in the past have not persuaded you to mend your ways. Plainly you should never be allowed behind the wheel of an HGV again. The risk to the public is just too great."The judge said Putz had made an "extraordinarily irresponsible decision to climb into to the cab of a heavy goods vehicle with, let's be frank, the most godawful hangover, knowing full well he should not have been driving at all."When she died, Patel, a director at public relations firm Citigate Dewe Rogerson, was in training with her husband, Anish, to take part in the L'Étape du Tour, a cycling event in which amateur cyclists follow a route of the Tour de France.• This article was amended on 19 November 2010 to clarify the charge on which Dennis Putz was found guilty.
