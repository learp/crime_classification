Crime and the fear of crime, particularly by children, is a major concern of the government and public alike. Yet statistics tell us that youth crime has declined by almost 21% since 1992. Evidence also indicates that children in the criminal justice system come from the poorest and most disadvantaged communities.We also know that more than 88% of children who receive a custodial sentence will reoffend within two years, indicating that putting children in prison does not work. Yet over the last decade there has been an 800% rise in the number of under-15s sentenced to detention. Shape - children's lives and the youth crime debate - is launched today by five children's charities and a crime-reduction charity to challenge current beliefs about youth crime. Shape, funded by the Esme Fairbairn Foundation, wants the public to know that most young people do not commit crime; that dealing with the causes of child neglect and abuse will help to address the causes of youth crime; that working together to help communities build safer environments will help prevent crime; and that providing support for community penalties will reduce offending. Sending children to the potentially damaging environment of custody should be an absolute last resort. It is time to change the way we respond to children in trouble.
