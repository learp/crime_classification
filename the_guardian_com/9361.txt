A UK centre to tackle the growing problem of sexual slavery and help victims will be opened this year, the Home Office minister, Vernon Coker, said today.The announcement was made at a London conference marking the end of Operation Pentameter, a taskforce launched in February to trace women and girls trafficked for sex.Pentameter led to 84 people - including a 14-year-old African girl who had been discarded when she became pregnant - being rescued.Police raided more than 500 brothels, massage parlours and private homes in the UK and Ireland, leading to 232 arrests and 132 charges. Twelve girls aged between 14 and 17 were rescued.Mr Coker said the UK Human Trafficking Centre, which will be based in Sheffield, would include police, lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency. It will also provide counselling to victims."Sexual slavery is taking place nearly 200 years after the abolition of the slave trade," Mr Coker said."It is happening here, in the UK, in the cities, in our towns, in our villages. It could even be happening in your street. The women harmed by this are real people, real victims."Grahame Maxwell, the deputy chief constable of South Yorkshire, told conference delegates that the huge number of women trafficked into the UK was causing a rapid fall in the price of sexual intercourse.In two years, prices had fallen from between £50 and £60 to between £40 and £50. Mr Maxwell said prices for newly-trafficked women were as high as £8,000, particularly if the girl was young and a virgin."It is awful to talk about people as commodities, but that is how they are viewed by trafficking gangs," he said.Most of the girls discovered by Pentameter were from African nations, and around half were pregnant.A government consultative paper on how to deal with human trafficking, published by the Home Office today, called for the centre to provide support for victims.The paper, which included the views of around 200 community members and organisations, found overwhelming consensus that victims of human trafficking should be allowed to stay in the UK.
