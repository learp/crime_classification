The Royal College of Nursing has called on the government to decriminalise prostitution to protect the health of vulnerable women and men who feel unable to access NHS and social services.After an impassioned debate yesterday, the RCN's annual congress in Harrogate voted by a majority of more than four to one for a change in the criminal law.Union officials said they would begin urgent consultations with police, local authorities and voluntary bodies about how best to halt prosecutions for soliciting, advertising or running a brothel.Andrea Spyropoulos, a Liverpool nurse, said the resolution was not about the moral issues of prostitution and did not imply that nurses condoned sex trafficking, grooming or coercion of vulnerable people.About 95% of street prostitutes had a history of drug abuse, delegates heard. Many entered the profession under 18 because they were vulnerable. They were reluctant to access healthcare through the normal routes because they were regarded as people operating outside the law."Be bold. Be daring. Be caring and support decriminalisation," she said.The original motion, proposed by Mrs Spyropoulos, called for legalisation of prostitution. But this was amended after delegates objected to anything that might be thought to legitimise intimidation by pimps.Maura Buchanan, the RCN deputy president, said: "Stop making criminals out of prostitutes and instead target the men who abuse them."Princess Morufu, a London nurse, said legalisation of a dangerous activity was not the answer. "As nurses we should be looking into ways to prevent more people getting into prostitution and alleviate the circumstances that make women and young people vulnerable to being forced into it," she added.Delegates voted by 355 votes to 83 in favour of decriminalisation, with 21 abstentions.Steve Jamieson, the RCN's coordinator of professional nursing, said prostitutes suffered from poor health, including sexually transmitted infections, ulcers, poor dentistry and lack of social care for their children as well as themselves."We will begin to engage with other organisations to ensure these women and men feel they can come forward to access better care," he added.The conference was told that Liverpool council has proposed a managed zone for prostitutes in an effort to reduce curb crawling and awaits a response from the government. The Scottish executive has started a review of the legal, policing, health and social issues raised by prostitution in Scotland.
