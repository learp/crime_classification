A prison chaplain has been suspended after admitting smoking crack cocaine. The Rev Robert Pearson, 54, a Church of England priest at Pentonville jail in north London, was secretly filmed visiting a crack den.A report in yesterday's Daily Mirror said that when confronted by mobile phone footage showing him heating the highly addictive drug before inhaling it from a pipe, Mr Pearson confessed: "It's true. I can't make any excuses. It's a stupid sodding thing to do. I just want to say sorry to my family. They know nothing about this."The father of two insisted he was not addicted, but it would be "hard to stop".A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "A member of the chaplaincy at HMP Pentonville has been suspended following allegations of inappropriate behaviour."According to the Mirror, Mr Pearson took the drug at a housing association flat in Wood Green, north-west London. He told the paper he had first tried it after chatting to a user in Soho. "It was a spur of the moment thing but very enjoyable. Part of it was trying to understand what was going on for the people who take it. But I don't want to make excuses."The clergyman, who befriended the troubled rock singer Pete Doherty when the star spent 13 nights in Pentonville in January for drugs offences, now faces the sack and could lose his prison-owned home. But he said he was glad his secret had been exposed. "This has been a wake-up call. It's a relief it's out in the open. I'm not going to let crack destroy me."Mr Pearson moved to work at Pentonville four years ago after a post at Wandsworth jail in south London.The Rt Rev Stephen Oliver, the Bishop of Stepney, said: "We will take steps to ensure that he and his family receive support."
