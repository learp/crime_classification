Scotland's most senior judge has accused the country's chief prosecutor of attacking the independence and reputation of the judiciary, in an unprecedented row over the collapse of a double murder trial this month.Lord Hamilton, the lord justice general, yesterday claimed that Elish Angiolini, who as lord advocate oversees the Scottish prosecution system, was putting the rule of law at "serious risk" after she openly criticised a judge's decision to stop the World's End murder trial.The row between Scotland's two most senior legal figures follows a statement by the lord advocate to the Scottish parliament two weeks ago defending her department's handling of the case against Angus Sinclair, who was accused of raping and killing two young women nearly 30 years ago. His trial for the murders - named after the World's End pub in Edinburgh's Old Town where Helen Scott and Christine Eadie, both 17, were last seen alive - was brought to a halt by the trial judge, Lord Clarke, after he ruled there was insufficient evidence against Sinclair.His decision caused political and legal uproar. Sinclair is serving life sentences for murdering and raping another 17-year-old, Mary Gallagher, in 1978, and rapes and assaults on 11 boys and girls in the 1970s. The chief prosecutor, advocate depute Alan Mackay, briefly went missing after the case collapsed.In her statement to MSPs, Mrs Angiolini dismissed criticisms of Mr Mackay's handling of the case and said she was of the "clear opinion" that the crown had presented enough evidence to put to the jury - an open criticism of the trial judge.Yesterday, Lord Hamilton said Mrs Angiolini should have made her concerns known in private: "Public criticism in a political forum of particular decisions, especially in controversial and sensitive areas, is in my view inappropriate."Claiming that he was speaking "on behalf of the senior judiciary", he said judges were required to remain "reticent" about their decisions and could not defend themselves in public.In a letter to Mrs Angiolini, the lord justice general insisted the lord advocate had to publicly respect a judge's decision. "If such respect is not afforded, the independence of the judiciary as the final arbiter of legal issues is put at risk," he wrote.Mrs Angiolini rejected Lord Hamilton's complaints yesterday. With nearly unanimous backing from political parties and Alex Salmond, the first minister, the lord advocate said she had clearly defended the independence of the judiciary in her statement and Lord Clarke's right to make his decision.But the controversy surrounding Sinclair's acquittal and widespread attacks on her department's handling of the case meant she was obliged to make a statement. She had chosen her words "with great care", she added.
