1 Nearly three weeks ago, Mr Bond, 72, and his wife Audrey, set off to South Africa for a wine tasting holiday.2 He is questioned by airport officials on his arrrival in Cape Town.3 A few days later, he is arrested at a KwaZulu Natal holiday village on suspicion of a multi-million dollar telemarketing scam in the US.4 A photograph of a man bearing a resemblance to Mr Bond, circulated in March last year, appears on the Interpol website. He is named as Derek Bond, alias Derek Lloyd Sykes, and is described as 1.77 metres tall (about 5ft 10ins), weighing 160lb and having blue eyes and a toupee. His date of birth is listed as January 26 1931.5 Mr Bond's family protest that he must be the victim of stolen identity. They say the Interpol photograph is not of Mr Bond, and call the charges against him "ludicrous". Among many discrepancies, the description says his hair is blond or brown, while Mr Bond has had grey hair for the last 20 years. He has also never worn a toupee. 6 The FBI and the US embassy do not bother interviewing Mr Bond or taking his photograph for 17 days after his arrest, according to the family7 Mr Bond denies the charges but on legal advice he agrees to be extradited to the US in the hope of clearing his name.8 Last night, an anonymous caller with a British accent leaves a message with the FBI, naming the real suspect and saying: "I think you have got the wrong man in South Africa". 9 After the tip-off, FBI agents in Las Vegas arrest a man identified as Robert James Grant, who admits that his real name is Derek Lloyd Sykes.10 British diplomats say the arrest in Las Vegas came only as a result of the intense media reports of Mr Bond's detention and circulation of the real fugitive's picture. 11 The US attorney's office apologises to Mr Bond and say he is not the man they want. They say he is the victim of identity theft. 12 In the early hours of this morning, Mr Bond is informed by a phone call from the BBC that he is a free man.
