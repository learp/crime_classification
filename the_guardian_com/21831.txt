Two men who ran over and killed a holidaymaker in a failed carjacking attempt outside Liverpool John Lennon Airport were each sentenced to seven-and-a-half years' detention yesterday.Michael Howard, 57, from Hesketh Bank, near Preston, died after he was run over by his Volvo car in front of his wife, Elaine, in January. The company director was unloading luggage from the boot of his car as he and his wife were preparing to catch a flight to Malaga. Dean Taylor, a 17-year-old of no fixed address, jumped into the driver's seat and attempted to drive off. Mr Howard tried to stop the vehicle from being stolen, but it hit him and trapped him beneath the wheels. Taylor pleaded guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing at Liverpool crown court. His accomplice, 21-year-old Craig Abbott, had also pleaded guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing. A third man, Neil Dolan, 20, admitted con spiracy to steal and was sentenced to four years' detention. Merseyside police believe they had been stealing luxury cars from Cheshire and Merseyside for some time. Thirty minutes before Mr Howard was killed, they attempted to steal a Volvo estate from a driveway in nearby Halewood. Detective Chief Inspector Ian Mulcahey, of Merseyside police, said he believed Taylor had been involved in a similar airport robbery involving the racing driver David Coulthard's family in December 2003. Mr Mulcahey said: "We believe the gang had previous successes at the airport." He described Dean Taylor as "sneering" in court and showing "no remorse for what he had done". Elaine Howard said: "They are only young lads - one of them is the same age as my son. "Up until I saw them in court, I felt quite sorry for them. But my feelings are not the same now."
