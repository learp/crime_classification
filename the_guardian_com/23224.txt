Prosecutors admitted they would face an uphill struggle to bring a case against Ray Gosling for smothering his dying boyfriend with a pillow because they do not have the victim's name or body. If the homicide detectives of Nottinghamshire police force can overcome the veteran presenter's current refusal to provide these details when they interview him, then prosecutors might be able to start assembling a case.Depending on the facts that emerge, the case could go in one of two directions. Prosecutors could mount a murder or manslaughter case if Gosling's actions were considered to be euthanasia, which means taking someone's life, as opposed to helping them to take their own life. If it was regarded as assisted suicide, the case could be brought under the Suicide Act 1961, which has made assisted suicide a criminal offence under British law for nearly half a century, attracting a jail term of up to 14 years.Depending on the facts of the matter, the Gosling case has the potential to be affected by the current upheaval in the implementation of this latter law.Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, is finalising changes to the list of factors which determine whether someone should be prosecuted. It is seen as significant guidance for prosecutors which pro-euthanasia campaigners hope will provide clarity for people considering asking loved ones to help them die.Starmer is producing the guidelines following a House of Lords ruling in the case of Debbie Purdy, a Bradford woman with progressive multiple sclerosis who wanted to know if her husband, Omar Puente, would face prosecution if he accompanied her to Dignitas, the Swiss euthanasia clinic where she wishes to die if her condition worsens. Following her high-profile case, the law lords ordered Starmer to set out under what circumstances prosecutions are most likely, to help people like Purdy and Puente.Last September he published interim guidelines. He said prosecutors should favour prosecution if, among other things, the victim is under 18; has a mental illness or learning difficulty which might affect their capacity to make a decision; did not have a settled wish to kill themselves and did not express unequivocally their wish to do so; and did not have a terminal illness.On the other hand, the public interest factors against a prosecution include evidence that there was no possibility of recovery from the illness; the victim asked personally on his or her own initiative for the assistance of the suspect; the suspect was wholly motivated by compassion; and the suspect was the spouse, partner or a close relative or close personal friend of the victim, within the context of a long-term relationship. Gosling has referred to the man he killed as "a bit on the side" and not his long-term boyfriend.The guidelines have been out to public consultation since 23 September and will be finalised next month.A spokesman for Care Not Killing, a group opposed to the legalisation of assisted suicide and euthanasia, said: "Any such changes will increase the incidence of cases where vulnerable and terminally ill people are preyed upon. We have seen that happen in cases around the world."
