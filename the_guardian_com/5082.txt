The murder rate in England and Wales has fallen from 644 to 619 over the last year to its lowest level for 12 years.Official Home Office figures published today also show that overall crime fell 5% according to the British Crime Survey and by 7% according to police figures in the year to September 2010.The latest set of quarterly crime figures suggest that the sustained long-term trend in the fall of crime since 1995 by more than 45% has continued despite the economic recession and the accelerating rise in unemployment.The fall in the murder rate in the 12 months to September 2010 was accompanied by a 9% fall in gun crime and a 6% fall in knife offences. The 619 deaths recorded on the homicide index was the lowest since the 606 murders in 1997/98. In 2009/10 , 421 victims were male and 198 were female.The murder rate in England and Wales over the past 50 years rose steadily from around 300 a year in the early 1960s to more than 1,000 in 2002/03 when 172 deaths were attributed to the activities of Dr Harold Shipman. They have declined sharply since that peak with the fall in domestic violence providing part of the explanation for the decline.The Home Office figures published today show that England and Wales are in the middle of the European murder league at 13.5 deaths per million population. Finland tops the table at 23.4, followed by Scotland at 21.4, and Ireland on 20 per million. Northern Ireland now has a murder rate well below Scotland at 15.2. Austria has the lowest murder rate in Europe at 6.1 per million.Both sets of crime figures, the British Crime Survey, which measures people's experience of crime, and the police recorded crime figures show continued substantial falls in offences bringing the risk of becoming a crime victim to a 30 year low.The 5% fall in the British Crime Survey estimate includes an 18% drop in the category of theft from the person, a 12% fall in other theft of personal property, a 15% fall in car crime and a 7% drop in vandalism. However the BCS also records a 16% rise in 'other household thefts', a 9% rise in burglary and a 3% rise in bicycle thefts.The police recorded crime figures which show an even greater fall of 7% include an 18% drop in criminal damage, 14% fall in car crime, and a 7% drop in domestic burglary.The only rise recorded on the police figures is a 7% increase in sexual offences but Home Office statisticians continue to urge caution over this figure citing under-reporting and recent police campaigns to improve recording.The good set of crime figures are accompanied by BCS evidence of continuing falls in concerns about antisocial behaviour and levels of fear of crime.Keith Bristow of the Association of Chief Police Officers said the figures showed the risk of becoming a crime victim remained at a 30 year low."Nationally we have been working to improve all areas of sex offence investigation, with a particular emphasis on rape in domestic abuse cases. We remain determined to bring to justice people who commit sexual offences and we are making significant progress in this critical area, particularly around giving victims confidence to come forward and report these crimes and we need them to do so," he said.The home secretary, Theresa May, welcomed the statistics and confirmed moves designed to boost public confidence in the crime figures including moving them from the Home Office to an independent body: "Any reductions in crime are welcome, however levels are still too high and we know these statistics only offer a partial picture about the level of crime," she said."More needs to be done to bring crime down and we need to take bold action to restore public trust in crime statistics."That is why I have asked the national statistician to lead a review and why we are moving the publication of crime statistics out of the Home Office to an independent body."Improving public trust and confidence in crime statistics is crucial if we are to improve transparency and empower local communities to hold authorities to account."
