A vicar who went on the run while waiting to be convicted of stealing thousands of pounds has handed himself in.Simon Reynolds disappeared during a lunch break at Sheffield crown court on 23 July shortly before he was found guilty of four counts of theft.He stole more than £24,000 of fees given to him for weddings, funerals and graveyard memorials while in charge of All Saints’ church in Darton, near Barnsley.South Yorkshire police alerted Interpol, fearing the 50-year-old may have fled to mainland Europe.But the force said Reynolds walked into a police station in Sheffield on Monday and was arrested. He will appear in court later. Senior clergy, including the Right Rev Tony Robinson, bishop of Wakefield, and the Ven Peter Townley, the archdeacon of Pontefract, had appealed for Reynolds, of Farnham, Surrey, to hand himself in.Reynolds’s trial heard he had not paid any fees for weddings or funerals to the Wakefield diocesan board of finance for a number of years, despite conducting a number of services during this time.Monuments for 23 burials and 50 cremation plaques or inscriptions were found in the church grounds and graveyard but no records of the burials or cremations had been made.
