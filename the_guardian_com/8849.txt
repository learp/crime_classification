A man who stabbed to death a bus passenger who tried to stop him throwing chips at his girlfriend was sent to Broadmoor high security hospital today.Anthony Joseph, 23, admitted the manslaughter of Richard Whelan, 28, after he was formally acquitted of murder when two trials failed to produce verdicts.Whelan was stabbed seven times in the heart and torso after remonstrating with Anthony Joseph who was throwing chips at the victim's girlfriend on a London bus in July 2005.Sentencing Joseph to a hospital order without a time limit, Mr Justice Gross said today: "The circumstances of this case are tragic indeed."They form the nightmare of all those who use public transport."After the case at the Old Bailey last month, it emerged that Joseph had been mistakenly released from a young offenders' institution in Manchester only hours before the attack, after charges of abduction and unlawful sex with a 15-year-old were dropped.Because of a separate arrest warrant, issued after Joseph failed to attend court in Liverpool four weeks before the killing on charges of burglary, he should have been retained in custody, but was instead released in error from Forest Bank young offenders' institution.Eight hours after his release, at around 10pm on the evening of July 29, he killed Whelan in what was described by Detective Chief Inspector John Macdonald, who led the investigation, as a horrendous attack.The government has announced an investigation into "failings" in the justice system that led to Whelan's death.
