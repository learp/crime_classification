A miners' leader once feted for opposing Arthur Scargill has been convicted for stealing nearly £150,000 from his own union's charity.Neil Greatrex, 60, who led the breakaway Union of Democratic Miners after the 1984-85 strike, was found guilty of 14 separate thefts from a care home for miners.He denied charges of making fraudulent claims of work done on the building, near Skegness, to pay for a new kitchen and garden improvements at his own home, telling Nottingham crown court the payments had been in lieu of salary as the UDM's former president, according to established custom and practice.The UDM was formed by Nottinghamshire colliers who chose to work during the year-long strike. Its general secretary, Mick Stevens, 60, was cleared of similar charges after telling the court he had signed cheques under the impression that the money was going to the care home.Both men were trustees of the Nottinghamshire Miners Home and carried out their financial dealings through a subsidiary company, Phoenix nursing and residential homes.Greatrex funnelled £148,628 to two building companies and a joiner for work that staff at the home in Chapel St Leonards told the court had never been done.The two-week trial was told by prosecutor Martin Hurst that the scheme was "a sophisticated attempt to steal from a charity" to pay for items ranging from a granite worktop to a pool for ornamental koi carp. Trustees of the charity were expressly forbidden to take any benefit from it.Greatrex and Stevens were criticised by Labour MPs in 2004 after it emerged they were receiving salary packages worth £150,000 while leading a union with only 1,431 members.But Greatrex was used to dealing with controversy – he was goaded after the strike, and his own father refused to speak to him for six years.The verdict was welcomed by John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, who worked with the Serious Fraud Office on the case. He called for a renewed police investigation into UDM involvement with solicitors struck off for grossly expensive but inadequate handling of miners' injury compensation cases.He said: "The whole thing has been a disgrace from start to finish and now we have the predictable demise of the union leader at the heart of the scandal. I am calling on the police to open up their investigation into whether others have benefited from the UDM fraud."The UDM should also pay back monies taken from the compensation of sick and elderly miners, reopen the care home as a miners' convalescent home and invite in the fraud squad to investigate every aspect of its finances over the last 10 years."
