Findings of a series of major investigations by NHS hospitals into allegations of abuse by disgraced presenter Jimmy Savile are being published on Thursday.The inquiries were prompted after a review by the Metropolitan police revealed a number of shocking claims relating to Jimmy Savile sexually abusing victims in a number of hospital settings, including within the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust area and the high-security psychiatric Broadmoor hospital.Kate Lampard, who was appointed by the Department of Health to oversee the investigations, chief investigators and chief executives of NHS trusts will present the findings at a press conference in London.Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, a documentary shown on ITV in October 2012, ultimately led to a joint review by the Metropolitan police and NSPCC into allegations that the television presenter abused women, girls and boys. The findings of the review, published in January last year, saw 214 criminal offences, including 34 rapes, recorded against Savile's name across the UK between 1955 and 2009.Uncovering the scale of his offending in their report, detectives said the Top Of The Pops presenter sexually abused a teenager at a hospice, one of 14 medical sites he used to prey on his victims.He also committed 14 offences at schools across the country, some of them when children had written to him for his popular BBC series Jim'll Fix It.A national investigation known as Operation Yewtree was launched after the abuse claims. Detectives have run the investigation in three strands: allegations involving Savile, those involving Savile and others, and those involving others acting without Savile.Further research by the NSPCC claimed at least 500 victims as young as two were abused by Savile.The NSPCC report said the scale of Savile's offending inside Broadmoor was higher than previously thought, with Thames Valley police having received 16 reports of abuse by him inside the special hospital.It also describes how some awe-struck civil servants erroneously referred to the Top Of The Pops presenter as "doctor", unaware of the trauma he was inflicting on some youngsters behind hospital doors.The figures show the most common age group for Savile's victims was 13 to 15 and the youngest alleged victim was two years old.In addition fears that Savile abused children in more than 20 children's homes and schools across England are being investigated. Allegations dating back to the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s have been handed to the Department for Education (DfE) following a review of documents by the Met.Local authorities and other relevant institutions had been asked to further investigate the claims, the education secretary, Michael Gove, said in a written statement.Among children's homes and schools to be further investigated are Henshaw School for the Blind, one of four institutions in Savile's birthplace of Leeds, and a Barnardo's children's home in the London Borough of Redbridge.Children's homes and schools in focus are spread across England, including Bournemouth, Devon, Gloucestershire, Leeds, London and Manchester among others.
