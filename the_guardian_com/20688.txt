The mother-in-law and husband of a Heathrow airport customs officer were today found guilty of arranging her death in a so-called "honour killing".Bachan Athwal, 70, and her son Sukhdave, 43, were told by Judge Giles Forrester at the Old Bailey that they faced life sentences for the murder of Surjit Athwal. The judge remanded the pair until a sentencing hearing on September 19.Surjit, 27, never returned from a trip with her mother-in-law to a family wedding in India in December 1998, the Old Bailey trial had heard.Bachan, of Hayes, west London, arranged for Surjit to "disappear off the surface of the earth" after discovering that she was having an affair.Bachan, a grandmother of 16 children, and her son later said that she had got rid of Surjit by getting a relative to strangle her and throw her body into a river in the Punjab.The court heard that Bachan called a family meeting to discuss killing Surjit a month before she vanished.The prosecutor, Michael Worsley QC, said Surjit, who was originally from Coventry, was a vivacious young woman whose western ways had annoyed the family.Mr Worsley said that "family honour was at stake" when it was discovered she was having an affair with a married man and wanted a divorce from Sukhdave, a Heathrow bus driver.Bachan, the most senior member of the Sikh family, vowed a divorce would only take place "over my dead body", the court heard.
