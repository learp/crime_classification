Scientists who used a new and exhaustive approach to scouring items for evidence found a tiny spot of blood on the collar of Gary Dobson's jacket that potentially ties him to the murder of Stephen Lawrence, a jury has heard.Dr Angela Gallop, director of science and innovation at LGC forensics, told the Old Bailey she had assembled a team to re-examine clothing from Lawrence and the suspects, for evidence that may have been missed by earlier forensic experts.Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, are accused of the 1993 murder of the teenager in south London. Both men deny the charge.Gallop said her team started from scratch with the exhibits. She said that by looking at the items "imaginatively and hard", surprising new discoveries could be made. The key to that was understanding what may have happened at the crime scene, what contact the attackers may have had with the victim, and thus what forensics may have been transferred and still detectable.The cold case review she led began in 2007. As well as a more exhaustive search for evidence, backed up by new techniques, the team examined debris in the bags clothing had been stored in since 1993, in case fibres and blood flakes had dropped off.The team used a traditional test for blood traces, which found none. But then they decided to examine Dobson's grey jacket under a microscope, something scientists do not usually do because it is so time-consuming. Gallop told the jury: "This revealed a tiny blood stain on the back of the collar."The prosecution has told the jury there is a one in a billion chance that the microscopic blood stain on Dobson's jacket collar did not come from Lawrence.The LGC team also found fibres potentially from Lawrence's clothing on items belonging to Dobson and Norris.Seven red fibres were found on tapings – sheets of sticky tape used to gather fibres – from Dobson's jacket and one on those taken from a sweatshirt removed from Norris's house.Another was discovered on a shirt seized from the home of Neil and Jamie Acourt, who are not on trial. Gallop told the jury that the search for fibres was difficult: "It's a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack and some needles are easier to find than others."Gallop had taken part in a review in 1995 of the exhibits. That looked at 1,071 fibres while the LGC review, 12 years later, scoured 4,500.The crown's case rests on the microscopic amounts of fibres, blood and hair found on clothes seized in 1993, a fortnight after the murder.The defence team says the risk of contamination during the 18 years the exhibits were stored and handled makes the prosecution's claims unreliable.The trial continues.
