A man was shot dead yesterday during a gun battle with armed officers who were patrolling close to the perimeter of Heathrow.According to one early report, police were fired at when they gave chase to a car which had been involved in a hit and run accident at a pedestrian crossing in Colnbrook. It was suggested that the victim had fled his vehicle and was shot as he attempted to escape. The man, who was hit at least twice in the chest, was pronounced dead at 5.34pm, less than an hour after paramedics began treating him. The police complaints authority launched an investigation. The airport has been on a high terrorist alert since February, but police sources said there was nothing at this stage to suggest it was a terrorist-related incident. "However, it is very, very early days. We're just not sure what happened yet," the source said. Police said the incident had taken place place in Saxon Way, a minor road close to the A4 and near the British Airways training centre. A witness said about 50 police officers and 20 police vehicles were at the scene.
