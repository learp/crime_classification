Rural police forces are to be given an extra £30 million next year as the Government attempts to seize back the crime initiative.In his speech to the Labour Party conference today, the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, will say the money will be given to forces to increase the number of police officers in rural areas and to improve computer-based systems to catch criminals. The Government's move comes after the huge row about rural crime ignited by the conviction of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who shot and killed an intruder. In a wide-ranging speech, Straw will admit that the prison population is set to increase by 2,660 over the next three years. In England and Wales there are 120 people in prison for every 100,000 of the population, compared with a European average of 90 people. Since Labour came to power in May 1997, the prison population has risen from just over 60,000 to 65,000. 'It is about making prisons work,' Straw told The Observer. 'Unapologetically, our policies have led, and will lead, to more people going to prison. If you have got crime at the levels we have and have had for the last 15 years and you want to get on top of it, then that means that more of the people who are committing most of these crimes need to be caught and convicted and, for the serious and persistent offenders, they need to go to prison.' Straw will also launch a £20 million scheme to help prisoners who are freed find work. The Custody to Work Unit will be aimed at people serving short-term sentences who have very high rates of reoffending. Almost 60 per cent of all prisoners released in 1996 were convicted again within two years. Straw will also announce £18 million for education and skills training in prisons to increase the number of people who leave prison with nationally recognised qualifications by 50 per cent.
