Bernard Hogan-Howe is believed by police chiefs to be the government's preferred choice to become the next commissioner of the Metropolitan police, with the deadline for applications at midday on Wednesday.The Home Office installed him as acting deputy commissioner at Scotland Yard after Sir Paul Stephenson resigned last month over his force's handling of phone hacking. One senior officer described that move as "remarkable" and a clear indication that Hogan-Howe had the government's blessing to become Britain's most senior officer.Hogan-Howe had previously been working for Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. He had technically left the police service after retiring as chief constable of Merseyside, so before he could take up the deputy commissioner post, he had to be sworn in as a warranted police constable.The acting commissioner, Tim Godwin, said on Tuesday that he would apply, and Sir Hugh Orde is believed to have decided to try again, after previously coming second to Stephenson.Orde is president of the Association of Chief Police Officers and has been an outspoken critic of the government's policing policies. Some believe the home secretary will refuse to give him the job, even though he would probably be the choice of Met officers.Stephen House, chief constable of Strathclyde, has been asked to consider applying by Home Office officials. He is favourite to head the new single Scottish force, due to be announced next month. Other potential candidates are Thames Valley's chief constable, Sara Thornton, and Andy Trotter, chief of British Transport police, who is a public order specialist who has been sitting with Cobra, the government's emergencies committee, during the riots.The first interviews will be held within a fortnight by a panel of the Metropolitan Police Authority. Their views will be shared with Theresa May and London mayor Boris Johnson, to produce a shortlist. The decision is ultimately made by Johnson and May, but Downing Street will let its preference be known. On Tuesday May outlined some of the qualities she is looking for, though in truth it pretty much describes all the potential candidates: "I absolutely believe that we will be able to find from amongst our ranks the sort of tough crime fighter, equipped to lead the Metropolitan Police and drive down crime in our capital."May also explained why the commissioner needs to be in post soon and why she blocked Downing Street's attempt to have the American Bill Bratton get the job: "I think it's absolutely important at the moment that we don't delay the appointment of a new Metropolitan Police Commissioner."It's an Olympics year and the Met is facing challenges following the departure of Sir Paul Stephenson and John Yates."It's also clear to me that as long as the Met retains its national policing duties, including counter-terrorism, the Commissioner will have a unique policing role in relation to national security, and that is why the post has always been held by a British citizen."
