Children's campaigners yesterday opposed moves to lift the anonymity of the brothers aged 12 and 10 who admitted beating and torturing two boys in a shocking and sustained attack in the Edlington area of Doncaster, South Yorkshire in April.Following the brothers' guilty pleas to a series of offences linked to the attack on boys aged 11 and nine, the judge at Sheffield crown court deferred sentencing until November and said he would wait until then to consider a request from newspapers and broadcasters to lift the court order protecting the anonymity of the brothers, who were described by some sections of the media as "savages".There are precedents, notably in 1993 when the judge trying the killers of Liverpool two-year-old James Bulger decided that it would be in the public interest for the 10-year-olds, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, to be named.Since their release on licence in 2001, the government has spent several million pounds providing Thompson and Venables with new identities and protecting them from possible vigilante attacks.It was "very likely" that the judge in the Doncaster case, Mr Justice Keith, would take a similar view and permit the brothers to be named, according to Mark Stephens, a leading media lawyer: "The critical thing will be the public need to know. This was a peculiarly horrible crime and it is important for justice to be seen to be working. With a crime like this involving children, it is important for the public to understand why, who the children are and where they came from."But such a move would be "a cause for real concern", said Jodie Black from the human rights organisation Justice. She said: "The whole purpose of putting these children through the adult criminal justice system is to punish and rehabilitate them. The fact they are so young means rehabilitation has a real chance to work, but the process will be that much harder with the constant pressure of a press and public who know who they are."Katie Swaine, from the Children's Rights Alliance for England group, said: "They are horrific crimes and justice needs to be done, but there has be a degree of dispassion in this. The bottom line is whether this is in the public interest, and it's hard to argue this when naming them will end up costing the taxpayer so much more."The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, argued that a kneejerk call for more parental discipline was counterproductive. "The sort of discipline these kids have received is arbitrary and often incredibly violent. In their case, it was simply a case of just savaging them," he said on BBC Radio 5 Live.Graham Allen, a Labour MP who has helped pioneer the introduction of pilot family intervention schemes in his Nottingham constituency, said he was hopeful the leaders of the main three political parties would agree to expand such a plan nationally."This would be a breakthrough â€“ giving basic social and emotional capabilities to children," he said.
