Police are to delay questioning the two young victims of a vicious attack, which saw two brothers of primary school age charged with attempted murderyesterday, until they have finished hospital treatment.Concerns about shock and their serious injuries, which threatened the life of one for two days and led to two operations on the other, have convinced detectives in Doncaster to wait for what could be several weeks before starting a very gentle interviewing process.Doncaster council is referring the case of the two accused children, who are aged 10 and 11, to a serious case review panel.Both had recently been placed in foster care by the council's children's department, which was given new management last month by the children's secretary, Ed Balls, because of serious failings.The director of children's services for Doncaster, Gareth Williams, said: "We cannot make any specific comments about the case as there are ongoing legal proceedings. However, it is crucial that people understand that this is a one-off, rare incident that we are taking very seriously."Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, who are having to deal with the aftermath of this appalling situation. We will ensure any support we can offer them is available for as long as is necessary."The brothers were remanded to secure council care yesterday after an hour-long hearing, at which the younger had difficulty seeing over the edge of the dock.They spoke to confirm their ages and acknowledge that they understood charges of attempted murder and stealing a mobile phone and Â£5.The victims, aged 11 and nine, are making progress and the older one spoke for the first time since the attack after being transferred from Sheffield children's hospital to Doncaster Royal Infirmary.He had been on a ventilator for two days in intensive care with serious head injuries and knife wounds.He is the uncle of the younger boy, who has had two operations at the infirmary on a deep knife wound in one arm. That is healing and the boy has given a very brief account to relatives of what happened in the incident on Saturday at Brick Ponds, Edlington, a semi-wild area on the site of a former colliery brickworks and clay quarry.The children are alleged to have been lured into an isolated area, away from anglers who use a two-acre lake in a flooded part of the quarry.They were then allegedly burned with cigarettes, hit with bricks and slashed with a knife.The alarm was raised when the younger boy wandered, dazed and covered with blood, on to the neighbouring housing estate where he lives.The older victim was then found semi-conscious and airlifted to Sheffield.The accused boys will appear again at Doncaster youth court on 14 April. District Judge Jonathan Bennett ruled that the case should be transferred to the crown court and committal proceedings are expected at Doncaster on 19 May.
