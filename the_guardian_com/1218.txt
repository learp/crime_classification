A group of 19 teenagers has been arrested after a man died of his injuries following an attack at a Chinese takeaway, police said yesterday.The 41-year-old married man, Mi Gao Huang Chen, from Manchester, died in hospital on Thursday evening after the assault last Saturday. Two girls and two boys, aged 14 and 15, were arrested yesterday on suspicion of murder and are being questioned by detectives. The 15 others, all aged between 14 and 18 and including five girls, have been released on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and assault. The victim was attacked with metal scaffold poles and fence posts at the Superb Hut in Scholes, Wigan, on Saturday evening. He had been involved in a row with a gang of teenagers who were hanging around the parade of shops. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Crimmins, who is leading the murder investigation, said: "Police in Wigan work extremely closely with the local community and recently we have become aware of groups of youths coming into the Scholes area to cause a nuisance. "This type of behaviour will not be tolerated and the attack last weekend is unacceptable." Police appealed for witnesses. The teenagers on bail include a 14-year-old girl from Ashton-in-Makerfield, three 16-year-old girls from Wigan, a boy from Aspull and five youths from Ince.
