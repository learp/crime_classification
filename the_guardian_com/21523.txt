Four members of a gang which 'steamed' London tube trains, robbing, stabbing and beating passengers, were given indeterminate jail sentences today in what the judge described as a "dreadful" case.Judge Henry Blacksell said the four - members of the so-called Kensal Green tribe, led by the killers of Tom ap Rhys Price, Donnel Carty and Delano Brown - should serve a minimum of five years before being eligible for parole.Carty, 19, and Brown, 18, were jailed for life last year for knifing the lawyer through the chest during a mugging in north-west London.The Middlesex Guildhall crown court, in London. heard the murder in January 2006 was the culmination of a robbery rampage by the gang, during which police estimate they carried out 150 attacks.The robberies were planned in part with a "good mugging" guide, scrawled on the back of a London Underground map, which marked certain areas as better than others for crimes.A number of victims were stabbed while others were badly beaten. Several were threatened with death and one woman, held up at gunpoint, was warned she would be raped if she did not hand over her valuables.Mr Blacksell called the convicted men, all from north-west London, "cowards" and "bullies".Toyan Vassall, 18, from Stanmore, Ishmael Cowell, 23, and Harry Bees, 17, both from, Harrow, and Kariem Al-Ebadi, 18, from Willesden, were all convicted of conspiracy to rob between December 2005 and January last year.Vassall, Cowell and Bees were also found guilty of charges of wounding with intent."The dreadful aspect of this case is how you left people traumatised because they couldn't actually intervene to help their fellow men," the judge told them."You left people having to live with themselves because they knew if they intervened they were likely to be stabbed, assaulted, a gun shown to them, left helpless... you didn't care a jot."This case, in my judgment, must be one of the most serious of its kind. It is not just the taking of the property, outrageous though that is, but the fact you enjoyed humiliating people and beating them up."We have all seen CCTV images of people limping and bleeding, while you are jumping barriers, laughing," he said.
