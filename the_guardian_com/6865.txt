An attempt by William Hague to exploit public anger over the Tony Martin case backfired last night when it emerged that the Tory leader had voted against a change in the law which could have allowed the Norfolk farmer to walk free.As Mr Hague was roundly condemned for demanding changes to the law on self-defence on the back of one court case, the Tories suffered further embarrassment when a former minister confirmed that the last government shelved such plans in the mid-1990s. The Tory leader provoked an outcry yesterday when he called for greater protection to be given to people who were forced to defend their homes against intruders. In a bid for Tory votes ahead of next week's local elections, Mr Hague said that a Conservative government would introduce a "strong presumption" in favour of the likes of Martin, who was convicted of the murder last week of a teenage burglar. However, Mr Hague's credibility was dented when it was confirmed that he had voted against a change in the law which could have allowed Martin to walk free last week even after being convicted of murder. As a new MP in 1991, Mr Hague voted against an amendment to the criminal justice bill which would have abolished mandatory life sentences for murder. Lord Ackner, the former law lord who proposed the amendment, said that Martin would probably be serving a shorter sentence if his amendment had been passed because his lawyers would have been able to urge mitigating factors. The disclosure of Mr Hague's voting record was seized on by his political opponents as a sign that yesterday's speech was a knee-jerk response to score political points ahead of the local elections. Mr Hague suffered another blow when a former Tory minister admitted that the last government had rejected the central proposals in yesterday's speech by the Tory leader. David Maclean, the former home office minister, said: "We looked at [the law on self defence], but we decided we had other priorities." Another former Tory home office minister said he saw no reason to change the law. Sir Peter Lloyd said: "The law at the moment does give courts the discretion to interpret whether reasonable force was used." His remarks were echoed by senior police officers. Crispian Strachan, chief constable of the Northumbria police, warned that Mr Hague's proposal would lead to a "serious increase in violent crime" similar to levels in the US. " Colin Langham-Fitt, the acting assistant chief constable of Norfolk whose force handled the Martin case, said there was no need to change the law. "There's nothing in the Martin trial or its verdict that takes away from people the right to defend themselves. I can't see how you could practically change the law without risking all sorts of miserable sad effects and uninvited consequences." Lawyers also condemned Mr Hague's proposal. The former high court judge, Sir Michael Davies, asked on Radio 4's Today programme: "Are people going to be encouraged to have guns, to have an electric fence with killing power round their back garden, to have a pair of man-eating tigers tied up to be released if there is a burglar about?" Labour believes that Mr Hague's speech shows that the Tories are more interested in consolidating their core vote, rather than appealing to the political centre ground. This was voiced by Peter Bradley, head of the rural group of Labour MPs, who said Mr Hague appeared to be advocating a move to a US-style gun law which could foster a "kind of lynch mob mentality". On Monday Ann Widde combe, the shadow home secretary, said she saw no need for a change in the law, although she insisted yesterday that she agreed with Mr Hague's speech. Â• Last night further allegations of intimidation in the Tony Martin trial emerged when a caller to a local radio station claimed the jury had been stared at by people in the public gallery of the courtroom. A producer at Radio Norfolk in Norwich telephoned a relative of a juror after a call to the station and was told that jurors had felt uncomfortable coming to and from the courtroom. He said one juror would have preferred to have heard the evidence from behind a screen.so he could not be identified.
