Ministers are working on an emergency package of measures to stem the growing crisis of confidence in the Probation Service that has been triggered by a cluster of high-profile failures involving the supervision of offenders.The latest failure involves the murder of 16-year-old Mary-Ann Leneghan by a six-strong gang who kidnapped and raped her then stabbed her to death. It emerged yesterday that four of the gang were on probation at the time of the attack.One of the men, Michael Johnson, had already served a three-year sentence for hanging a 13-year-old boy with learning difficulties upside down and attacking him. He had assaulted a police officer three weeks before the Leneghan murder.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, acknowledged that the high-profile cases has been "a dagger at the heart of public confidence in the Probation Service". He is working on a package of new measures to be unveiled before Easter.The Leneghan verdict follows a damning report by the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, which found there had been a "collective failure" in supervision by the London Probation Service of the killers of financier John Monckton.His death was preceded by the murder of the Nottingham jeweller Marian Bates, and was followed by the killing of teacher, Robert Symons in his west London home.The Home Office package is expected to include an attempt to enforce the new "indeterminate" sentences - where prisoners are not given a set term - retrospectively. That would mean it could apply to people jailed before April 2004 and give the parole board the power to decide on release dates of dangerous offenders based on rigorous risk assessment.Indeterminate sentences have been popular with courts, with more than 400 serious offenders put on such a sentence.Ministers also intend to bring back a major overhaul of the Probation Service, including the introduction of "contestability" - the involvement of private companies and not-for-profit organisations - to drive up standards. Legislation was delayed earlier this year in the face of hostility from Labour backbenchers. A new "end-to-end" offender management system is also planned.There were growing demands last night for an independent inquiry into the Leneghan case. But an unpublished internal inquiry by the London Probation Service is said to have found that national standards were met and there was nothing to justify a further independent investigation.Mr Clarke said it was "vital that we learn any lessons we can from these cases and take any steps necessary to ensure that offenders are properly managed and the public are properly protected. I will not hesitate to add any further issues raised by this case to the conclusions I will be presenting to the Commons by the end of Easter."But his promise failed to stem immediate criticism of the Probation Service. Shadow home secretary David Davis said it was political leadership not legislation that the service needed: "It is time the government realised the shocking consequences of their policy of allowing dangerous criminals out of prison and owned up to their complete mismanagement of the Probation Service," he said. Harry Fletcher, of Napo, the Probation Service union, said staff were not able to predict that there would be such a catastrophic deterioration in the gang's behaviour based on the information they had.The ringleader of the gang, Adrian Thomas, 20, and his followers Michael Johnson, 19, Jamaile Morally, 22 and Indrit Krasniqi, 18, were on a mixture of community punishment orders and a community rehabilitation order for a range of offences including possessing class C drugs, assaulting a police officer, driving offences and possessing a bladed article at the time they abducted and killed the teenager.Paul Harrison, a prosecution lawyer, said the treatment of their victim was as brutal and inhumane as cases he had witnessed as a war crimes prosecutor.Over three hours the teenager, and a friend who cannot be named, were beaten, raped, burned and told they were going to die before being driven to a park where Leneghan was stabbed 40 times and her friend was shot.Leneghan was abducted with a friend on May 7 last year by a gang of six men who had driven to Reading from south London in a reprisal attack for a beating they believed the girls had set up. They booked a room in a guest house where they held the girls for three hours, raping and torturing them before driving them to nearby Prospect Park.Leneghan was stabbed as she knelt in front of the gang. As she lay dying the men put a gun to her friend's head, ordered her to "prepare to die" and pulled the trigger. But the friend survived the attack and was a crucial witness at the men's trial at Reading crown court, which ended yesterday with the conviction of Krasniqi, 18, a Kosovan refugee who had overstayed in the UK.The gang had a string of convictions for kidnap, assault, false imprisonment and robbery. Johnson had kidnapped the 13-year-old and forced him off a train before tying him upside down, beating him unconscious and fracturing his skull.He was given a three-year sentence at a young offenders' institute for kidnap, false imprisonment and assault but two years later he received a conditional discharge. The men will be sentenced at a later date.
