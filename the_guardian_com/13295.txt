Human remains have been recovered byÂ search teams involved in the hunt for a missing Irish vet.Catherine Gowing, 37, was last seen on the evening of Friday 12 October at a supermarket near her home in New Brighton, Flintshire, north Wales. A 46-year-old man from Gwynedd, north Wales, has been charged with her murder.A police spokesman said on Thursday: "Following information received by the public, recent searches have focused on fields in Manor Road, Sealand. Yesterday search team officers discovered human remains in a shallow pool within the field known locally as the Lum."Those remains have yet to be formally identified, as this will require medical as well as forensic examination. A postmortem is planned for later today."Catherine Gowing's family have been informed of this distressing development and clearly our thoughts are with them at this very difficult time. I would ask that they be allowed privacy to come to terms with this news."Gowing, originally from Clonlee, Co Offaly, in the Irish Republic, had worked at Evans Veterinary Practice in Mold, Flintshire, for 18 months. Her sister Emma described her as a "beautiful person".Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pierce urged potential witnesses to come forward: "This development came about as the result of information from the local community, for which I am very grateful," he said."However, I am once again asking for their assistance. The search for evidence relating to Catherine's disappearance continues and I am very eager to hear of any sightings of her Irish-registered Renault Clio 00D 99970 and Sharp's black Volvo S40 AG58 JHE since Friday 12 October and particularly in the Sealand area."I would like to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in fields in Manor Road, Sealand, to contact police."Clive Sharp, 46, of no fixed address, has been charged with murder and was remanded in custody until 7 January, when he is due to enter his plea.The last recorded sighting of Gowing was in Queensferry. She left work at the veterinary practice in Clayton Road, Mold, about 7pm and was seen on CCTV at Asda at 8.06pm before leaving at 8.39pm.David Evans, the owner of Evans Veterinary Practice, said a text message was sent from Gowing's phone during the weekend after 12 October to a nurse who worked with her, but her phone sent only half the message.Anyone with information should contact North Wales police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
