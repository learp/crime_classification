Detectives have launched a murder investigation after a man was shot dead in north London today.Officers called to Tottenham High Road, in Haringey, shortly after 1am found a man, aged in his mid- to late 20s, with two gunshot wounds to his chest outside a Caribbean restaurant.The man, who has not been named, was taken to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead a short time later.A Metropolitan police spokesman said it was not clear if the victim was shot in the restaurant or the street outside, but there were a large number of people inside the restaurant who might have witnessed the shooting.The spokesman added that no one has been arrested, and a postmortem examination is due to take place today.The murder comes less than a week after Shawn Callum, 26, was shot dead after leaving a party at Stonebridge school in Harlesden, north-west London.Police believe revellers at a birthday party in the area could hold the key to the shooting.
