Law enforcement agencies are not fully exploiting new powers to strip criminals of their ill-gotten gains, a report said yesterday.The joint study, by the inspectorates of constabulary, the crown prosecution service and the magistrates courts, found the new Assets Recovery Agency and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 were having significant success, but often only targeted the "Mr Bigs", and almost exclusively drug traffickers, not lower-profile criminals."Agencies are failing to use the act to its full potential," said Kate Flannery, of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. "The act is not just a tool to target the mansion, yacht or Ferrari of the crime baron. There is considerable untapped potential to use the powers to disrupt and deter the prolific burglar and street corner drug dealer as well. "It is in those areas that the public sees the trappings of criminal wealth and understandably feel that, in many cases, crime does pay." But the report conceded the legislation was relatively new and could be used more effectively in time. It made 11 recommendations, including amending the law to allow both police and administrative staff to make court applications to freeze or confiscate cash, and guidance on how to better exploit top-offs. Home Office minister Caroline Flint said the new powers were making a real difference, disrupting organised crime, but there was more work to be done. The agency has taken on 69 civil recovery cases totalling £55.3m, of which four have been completed, recovering some £5.1m. There have been 28 interim receiving and freezing orders, restraining some £17.9m in assets.
