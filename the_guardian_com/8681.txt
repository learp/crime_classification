A man who organised a 10-year armed robbery spree during which three security guards were shot and almost £200,000 was stolen, yesterday admitted the murder of a "have-a-go hero" passerby.Derek Elener, 65, pleaded guilty to the killing of Tasawar Hussain, 36, whose bravery in chasing and confronting armed robbers a year ago was praised by Tony Blair in the Commons.The pensioner also admitted 12 counts of using illegal firearms and three of grievous bodily harm, offences committed during a dozen robberies that were allegedly planned and carried out with his son.Barry Elener, 46, who is said by police to have fired the shot that destroyed Mr Hussain's heart, pleaded not guilty to murder at the opening of the pair's trial at Leeds crown court.He also denied the 12 robberies, three charges of attempted murder, one of grievous bodily harm with intent and 12 counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.The jury was told that Mr Hussain was murdered "calmly and deliberately" after he and a friend witnessed an armed robbery and gave chase.Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said that Barry Elener had punched a security guard, Vittorio Diclemente, as he carried part of £140,000 takings from the Madina travel agency in Bradford last January."Mr Diclemente tried to get back into the shop with the two bags he was carrying, each with £20,000 in it, protected by smoke-and-dye devices," said Mr Smith. But he said Barry Elener drew a handgun and shouted: "Give us your money or I'll shoot."Mr Smith told the court that staff had run out of the travel agency, and that its owner, Wahid Iqbal, had seen Mr Hussain and a friend, Aznam Hus sain, passing slowly in a BMW. He shouted: "Follow that car" and the pair set off in pursuit.The jury heard that Tasawar Hussain, who worked at British Car Auctions in Brighouse near Bradford, rang police and kept in touch with them on his mobile phone as the BMW trailed the robbers' Nissan Sunny through a warren of side streets in central Bradford.But after some five minutes the Eleners, who both live inthe city, pulled up by their second escape car, a Volkswagen Jetta."Tasawar Hussain got out," said Mr Smith, "and as he did so, the passenger in the Nissan also got out and produced a handgun. He held it over the corner of the roof of the Nissan and calmly and deliberately shot Tasawar Hussain."The court was told that Derek Elener had been driving the getaway car and that his son had fired the fatal shot. The pistol was the same one that had been used in the four previous robberies where shots were fired."Barry Elener was the man responsible for pulling the trigger of that gun on every occasion it was discharged," said Mr Smith. "It's a significant feature of this case that these two men were prepared to shoot at four security guards, injuring three of them, before the deliberate shooting of Tasawar Hussain."The gun has never been recovered.Mr Smith told the jury that the Eleners had planned all their robberies and escape routes with great care. In the past, Barry Elener had worked for a security company and knew the way in which deliv eries and money transfers worked.The raids, which all took place all in the Bradford area, were carried out violently and ruthlessly. In one, a security guard at the Yorkshire Bank was shot in the chest in spite of offering no resistance.In another incident, seven years ago, at a travel agency near the Madina, a woman guard who had refused to hand over any money had a pistol pointed at her head, but the bullet missed.Mr Hussain's second daughter was born six months after his death, when a fund in his memory was launched with the support of the lord mayor of Bradford and local MPs.
