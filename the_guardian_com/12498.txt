A pensioner joined the growing ranks of reined-in Victor Meldrews yesterday when he was served with a court order forbidding him to annoy anyone in England and Wales.Sidney King was also banned from entering the Hertfordshire town of Berkhamstead for two years after setting about local teenagers with his walking stick. Magistrates in Hemel Hempstead heard that King, 73, had waged a running battle with young people, putting himself in the "anti-social behaviour" category more often associated with teenagers themselves. "Mr King is well known in this area," said a Hertfordshire police spokesman after the hearing, at which King was jailed for two months for assaulting a police officer. King is two years older than Claude Kramer, whose 10-year Asbo was described by his local council in West Yorkshire as "making Pontefract a better place".
