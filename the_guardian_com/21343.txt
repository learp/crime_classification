A Shrewsbury labourer was today found guilty by a jury of the 1984 kidnap and murder of the leading anti-nuclear activist Hilda Murrell.Andrew George, who was 16 when he killed Murrell during a burglary that went wrong, showed no emotion as the verdict was announced at Stafford crown court.George, now 37, denied the charges against him and told jurors the offence was committed by his brother, Steven. The court heard that George, who spent his teenage years in a children's home, stabbed, kidnapped and sexually assaulted the campaigner on March 21 1984. He then dumped the 78-year-old's body in woodland, where she died of hypothermia. Her body was not discovered until several days later when a farmer noticed Murrell's abandoned car and friends had become concerned about her wellbeing. The police found that her telephone was off the hook and the wires had been ripped out of a junction box. DNA samples taken from a tissue and Murrell's underwear matched a profile provided by George, and he was arrested at his home in June 2003.The killing sparked several conspiracy theories, including one that she had been killed at the behest of the nuclear industry as a result of her plan to present a paper to the public inquiry into the Sizewell B power station. During the multimillion-pound police inquiry, officers also investigated claims that MI5, British intelligence or other state agents had murdered her. Those theories arose from false claims that Murrell's nephew, Commander Robert Green, might have hidden documents at her home about the sinking of the Argentine cruiser the General Belgrano during the Falklands war. The jury of six men and six women took more than 13 hours to reach its unanimous verdict.
