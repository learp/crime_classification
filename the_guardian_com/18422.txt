The Forensic Science Service is to be wound up with the loss of hundreds of jobs, the government said today.The crime prevention minister, James Brokenshire, said the service was making losses of Â£2m per month and was likely to run out of money by January.In a written statement to MPs, the Conservative minister said: "The police have advised us that their spend on external forensic suppliers will continue to fall over the next few years as forces seek to maximise efficiencies in this area. [Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary]concur with this assessment."We have therefore decided to support the wind down of the FSS, transferring or selling off as much of its operations as possible."He added that there would be "no continuing state interest in a forensics provider by March 2012""The current challenging forensics market has put the FSS back into serious financial difficulty," Brokenshire said.
