There has been a 250% increase in the number of prisoners recalled to custody for breaching their licence conditions in the last five years, according to the chief inspector of prisons.Anne Owers says the rise, from 3,182 in 2001 to 11,081 last year, was triggered by the automatic reporting of offenders who fail to attend one probation appointment, and expansion of the early release home detention curfew scheme.Too often prisoners were not told why they were being sent back to jail; one hanged himself after receiving "a slip of paper, with no explanation" that he would have to serve four more years.
