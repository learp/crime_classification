You report that the European finance ministers have frozen the Greek debt relief deal (15 December). The reason was the Greek government had made small surpluses on its budget (after complying with the imposed austerity measures) and had used some of them to help Greek pensioners with a one-off Christmas bonus. This was to be given to pensioners with an income of less than £650 a month. Top of my reasons to vote for Brexit was the appalling treatment of the poorest people in Greece. How refreshing to be reminded that my decision was justified.David EllisComberton, Cambridgeshire• If consumption of Buckfast tonic wine features in over 6,000 crime reports (Buck up, G2, 15 December), should the monks of Buckfast Abbey review their business model before the Charity Commission removes their charitable status?Gus PenningtonStokesley, North Yorkshire• “Compulsory medication with some vile substance called ‘Radio Malt’,” writes your correspondent Martin Plaster (Letters, 16 December). I am compelled to raise my voice in defence of this malt extract which I too recall from my childhood. It was delicious – and that opinion was shared by Nigel Molesworth’s brother. Sadly it is no longer available, but there are still acceptable substitutes.Kevin McGrathHarlow, Essex• Simon Hattenstone’s comparison of Glenda Jackson’s face to a £5 note (Letters, 16 December) was apt, affectionate and amusing. As was Noël Coward’s observation on seeing a photograph of the crumpled and wrinkled face of WH Auden: “One shudders to think what his scrotum must look like.”Jimmy HibbertManchester• I see that in the picture of the “festive window display” (16 December) there is what looks like an inflatable Dalek with a sign hanging from it reading “Piss off I’m busy.” Very festive.Dan TanzeyThornton Cleveleys, Lancashire• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com•  Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters
