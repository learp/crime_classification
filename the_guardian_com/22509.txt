Photograph: Avon and Somerset Police/PAThe body of the 44-year-old was discovered in her basement flat by her partner. Donoghue had been unwell and had taken the night off from work when she was attacked in bed as she slept. She was hit seven times with a truncheon, which was left behind along with a pair of bloodstained gloves and a tobacco tin. Despite an extensive investigation the killer was never caught. But due to advances in scientific technology Avon and Somerset police now have a full DNA profile of the suspect. This comes months after Christopher Hampton, 64, was jailed for life for the rape and murder of Melanie Road, 17, in Bath, Somerset in 1984 in a similar breakthrough. He was caught last year after police matched DNA from Melanie’s clothing to Hampton’s daughter whose DNA was on the national database after she had been cautioned for criminal damage. DCI Julie MacKay, who led the police team that brought Hampton to justice, is also in charge of the Donoghue investigation.
