A mother repeatedly stabbed her three-year-old daughter before dousing her body in acid in an attempt to "dissolve her away", a court has heard.Iman Omar Yousef was initially charged with murder after police found the body of Alia Ahmed Jama at her home in Birmingham in February.At Birmingham crown court, Mr Justice Flaux ruled that that Yousef, 25, who has paranoid schizophrenia, was unfit to stand trial for murder and jurors were instructed to consider whether she had unlawfully killed her daughter. They were told to disregard the question of intent.James Burbidge QC, for the prosecution, said two police officers attended the address on 13 February after Yousef's mother expressed concerns for Alia's wellbeing.He said: "What they found was truly a shocking sight. She was on the floor and not on the bed, however her body was in a state of decomposition ... due to some form of corrosive substance having been applied to her torso."The body had then been partly covered with black and green bin liners. The officers could smell what seemed like acid."Burbidge said a number of stab wounds had been inflicted, most likely with a large kitchen knife, although no weapon was recovered.Dr James Lucas, a pathologist who conducted a postmortem, told the court "very extensive corrosive damage" hampered interpretation of Alia's injuries, making it impossible to ascertain a cause of death.He said the shoulders, chest and upper abdomen, displayed evidence of "dozens of penetrating injuries of varying shapes and sizes". Alia had not swallowed any of the acidic substance and was either "deeply unconscious or dead" when it was applied to her body. The acid had partly corroded internal organs, including her heart and lungs, and part of her spine, ribcage and breastboneThe court heard that social workers had visited Yousef, an asylum seeker from Somalia, the day before Alia's body was found amid concerns over her supervision and whether their accommodation was suitable.The prosecution said Yousef was reluctant to allow social services access to Alia's medical records but took her to a GP for a check-up later that day where the child was found to be healthy.Burbidge said Yousef's mother and aunt, who lived in Leicester, had been concerned about her mental health, describing her as "acting strangely and talking to herself". Her mother told police she had twice removed knives from her daughter's possession.The trial continues.
