The parents of one of the prime suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder were arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Pauline and Stephen Dobson were held early yesterday by detectives trying to solve the stabbing of the black teenager in 1993 at a south-east London bus stop.Two others, also in their 40s, were arrested at a separate address in south-east London. The arrests are believed to relate to the alibi one of the five prime suspects, Gary Dobson, gave the police team investigating the murder. Some detectives had believed Dobson's alibi was unshakeable because it was supported by four people and thus meant he was not directly involved in the murder. Dobson told officers who spoke to him on the night of the murder, April 22, that he had been at home all evening with his parents. Two friends of the family in the house also supported this account and said they had shared an Indian takeaway meal and been watching television with the Dobson's until they left at 11.10pm. They said Dobson had been in another room for most of the evening but had said hello to them several times during that evening. But after Dobson was arrested by police in 1993, his story changed. He said that at 11.45pm he had visited the home of two other suspects, Neil and Jamie Acourt, which was nearby. When questioned, Dobson's father said he had not realised his son had popped out that evening. Police were not expecting to charge any of the four immediately after yesterday's raids. Arrests for the murder itself are not thought to be imminent but the investigation has not been scaled down. Yesterday's arrests were the first activity by the Stephen Lawrence team to be made public in over six months.Stephen was attacked while he was with his friend Du-wayne Brooks by a gang of at least five white youths.
