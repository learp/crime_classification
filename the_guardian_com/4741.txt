Jeremy Bamber, once described by his trial judge as "evil beyond belief", yesterday sought to overturn his conviction by claiming Essex police had framed him in a "series of deceits".Sixteen years after he was given five life sentences for killing five members of his family, his barrister told the court of appeal in London there were 15 grounds for arguing his conviction was unsafe, most due to the force's failure to disclose crucial evidence at his trial.Addressing Lord Justice Kay, sitting with Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, Michael Turner QC insisted: "You are asked to consider whether certain matters were deliberately withheld so as to unfairly bolster the prosecution case and therefore secure a conviction. If non-disclosure is a fact it would be difficult to conclude other than it was withheld deliberately."He went on: "At trial, the crown's case centred on 10 key points. All but four of those we suggest are either destroyed or seriously weakened by the material now available."Bamber was convicted of shooting his wealthy adoptive parents, June and Nevill, his sister Sheila Caffell, and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas, at their farmhouse in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, in August 1985.The prosecution alleged he had murdered them to inherit a £500,000 fortune. But Bamber consistently argued his sister, a model known as "Bambi" who had a history of mental illness, killed her family before turning the gun, a .22 semi- automatic rifle, on herself.A previous application by Bamber to appeal was refused and yesterday was the first time since his conviction he has appeared in public. Now 41, he cut an upright figure, though his once-flowing dark locks have been cut short and are flecked with grey.Watched by members of his family, including his cousin David Boutflour who discovered the gun silencer that helped to secure his conviction, his barrister revealed that, in addition to evidence suggesting police corruption, he would be relying on fresh scientific evidence not available at the time of the trial.It included a new analysis of the blood found on the silencer that was initially believed to be that of Sheila Caffell. If this was the case, Sheila could not have committed the murders since the silencer was found in a cupboard and, after shooting herself, she would not have been able to replace it. But Mr Turner said the new tests revealed there was "strong support for the fact" it was June Bamber's DNA on the silencer, possibly mixed with that of her husband.Unfortunately, this could never be proved. "In February 1996, the police without reference to the appellant [Bamber], the CPS [crown prosecution service], the Home Office, the Treasury solicitor, or the forensic science service destroyed all the blood-based exhibits, thereby destroying the only known source of June and Nevill Bamber's DNA."Detailing the remaining grounds, Mr Turner accused the police of failing to disclose to the defence that swabs suggesting Sheila had no lead on her hands, and so could not have been the murderer, had been rejected by the forensic laboratory for being "contaminated".An apparent fight in the kitchen, which the prosecution had argued cleared Sheila of any involvement since she was not strong enough to tackle her 6ft 4in tall father, could be explained as disruption caused when 13 members of the tactical firearms group gained entry. Police had also failed to disclose that there was doubt over the timing of a phone call which Bamber claimed gave him an alibi.Doubt should also be cast on the "selfish" motives of Julie Mugford, Bamber's girlfriend at the time, who told police Bamber had spoken of killing them, Mr Turner said. A bank accountant would give evidence that she had confessed to a cheque fraud, and she had sold her story to the News of the World for £25,000, with her solicitor opening negotiations before the start of the trial.The appeal, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.
