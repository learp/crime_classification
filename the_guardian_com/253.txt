A woman who filmed a man sexually assaulting another woman while laughing in the background has been jailed.Alyshia Newton, 26, was arrested by Norfolk police after a woman reported suspicions that she had been attacked while unconscious.The woman, who cannot be named, had gone to the home of Victor Chokor, 36, in Norwich, and later woken up with no recollection of what had happened, the force said.Officers discovered video footage on Newton’s mobile phone showing the woman being assaulted by Chokor. A woman could be heard giggling in the background.DC Paul White said: “The victim woke up after passing out on a sofa, with no knowledge the offence had taken place. It was only days later when she saw the footage that she realised what had happened to her.“The footage was extremely disturbing and it is shocking another woman would find such an incident amusing and take the time to record it on a mobile phone. Given the circumstances, it was a difficult decision for the victim to come forward to police and we would like to commend the courage she has shown.”Newton and Chokor, both of Norwich, admitted sexual assault at Norwich crown court. Chokor also admitted possession of extreme images.Newton was jailed for 32 months and Chokor for 27 months. Both have been placed on the sex offender register.
