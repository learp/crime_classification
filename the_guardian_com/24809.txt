Detectives investigating the murder of a Hells Angel on the M40 have found evidence that a second shot was fired at him, police said yesterday.Gerry Tobin, 35, of south-east London, was shot in the back of the neck as he rode his motorbike home from the Bulldog Bash festival near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, on August 12. He was being pursued by a green Rover 620, from which police believe two shots were fired. The second shot hit his motorbike, they said.As they released CCTV footage of Mr Tobin's last stop at a petrol station before he was killed, detectives appealed to Hells Angels members to come forward.Friends of Mr Tobin told the Guardian last week they believed they knew who was responsible for his murder but were not prepared to go to the police.Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, who is leading the inquiry, said he had had no "meaningful dialogue" with members. "I'm concerned that the Hells Angels are not coming forward. I'm sure they will have theories about Mr Tobin's death and I'm asking them to share those with the police."Amid fears of revenge attacks, Mr Lawrence urged bikers not to take the law into their own hands. He appealed for motorists who stopped on the motorway after the shooting to come forward.The CCTV footage shows Mr Tobin with friends looking relaxed and at one point he is seen smiling up at the camera. Mr Lawrence said: "He doesn't look as if he's wary, he's not looking furtively around to see if anybody's with him or watching him. That suggests he's not a man who feels under any imminent serious threat."Police have received more than 500 calls from members of the public with information about the incident and Mr Lawrence urged motorists who were on the M40 on the afternoon of August 12 to report anything they may have seen, no matter how trivial it may seem.The murdered biker's mother has travelled from Canada to help police build up a picture of his character and past life.
