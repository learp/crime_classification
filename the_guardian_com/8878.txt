A row broke out yesterday between the lord chancellor and the official watchdog on judicial appointments, which accused him of interfering in the selection process for a specialist circuit judge and using his influence to favour Oxbridge-educated candidates.In its annual report published yesterday, the Commission for Judicial Appointments accused Lord Falconer of acting "inappropriately" in appointing Wyn Williams QC as specialist chancery circuit judge for Cardiff despite the unanimous recommendation of the selection panel that the job go to another candidate. The panel decided Mr Williams lacked the experience of chancery work stipulated in the job advertisement. Sir Colin Campbell, first commissioner for judicial appointments and vice-chancellor of Nottingham University, also suggested Lord Falconer had tried to persuade the commission to change its opinion. He said the commission had had two meetings with the lord chancellor, during which Lord Falconer had "sought to make representations on factual areas and on opinions" before final publication of the report.Lord Falconer's spokesman said the lord chancellor had put forward his point of view but denied he had tried to persuade the commission to change its conclusions. In a letter, Lord Falconer accused Sir Colin of producing "inaccurate and damaging reports" on the Cardiff case and on a competition for part-time judges in the Midlands, where the commission noted that the lord chancellor's involvement had increased the proportion of Oxbridge-educated candidates.Sir Colin also said Lord Falconer had rejected the commission's recommendation that five candidates for appointment as judges or QCs, who had been treated unfairly, should be reconsidered, with the prejudicial factor removed.He said he found it "quite disturbing" that in the legal arena there should be a complaints system without redress.Lord Falconer reacted angrily to a section in the report which said that in the competition for recorders on the Midlands circuit, "the lord chancellor's involvement at the end of the process increased the proportion of Oxbridge-educated candidates who were appointed, over and above those recommended by officials".A commission spokesman said: "Our report, which says that the proportion of Oxbridge-educated candidates was increased after his involvement, is accurate. It does not say anything about the lord chancellor's motivation."
