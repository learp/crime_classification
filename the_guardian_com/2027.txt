Problem families whose members commit crime, live on benefits and have poor health cost the state £250,000 a year each, research for the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit has found.Officials working on the government's Social Exclusion Action Plan say the figure is a realistic assessment of how much it costs to deal with a family living in deprivation who are responsible for antisocial behaviour.The £250,000 figure includes NHS treatment, money spent prosecuting and punishing law-breakers, social security benefits, call-outs by emergency services, damage in their neighbourhood and the cost of keeping a young person in care or a secure unit.A total of £57.9bn is spent every year trying to tackle or prevent problems associated with the social exclusion of about 1.3 million poor Britons who have multiple problems. That includes £1.9bn on looking after the 60,000 children who are in care and £30bn on benefits for those who are 'high-risk and high-cost'.Tony Blair will stress the cost to society, both financial and practical, when he delivers a lecture on social exclusion to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on Tuesday.
