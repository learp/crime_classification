If you are lonely in Sheffield, you can at least start talking to a parking meter. Slide in your coins or credit card and a tinny voice strikes up in the tones of one of seven celebrities, each with their own take on car crime. "Eh, watch your hub caps," squeaks Lily Savage. Jeremy Clarkson drawls: "Nice car - plenty under the bonnet, but I hope there's nothing valuable inside."The ploy is an attempt to beat the low boredom threshold of Sheffielders who have failed to respond to robotspeak messages from parking meters over the last 18 months. "We're hoping people will be listening hard to the new voices," says Superintendent Mark Webster, of South Yorkshire police. "The old message got repetitive and people stopped listening, so we've come up with this."The illusion that Sean Connery is at your elbow in Snig Hill or Pond's Forge has come cheaply, thanks to a professional mimic, Stuart Smith, who recorded messages from James Bond as well as seemingly, from David Beckham, Michael Caine, in his Italian Job role, and David Dickinson, the TV antiques dealer, who warns: "There are people round here on a bargain hunt - it's as cheap as chips for them." Supt Webster reckons that people will want to "collect" all seven messages, which end with the slogan: "Make it tough, hide your stuff."The meters' technology has been protected from a different sort of criminal - IT hackers like the one who managed to get into the talking bus stop system in neighbouring Leeds. As Peter Roach, a professor at Leeds University, reported in a paper on speech technology: "Messages were substituted that should not be spoken in polite society, and certainly never by a talking bus stop."The Leeds service was also temporarily withdrawn after locals objected to the "posh" voice used in the recording. A Yorkshire alternative was substituted.
