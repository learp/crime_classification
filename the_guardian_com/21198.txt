The number of people killed or injured in collisions with police cars has risen by 60% in England and Wales, Home Office figures revealed today.Police chiefs responded by calling for better training and for officers not to take unnecessary risks.The Home Office backed high-speed pursuits but said everything possible should be done to prevent accidents during pursuits or as police vehicles responded to emergencies. The Home Office minister Hazel Blears confirmed in a parliamentary answer that there were 2,015 casualties in 2003-04, up from 1,259 the previous year. These included 31 people killed and 138 people seriously injured, up from 22 deaths and 106 people seriously injured a year earlier.Nick Hardwick, chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigates the most serious collisions involving police driving, said officers must not take "unacceptable risks" in police pursuits.He said police chiefs had introduced new guidance and training - the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) pursuit policy - to help tackle the problem. Ian Shannon, the Acpo spokesman on police driver training and the North Wales Police Assistant chief constable, said the police were "very conscious" of the rising numbers of casualties. He said: "Each pursuit has to be considered individually and there are occasions where police decide to stop a pursuit in the interests of safety."But Mary Williams, chief executive of the road safety campaign Brake, urged the IPCC to launch an immediate inquiry into the "disturbing" increase. She said: "Police officers shouldn't risk people's lives in order to get to other emergencies."Zoe Stowe, chairwoman of Roadpeace, said: "Despite a number of reports, following which guidelines were set down, it would appear that tougher guidelines are needed and closer monitoring to ensure they are followed."Heather Mills McCartney, whose left leg was severed below the knee when she was hit by a police motorcycle in 1993, called for tougher guidelines for police drivers. The wife of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney said: "All police cars should always have their directional sirens on especially when they are going over the speed limit."It is often the case that people have a problem telling which direction a siren is coming from and sometimes police cars do not turn their sirens on at all. I wonder if these are both factors in the increase in the number of people killed or injured in collisions with police cars over the past year."Today's figures showed that six people were killed in crashes with Greater Manchester police, the largest number of deaths involving any one force in 2003-4.With 625 casualties, the Metropolitan police was involved in the highest number of injury-causing incidents of any force. This was a jump from a total of 82 the previous year. In 2003-4 four people died and 21 were seriously injured compared with five deaths and 14 serious injuries a year earlier.Lynne Featherstone, the Liberal Democrat MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, said: "These figures are deeply worrying. The public will be concerned that their own safety, as well as the safety of police officers, is being put at risk each time the Met responds to an emergency call."It's crucial that there is an intensive effort to recruit, train and retain officers capable of driving safely at high speeds and on crowded roads, as well as respond to emergency calls in time."The Conservatives' home affairs spokesman, David Davis, said: "The recent trend of a higher amount of these incidents merits an examination of the training that police are receiving."Unlike much of the pointless bureaucracy and political correctness that our officers are forced to deal with, the Acpo guidelines are an important part of police training and it is important that they are adhered to."
