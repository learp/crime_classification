A mother who left her two-year-old son penned in a filthy kitchen for three days while she partied with her boyfriend was yesterday jailed for a minimum of nine months.Kelly Tollerton, 23, was convicted by a jury of child neglect charges earlier this month after a jury was told she abandoned the infant at her Lincoln home while she spent the weekend drinking with her boyfriend. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison and told she should expect to serve at least nine months.The little boy, who was left with just one nappy and filthy laundry to sleep on, was discovered alone after a leaking tap flooded the flat downstairs. Police discovered him standing barefoot in several inches of water and shaking with cold. He was wearing a filthy vest and pants and had been forced to search through bags of rubbish for food after he had eaten from plates left on the kitchen floor.Tollerton still denies all charges. She claimed that she had left the child to be cared for by a friend of hers, but the friend denied this and told the court the pair had not spoken for weeks after an argument over money.Passing sentence at Lincoln crown court, recorder William Harbage QC, said: "Your treatment of your young son was deplorable and disgraceful. Your parenting was woefully inadequate. Your conduct arouses feelings of horror and revulsion among all right-thinking people." Lincolnshire county council has said it will open an inquiry into the matter.
