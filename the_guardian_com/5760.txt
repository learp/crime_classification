A fourth suspect being hunted by police in connection with the murder of the British student Meredith Kercher was arrested in Germany today.Rudy Hermann Guede, a 21-year-old originally from Ivory Coast, was detained on an international warrant in the city of Mainz.Meanwhile, it was reported that one of the other suspects being held in custody had been released due to a lack of evidence. The Italian news agency Ansa said bar owner Diya "Patrick" Lumumba, 37, was freed from prison in Rome two weeks after being remanded in custody by a judge.Ansa reported that as Lumumba left custody, he said: "I am happy to be going home. I thank God."He had steadfastly denied any involvement in the killing of Kercher, a 21-year-old from Coulsdon, south London. She was found with her throat cut in the Italian city of Perugia on November 2.Lumumba has maintained that he was at his pub, not in Kercher's apartment, on the night of the murder.He was being held along with Kercher's 20-year-old flatmate, Amanda Knox, and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 24. Both also deny any involvement in her deathPolice believe she was murdered after refusing to take part in a sex game.Detectives began searching for Guede after finding fingerprints on a pillow and toilet paper in Kercher's flat which did not match those of the three people in custody.Italian police traced Guede to Germany through a friend who established internet contact with him last night and chatted with him for hours, investigators said.Police in Mainz confirmed they had arrested a 20-year-old native of Ivory Coast. The man was detained on a train bound for nearby Frankfurt for travelling without a ticket, said a Mainz police spokesman.Arturo De Felice, the Perugia police chief, said Guede would be transferred to Italy as soon as possible.The Italian La Repubblica newspaper reported that Guede had briefly been fostered by a wealthy industrial family in Perugia, and had worked at a rural bed and breakfast.He was later rejected by his adoptive family because of his "rebellious" nature, and was knifed during a fight over drugs five years ago, La Repubblica said."Guede was a difficult type - spent a lot of money, told lies, and did not behave well," Simone Benedetti, a member of the adoptive family, told the paper. "If I had to judge him, I would say he was a boy who could not take care of himself. But no way is he a murderer."Corriere della Sera also reported that Guede regularly played basketball metres from the house Kercher had shared with Knox and two Italian women.Knox's lawyer, Luciano Ghirga, said the identification of a new suspect would change little for his client because she had not mentioned any such person in her two declarations to prosecutors.
