The escape of a rapist from the Pakistan high commission in London caused a diplomatic row today as British officials were accused of failing to warn staff he was dangerous.Police have been hunting for Imtiaz Hussain, 44, since he climbed out of a toilet window at the London embassy and escaped last Friday.The convicted double rapist was brought under guard to obtain a passport, so he could be deported at the end of a nine-year prison sentence.Syeda Sultana Rizvi, of the Pakistan high commission, said a formal complaint has been made to the British authorities.She accused immigration officials of failing to make an appointment and leaving the criminal inadequately guarded.Rizvi said diplomatic staff only learned of his visit from panicking private security guards after he disappeared from the building.She said: "He was a dangerous person, this fact was known to the agency which was handling his custody."The questions that arise are: why then did they bring him for the interview without prior information in the first place? And why was the criminal inadequately guarded? There are many questions that can be raised surrounding the entire episode."Hussain was last seen running across Sloane Square, in west London, after escaping from the building in nearby Lowndes Square at about 2.35pm last Friday.He told private security guards from G4S Care and Justice Services that he needed to visit the toilet before escaping.Hussain was approaching the end of a prison sentence after trying to rape two women at knifepoint in Derbyshire.David Wood, of the UK Border Agency, said: "Police were immediately informed. His details have been placed on the Police National Computer and watch-lists."We are actively searching for this individual to return him to custody and remove him from the UK."Detective chief inspector Brent Lancaster, of the Metropolitan police, said: "This individual is believed to be very dangerous and we need to apprehend him as soon as possible. If anyone sees him, please don't approach him, but call alert police immediately."Officers were working with colleagues in Derbyshire to establish if Hussain has any contacts in Britain who may help him while on the run.He was described as about 5ft 5ins, of medium to chubby build, with dark cropped hair. He was wearing a blue T-shirt, blue jeans and white trainers.
