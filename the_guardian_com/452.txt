A British businessman accused of drugging and raping a woman while on a New York business trip faces extradition after failing yesterday in a last attempt to stop the process.The extradition of David Nicholson, a chartered accountant, was ordered by the home secretary in April last year.A man of "impeccable" character, he is alleged to have taken the woman, also a British national, to dinner at a restaurant in the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre in March 2000. After the meal he is alleged to have drugged and raped her.On returning to England, the woman told her sister of the alleged attack.Mr Nicholson faces charges of rape, indecent assault and administering noxious substances.He asked Lord Justice Scott Baker, sitting with Mr Justice David Clarke, to halt the extradition because other proceedings were continuing in the UK which could result in him being found innocent.Lord Justice Baker said the court was concerned only with the lawfulness of the home secretary's decision to order extradition. "It seems to me there is not a shred of material to show the secretary of state's decision was arguably unlawful." Mr Justice Clarke agreed.
