A couple of miles from the spot where her son was brutally murdered 15 years ago, Doreen Lawrence will today witness the opening of a Â£10m architecture centre in his honour. The three-storey building, designed by the award-winning architect David Adjaye, aims to offer thousands of young people from deprived backgrounds the chance to break into architecture, urban design and building."He would have been so excited but a bit surprised that this is all happening in his name," Mrs Lawrence said. "He had dreamed of becoming an architect since he was seven years old. I think it came from his father, Neville, who never had the encouragement when he was growing up. But we supported Stephen, who was always interested in drawing and art and he had done his work placement from school at an architect's firm."Stephen was stabbed to death by a gang at a London bus stop in April 1993. The case was the subject of three separate investigations, an internal Scotland Yard review and a re-examination by Kent police, as well as the 1999 Macpherson inquiry, which found the Metropolitan police was beset by "institutional racism".The centre, in Deptford, south-east London, offers courses, training and mentoring in engineering, architecture and building facilities for people between 14 and 25. It is linked to several leading firms and universities.Yesterday Karin Woodley, chief executive of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, said: "This is a laboratory for looking at new ways of working with young people to improve their attainment and skills. Stephen was tragically denied the chance to realise his dream of becoming an architect but we hope to offer young people who are living in poverty the opportunity to realise their aspirations."London mayor Ken Livingstone, who will formally open the centre, paid tribute to the trust. "It has been extremely important in ensuring that the potential of young people who are interested in pursuing careers in architecture, urban design and regeneration is supported and nurtured," he said.
