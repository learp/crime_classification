The additional £1bn for counter-terrorism announced by the chancellor, Alistair Darling, will mean the newly created "single security budget" covering the police and security services will rise to £3.5bn a year over the next three years - triple the spending before 9/11.The rise will give the otherwise frozen Home Office budget a £220m-a-year boost over the next three years - amounting to around £700m or 1% - to meet the costs of its more "tightly focused" security role in the light of its new "split for purpose' status. Funding for the intelligence services - MI5 and MI6 - is now set to rise at 9.6% a year in real terms.A further £100m of the extra money is to be spent on a three-year drive intended to stop people in Britain being drawn into violent extremism. A further £61m a year is to be spent by the BBC World Service, British Council and Foreign Office to "break down cultural barriers and misunderstandings" among opinion formers and communities at home and abroad.The extra money to fight terrorism was accompanied by more funding to redeem the government's general election pledge to put a neighbourhood policing team into every area by next April, create 9,500 prison places by 2012 and spend a further £400m on developing new electronic border controls.Ministers have promised a further 1,500 prison places on top of their existing building programme of 8,000 to meet the record prison numbers of 81,000 but the money announced yesterday will only fund 500 of the 1,500 extra places. The demand for 3% efficiency savings is believed to mean £65m a year out of the prison service and £20m from the probation service but £100m extra has been found to modernise the court system.The chancellor also did not mention that the government is dropping its target of reducing crime by 15% by April next year. The latest figures show that crime has fallen by 11% since the target was set but the trend is now threaten- ing to rise once again. Also being dropped is the target of bringing 1.25 million offences to justice which measures the conviction rate. In its place will be a whole new system of public service agreements on crime and disorder designed to boost public confidence in the crime figures and police targets.A new target of reducing serious violent crime - the 19,000 cases of murder, grievous bodily harm and death by dangerous driving last year - is to be introduced based on police recorded crime and not the much criticised British Crime Survey. But it will exclude a measurement of serious sexual offences.A new violence action plan is to be produced alongside revised drug and alcohol strategies by next April.Similar targets will be introduced for burglaries and other property crime and also for the reduction of anti-social behaviour and disorder.In an unexpected move, the chancellor offered a further £400m to the armed forces to help pay for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The total cost of operations there now amounts to more than £7bn.The money comes out of a special Treasury reserve and not the defence budget which will rise to £37bn a year by 2010 in a three-year comprehensive spending review agreement announced in July.
