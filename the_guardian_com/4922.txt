Underage drinkers face fines and the witnesses and victims of antisocial behaviour will be given protection under a safer neighbourhoods bill introduced in the Queen's speech today.The bill, which is part of the government drive to create "cleaner, safer and greener neighbourhoods".Under the bill, a range of minor offences such as underage drinking, fly-posting, dog fouling, and graffiti are likely to be the subject to fixed penalty notices.The legislation would also allow the witnesses and victims of neighbour nuisance to give evidence behind screens and via video links in cases involving antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos).In addition, the bill is expected to allow courts to force drug treatment on those served with Asbos, even when they have not be convicted of a criminal offence.This alarms lawyers and civil liberty campaigners. The Law Society warned that it effectively "criminalises" antisocial behaviour.In a briefing on the proposals, the society said: "In creating a compliance aspect to the orders more akin to a criminal sentence, the distinction between the civil and criminal systems is increasingly blurred."The bill is also set to introduce tougher powers to tackle fly-tipping with offenders facing fines of up to Â£50,000. Powers will also be introduced to allow councils to tax households that fail to recycle their waste.
