An armed robber accused of murdering the police officer Sharon Beshenivsky was part of a "deliberate, callous and unnecessary" shooting carried out with the intention of killing the police constable and her colleague, a court heard today.Both Beshenivsky and Teresa Milburn were shot in the chest at close range when they investigated a robbery at a travel agency in Bradford in 2005, Newcastle crown court was told.  Sharon Beshenivsky was shot during a robbery in Bradford Photograph: West Yorkshire Police/PABeshenivsky, 38, who was married with three children and two stepchildren, died on her daughter's fourth birthday after being shot in the chest. She had been a serving constable for only nine months.Mustaf Jama, 28, admits taking part in the robbery but denies murder and firearms charges.The killing took place on 18 November 2005 as the officers responded to an alarm call shortly before their shift was due to end, Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, told the court."Within minutes, both of them had been shot. One of them, PC Sharon Beshenivsky, suffered a bullet wound that killed her while the otherm, PC Teresa Milburn, was shot in the chest but survived the attempt on her life."It was deliberate, callous and unnecessary, and done with the intention of killing both officers."They were both shot in the chest at close range."Smith said three robbers were armed with a 9mm self-loading pistol and a 9mm semi-automatic machine gun."They were dangerous men who had used violence to the owner of the premises they had just attacked and were prepared to stop at nothing to avoid arrest."Two of the men, Muzzaker Shah and Yusuf Jama, have both already been convicted of murder, robbery and firearms offences."The third man is the accused sitting in the dock."Jama, who the court heard was the brother of Yusuf Jama, sat quietly in the dock wearing a dark-green polo shirt.Smith told the jury that even if Jama had not fired the fatal shot, he was "as much guilty of murder as the man who did"."The prosecution case against the accused man is straightforward," he said."He was party to an attempt to rob the premises. The carrying of loaded guns for the purpose of robbery involves, you would think, the intention to fire them if necessary."You may think that people who carry firearms in order to commit such crimes know the consequences. Someone may be shot."He told the court that Milburn recalled that it was Muzzaker Shah who shot her colleague in the chest.But the prosecutor said Jama "at the very least" knew one of his number could use the guns to "kill or seriously injure anyone who hinder them or might stand in their way"."Whether he was in agreement with it or not, one of his companions was to shoot two police officers at point-blank range to escape with the cash he had stolen," Smith said."Even if he did not fire the trigger, he is as much guilty of murder as the man who did."The trial continues.
