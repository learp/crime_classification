One of the two men accused of trying to blackmail an unnamed member of the royal family was denied bail at the Old Bailey yesterday.Ian Strachan, 30, of Chelsea, west London, has been jointly charged with Sean McGuigan, 40.Mr Strachan, being held at Belmarsh prison, was not at yesterday's hearing.Both men are due to appear at the Old Bailey on December 20 when an indictment will be put to them.The judge, Mr Justice Gross, denied a request for the bail proceedings to be held in closed court after representations by Anthony Hudson, counsel for the Guardian, five other newspapers, and the BBC.A previous bail application last week was adjourned after a few minutes because lawyers needed more time to prepare.Mr Strachan has been charged with an offence of blackmail contrary to section 21 of the Theft Act. Mark Carroll for the prosecution said it was alleged that he had made "demands with menaces" prior to his arrest on September 11. James Lewis QC, for Mr Strachan, said his client was not guilty and had a defence to the charge.The victim, said not to be a senior member of the royal family, denied accusations made after a demand for a reported Â£50,000 was allegedly made. He called the police and the suspects were arrested following a police sting operation.
