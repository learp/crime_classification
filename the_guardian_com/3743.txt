The legal aid bill for human rights' challenges by prisoners to parole board decisions has soared tenfold in the last five years to more than £2m, according to official figures released yesterday.The parole board last night said the rising bill was cause by the increasing number of release and recall decisions involving oral hearings, at which lawyers paid for by legal aid can represent prisoners. Their number has increased sharply from 425 in 2001-02 to 1,500 in 2005-06.The number of oral hearings is expected to accelerate further as the courts sentence hundreds more offenders to a new "indeterminate" sentence which came in last April, under which the parole board is given the task of deciding when somebody is safe enough to release.This disclosure will increase pressure on John Reid, the home secretary, when he delivers the annual parole board lecture on Monday, to outline his plans to strengthen public protection over the release of serious offenders, following the controversy about the release of a life prisoner, Anthony Rice.The prime minister last week ordered the home secretary to carry out a reappraisal of the way serious offenders are released from prison. In a further effort to calm the political turbulence battering the Home Office in the wake of the sacking of Charles Clarke, Mr Reid will also appear before the Commons home affairs committee on Tuesday to defend his department's record on immigration control and explain the foreign prisoner releae fiasco. The parole board figures also confirm the scale of the "human rights" problem raised by the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, in his inquiry into the Rice case. He complained that increasing use of barristers to represent prisoners at parole board oral hearings was allowing protection of the public to be undermined by rights considerations.Figures released by the Department for Constitutional Affairs show that the legal aid bill for supporting prisoners at parole board hearings has soared from £209,750 five years ago to £2.4m in 2005-06.A Home Office spokesman confirmed that much of the increase stemmed from the Stafford case, which was a 2002 judgment by the European court of human rights, under which mandatory life prisoners won the right to oral parole hearings and to be legally represented at them.Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, last night said: "Recent changes in the law should not be a gravy train for lawyers . What we need are short, effective hearings which allow both sides to examine reasons for parole decisions."David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth, who ferreted out the figures, said: "It is appalling that because of human rights laws so much taxpayers' money is being spent on allowing prisoners to be legally represented to argue their case before the parole board."
