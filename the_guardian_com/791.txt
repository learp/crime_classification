One of the two men accused of trying to blackmail a member of the royal family over gay sex allegations today denied ever demanding money.Ian Strachan told the jury at the Old Bailey that he had "never" wished the royal, identified only as witness A, any harm.Strachan said he had been acting out of revenge against one of witness A's employees, whom he called a "predatory homosexual" that drugged his victims.He said his only aim was to ensure the employee, know as witness D, would be exposed, "get his comeuppance" and get the sack, the court heard.Strachan, 31, and Sean McGuigan, 41, are accused of trying to extort £50,000 from the royal by claiming he had performed a sex act on witness D.The court heard there were also allegations, stemming from eight hours of video and audio recordings of D, that the royal took drugs. Jurors were told that prior to the blackmail attempt, the men had tried to sell the tapes to several newspapers.Jerome Lynch QC, counsel for Strachan, asked his client: "Did you appreciate that publishing these stories might cause him (the royal) some harm?" Strachan replied: "I did not really think that they would take it seriously."Lynch asked: "Did you think he would be embarrassed?" Strachan said: "Well, the whole sexual allegation was not going to be printed."Lynch asked if Strachan believed in the truth of any of the other allegations relating to the royal, to which he replied that he had "serious doubts".Strachan insisted money was not the main reason for drawing the royal family member into his alleged expose of witness D. He said he never made financial demands of A because he knew it could be construed as blackmail, but told the jury: "If someone offered me thousands of pounds, yes, I would take it."Strachan, of Fulham, south-west London, and McGuigan, of Battersea, south London, both deny the charge that they made "an unwarranted demand with menaces" of £50,000.The trial continues.
