The champion racehorse trainer Peter Easterby and a retired army major, John Shaw, were convicted today of taking part in illegal hare-coursing on their land in North Yorkshire two years ago. Scarborough magistrates heard that the event was secretly filmed by wildlife campaigners who regularly monitor supposed greyhound field trials to check whether they are coursing in disguise. The district judge, Christina Harrison, gave both men an absolute discharge and no costs award because "everybody in this case has had extreme difficulty trying to wrestle what exactly parliament meant in the 2005 Hunting Act". The trial heard that a police officer had attended the event and left satisfied that it was legal.
