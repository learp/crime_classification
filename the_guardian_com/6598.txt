An entire family was banned from their home town yesterday under one of the most wide-ranging anti-social behaviour orders yet served.The five members of the Bridge family in New Brighton, the Wirral, allegedly terrorised their local community. The Asbo will ban the family from the Wirral for between four to seven years each. Birkenhead magistrates court issued the ban against John Bridge, 40, his wife Karen, 37 and their sons John Junior, 20, 18-year-old Alan, and Luke, 16. John Junior and Alan are both serving custodial sentences. The Bridges allegedly engaged in threatening and violent behaviour, verbal abuse and intimidation, and criminal behaviour. Chief Superintendent Alan Jones of Merseyside police said after the hearing: "There were fights in the street with baseball bats, all sorts of disorder, and dangerous driving. People were frightened to come out of their houses, to go on holiday or leave their cars overnight. "I've been involved in a number of Asbo cases, but this is such a significant one. "I see Asbos as an action on behalf of the community. This is about ensuring people do behave themselves - and in this case, protecting the community wherever they go next." The family were also banned from causing harassment, alarm or distress to anyone in England and Wales. Caroline Laing, manager of Wirral anti-social behaviour team, added: "This is the worst case I have ever seen. "It has been incredibly difficult to deal with. The reputation of the family is very strong and residents were incredibly frightened of reprisals." Police created a special unit to monitor the family.
