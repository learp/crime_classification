An Irish republican terrorist was jailed for life today after he admitted murdering a British soldier outside an army recruitment office 18 years ago. Sergeant Michael Newman, 34, was gunned down by the Irish National Liberation Army, an IRA splinter group, in Derby on 14 April 1992.Declan Duffy, 36, who was brought to Stafford crown court from Northern Ireland to face the charge, pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life with a minimum of 24 years.The INLA, which announced it was disbanding last year, admitted responsibility for Newman's killing at the time, writing to his family to say he had been shot as part of its fight with the government.Duffy, a former leader of the group who was named as a suspect with two other INLA men, said last year he had decided to speak to the police after renouncing his links with the group.He said: "I would never have spoken to the police in the past but my war is over and there are things I have to get off my chest. This man was a family man and it is regrettable that he was killed."I would be happy to meet with any member of his family to explain to them the circumstances of why soldiers at that time were being targeted. The war is now over and I acknowledge the hurt caused to Irish and English people."Duffy, who was jailed in Ireland last year after admitting INLA membership, said he had received death threats after renouncing his links to the group.Another INLA member, Joseph Magee, was jailed in 2004 after pleading guilty to Newman's murder.Anthony Gorman, who is also accused of the shooting, is fighting extradition from the Irish Republic.
