A prolific sex offender who was left at large because of police blunders is believed to have attacked at least 102 women, it emerged today.John Worboys, dubbed the "black cab rapist", is one of the most prolific sex offenders in British criminal history.He was jailed indefinitely in March last year after he was found guilty of 19 charges of drugging and sexually assaulting 12 women, in one case raping his victim.The licensed London taxi driver preyed on female passengers late at night.Since his conviction another 19 women have come forward to tell detectives they believe he attacked them.His method of attack was to spike champagne with powerful prescription sedatives and over-the-counter sleeping pills. He tricked young professional women into drinking with him by claiming to have won the jackpot at a casino or on the lottery and showed them bundles of cash to prove it.The attacks are believed to have been carried out over a period of about five years, between 2002 and 2007. At the time of his conviction police believed he may have attacked over 80 women.A Metropolitan police spokesman said: "There is a high possibility there are more victims out there."The difficulty is that a large number of the women do not know whether they were raped or not."The only person who knows is Worboys himself. We hope he might consider telling us in the future what went on."Worboys was told he must serve a minimum of eight years in prison for the attacks and would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women.Despite the new victims coming forward it is thought unlikely new prosecutions will be mounted because of the length of time he is expected to serve for the offences he has already been convicted of.An inquiry by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found that Worboys remained free to continue preying on women because police officers made serious mistakes and failed to take victims seriously.The IPCC inquiry found individual and systemic failings. In one report, a detective constable dealing with a victim attacked in July 2007 wrote: "The victim cannot remember anything past getting in the cab. It would seem unlikely that a cab driver would have alcohol in his vehicle, let alone drug substances."Other findings included:• Officers adopting a mindset that a black-cab driver "would not commit such an offence", and failing to challenge Worboys, who was identified by his cab number in CCTV footage in July 2007, over his account.• Failing to search his home for evidence, and making no attempts to corroborate the victims' accounts.• Failing to check his story or re-interview him after hearing the July 2007 victim's full statement.Worboys was arrested and released without charge after the woman came forward in July 2007 and officers chose to believe his account, not hers. Seven months later he was arrested again when police finally put together years of missed intelligence.Scotland Yard says it has now overhauled the way rape and sexual offences are investigated, forming the country's first rape intelligence unit.
