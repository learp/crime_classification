Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, ground to a halt this morning after an exiled senior official from its dominant political party was stabbed to death in a north London suburb.Streets were deserted, schools and businesses shuttered and buses taken off the roads in the aftermath of the death of Imran Farooq, a senior figure with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) party, yesterday afternoon.Farooq, 50, was attacked by an unidentified assailant near his home on Green Lane in Edgware at about 5.30pm. Paramedics treated him on the scene for stab wounds and head injuries but he was pronounced dead an hour later.Farooq had been living in London since 1992 when he fled murder and other charges in Pakistan at a time when the MQM was engaged in a violent battle for control of Karachi.Farooq, who denied the charges, claimed political victimisation. He sought asylum in the UK along with his party leader, Altaf Hussain. Yesterday's killing coincided with Hussain's birthday celebrations, which were cancelled.Pakistani television showed a distraught Hussain mourning the loss of his colleague in London. "God please grant us patience to bear this loss," he said as a supporter mopped tears from his face.Party officials in Karachi, Pakistan's financial and business hub, declared a 10-day period of mourning as people awaited indications of whether Farooq's killing had political links.Previous political killings have inspired riots and shootings between rival factions, many of whom are heavily armed.Farooq Sattar, who leads the party inside Pakistan, said the killing was "one of the biggest tragedies in the MQM's history". He expressed confidence that "since this tragedy has taken place in London, investigations will take place there and the culprit will be arrested".Another senior MQM official said he saw an "element of conspiracy" in the killings and suspected a political assassination.Farooq was a top MQM leader and a close ally of Hussain, whom he befriended during their days in student politics in the late 1970s. He served as the party's chief official but was said to have been absent from politics for the past two years.His home in Edgware is close to the office block from which Hussain, who has British citizenship, effectively runs his party – and by extension large swaths of Karachi.Analysts said they were keeping an open mind as to the identity of Farooq's killer. The MQM has long-standing rivalries with ethnic Pashtun and Sindhi parties in Karachi, with political killings often followed by tit-for-tat shootings.It was not clear which Pakistani political force would have the ability to strike on a quiet London street – or why they would want to, given Farooq's relative inactivity of recent years.The MQM has occasionally been rocked by internecine violence, and has a sometimes deadly rivalry with a faction known as MQM-Haqiqi, which was once supported by Pakistani intelligence.Hussain says he cannot go back to Pakistan for fear of assassination, although he recently hinted at a return.Metropolitan police detectives are trying to secure CCTV footage from the part of north London where Farooq lived.Diplomatic sources expressed shock about the killing. One said Farooq was obviously killed by an enemy, but it remained to be seen whether the motive was personal, or to do with rivalry within his party or hatred of the MQM.Farooq claimed in November 1992 that he was wanted dead or alive and this gave "licence and impunity to every individual in Pakistan to assassinate me".
