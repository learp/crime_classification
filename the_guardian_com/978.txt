MI5 warned todaythat disclosing information on why it had failed to investigate the ringleader of the terror attacks of July 2005 could give al-Qaida plotters an "invaluable weapon".Bereaved families want to ask security officials, during the coming inquests into the deaths of those killed in the London bombings of 7 July five years ago, why Mohammad Sidique Khan was not followed up after being seen meeting known terror suspects.MI5 told a hearing at the royal courts of justice, set up to decide the scope of the inquests, that disclosing such information would aid those planning another atrocity.Neil Garnham QC, counsel for the home secretary and MI5, called the bombings "the deliberate action of evil and callous killers". But he said there were people who celebrated the appalling act: "And there are others who would like to repeat it, to emulate the action of these murderers."Garnham added: "Can there be much doubt that potentially the security service's answer [to such questions at the inquests] would be of the greatest interest to an intelligent planner of the next terrorist outrage?"Khan, 30, and three other suicide bombers killed 52 people by detonating explosives on tube trains and a bus in 2005. In 2004 he had been followed by counter-terrorism officers during an inquiry into extremists planning a fertiliser bomb attack. But MI5 concluded that diverting resources to his surveillance was not justified.
