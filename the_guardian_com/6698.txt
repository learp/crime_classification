A man has been sentenced to four years and four months in jail for what a judge called a "disgraceful attack" on the deputy editor of the Essex Chronicle. Paul Dent-Jones, pictured here, was punched to the ground and then repeatedly kicked and stamped on after he had left a Chelmsford pub following a disagreement with former Royal Air Force technician Richard Quinn.Chelmsford crown court was told that bar staff delayed Quinn leaving the pub, but he followed Dent-Jones and launched his vicious attack, which was caught on CCTV.Quinn admitted a charge of attempted grevious bodily harm with intent. In sentencing him, the judge, Karen Walden-Smith, said: "Your victim was much smaller than you and you punched him with such force he immediately went to the ground..."And when he fell with his head resting on the kerb, you kicked him and stamped on him deliberately."Quinn's lawyer told the court Quinn had serious problems with alcohol. He had had an exemplary 11-year RAF record and was deeply ashamed of his behaviour.As for Dent-Jones, being in that uncomfortable position of a journalist who becomes the news, he handled the difficulty of reporting on his own case very well indeed, as his editor-in-chief, Alan Geere, made clear in a personal blog posting. Dent-Jones wrote about the incident, CCTV camera saved my life, in his paper.Sources: Chelmsford Weekly News/Geere blog/Essex Chronicle
