Rape conviction rates remain close to an all-time low despite efforts by the government, police and prosecutors to improve performance, according to Home Office research published today.The study into attrition rates for rape cases sampled 676 complaints from 2003-4 and found that 6% resulted in an offender being convicted.The report said the conviction rate in England and Wales rose to 13% when taking into account lesser offences such as indecent assault.But in rape cases there was virtually no change from the record low conviction rate of 5.5% reported two years ago by the Home Office. That compares to conviction rates of up to 32% in the 1970s.The study took in cases from eight police forces, three of which had a record of high detection rates and two of low detection rates.It found there was a high attrition rate as cases passed through the criminal justice system.Most often, cases were ended between the report of the crime and the charge. The most common reasons the report found for the failure to bring charges were insufficient evidence (in 40% of cases) and the complainant withdrawing their allegation (35% of cases).Where the complainant withdrew support for the process, the most common reasons given were not wishing to go through with the investigative or court process and wanting to move on.A study two years ago by researchers at London Metropolitan University said rape conviction rates had reached a record low because of a culture of scepticism among the police.Today's report said improved victim care, better communication and action to address concerns of reprisal would help to minimise the number of cases dropped because complainants stopped cooperating with the investigation."Concern about various aspects of the investigation and prosecution of rape cases continues to be an important theme within the debates about law and order," the report said.The study was commissioned amid concerns about the drop in detection rates for all sexual offences since 1997.Reports of rapes have risen dramatically, partly as a result of high-profile campaigns to encourage victims to come forward. Recorded cases rose from 6,281 in 1997 to 12,354 in 2003/4.Of the sample of 676 cases, women aged between 16 and 25 represented the largest single group of complainants. Stranger rapes accounted for 14% of cases, while one-fifth of cases involved complaints against partners or ex-partners, and more than two-thirds of alleged offences were in the complainant's home.In January it was announced that a nationwide network of specialist rape prosecutors was to be set up.
