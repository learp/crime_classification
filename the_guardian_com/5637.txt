Dale Cregan has been told he will die in prison for the murders of two unarmed policewomen and a father and son.Cregan, 30, described by Greater Manchester police's chief constable, Sir Peter Fahy, as a "scourge on our society", was given a whole-life sentence at Preston crown court by Mr Justice Holroyde QC at the end of a trial which laid bare the sheer brutality of Manchester's underworld.Cregan was already on the run for the murders of David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed policewomen Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, in a horrifying gun and grenade attack.Sentencing Cregan, Holroyde said he had "acted with premeditated savagery" in the "quite appalling" murders."You, Cregan, drew those two officers into a calculated trap for the sole purpose of murdering them in cold blood," he said.The judge said he had no doubt Cregan had expected one or more unarmed officers to attend his false report of a crime.

Four of them were cleared.Cregan went on the run days before he killed David Short last August after he had gunned down Short's son, Mark, in a pub in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, three months earlier.The manhunt reached a ghastly conclusion on 18 September, when he lured the constables with a bogus 999 call to a house in Abbey Gardens in Hattersley.His last comment to the call handler as he was told officers were on the way was: "I'll be waiting."He opened the front door as they walked up the front garden path and shot them in the chest with a Glock handgun.PC Hughes was hit eight times, including three strikes to the head as she lay on the ground.PC Bone was hit up to eight times after she managed to draw and fire her Taser at Cregan, who fired 32 bullets in total in barely half a minute.He then left his "calling card" of a military grenade, which he threw on to the path where the officers lay.The killer then dropped his gun and drove the short distance to Hyde police station, where he calmly walked up to the counter clerk and said: "I'm wanted by the police and I've just done two coppers."

You were hounding my family so I took it out on yous."The spiral of violence began on 25 May last year when a balaclava-clad Cregan stepped into the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden and shot Mark Short, who died in the arms of his father.On 10 August, Cregan targeted Short senior outside his home in Clayton as he unloaded furniture from his car.He chased him through his house and shot him numerous times before throwing a grenade at him with "devastating consequences", the first recorded time one had been used in the UK in this way.At 1.10pm, on the 77th day of the trial and on the sixth day of deliberations, the jury came back into court with unanimous verdicts on all counts. The defendants were ordered to remain seated.The first lot of verdicts were delivered in silence in the packed courtroom save for some stifled gasps as 'not guilty' was recorded on some counts.Fiona Bone's sister, Vicky, shook her head and her father, Paul, leaned back in his seat.David Short's wife, Michelle Kelly, sitting with members of her family, also shook her head and wiped away tears.As Cregan was cleared of the remaining count he faced, there was a shout of "Yeah!" from the back of the dock and Cregan turned around with a smileHe smiled and shook hands with the other defendants after the verdicts. His co-accused Anthony Wilkinson looked directly at the public gallery where the victims' families were seated, with a broad smile on his face.Leon Atkinson, 35, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Ryan Hadfield, 29, from Droylsden, and Matthew James, 33, from Clayton, were cleared of the murder of Mark Short in the Cotton Tree pub and the attempted murders of three others in the pub.Luke Livesey, 28, from Hattersley, and Damian Gorman, 38, from Glossop, were found guilty of those charges.Anthony Wilkinson, 34, from Beswick, pleaded guilty during the trial to murdering David Short and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was cleared of one count of attempted murder of Hark on the same day and cleared of causing an explosion with a hand-grenade.Francis Dixon, 38, from Stalybridge, was acquitted of the murder of David Short, the attempted murder of Hark and causing an explosion with a hand-grenade.Jermaine Ward, 24, was found guilty of the murder of David Short but cleared of the attempted murder of Hark and causing an explosion with a hand-grenade.Mohammed Ali, 32, from Chadderton, was found guilty of assisting an offender.The crown had alleged that last summer's violence was sparked by a "long-standing feud" between two rival Manchester families â€“ the Shorts and the Atkinsons.The Cotton Tree shooting was said to have been ordered by Atkinson and carried out by Cregan with the help of others.Atkinson looked at the floor and put a hand on his head as he was cleared of all charges.Dixon shouted: "Yes!" as he was cleared. Ward, sitting behind him, burst into tears.Roderick Carus QC, defending Atkinson, asked for his client to be discharged, along with the other defendants cleared of all charges - Hadfield, James, and Dixon.Dixon is on a life licence for his past serious convictions, which the jury was not told about as they were ruled inadmissible before the trial.Cregan shook hands with Wilkinson and Ali as they were taken down past him in the dock.
