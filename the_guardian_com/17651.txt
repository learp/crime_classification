The man wrongly linked to the murder of Joanna Yeates hopes a forthcoming drama about him will show the destructive nature of certain elements of the UK press.Retired teacher Christopher Jefferies was arrested when Yeates, who rented a flat from him, was found dead on Christmas Day 2010.He was questioned for two days before being bailed by police and eliminated from the inquiry several months later.Vincent Tabak, who lived next to Yeates in Bristol, was jailed for life in October 2011 after being convicted of her murder.Jefferies's experiences will be told in The Lost Honour, a two-part ITV drama scripted by Oscar-nominated writer Peter Morgan. Jefferies will be played by Being Human star Jason Watkins.Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol on the third anniversary of the inquiry, Jefferies said he had tried to get on with his life."When Peter Morgan first got in touch with me he made it entirely clear that if I would be very uncomfortable, then he wouldn't go ahead, he wouldn't make the film," Jefferies said."So right from the start he was entirely principled and from what he said it was clear to me that the interest that he had in the story was in no way sensational. "He was entirely sincere in what he wanted to do. I suppose one of the things that I hope will emerge from the film is one of the things that I think emerged from the Leveson inquiry, was to make people realise the kind of press – at least certain sections of it – that we have in this country and how destructive they are and how amoral they are."It's about the damage that can be done. It happens to be about me but it's about the damage that can be done to somebody by certain elements of the media, who are not in the least bit concerned with the people whose reputations they trash.Filming for the drama has already begun in Bristol.Jefferies successfully sued a number of newspapers for libel following coverage of his arrest in 2010 and later gave evidence before the Leveson inquiry.In 2013, Jefferies also received an apology from Avon and Somerset police for distress he suffered during the murder investigation.Jefferies said he felt "extremely fortunate" to get redress through the courts.The landlord told BBC Bristol how he had changed his appearance after his arrest to prevent being recognised when he went outside."When I was released from custody I had no idea that I was simply going to have to stay indoors for almost all day and only occasionally go out at night in order to avoid a media scrum," Jefferies said.
