Dartmoor and Liverpool prisons were yesterday named as the worst in Britain and given six months to improve or face being taken over by a private prison company.The prisons minister, Hilary Benn, said yesterday the "performance test" on the two jails would start immediately and two further "failing" prisons would be named in June to follow them. At the same time the prison service named 10 jails which they said were "coasting" and would be given special management support to help them improve. Mr Benn said those named as failing prisons were being given six months to produce proposals for a much-improved level of service. Failure to deliver and implement a plan to achieve real improvements would result in a decision to contract out the prison.
