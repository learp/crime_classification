For far too long, antisocial behaviour was treated by policymakers and politicians as akin to bad manners, something to be regretted but about which little could be done. The reality for millions is that their lives can be made miserable - even in their own homes - by noise, thuggishness and malign behaviour, such as racial and homophobic harassment, all of which are still too prevalent in Britain.It was Jack Straw who first pledged a 'micro' approach to improving the communities in which people live. Litter, graffiti and bad behaviour should be targeted with 'zero tolerance'. The former Home Secretary spoke movingly more than once about the reality of life in his Blackburn constituency. Now his successor is to pilot an Antisocial Behaviour Bill. Much of its content is welcome. What is not, however, acceptable in this legislative portmanteau are proposals to target begging, making it a recordable offence with tougher penalties after three convictions. Ministers claim that beggars, many of whom have a drug habit, will secure easier access to rehabilitation. The reality is that most drugs rehab is massively over-subscribed. Six-month waiting lists are commonplace and police and social workers find it almost impossible to track the homeless. Consequently, custody now risks becoming the only way to ensure that people can be reached with certainty when help becomes available. This is an utterly disproportionate response to the needs of a vulnerable group. Begging is a blight, but already an offence. It should be addressed with accessible, adequately funded support for the people involved. The Government's proposal smacks all too starkly of the sort of high-profile posturing that New Labour's communications experts have often told us had been abandoned.
