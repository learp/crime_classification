When you are desperate, anything goes. It was always clear the Tories would attack Labour on three key fronts: race, tax and crime. With the first two having blown up in their face, the third target was brought forward yesterday to coincide with Labour's manifesto. Crime has always produced the most nauseating deliberate distortions. All sides indulge, but the Tory party's political election broadcast on Tuesday night must have reached a new low - with its deliberate exaggeration of the risks posed by Labour's home detention curfew scheme, under which only 3% of 35,000 offenders given early release re-offended, compared to up to 60% of normal releases. This election, as our home affairs editor discloses today in his exclusive leak on the Halliday sentencing report, could end with the UK lurching into yet another massive prison-building programme. A system which already imprisons more people than the most hardline overseas states - Burma, China, Saudi Arabia - is on the brink of adding another 10,000 inmates to the 65,000 already inside.Contrary to popular belief, crime continues to fall. The main reason has nothing to with prison - or numbers of police officers - but intelligently designed crime prevention programmes that cost one-tenth of the price of a prison place. Car crime has dropped by 15% and burglary by 20% since the last election because of more secure cars and houses. Violent crime, which only amounts to 14% of all crime, has continued to rise - as it has done for the last 10 years - but is now being targeted. The review of sentencing by John Halliday, director of criminal justice policy at the Home Office, was set up to report after a May election. It sets out a series of intelligent options, including well-designed rehabilitation and community programmes, but only its toughest options are going to be heeded in the decibel auction of the next three weeks. Indeed, Labour trumpeted yesterday a sentencing overhaul that would lead to "tougher punishment".Labour's 10-year crime plan, published in February, already includes proposals for 3,000 more custody places. There are five ways its existing plan could push up prison numbers. Now Halliday's most pessimistic projection sets out an extra 9,500. This is obscene. Each place will cost £72,000 in capital and £26,000 a year in running costs - over £1bn in extra public expenditure. Is a Labour government, promising radical reforms, ready to approve such waste? Remember the existing system is already cutting prison education under Treasury budget cuts. Forget civil liberties, economics alone insists this should be stopped.
