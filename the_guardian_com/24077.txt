A key report into the Mark Kennedy controversy is due to be published tomorrow morning. Back in the summer, Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, set up a judge-led inquiry into claims that prosecutors suppressed secret surveillance tapes recorded by Kennedy, the undercover police officer, in the trial of a group of environmental activists.The inquiry has been conducted by Sir Christopher Rose, a retired High Court judge. No word yet on his verdict. The background to the allegations can be found here and here.Starmer set up the inquiry following allegations published by the Guardian and BBC Newsnight that prosecutors had concealed vital evidence over the collapse of a trial against six activists accused of conspiring to break into the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station.The Crown Prosecution Service has chosen to announce the publication of the report late this afternoon - for some reason.
