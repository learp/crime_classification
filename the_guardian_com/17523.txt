The populist move to give victims a bigger say in the criminal justice system is taking us on to dangerous ground.A criminal should be punished no more or less severely because his victim is worthy or unworthy, or cannot be found, or is dead, or because there is no victim. As a victim, I may demand an eye for eye, or I may forgive.There may be many victims, and they may have different opinions. In the Lockerbie case, some victims' families demand that nothing should be done to restore Libya to the family of nations, while Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter was killed, has said that he will apologise to the convicted perpetrator because he played an influential part in a trial about whose verdict he feels unhappy.I have lived with a primitive tribal system of justice in parts of Arabia. In a homicide case, the relatives of the victim may kill the killer or may accept blood money. This ancient system was made less barbarous by codification, in the book of Exodus on the one hand and in sharia law on the other. In our tradition, it has been replaced as a matter of ethics by the Christian principle of forgiveness and as a matter of law by the Roman principle that justice is blind, that is to say impartial.If I, or someone close to me, were to be a victim, I do not know whether I would be able to live up to the Christian principle. If I could not, I hope I would at least be able to draw back from involvement in the criminal process. I assume that my feelings would be such that I could not pretend to retain my sense of balance, and that being the case, I would not wish to influence the process.I agree with Francis Bacon. Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more man's nature runs to, the more the law ought to weed out.
