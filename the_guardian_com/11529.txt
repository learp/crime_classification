Detectives investigating the murder of PC Keith Blakelock during the 1985 disturbances at Broadwater Farm, north London, have arrested two men on suspicion of murder, it emerged today.The suspects, aged 52 and 46, were arrested at separate London addresses on Friday and interviewed before being released on bail until September.Blakelock, a father of three, was murdered during the riots in Tottenham, north London. He was thought to have been hacked to death by rioters armed with sticks and machetes. A second PC, Richard Coombes, was also attacked during the incident.The unrest at Broadwater Farm, a large housing estate, followed the death of 49-year-old Cynthia Jarrett, the mother of a man arrested over a motoring offence, who collapsed during a subsequent police search of her home.A fresh inquiry into the Blakelock killing was launched in December 2003.A Metropolitan police spokesman said the two arrested men, who would have been aged 27 and 21 in 1985, were both originally from Tottenham. A third suspect, aged 40, was arrested in Suffolk in February, and is also on police bail. Investigators believe people in the Tottenham area have information about the identity of the killers not shared with the police.Six people were charged with the murder, including Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip. The three were convicted in 1987 but cleared on appeal four years later. Three youths were also charged with murder but did not face trial after a judge ruled their questioning inadmissible. The newly arrested men are not believed to include any of the six who were charged by the police.
