Prisoners could be allowed to claim housing benefit for up to six months into their sentences under a plan being considered by the government's social exclusion unit.The proposal, which is part of drive to cut down on the high levels of homelessness among former prisoners, is included in a leaked report of the unit's inquiry into reducing reoffending rates.It also recommends paying former inmates £100 in benefit on their release, instead of the current £40.The inquiry has been investigating ways of boosting employment and lowering homelessness among ex-offenders.A spokeswoman for the unit could not confirm or deny whether the proposals, which were leaked to the BBC's Today programme, will be included in the final report.She said: "The report is due out shortly. It will make recommendations to government on measures to reduce reoffending and so reduce the level of crime committed by released prisoners."She added that a third of prisoners are homeless on release.Housing benefit used to be paid to prisoners for up to 12 months of their sentence. That system was replaced by the Conservative government in 1995 with the controversial 13 week rule. Under the rule, which is still in place, prisoners are only entitled to housing benefit for the first 13 weeks of their sentence. Those with sentences of more than 13 weeks are not entitled to housing benefit. A spokesman for the ex-offenders charity Nacro welcomed the leaked report.He said: "A homeless ex-prisoner is more than twice as likely to reoffend as one who has a home to go to. Making sure released prisoners have access to appropriate housing is fundamental to helping them put crime behind them."Restricting housing benefit is not only draconian it makes a nonsense of any coherent attempt to improve the chance of released prisioners leading crime free lives."
