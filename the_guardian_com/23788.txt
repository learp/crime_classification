Hazel Blears, the former communities secretary at the centre of an expenses controversy, has had her car attacked in her Salford constituency, it emerged today.Teenagers slashed two tyres and damaged the front window on her Citroën Xsara Picasso while the MP was out canvassing among her constituents.Blears told the Manchester Evening News that she did not think it was a protest related to her expenses and that instead it was just the work of "teenagers with nothing to do on a hot afternoon".She also said it was the work of "tiny minority".But Norman Eaton, a resident who witnessed the incident, told the Evening News that he thought she was being targeted because of her expenses."This is the people of Salford telling her that they don't accept what she has done," he said."She was with a couple of minders and her husband. Lots of people saw them and people know it's her car. They came back and the front window was damaged and the tyres had been slashed."They tried to drive off, but they were going nowhere. Next thing, police vans turned up."Blears was criticised when the Daily Telegraph started publishing the details of MPs' expenses claims because it emerged that she had twice sold a London property funded through the second home allowance without paying capital gains tax. Although she had not broken any rules, she agreed to pay HM Revenue around £13,000 to cover the unpaid tax.Gordon Brown described her behaviour as "completely unacceptable" – a remark that angered Blears and her supporters, who felt that she was being treated more unfairly than other ministers who had also made controversial claims.Blears announced that she was resigning the day before the local and European elections. This infuriated some Labour activists who felt it was damaging to the party's prospects and there was subsequently an attempt to deselect her in Salford.Blears survived after winning round activists with an admission that she had made a mistake to resign when she did.
