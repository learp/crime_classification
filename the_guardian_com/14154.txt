Marjorie Larose, now 80, was attacked in July 1998 as she lay in bed in her bungalow in Marple, Greater Manchester.Two boys aged 14 burst into her bedroom at 5am. One began smashing her leg with a wine bottle, the other hit her in the face with a brick. Her jaw was fractured and she suffered other severe injuries to her skull and one eye. The boys, who stole rings and cash, were sent to detention centres for seven and five years. Police called it a "horrendous, callous attack". "I don't know what it was but I just sensed that something was in the room. I looked up and saw these two dark figures standing in front of me. I said, 'Who are you? What do you want?'. Then something crashed on my face and I was being beaten around the leg. I don't remember any more until I came to. I just felt something on my pillow and it was a brick and it was covered in blood. I had to get help and I could feel the blood trickling down into my mouth. I stumbled out of bed and my feet were crunching over broken glass. I saw the orange emergency light on the phone and pressed it. The police came and I went to hospital. I was there for about four weeks. I was in terrible pain and I couldn't stop being sick. I was shaking and in a terrible state. What upset me more than anything was when my daughter came. When she saw me and heard what had happened, she had to keep going out to be sick. Now I'm registered partially sighted and I had to have teeth taken out because they had been loosened. I have terrible pains in my legs and constant pain in my head. My memory has been badly affected. I just can't remember anything. I turn up for things and it's the wrong date, I can't remember where I should be going and my daughter has to ring me every day to tell me what I should be doing. I feel very angry and bitter that those boys have got away very lightly."
