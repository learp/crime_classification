The long-running investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence could yet end in a prosecution, the senior officer in charge of the case insisted today.Deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of the Metropolitan police's racial crimes unit, said new evidence continued to emerge, even several years after the 18 year old's killing."I'm inspired by some cases both here and in the United States where even up to 30 years later evidence comes out," Mr Grieve told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme."I think what happens is people change their allegiances, their alliances, but particularly the way they think about some of this."We have been talking to people who actually say that what happened then was not right, and they want to try and do something to put it right. I think there has been a shift in thinking."So we look for ... people who have evidence from the time, and we are still appealing to them, I beg them come forward before we come to you."Mr Grieve continued: "I very strongly believe that it is possible to prosecute in these circumstances."The question will always be whether we can cross the kind of complex evidential and criminal justice hurdles that are created by the last nine years and the 15 previous investigations of different kinds ... It's quite a complex legal maze."The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, said in July this year that he knew who killed Stephen. But Mr Grieve declined to say that he knew who carried out the killing."My position would always be it is a matter for a jury. You don't want cops, you don't want me deciding who is guilty," he said.The Metropolitan police's failure to bring Stephen's killers to justice has been a major source of frustration and embarrassment for the force, which was branded "institutionally racist" in a damning official report into the initial murder inquiry.A-level student Stephen was stabbed to death when he and his friend, Duwayne Brooks, were attacked by a gang of white youths in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.Soon after the murder, five men - brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, and David Norris, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight - were arrested. But proceedings against Neil Acourt and Luke Knight were later discontinued by the crown prosecution service following a meeting with the senior investigating officer.Stephen's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, took up a private prosecution against the five following the CPS's decision, but the case against Jamie Acourt and David Norris was dropped at the committal stage.Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson eventually stood trial for murder at the Old Bailey in April 1996.A week after the start of proceedings, the jury was ordered to find the defendants not guilty after the judge decided Duwayne Brooks's evidence was unreliable. As the law stands now, they cannot be tried again for the same crime. In February 1997 an inquest into Stephen's death ended with the jury deciding that the teenager had been "unlawfully killed in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths".
