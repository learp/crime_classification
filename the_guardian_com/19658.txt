Scientific evidence which helped convict Barry George of the murder of the BBC presenter Jill Dando six years ago has since been codified by the government's Forensic Science Service as "of no value", the Guardian understands.The guidance on the evidence, a speck of firearms residue found deep in the pocket of George's coat, was circulated internally by the Forensic Science Service early last year in a paper on gunshot residue.The paper was seized upon by lawyers at the Criminal Cases Review Commission who have spent five years examining various theories in the George case.It is the scientists' opinion that single speck ballistics evidence is of no value which formed the basis of yesterday's decision by the review commission to refer the case to the court of appeal, where George's lawyers will argue the murder conviction must be quashed as unsafe.The Crown Prosecution Service said yesterday it was examining the evidence. It is understood the CPS and the Metropolitan police will contest the appeal, which is likely to be heard this year.If the appeal succeeds a decision will be made on whether a retrial would be possible so long after the murder.George's solicitor Jeremy Moore said he and his client were "very pleased" by the decision and commended the review commission for its "extremely thorough and careful approach" to the case.Mr Moore said: "We hope finally to persuade the court of appeal that the verdict in this case was clearly unsafe. Mr George has now spent seven extremely difficult years in custody for a conviction which ... will be seen as one of the gravest miscarriages of justice of recent years."George, 47, was convicted in July 2001 of murdering Dando on the doorstep of her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26 1999. The BBC presenter was shot in the head. No weapon was ever found, there were no eyewitnesses and no motive was presented.George, who used several different aliases, including Barry Bulsara, the real name of Freddie Mercury from Queen, had a variety of personality disorders. He was presented as a fantasist who stalked and photographed hundreds of women.George was arrested 13 months after the murder when a review by the police murder squad team of outstanding names in the system flagged him up.It emerged later that the police were given information which pointed out George as a potential suspect in May and June 1999, just weeks after the murder. Nothing was done with this information until eight months later.A picture found by police in George's flat in April 2000 showed him brandishing a modified handgun, similar to that used to kill Dando, a weapon which was never found.A scientist discovered a speck of firearms residue deep in the pocket of the black Cecil Gee coat a month later - more than a year after the murder.Doubt was cast on the significance of the residue at George's trial and the judge warned the jury against viewing it alone as significant. The jury convicted by 10:1, and a year later George lost his first appeal.Over the last five years lawyers from the Criminal Cases Review Commission have examined and dismissed more than 17 potential grounds for appeal, including the claim that a Serbian hitman killed the BBC presenter. Graham Zellick, chairman of the CCRC, said too much weight had been placed on the residue evidence. "The particle was found a year later, it was found in a pocket and was such a small speck it could not be seen," he said. "The consensus view now is that in those circumstances for a whole variety of reasons you can infer virtually nothing from that. It neither points to guilt or innocence, it is neutral."Our investigation of this case could not have been more thorough or intensive."It is understood, however, that a review by Strathclyde police of the ballistics evidence found that there was no dispute that it was firearms discharge residue and that it was also consistent with that found on the bullet wound and the cartridge case at the scene.Presenter Nick Ross, a former colleague of Dando's, said yesterday he "rather expected" the appeal to be granted. Of the firearms evidence he said: "I thought it was the most irrelevant piece of evidence of the lot."But he said there were large amounts of other evidence that pointed to George as the murderer, such as witness statements.Dando was 37 and anticipating her forthcoming marriage when she died. After joking to friends she would end up as the career woman who turns around at 40 and says, "Oh God, I forgot to get married and have children," she became engaged to gynaecologist Alan Farthing in 1999.She was wearing the Â£20,000 solitaire diamond engagement ring he gave her when she was shot.In interviews after her death he said: "Jill believed everyone was fundamentally the same, and treated everyone the same."TimelineApril 26 1999: Jill Dando, the 37-year-old television presenter, is shot dead with a single bullet to the head on the steps of her home in Fulham, south-west London.May 25 2000: Police arrest Barry George, also known as Barry Bulsara, following surveillance of his home.May 29 2000: Police charge George with murdering Dando.July 2 2001: A jury finds George guilty of murder. He is later sentenced to life imprisonment.July 29 2002: George loses appeal against conviction at court of appeal in London. Three judges rejected his claim that his conviction was "unsafe".December 16 2002: House of Lords refuses permission for George to mount a further challenge to his conviction.March 25 2006: It emerges that lawyers for George have submitted new evidence to the CCRC which they believe undermines the safety of his conviction. They say they have new medical evidence which suggests George's mental problems would have made him incapable of carrying out the crime, and that new witnesses who were not heard at the original trial may provide an explanation for why a particle of gunshot residue was found on his coat.
