Convicted stalkers will be put on the sex offenders' register and may be banned from sensitive jobs, while thieves whose crimes appear sexually motivated - such as stealing women's underwear - will also face registration. Registered offenders can be blacklisted from careers such as teaching or nursing and forced to undergo supervision after release from jail.Child abductors will also be registered for the first time. This follows the case of Terry Delaney, who was jailed for four years in April for a failed attempt to abduct a 13-year-old girl. The judge in his trial said the law 'makes no sense' after discovering that he could not put Delaney on the register because of the offence with which he was charged.John Reid, the Home Secretary, will lay regulations in parliament this week to amend legislation covering the register, which already holds around 30,000 names nationwide. While some offences, such as rape, automatically lead to registration, the police and courts would decide if the new categories of offender was to be be added.
