Two boys aged 15 and 16 have been charged with the murder of a man who was beaten to death outside a church, police said yesterday. William Wickham, a 44-year-old trawlerman, from Gosport, Hampshire was found dying on a grassy area next to Holy Trinity church in Gosport on Monday night. A postmortem examination found he had died as a result of a serious physical assault.The two teenagers, also from Gosport, are due to appear before magistrates at Fareham today. A spokeswoman for Hampshire police, Lucy Dibden, said: "Two youths aged 15 and 16 have been charged with murder by detectives from our major crime team." Wickham had a nine-year-old son, Louis, by his former girlfriend, Lynne Stevens. After the attack, she said Louis was struggling to cope with his father's death. She said: "He's still in shock. It just hasn't sunk in for him yet. He feels very angry." The Reverend Andy Davis, the vicar of Holy Trinity church, said: "It's an area where people usually come to enjoy the peace and quiet, so this is particularly shocking and tragic. For someone to be murdered right next to our church is deeply disturbing. "We have certainly never had any trouble like this before. That area is dark at night and is used as a cut through by people who have travelled on the ferry from Portsmouth." David McAlesse, 35, whose flat overlooks the church, said: "I heard a lot of shouting and I just thought it was young people having a good time, I was surprised to hear that it was a murder. It's just so shocking. "I heard a lot of raised voices and just thought it was about alcohol, but didn't think it was anything this bad." A 47-year-old man and a 32-year-old man also arrested in connection with the killing have been released on police bail.
