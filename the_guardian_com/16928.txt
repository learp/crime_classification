A video of a teenager describing the harrowing moment when he and his 11-year-old sister found their mother's mutilated body has been played to a murder jury.Terry Marsh was 14 when he gave the interview to police investigating the murder of Heather Barnett at the family's home in Bournemouth, Dorset.Their neighbour, Italian national Danilo Restivo, is on trial for murdering Barnett and is also facing allegations of killing a 16-year-old girl, Elisa Claps, in Italy.Both victims had suffered horrific stab wounds to their chest and hanks of their hair were left at the scene, Winchester crown court has been told. In Barnett's case, hair belonging to someone else had also been placed in one of her hands.In the interview, Terry told officers that he and his sister, Caitlin, arrived home from school just before 4pm on 12  November 2002."My sister started calling out and there was no answer," he said. "It was at that moment, when the house was silent, then I thought something's wrong here – nothing visually, just quiet."Terry said he went into his bedroom and took his school clothes off and his sister asked: "Where is she, then?"Caitlin then went to the closed bathroom door and knocked but there was no reply, so she opened a little and Terry said she went "absolutely ballistic" when she saw her mother lying on the floor dead.Terry then saw her body and knew something had happened, but he said he was not scared because "there is nothing I could do about it".He continued: "I went into the bathroom. I just opened the door halfway. I saw her lying on her back with blood. I saw blood absolutely everywhere and I thought, 'Oh no'. When I saw the blood I thought this ain't no accident."He told the 999 operator he wanted both the police and ambulance because his "mum's been murdered".The prosecution alleges that Restivo, now 39, who lived opposite the family, murdered Barnett, 48. It has claimed that Restivo has a hair fetish and murdered and mutilated her with the same "hallmark" method he used to kill Claps in Potenza in southern Italy in 1993.Restivo denies murdering Barnett. The jury has been told that a police inquiry on the murder of Claps is under way in Italy but it will not have to make a decision on that case.The trial continues.
