The perpetrators of almost 2,000 unsolved murders over the past 30 years of violence are likely to continue to escape justice because of pressure on police resources and the inherent difficulties in pursuing older cases, Northern Ireland's chief constable admitted last night.Hugh Orde insisted his detectives must be allowed to concentrate on present-day crime, which meant there was little realistic chance of obtaining convictions on around 1,800 killings - more than half of those carried out over the past 30 years of terrorism, and including more than 200 of the 300 police officers murdered.Instead, he suggested some sort of truth and reconciliation commission might be able to provide closure for the relatives of victims.Under the Patten recommendations to reform the service, the full-time strength of the service has been virtually halved to 7,500 officers.Mr Orde said: "The numbers of officers I would have to employ to carry out that job [re- examining past murders] is simply unachievable." A substantial number of past cases are already being reviewed."We will look at cases where the chances of success, due to forensic advancements or witnesses coming forward, give us a chance of a positive outcome," said the chief constable, in an interview with BBC Northern Ireland. "But the longer a case goes on, the older the case is, the harder it is to solve in an evidential format. My primary focus is to prevent any more murders, reduce the opportunities for serious crime, and to investigate the most recent murders."Mr Orde courted controversy in February when he suggested the Bloody Sunday tribunal, into the shooting dead of 13 Derry men by soldiers in 1972, was too costly and would satisfy no one.His latest remarks could also provoke criticism, particularly from those who have had loved ones murdered, and who will want to know exactly why some past crimes should be deemed worthy of further investigation and others not.Others will agree with the chief constable that some type of truth commission, perhaps with elements of the one established in South Africa, might be the answer.Mr Orde added: "There needs to be something that gives everyone an opportunity to say their piece, to get the best explanation they can on what happened to their families, their loved ones, so that they can then get on with their lives."
