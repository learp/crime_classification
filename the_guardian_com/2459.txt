A total of 196 convicted violent or sex offenders have been charged with a further offence of murder, rape or other serious crime while under the supervision of the probation service, according to Ministry of Justice figures published today.The figure includes 14 offenders ranked as medium or high risk who have been charged with a murder or rape after leaving prison in the past year.The official figures also show that the number of registered sex offenders in England and Wales rose by more than 2,500 in 2009/10 to 34,939.A total of 1,116 registered sex and violent offenders were returned to prison for breaching the terms of their release licences – 300 fewer than the previous year. Another 89 were sent back to prison for breaching the terms of a sex offences prevention order.The annual figures appear to be a further blow to public confidence in the probation service in a week when the justice secretary, Ken Clarke, has said he hopes an element of "payment by results" can be brought in as a way of finding more effective rehabilitative sentences.The debate over the quality of supervision by the probation and police services of released prisoners has been dominated by cases such as that of Daniel Sonnex, who tortured and murdered two French research students , Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, in London when he should have been recalled to prison.Ministry of justice officials point out that the figure of 196 convicted violent or sexual offenders who have been charged with further offences has been inflated this year by including level one offenders – the lowest level – on the sex offenders register for the first time.There were 31 level two offenders – the intermediate level – convicted of further offences and three level three offenders – the highest level, known as the "critical few", which involves the most intensive forms of supervision on release from prison, including specialised accommodation.The 34 who committed further serious offences this year compares with 48 last year, but some changes in counting methods are involved in those figures.The Ministry of Justice said that a serious case review was held for 14 of the level two and level three offenders who went on to commit another serious offence. The figures did not include level 1 offenders who triggered a serious case review.Serious case reviews, triggered when the further offence involves a murder or rape, are carried out under the multi-agency public protection arrangements, known as Mappas, which bring together the police, probation, and prison services.The Ministry of Justice figures show that 48,338 violent and sexual offenders were eligible for supervision under the Mappa arrangements on 31 March this year. This figure includes 34,939 sex offenders. The remainder were violent or other dangerous offenders assessed to pose a risk of harm to the public.Crispin Blunt, the prisons and probation minister, said the probation service and the police delivered a robust system that effectively monitored potentially unpredictable and dangerous behaviour by Mappa offenders."The risk of further offences can never be eliminated entirely which is why Mappa is a critical tool in protecting the public and reducing serious reoffending," he said. "The number of individuals who reoffend seriously has historically been a very small percentage of those offenders managed under Mappa."Paul West, the public protection spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: "The staged roll-out of the child sex offender disclosure scheme has significantly enhanced our ability to protect families from potential harm and has provided another critical layer that empowers parents, carers and guardians to take active steps to protect their children."While the reality is that the risks posed by some offenders can never be completely eliminated, we will continue to do all in our power to keep them to a minimum."
