The parents of the murdered schoolboy Rhys Jones today said they could finally begin rebuilding their lives after the conviction of his killer, Sean Mercer.Speaking outside Liverpool crown court, Rhys's father, Stephen, thanked wellwishers around the world for their support."Finally, justice has been done for Rhys," the 45-year-old said with his wife, Melanie, by his side."First, we would like to record our enormous gratitude to Merseyside police for their professionalism and perseverance in securing this outcome, especially for Detective Superintendent Dave Kelly."From the day Rhys died, the kindness shown by the people of Liverpool has been immeasurable, for which we will always thank them from the bottom of our heart. Over the months, we have found strength in messages of support from the many thousands around the world. As a family, today is not the final chapter, but we can begin the challenge of rebuilding our lives."Kelly, the senior investigating officer, said Rhys's family had "suffered untold grief and distress"."Our deepest sympathies go out to Steve, Melanie and [Rhys's brother] Owen. Nothing can bring Rhys back, but we hope his family will find some peace in the fact that justice has been done," Kelly said."Mercer's actions on August 22 [2007] showed total disregard for Rhys and others. Since killing Rhys and during his trial, it is fair to say Sean Mercer has shown no remorse whatsoever. We only hope that the verdict will bring home to him the enormity of what he has done and the pain and suffering he has caused."The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said she was "pleased" Mercer and his accomplices had been brought to justice."This was a tragic case which shocked the whole nation, and I hope that this verdict brings some peace to Rhys's parents, family and friends at this difficult time," she said."I would like to congratulate Merseyside police for their efforts investigating this case, working with the local community and supporting witnesses to come forward and identify Rhys's killer."
