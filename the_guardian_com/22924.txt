A motorist who crawled along a motorway in her car at less than 10mph was banned from driving today.Stephanie Cole, 57, from Bristol, repeatedly slammed on her brakes as she straddled the hard shoulder of the M32.On the back of her car she had affixed a sign saying: "I do not drive fast, please overtake."When officers stopped Cole she told them she had "no confidence" on the motorway.She was banned from driving for a week and told she must retake her test. She was also given a three-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay court costs of Â£35.Cole, who had pleaded guilty to driving without reasonable consideration, told North Avon magistrates court that her GP had been treating her for "fear of driving" for the past three-and-a-half years.She was travelling from her home to a Staples stationery store when police arrested her on August 30.The officer had followed her as she drove between the hard shoulder and the motorway at speeds of less than 10mph (16km/h)Dawn Killick, chairwoman of the bench, said the ban was imposed because they had serious concerns about her driving ability, for her own safety and for the safety of others.Before sentencing Cole said losing her driving licence would mean she would have "no life".She told the Bristol Evening Post that she had suffered from multiple sclerosis since she was 25 and relied on her driving licence to get around."I cannot walk any distance at all and rely on my wheelchair and my car," she said."I am too disabled to stand at a bus stop and cannot afford taxis on income support, so I have no alternative."
