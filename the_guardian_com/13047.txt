When Mark Wells shouted, "Help me, help me, please!" in the middle of the night, neighbours were too frightened to intervene. One neighbour heard his "pleading" tone, but his friend dismissed it as a drunk. In the morning, Wells was dead: he suffocated after falling head-first into a storm drain metres from his home in Newport on the Isle of Wight.The coroner did not blame residents for ignoring the 32-year-old's cries, saying it was "a sad reflection on society that people were too scared to venture out of their homes when they heard screams".We seem to believe that any modern good Samaritan will be stabbed if they don't walk on by, but can we help safely â€“ and how should we do it?"People are nervous about getting involved, particularly if it's a fight, but the worst thing is to do nothing," says Bill Fox, chairman of conflict management specialists Maybo.The charity Kidscape encourages children to intervene if friends are being bullied or attacked. "You cannot be a bystander. If you walk by and do nothing, you are colluding with the person doing the harm," says Kidscape founder Michele Elliott. "If one person had stopped to help that man in a drain, other people would have stepped in," says Elliott.To take action without getting hurt, first take a mental step back and think about the unfolding situation, according to Fox. "The key thing is to find help," he says. Phone the police, tell someone else to phone 999 or enlist the help of passersby. "People will get up and help but usually it takes someone to lead."What if you are the person in trouble? The common suggestion that shouting "fire" is the best way to raise the alarm if you are being assaulted is unhelpful. Instead Fox advises asking passersby for something specific. Rather than a vague cry for help, ask someone to call an ambulance. Then they can assist you without putting themselves at risk.
