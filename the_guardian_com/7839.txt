Men who pay for sex are as bad as child abusers, a senior government minister warned today, as she unveiled radical plans to protect prostitutes by targeting their clients. Under the proposals, schoolgirls will be taught about the dangers of selling sex, amid evidence that more than half of streetwalkers start out as teenagers.Police will also be expected to take prostitutes' complaints of rape seriously while a new database will enable call girls to swap details of violent and dangerous clients, as the balance shifts from targeting women who sell sex to the one in 10 men who buys it.Fiona MacTaggart, the Home Office minister, is also considering relaxing laws that prevent off-street prostitutes working in pairs from private flats, which reformers argue is safer than working solo.Dismissing the idea of women enjoying sex work - exemplified in the film Pretty Woman, which portrays Julia Roberts as a glamorous streetwalker - MacTaggart said the reality was grim exploitation.'I don't think most men who use prostitutes think of themselves as child abusers, but they are,' she told The Observer. 'It could change things if we changed the view of prostitution from "it's the oldest profession" to "this is the most common form of child abuse".'Women did not choose street prostitution, she said, but often ended up doing it because they had highly damaged backgrounds.Her review of prostitution, to be published on Tuesday, will create a national database of 'ugly mugs', allowing prostitutes to warn others about clients they consider dangerous.With more than 60 prostitutes killed in the past 10 years, police will be expected to protect women in red-light areas, while kerb crawlers will forfeit driving licences. MacTaggart said it was also crucial to stop girls being drawn into such work by 'helping to prevent prostitution being seen by them as a solution to their problems', either financially or within their families. 'Working in schools, particularly with children who might be vulnerable, is really important,' she added.Girls were 'groomed' over long periods to enter prostitution, she said: 'A very common route in is exchanging sexual services for drugs, or just being given them in order to get addicted. 'It starts as a gift relationship, then goes into a relationship which is exchanging sex for drugs, but then it's, "I can't afford to give you a rock [of crack] now, what about if you get the money another way?" It's the same kind of grooming process that happens with very small children.'The government has, however, ruled out legalising brothels or creating 'tolerance zones' where sex workers could avoid arrest, to the sex industry's fury.A spokeswoman for the English Collective of Prostitutes said it was 'outrageous' to equate prostitution and child abuse: 'It's as though women didn't know the difference between rape and abuse, and consenting sex. She is trying to take the decision out of women's hands.'However, Kathy Evans, of the Children's Society, welcomed the commitment to education and to treating prostitution as child abuse. Many men did not realise that it was now an offence to sleep with a prostitute aged under 18, even if she was over the age of consent, Evans added: 'Some of that rests in very old-fashioned ideas about prostitution - the idea that somehow the prostitute is enjoying it as much as the client. That's the client fantasy.'
