The mother of two toddlers found dead in the boot of her car has been remanded in custody charged with their murders.The bodies of Harry Donnison, three, and his sister Elise, two, were discovered after their mother, Fiona Donnison, went to Heathfield police station in East Sussex in a distressed state on Wednesday.Donnison, 43, of Marshwood Road, Lightwater, Surrey, was charged by Sussex police today and appeared at Lewes magistrates court accused of murdering the children between 25 and 28 January.Postmortem examinations revealed they had been dead for less than 24 hours when they were found in separate holdalls in the boot of the silver Nissan car, parked near the former family home in Heathfield. It is thought they had been asphyxiated.Donnison spoke in court only to confirm her name, date of birth and address. There was no application for bail during the 10-minute hearing and no plea was entered.The case was adjourned and Donnison will next appear at Lewes crown court for a preliminary hearing on 12 February.Former City worker Donnison, who was estranged from her husband, Paul, was discharged from Eastbourne District General hospital last night after being treated for apparently self-inflicted wounds.The court was told she would be transferred to a medium-secure psychiatric unit.Detectives said toxicology results were awaited before the cause of toddlers' deaths could be confirmed.Mr Donnison issued a statement through police last night describing Harry and Elise as "the lights that shone the brightest in my life".
