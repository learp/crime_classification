Drug busts by the UK's organised crimefighting agency have helped force dealers to push up their wholesale cocaine prices to record levels, the agency's boss claimed today.Trevor Pearce, head of enforcement at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), said the price a kilo had jumped from £39,000 last year to more than £45,000 as a result of undercover work and seizure operations.But his findings come amid a warning that UK cocaine's purity level is currently the lowest on record, as gangs use increasing amounts of chemicals such as insecticide and worming powder to dilute the drug sold on Britain's streets.Pearce told the BBC: "There is a discernible effect that we are now seeing in relation to the availability of cocaine both in Europe and also across the UK."We are now seeing high-quality cocaine at about £45,000 a kilo wholesale in the UK. That's significantly higher than it has been and has to be indicative of the pressure which the importers are under."Soca's estimate of wholesale cocaine prices two years ago was £35,000, according to the BBC. By the end of last year the price had risen to £39,000 and in the first few months of this year it hit the record level of more than £45,000 a kilo.Pearce said: "We are seeing wholesale prices of cocaine rising across Europe, in Spain and Belgium. We think that is due, to a large degree, to the strategy of working in South America, the Caribbean, across the Atlantic and with European partners – tackling it in a different way."Soca, which was billed as the UK's answer to the US's FBI when it was set up in 2006, has come under pressure over the past year to prove its worth.The agency said its activities in the run-up to Christmas stopped 10 tonnes of street-quality cocaine powder being sold in Britain.But figures obtained by the BBC suggest almost a third (31%) of police cocaine seizures are now less than 9% pure, the lowest recorded purity level.The data, collected by the Forensic Science Service (FSS), suggests drug gangs are using more and more chemicals to increase the drug's availability on the UK's streets.Joy Newman, a scientist with the FSS, told the BBC: "Purities now are quite low – between 5% and 40% in police seizures, and we have seen them as low as 4% or 5% in the last few weeks."Danny Kushlick, of the drugs policy foundation Transform, said the changes in cocaine price and purity were no more than a temporary blip and did not mean the war on drugs was being won.He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: "The war on drugs was lost a long time ago. We know that the long-term evidence shows that drug prices are falling, drugs are more available and more pure than they have ever been before over the long term."These things need to be seen in terms of their ability to sustain. However, we can buck the trend temporarily. This bucks the trend. It would be disingenuous to claim that this is the beginning of the end of the cocaine trade or anything like it."The fact is that the cocaine trade has been gifted to organised criminals by virtue of our fighting a war on drugs and our global prohibition. The government and Soca are grabbing at straws and cherry-picking statistics in order to dupe us into believing we are winning it. It can't be won."
