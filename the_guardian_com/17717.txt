Detectives investigating the linked murders of two young women 40 years ago have received more than 50 calls following a Crimewatch appeal for help in identifying the killer.Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old model who worked at London’s Playboy Club, was found in her east London home with her throat cut on 18 March 1975.Six months later, 16-year-old schoolgirl Lynne Weedon was attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow, west London, on 3 September. She died a week later.The murders were linked in July 2006 after a review and advances in technology revealed the same DNA had been found on both victims.Scotland Yard said it had received more than 50 calls since it appealed for help on BBC1’s Crimewatch on Thursday night and offered a reward of £40,000 for information leading to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the person or people responsible for the killings.Detectives offer £40,000 reward in 1975 double murder case Investigating officer DCI Noel McHugh said: “It’s inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years.“It’s a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years – maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate – and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.”Stratford, the daughter of an army medic father and a German mother, left her home in Warrington in 1972 and moved into a maisonette in Leyton with her boyfriend and aspiring rock singer Tony Priest.Known as Bunny Ava, she was photographed with the likes of Eric Morecambe and Sid James at the Playboy Club.She was suspended for breach of contract after she posed for rival publication Mayfair and appeared as the March 1975 centrefold. Within days, she was dead.On the day of her murder, a neighbour heard the voices of a man and a woman in conversation coming from Stratford’s flat – although the exchange was not thought to be heated – followed by a loud thud.Priest, a fork-lift truck driver who played in a psychedelic band called Onyx, discovered Stratford at 5.20pm with a nylon stocking tied around one of her ankles and a scarf around her hands. Stratford’s father, her last living relative, has since died without finding out who killed her or why. But Weedon’s parents, both in their 80s, still wait for answers. Margaret Weedon described the murder of her daughter as a life sentence for the family.“We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. We are left, 40 years on, always wondering what it would have been like. We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford,” she said.“The hurt eases but the pain still sits deep somewhere inside. There are so many questions, so many thoughts, so much heartache. I will make a mother’s plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford’s lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.”Detectives believe Weedon was followed on foot from Great West Road into an alleyway called The Short Hedges where she was hit with a lead pipe, thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity substation and raped.She was found by a school caretaker whose house overlooked the substation but never regained consciousness and died at West Middlesex hospital on 10 September 1975.Police drew up a list of 16 suspects but DNA from Stratford’s dressing-gown cord and the ankle binding did not match any of them.Anyone with information is asked to call the incident room on 020 8785 8099 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
