A nightclubber who attacked another man with a bottle has been jailed after his victim tracked him down using Facebook, police said today. Vincent Collymore, 33, of Southsea, Hampshire, was jailed for 15 months at Portsmouth crown court last month after pleading guilty to wounding. The attack, which happened at the Club 8 bar in Portsmouth, left Fouad Hamodu requiring 50 stitches to his jaw and neck. Hamodu recognised his attacker as a regular at R&B nights in the city and had heard his name mentioned. He then searched Facebook and found photographs of Collymore, which he showed to police.
