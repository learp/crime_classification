Greater Manchester police are searching for thieves who stole a funeral company's van with the body of a pensioner in the back.It was missing for more than 12 hours before police found it in a local street just before 6am yesterday. The Silver Mercedes van with the coffin containing the body of Anne Hamer, 69, had been parked outside F Hamer Ltd funeral directors in Bury, Greater Manchester. It was apparently unlocked and the keys were in the ignition when it was stolen. Mrs Hamer - no relation of the funeral company's owners - was a resident of Walmersley for 30 years. She died at the Hope hospital in Salford, where the funeral directors collected the body on Monday afternoon and took it back to Bury. Her sons, Andy and Tim Hamer, said: "We are glad it is all over. It has not been the easiest of times for anyone and to have this happen was unbelievable. We were stunned and in shock. "She was a great person who will be greatly missed by an awful lot of people." The sons said they had nothing against the funeral directors. "They were exemplary and they could not have done more for us," they said. "It must have been a very difficult time for them as well. As far as we are concerned, that is the end of the matter."
