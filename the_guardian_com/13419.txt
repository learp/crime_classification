A hospital nurse was jailed for five years today for trying to kill two elderly patients in a bid to free up hospital beds.Barbara Salisbury, 48, from Pontybodkin, north Wales, was accused of trying to kill the patients - May Taylor, 88, and Frank Owen, 92 - on her ward at Leighton Hospital in Crewe, Cheshire, between 1999 and 2002, by either administering overdoses of diamorphine or lying them flat on their backs to drown in their own lung secretions. She had earlier been cleared of the attempted murders of James Byrne, 76, and Reuben Thompson, 81.During the six-week trial the jury heard that Salisbury, a married mother of two, was motivated by a "ruthless" desire to free up beds.Mr Justice Pitchford told Salisbury it was impossible for him to fathom her motives.He continued: "Your duty and your trust was one of care towards your patients and under the direction of the doctors the respect for and preservation of human life. The jury has found that in the case of two elderly patients who were nearing their end you broke that duty and abused that trust by attempting to hasten their death." Salisbury's barrister, Peter Birkett QC, said in mitigation that his client had no criminal record and had suffered depression, for which she was treated in hospital from August 2002 to July 2003. Mr Justice Pitchford said he recognised these mitigating factors but had to hand down a punishment to fit the crime. Salisbury repeatedly denied the allegations against her, saying she never told James Byrne to "give in, it is time to go". She said she may have used the phrase "it is OK to go now" but only to soothe a dying man in his final moments.Salisbury told the court she could not remember any of the patients and denied any wrongdoing.A spokesman for Cheshire and Merseyside Strategic Health Authority said: "This has been a distressing case for all involved. We are grateful to the hospital staff who first raised their concerns and the trust for bringing the matter to the attention of the police," he said.
