Relatives of murdered British student Meredith Kercher have fiercely defended Italian police after accusations that their investigations are going off the rails due to lack of evidence and the alleged botching of crime scene procedures.Kercher's mother Arline, brother Kyle and sister Stephanie flew on Friday to Perugia, the Italian town where the 21-year-old exchange student was killed in November, to meet investigators before a pre-trial hearing that brought them face to face for the first time yesterday with suspect Raffaele Sollecito.'Despite attempts to perhaps discredit the evidence and undermine the process we have every faith in the police and in the forensic experts, our legal team and the Italian legal system,' Kyle Kercher said before they were driven to the hearing by police and British embassy staff.Italian computer graduate Sollecito, 24, who arrived in handcuffs at the hearing by a different entrance, remains in custody on suspicion of cutting Kercher's throat as she resisted what investigators believe was a sexual attack. Kercher was found semi-naked in a pool of blood.Also held on suspicion of murder and sexual violence are Kercher's American flatmate Amanda Knox, 20, and Rudy Guede, 21, who holds dual Italian and Ivory Coast nationality. All have denied involvement, although Guede claims he was present at the house and saw Sollecito and Knox there as well.Knox's family have claimed in two recent US television documentaries that their daughter, who was also studying on exchange in Perugia, was pressured by police in a 14-hour interrogation to admit she was in the house at the time Kercher was murdered, a claim she later retracted. Sollecito's lawyers stress that a sliced-off section of Kercher's bra on which his DNA was found was only discovered a month after the murder.'Our experts are concerned about accidental DNA contamination, particularly because the strap was moved within the bedroom,' said lawyer Marco Brusco.But Edgardo Giobbi, a detective with the Rome serious crime squad, hit back, claiming: 'All three left traces of their presence at the scene of the crime and were involved, we are convinced of that.' Those traces included what Giobbi called 'fresh' spots of Knox's blood mingled with Kercher's blood in the bathroom of the Perugia house they shared.Yesterday's hearing, which Knox and Guede declined to attend, was held to discuss a new report ordered by judge Claudia Matteini on the cause of death which suggests Kercher had sex before her death but possibly consensually, a conclusion already reached by the first autopsy report in November, which could undermine police theories of sexual assault.Police are also considering theft as a motive, since the 250 euros Kercher had withdrawn from a cashpoint machine two days before her death, probably to pay her rent, was missing. The new report suggested that two knives may have been used in the murder and that Kercher was extremely drunk at the time of her death, although one of the authors, Giancarlo Umani Ronchi, admitted yesterday that was 'not certain'.Italian law allows the suspects to be held for a year, and while police are set to wrap up their investigation in June or July with an initial court hearing likely in October, a trial may not start until mid-2009.
