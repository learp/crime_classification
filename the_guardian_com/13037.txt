The members of a gang believed to have been responsible for almost half the caravan thefts in the UK over a three-year period were jailed today.Charlie Ward, 28, Martin Ward, 21, John McDonagh, 31, and Martin McDonagh, 29, all members of the same family, were found to be in possession of more than £700,000 worth of stolen caravans, cars, motor homes, jewellery and cash when police detained them.After they were arrested in Wiltshire in 2007, the number of caravan thefts fell from 848 to 454 in a year.Winchester crown court heard that the men began stealing caravans from driveways and motorway service stations in 2004.Martin McDonagh and Charlie Ward, both fathers of five, were sentenced to four years and five years to be served consecutively for two conspiracies. John McDonagh and Martin Ward received four years for their part in one of the conspiracies. Only around half the value of the goods has been recovered by police.Sentencing the men, Judge Patrick Hooton said the crimes had caused distress and anguish to their victims. "This trial lasted for three months, and during the course of it I heard evidence of repeated thefts of caravans and motor vehicles which, in total, could be described as theft on a grand scale repeated time after time after time."The judge said the conspiracy had been well organised, adding: "All four, each in their own way ‑ in particular you, Charlie Ward and Martin McDonagh ‑ were responsible for all this."The men, who travelled between the UK and Ireland, showed no emotion as the sentences were handed down. All had previous convictions related to the theft of caravans. Confiscation proceedings will take place against the gang to seize their assets, the court was told. The men were ordered to co-operate with efforts to detail their worth.Detective Inspector Matt Davey, of Wiltshire police, revealed after the trial that insurance industry officials had reported a 47% drop in UK caravan thefts following the gang's arrest. Nineteen police forces were involved in the operation to catch the men, who were found guilty of conspiring to steal after the three-month trial but cleared of money laundering.
