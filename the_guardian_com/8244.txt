The Home Office statistics that underpin one in five of its key policy areas are simply "not up to scratch", the department's most senior official told MPs yesterday.Sir David Normington, who had to apologise yesterday to the Commons public accounts committee for supplying inaccurate data on anti-social behaviour orders, said 30 of the 160 main sets of figures covering crime, immigration and prisons used by the Home Office were simply not up to the job.The unreliability of key indicators was uncovered during a major inquiry into the quality and accuracy of Home Office statistics carried out since last summer on the orders of the new home secretary, John Reid, as part of his programme to make the department "fit for purpose".The 30 "datasets" that received a zero rating for reliability in the exercise are now being examined. Ministers are expected to announce measures to improve the quality of immigration statistics as a first step today.But while Sir David, the Home Office's permanent secretary, was willing to disclose this new embarrassment, he declined repeated requests from MPs to name the senior civil servant in his department suspended over the weekend pending disciplinary action .Sir David is in charge of the six-week inquiry into the failure to log the 27,500 criminal records of Britons convicted of offences abroad since 1999. He said it would be unfair to name the civil servant involved as it would create a "firestorm around him".However, he did say the official appeared to have known about the backlog which he and the "current set of ministers" had only learned about last week. "The information available to us, we thought, justified a suspension," he said.When Sir David was asked by MPs on the Commons public accounts committee whether he was satisfied with the service officials had provided to ministers, he replied: "In this case I think that we have fallen short ... I understand the damage that is being done to the Home Office by some of the present circumstances."Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats renewed their calls for an independent inquiry into the Home Office blunder over criminal records.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, claimed it was "entirely inappropriate" for a civil servant to be conducting the inquiry when ministers may be involved. "Why is it that civil servants get suspended for admitting the truth and ministers don't for hiding it?" he asked. "What's gone wrong in this fiasco ... who is responsible, and what's going to be done about it?"The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, also demanded to know whether any minister had been involved in a Home Office decision to reject a request from senior police officers last October for more funds to sort out the backlog in logging the conviction data from abroad.The police minister, Tony McNulty, again denied again that either he or his ministerial colleague, Joan Ryan, had been told about the problems involving the failure to process the backlog. He said a letter from the Association of Chief Police Officers he had seen in October was about the "efficacy of the contract" after the police took over the task in May.Mr Reid spoke yesterday to the European Union home affairs commissioner, Franco Frattini, about the need for "stronger modifications and stronger standardisation" in Europe-wide exchange of criminal records. He also announced a root-and-branch review of Britain's many criminal record databases.Downing Street yesterday announced the appointment of the Foreign Office minister Lord Triesmann as a special envoy to try to speed up the deportation of failed asylum seekers and other illegal migrants.
