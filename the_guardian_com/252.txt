A man whose wife and three children were found dead in their family home near Manchester last month was today charged with their murders and remanded in custody.Rahan Arshad, 36, entered no plea and did not apply for bail in the hearing at Stockport magistrates court.He was arrested on Friday at Heathrow airport after returning to Britain from Thailand voluntarily, having left the UK following the killings.He had been arrested by Thai police last week when he tried to apply for a new visa at a border crossing in the south of the country.Police discovered the bodies of Usma Rahan, 32, along with sons Adam, 11, and Abbas, 8, and daughter Henna, 6, on August 20.They had been called out after neighbours complained of a bad smell and reported seeing flies buzzing around the letterbox of the house in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire.Post mortems revealed that all four had died of head injuries and had been lying in the house for at least four weeks.Police initially suspected that Mr Rahan had fled to Pakistan after they found his silver BMW car abandoned at Heathrow airport the day after his family's bodies were discovered.He wore a blue jumper to today's hearing and spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth. He will next appear at Manchester's Crown Square crown court next Monday.His solicitor Rizvam Anwar read out a brief statement on his behalf: "These are very difficult times for me and my family and I ask the media to respect the privacy of my family at these difficult times," it said.Last week detectives released on police bail a man in his forties and a woman in her thirties, who had both been arrested on suspicion of murder.
