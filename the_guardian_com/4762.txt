If Bane or the Joker were planning on moving their criminal empires from Gotham City to Bradford, they might just think again after seeing these CCTV images from West Yorkshire police.A man dressed as Batman – evoking, perhaps, the spirit of Del Boy and Rodney more than the sleek leather outfit of Christian Bale's latest incarnation – was caught on camera bringing a wanted man into police custody.The caped crusader marched into Trafalgar House police station, in the south of the city, in the early hours of 25 February and handed over the suspected criminal, before disappearing into the night.Police say they have no idea of the would-be superhero's identity, though they are playing down the prospect of a real-life costumed vigilante haunting the city's streets. It is understood the body language of the two men suggested they may have been known to each other, and there was no resistance from the suspect, who was later charged with handling stolen goods and fraud-related offences. He is due to appear at Bradford magistrates court on 8 March.A West Yorkshire police spokesman said: "The person who brought the wanted man into the station was dressed in a full Batman outfit. His identity, however, remains unknown."The mystery has fuelled speculation on Twitter as to the identity of Bradford's Bruce Wayne, with the Bradford West MP, George Galloway, moving swiftly to quash rumours that he had donned a lycra catsuit once again: "Contrary to rumours sweeping Gotham, I am not the Bradford Batman, However I take my hat off to him and wish him luck in the future."Bookies are even offering odds of 3/1 on the caped crusader repeating his heroics before the year's end – and 5/1 that he'll be joined by his sidekick, Robin. Famous West Yorkshiremen in the frame include Alan Titchmarsh (8/1), the former footballer Dean Windass (6/1) and the TV magician Dynamo (5/1).
