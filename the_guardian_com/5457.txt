The number of individual DNA profiles stored on the national database has now reached more than 5.2m, amounting to nearly one in 10 of the population in England and Wales, according to figures obtained by the Conservatives.But despite the huge growth in the database from 2m profiles seven years ago, the Tories claim the number of crimes directly detected through a DNA match has fallen.They say that the number of direct detections through DNA was 21,098 in 2002-03, but 17,614 in 2007-08, while the number of further offences detected as a result of a DNA match in the original crime has only risen from 12,717 to 15,420 over the same period.One explanation may be that the database already covers the 100,000 offenders in England and Wales responsible for most detected crime. Further expansion of the database may produce limited returns.The Home Office preferred to quote the figures for 2006-07, when the number of crimes detected through DNA peaked at 41,717, saying these included 452 murders, 644 rapes, 222 other sex offences and 1,872 other violent crimes.
