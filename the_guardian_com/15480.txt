Several police forces are leaving their community support officers vulnerable to attacks by failing to give them the stabproof vests offered to regular officers, according to new research.A report sent to the Home Office shows that three police forces do not provide their workers with the protective equipment, despite an increase in assaults against them in the last two years, including a high-profile stabbing.The government introduced CSOs in 2003 to tackle low-level crime and antisocial behaviour, and aims to recruit 16,000 by the end of next year.But freedom of information requests filed by Labour backbencher Tom Watson to all 43 police forces in England and Wales showed that three - West Midlands, Surrey and Staffordshire - do not issue stab vests to CSOs on the grounds that they should not need it.Greater Manchester Police was introducing the vests at the time of research, but one CSO was stabbed last December, before the policy was rolled out. A GMP spokesman said all CSOs should receive their vests within a few weeks."Whilst most forces believe they should be equipped with protective clothing similar to their frontline counterparts, a small number of chief constables take a more cavalier approach - despite reported attacks on them almost trebling," said Mr Watson, MP for West Bromwich East, who wants the Home Office to ensure all forces offer the equipment."West Midlands Police tell me they don't expect CSOs to go into dangerous situations. But there's a degree of randomness and, however much you try to organise your way out of risk, they walk the streets and patrol some pretty rough estates."Annette Mansell-Green of Unison said its members had complained about being refused the protective gear.She warned: "Without these vests an officer could be killed or seriously injured. Our members are frightened and worried... The officers may have a non-confrontational role, but members of the public won't distinguish them from full-time police officers."Several forces highlighted the need for the equipment, with Durham Constabulary advising its staff: "All uniformed officers, including CSOs, engaged in operational duties...MUST WEAR their body armour at all times."The number of assaults on CSOs increased from 96 to 272 between 2004 and 2006.West Midlands, Staffordshire and Surrey all stated that they did not issue stab vests because CSOs were deployed in high-visibility roles to communicate with and reassure the public. They avoided confrontations and high-risk activities.The forces said they continually reviewed their strategy and Staffordshire added that body armour was available in pools for CSOs "to wear only in the most extreme circumstances".A Home Office spokeswoman said: "Decisions on the employment of equipment remains a matter for individual forces."
