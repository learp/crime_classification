Police in Merseyside have arrested a 51-year-old man in connection with the murder of a mother and daughter living in Southport.Barry Morrow, 51, was sought by police after 54-year-old Angela Holgate, and her mother, Alice Huyton, 75, were found dead by a relative at their semi-detached house in Southport, Merseyside, on Saturday.Postmortem examinations revealed they died of asphyxiation. It is believed Morrow went to France or Spain and it is not clear where the arrest was made. Merseyside police said the man, from Southport, was arrested on suspicion of the murders.On Wednesday, Morrow, an engineer, who lodged at the women's house, contacted a firm of solicitors in his home town of Burnley, and instructed them to act on his behalf. Keith Rennison, of Donald Race and Newton solicitors, confirmed the request from Morrow.It also emerged that Morrow had allegedly contacted a reporter at the Lancashire Telegraph newspaper via Facebook. At 4.30pm on Tuesday a message from his account was posted to a journalist at the newspaper saying: "Get stuffed and leave my friends and family alone or I will sue you and your paper." Later another message said: "I have spoken to the police but it is none of your business."There was a further message saying: "To all those who have read the papers and seen the news, must make up their own minds, but "INNOCENT TILL PROVEN GUILTY" is still the bedrock of our justice system, I apologise to any of my listed friends if they have been hounded by the media, but that's down to the law, as they have allowed access to my account, I have even had journalist trying to add me on here, nothing but a cheep [sic] shot."
