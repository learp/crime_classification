A former council rat catcher who was found lying in a pool of blood in his cell in Belmarsh prison, south-east London, months before he was due to stand trial for murdering a woman with a parcel bomb died of a massive heart attack, a Southwark coroner's jury heard yesterday.Keith Cottingham, 73, who was charged with the murder of Barbara Harrold, was found by prison nursing staff last October. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital the same afternoon.Cottingham had been due to stand trial for Harrold's murder at the Old Bailey last July but the judge had postponed the case until January after hearing that Cottingham, who had diabetes and a heart condition, was unfit for trial.According to prison medical staff, in the days before his death Cottingham had repeatedly complained of chest pains but expressed reluctance to be treated. On the afternoon of his death Christine Jeffrey, a prison nurse, had seen him sitting up and writing at a table in his cell. But when she checked on him again later he was slumped on the floor.A forensic pathologist's report said Cottingham's head wound was consistent with a fall to the floor. Accepting the conclusion that Cottingham had suffered a heart attack as a result of a coronary atheroma, the jury returned a verdict of death by natural causes.Once listed as one of Britain's most-wanted men, Cottingham was extradited from Spain in October 2002 after a lengthy legal battle.After leaving his job as a rat catcher, Cottingham had moved to Spain in 1981 where he bought a villa near Alicante from Harrold and her husband, Gordon.But soon after buying the house, Cottingham became convinced that the Harrolds - whom he had never met - had tricked him into paying a Spanish property tax bill of Â£600. In an angry exchange of letters Cottingham wrote that the feud must end with "a peaceful agreement or total war".On May 21 1984, a parcel arrived addressed to Mrs Harrold, a mother of three, at her home in Ightham, Kent. It contained an explosive charge surrounded by pieces of shrapnel - including nails and air gun pellets - which blew off her left hand and a finger from her right hand. She suffered severe abdominal wounds and died in hospital six days later.Had Cottingham stood trial, the prosecution would have claimed he posted the parcel, on May 18 1984, at Bearsted, Kent.The same evening, Cottingham caught a ferry to France and from there returned to his home in Spain.However, Cottingham, who resisted extradition from Spain for 18 years, always protested his innocence, saying that he had never met Harrold, had never written to her and "certainly never sent her that bomb".
