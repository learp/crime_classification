A 46-year-old black man was last night recovering in hospital after being stabbed by a gang of white youths in a racially motivated street attack in Hampstead, north London, on Saturday evening.The four or five attackers hurled racial insults at him, stabbed him once in the chest and fled. Two were wearing grey Nike hooded tops, and all were aged around 18. The victim was taken to a north London hospital, where his condition was said to be stable. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the attack had been unprovoked and racially motivated, and he appealed for information.
