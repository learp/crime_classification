Families of homicide victims in England and Wales will be allowed to tell the courts of their grief and how the crime has affected them, under plans announced by the government today.Ministers have suggested the move may lead to longer sentences for some offenders, but legal experts fear the proposals could put improper pressure on judges.Under plans published in a government consultation paper, the relatives of murder or manslaughter victims would be able make a personal statement to the judge after the killer's conviction, but before sentencing.Alternatively, the statement could be read by a legal advocate - a so-called "victim's advocate" - or a Crown Prosecution Service barrister.Harriet Harman, the constitutional affairs minister, said the intention was to ensure that families "feel that they have had their say" in the justice process.She insisted that the aim of the scheme was to "end the problem of victims' relatives feeling that while everybody else is talking, they are confined to silence".The minister said it was possible that the system could affect the sentence imposed in manslaughter cases."If it means the sentence is higher on a manslaughter than it might otherwise have been in the first instance, without hearing from the victim's relatives, then I think that would be a good thing and that would be right," she said. Julian Young, a solicitor advocate at Westminster Law Partnership, said the move was "totally unnecessary" as there was already a system in place to give victims' families a voice in court.In homicide (murder or manslaughter) cases, the police appoint a family liaison officer who can take a statement from the family, which is handed to the prosecution and defence counsel, as well as the judge.The judge can refer to this statement when delivering sentence. Any victim of crime can also make a personal statement explaining how the crime has affected them.Mr Young said the government's proposals left "sentencing wide open to improper pressure".He added that, while no one doubted that bereaved relatives suffered terrible trauma and deserved every sympathy, the defendant rather than the victim should be at the heart of the criminal justice system, because they were the one on trial.But the mother of one of two teenage girls shot dead outside a New Year's party in Birmingham in 2003 welcomed the government's proposals.Marcia Shakespeare saw four men jailed for life earlier this year for killing her 17-year-old daughter, Letisha, and her friend Charlene Ellis, 18.Although she wrote a victim impact statement for the trial at Leicester crown court, she said airing her views more fully and in public would have had more effect."It didn't feel the same because even though you were actually writing that piece of paper, you actually felt upset and distressed writing it," she told the BBC. "If it came out from your own mouth, it would have been easier for people to see what we were actually going through."Joanna Perry, policy manager at Victim Support, said while the charity welcomed any proposal to make the voices of victims better heard in the criminal justice system, there was a danger the proposals would raise unrealistic expectations.She said: "If they [victims' relatives] are told they will be able to give a statement at the sentencing stage, it may lead them to believe that this will affect sentencing. So the government must ensure expectation is managed."Ms Perry cautioned against personal statements being allowed to affect sentencing. "If a victim had no known relatives, will their killer receive a smaller sentence?"She added that the proposals would not necessarily bring closure for the relatives."Some people may be really anxious about standing up in court - it could prove traumatic. Meanwhile, many don't really appreciate the impact of bereavement on them until years later. So if the proposals do go ahead, the pilot will require careful evaluation."
