The race for the top job in British policing was on yesterday, as Scotland Yard commissioner Sir John Stevens formally announced he will step down in January.Sir John, 61, became the Met chief four and a half years ago when the UK's biggest police force was at the centre of a storm, battling rising crime and plunging recruitment, and accused of institutional racism over its investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.While problems remain, Sir John, dubbed the "copper's copper" and "Captain Beaujolais" for his friendly, forthright approach, has been credited with steering through major reform, cutting crime and officer sickness levels and boosting morale in the ranks.The Â£175,000 a year Met role is one of the most difficult law enforcement jobs in the world, requiring sure-footed police skills and experience, as well as consummate diplomacy when dealing with senior politicians on all sides.Robust co-operation with M15 and the other secret services in the fight against international terrorism is vital, as is keeping the delicate balance between raising public awareness of the threat without creating panic.The new commissioner will be chosen by the home secretary from a shortlist drawn up by the Metropolitan Police Authority.Sir Ian Blair, Met deputy commissioner, is widely tipped as the front-runner. Oxford-educated Sir Ian, 51, is a much less flamboyant character than Sir John. But he is considered a shrewd strategic thinker, instrumental in reform and policy-shaping, particularly the controversial creation of the new community support officers, non-qualified back-up for beat bobbies.Sir Ian started his career with the Met in central London, and latterly served as deputy chief constable in Thames Valley and chief constable of Surrey, before returning to Scotland Yard as Sir John's deputy in 2000.Other senior officers could be deterred from throwing their hats into the ring if Sir Ian is viewed as the strong favourite. But one who might is Tarique Ghaffur, 49, the Met's assistant commissioner in charge of specialist crime.He is the highest ranking Asian officer in the UK police, and promoting him would send a strong message to Britain's ethnic minorities.Mr Ghaffur currently oversees murder investigation, serious gun crime, drugs, kidnapping and serious fraud. He started his career with Greater Manchester police, and carried out undercover work for the National Crime Squad.He became Met assistant commissioner in 2001.Another serious contender could be Hugh Orde, 45, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, and formerly Met deputy assistant commissioner in day-to-day charge of Sir John's inquiry into alleged security force-terrorist collusion in Northern Ireland.Likewise, there is Mike Todd, 46, a former Scotland Yard officer, who is now chief constable of Greater Manchester.Sir John, whose 43-year career has included senior posts in Hampshire, Cambridgeshire and Northumbria, said his greatest regret at the Met was that the killers of Damilola Taylor, the 10-year-old stabbed to death with a bottle in Peckham, south London, had not so far been convicted.Sir John also confirmed that after his retirement he will continue to lead the inquiry into the deaths of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed, and to run his 14-year investigation into security force collusion with terrorists in Northern Ireland.
