Diamonds worth an estimated Â£500,000 have been stolen from two of the world's premier jewellery firms in brazen robberies.Both jewellers, De Beers and Cartier, were conned into delivering the diamonds to bogus fashion shoots. They were told the gems would be worn by models on trendy "urban" shoots in east London.On each occasion, the couriers were ambushed by robbers in hooded tops and the jewels snatched.Detectives are focusing on identifying the person who managed to convince both firms that they were setting up a legitimate fashion shoot.The first of the robberies happened in French Place, near Shoreditch High Street, at 10am on Wednesday. Couriers had just arrived by taxi when they were attacked by two men and the jewels snatched.The robbers escaped with earrings, a necklace and a ring, all in maroon boxes bearing the De Beers logo.The second raid took place close to Kingsland High Street at about 11.30am yesterday. As a female courier arrived in Cotton Gardens, the location for the "shoot", two thieves approached the taxi, then one reached in and grabbed a diamond necklace and matching earrings in red boxes marked with the Cartier design.Detective Inspector Dave Rock, who is leading the investigation, said: "Due to the similarities between the two cases we are linking the investigations and appeal to anyone with information to contact us as soon as possible."Officers are hunting for two men aged in their early 20s, each about 6ft, who appeared to be unarmed and fled in a vehicle.
