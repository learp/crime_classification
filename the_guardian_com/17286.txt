The ringleaders of a gang who groomed vulnerable girls for sex were given indefinite prison sentences today .Abid Mohammed Saddique, 27, and Mohammed Romaan Liaqat, 28 from Derby – both married with children – were described by a judge at Nottingham crown court as "sexual predators" who subjected their victims to a "reign of terror".Saddique was jailed for a minimum of 11 years before he is eligible for parole and Liaqat for eight years.Judge Philip Head told Saddique: "Your crimes can only be described as evil," adding he was an "evil, manipulative and controlling" character who was a continuing danger to young girls."You are in the truest sense a sexual predator with a voracious sexual appetite that you gratified as frequently as possible in a variety of ways."He said the pair's attitude was "sex at any price" as they and others embarked on what he described as a "reign of terror on girls in Derby".There was tight security outside the court building following protests by far-right organisations including the English Defence League.The gang members were found after an undercover investigation by Derbyshire police, codenamed Operation Retriever. Originally 13 men were charged, with 11 standing trial for a string of charges – not all sexual – relating to the case. A total of 26 victims were involved, the youngest being 12. After three trials, there were nine people convicted of a variety of offences.At the opening of the first trial, also held at Nottingham crown court, prosecutor Yvonne Coen QC said of the men: "They preyed on young girls who were vulnerable, either because of their age and because of their personal circumstances. They exploited these girls either for their own sexual satisfaction or for their friends.Saddique, of Normanton, Derby, was convicted of four counts of rape as well as two counts of false imprisonment, two of sexual assault, three charges of sexual activity with a child, perverting the course of justice, and aiding and abetting rape.Liaqat, of Sinfin, Derby, was found guilty of one count of rape, two of sexual assault, aiding and abetting rape, affray, and four counts of sexual activity with a child.Both had earlier pleaded guilty to causing a person under 18 to be involved in pornography.A serious case review in November into the care of vulnerable girls found agencies missed opportunities to help them, although the review said it could not have been predicted that the two girls who were in local authority care would become victims of sexual exploitation.One of the victims told the court she was raped in 2008, when she was 16. She knew one of the men who called her asking to meet and, after being taken to buy vodka, she was driven to an isolated spot where one man raped her.Detective Superintendent Debbie Platt, said: "We were shocked with the scale and extent of what we'd uncovered … this is a very hidden crime so we didn't have a victim coming forward and saying what had happened, so we've had to investigate without the victim knowing what we were doing," she said.
