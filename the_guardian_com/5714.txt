A university graduate who stole Â£36,000 of manuscripts by famous figures including Sir Winston Churchill, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and TS Eliot has been jailed for 30 months.Tyrone Somers was working as a handyman for bookseller Rick Gekoski, who specialises in rare manuscripts and documents.Gekoski asked him to do some work on the weekend of 23 to 24 July, when he would be away from his west London property, and arranged for Somers to collect the key from a neighbour. But prosecutor Abigail White told Southwark crown court, London: "On the Monday, Mr Gekoski discovered a large number of highly valuable manuscripts and documents had been stolen from his house."Among these "extremely valuable items" were documents by Kingsley Amis, a speech by wartime prime minister Churchill, typed letters and Christmas cards by poet Eliot and a typed letter by poet Ted Hughes.Somers, 41, had not completed any of the tasks he had been assigned to do and a few days later, on 29 July, he emailed a social worker and confessed to his crimes.He eventually handed himself in at Belgravia police station in central London, bringing the documents with him.A sufferer of bipolar disorder, he told police he had had psychological problems and had been advised that going to prison would solve them, the court heard.White said he told police that "he went into the house and for a short time he battled with these thoughts. He said he took the book of manuscripts because he knew it would extend his prison sentence".
