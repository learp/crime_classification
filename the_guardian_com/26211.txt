The government is planning to introduce tough measures to stop criminals profiting from published accounts of their crime, it was confirmed today.Proposals for the seizure of money made by criminals from selling their stories to newspapers or through book deals are contained in a newly published consultation paper.Ministers insist the move is targeted at the criminal and will in no way affect the publishers of papers, magazines or books.They also said the government had no desire to stop the publication of such stories, but believed it morally reprehensible that criminals should be able to earn money by speaking about the crimes they have committed.Northern Ireland criminal justice minister David Hanson said: "It is wrong for convicted criminals to profit for their crimes, whether directly from the proceeds of the crime itself or indirectly through cashing in on the story of their crime."He added: "It is not only distasteful but contrary to the principles of natural justice that they should be able to exploit for financial gain crimes that have devastated the lives of victims and their families."The minister said the government wanted to prevent further hurt and distress to victims and their families who had already been deeply traumatised by their unwanted exposure to dreadful experiences.But he added: "At the same time we do not want any prohibition on profit to discourage or prevent publications which may help us to understand why criminal acts are committed, contribute to the rehabilitation of ex-offenders or constitute genuine academic research."There was concern earlier this year about former loyalist terror boss Johnny Adair receiving a substantial sum from a London-based publisher for his life story.Michael Stone, jailed in 1989 for six murders including the Milltown Cemetery gun and grenade attack on an IRA funeral in which three people died, has also published a book on his life as a loyalist hitman.Back in March 2004 the then home secretary, David Blunkett, promised to address the issue after it was raised by the mother of one of the victims of child-killer Mary Bell during a question-and-answer session in Newcastle.June Richardson, whose four-year-old son Martin Brown was murdered in 1968, was outraged when she discovered that Mary Bell had received Â£50,000 from the author of a book about the killings.The UK-wide consultation runs until February.
