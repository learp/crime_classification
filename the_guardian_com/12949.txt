A Nation of Islam member who assaulted a police officer at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry was ordered to do 200 hours community service yesterday. Rasaki Yesufu-Muhammad, a 29-year-old care worker, appeared for sentencing after being convicted of affray at Southwark Crown Court, south London, last month.The court was told he had kneed a constable in the face when trouble broke out on the day five youths suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence were due to give evidence at the hearing. PC Stephen Dukamp had told the jury that up to 50 members of the black activist group, founded by American Louis Farrakhan, behaved 'almost military-like' after arriving at the inquiry. When violence flared, at least three of them attacked him. He said he was punched to the floor and twice kneed in the face by Yesufu-Muhammad. He grabbed the care-worker's leg as other officers used CS gas to restore order. Yesufu-Muhammad insisted he had been looking for his glasses when the constable hit him with his baton, put him in a head-lock and dragged him across the floor. His barrister, Matthew Ryder, told judge Jeffrey Rucker that the politics graduate felt it was the 'ultimate irony' that he should have been the only person found guilty of anything arising from Stephen's death. Mr Ryder said Yesufu-Muhammad, of Brunel Close, Northolt, Middlesex, had found his 'worst fears' about the lack of justice for black people confirmed by the jury's decision. Later the Lawrence family said they were horrified at the prosecution and said the case showed the 'criminal justice system is still rife with racism'. In a statement, the family said: 'We are outraged and horrified that the only person to face criminal prosecution following the inquiry is a young black man who came to the inquiry out of sympathy for us.' Yesufu-Muhammad's solicitor said he would be appeal.
