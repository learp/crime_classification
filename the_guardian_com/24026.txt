Railway worker Antoni Imiela, 49, was given seven life sentences today for an 11-month campaign of rape against women and girls across south-east England.After less than a day of deliberation, the jury at Maidstone crown court returned guilty verdicts on 10 charges against him relating to the rapes of seven woman and girls in Kent, Surrey, London and Hertfordshire, and the kidnapping and sexual assault of a 10-year-old girl in Birmingham, his final sex crime.The trial judge sentenced him to a further 29 years for that attack. He told Imiela he had been responsible for a "sustained and vicious campaign of rape".He said Imiela had told the court that only "a beast" could have carried out the callous attacks. "You were accurate in your description but you were describing yourself," he said. "You are a very dangerous man, I have no doubt you present the most serious danger to women and girls and will continue to do so."The jury was discharged after it failed to reach a verdict on the remaining two counts of rape on one other woman. The Crown Prosecution Service said the remaining two charges would be left on file. This means in effect that there will be no retrial.The trial lasted seven weeks and presented strong evidence against Imiela.The father of a 10-year-old rape victim clutched his wife's hand and punched the air with his clenched fist as the guilty verdicts were given.The jury heard how Imiela had snatched the girl in Ashford, Kent, as she took down posters outside a police-run youth club and dragged her down a muddy path and through stinging nettles.Despite her pleas that she was only 10, he indecently assaulted her and raped her before leaving her to stumble half-naked to a nearby house for help.He suggested to his colleague Darren Arnold - who had no idea that Imiela was the rapist - that the girl might have "deserved" it. Mr Arnold told Imiela that he would have killed the rapist if the victim had been his daughter.A huge police hunt followed the horrific attack but despite nearly 3,000 men giving DNA samples in the following months, Imiela never entered the frame.The detective leading the investigation said he feared that he would wake up to the news that a child had been killed by the man his team had yet to catch, when he embarked on a spree of rapes eight months after the Ashford attack.Imiela struck twice in one day in July 2002, first in Earlswood, Surrey - a place he was familiar with through his work on the railways - and then in Putney, south-west London.The 30-year-old woman in Surrey was left with 56 separate injuries after she was repeatedly punched by Imiela, who had grabbed her as she jogged along a riverside path before tying and raping her. Just six hours later he struck again, this time attacking a 26-year-old woman walking across Putney Heath in an almost "carbon copy" of the previous assault. But not content with just raping the woman, Imiela stole his victim's mobile phone and, as he walked away, used it to taunt her mother and sister about the rape.By September 2002, a huge manhunt was under way involving at least three police forces. Imiela travelled further afield and in October 2002 he raped a 14-year-old girl in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, as she walked near woodland.The last attack saw him kidnap a 10-year-old girl in Birmingham at knifepoint and drive her around the west Midlands in a five-hour kidnap ordeal. She was forced into indecent acts but he failed to rape her.Detective Chief Inspector Philip Ball, the senior investigating officer in the Birmingham inquiry, today praised the 10-year-old for helping to bring Imiela to justice. "I must pay tribute to the courage of the victim who showed remarkable resilience after this dreadful experience. She was severely traumatised and even now is still rebuilding her life, but she was able to give us some very detailed information and, of course, she picked Imiela out of an identity parade," he saidThe Crown Prosecution Service said is was satisfied with the verdict. Chief crown prosecutor for Kent, Elizabeth Howe, said: "We have always maintained that we had a strong case against Antoni Imiela. "We worked continuously in close partnership with the police throughout this case. The guilty verdict for seven counts of rape means that Antoni Imiela has received a substantial sentence."Imiela had a previous conviction for a string of armed robberies between 1987 and 1988 no record of sex offences.It emerged, however, after the trial that he had bragged to workmates about beating prostitutes.There is the possibility he was sometimes referring to his victims. One former colleague said he had boasted that he "went with this young girl and she looked only about 12" a few days after he had driven to Birmingham and kidnapped the 10-year-old.Imiela denied the rapes, but his lies were made to look preposterous by DNA and other forensic evidence linking him to them.He said he was not the man who raped the 10-year-old in Ashford despite the fact that his DNA matched that of her assailant."I didn't rape her," he said, but admitted: "It would be difficult to convince you it wasn't me."Asked about DNA linking him to another rape - which according to experts had a one in 14m chance of belonging to someone else - he replied: "Either I have got a pal working with me or they have made a mistake. Or it's the one in 14m chance."Fibres that matched those found on Imiela's clothes were discovered by scientists on garments worn by victims, while telephone and bank card records placed him in the same area as the attacks.His fingerprint was even found on a bag belonging to one of his victims that he had forced her to use as a pillow as he raped her.Imiela said he had been "fitted up" by police and the fingerprint evidence against him had been fabricated.Giving evidence in his defence, he also insisted he was a homosexual. His wife, Christine, held her head in her hands as he described visiting male and female prostitutes and picking up other men in secret after their marriage in 1997.But police say there is no evidence to support his claim that he cruised gay bars though there is plenty to suggest he would regularly pay for sex with women.A number of colleagues who worked alongside Imiela told the court that he would often talk about his use of prostitutes. One recalled how he once boasted that a prostitute "was 18 but had looked younger".
