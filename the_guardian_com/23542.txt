Police are investigating the escape of a robbery suspect who was due to be arrested after a plane he was travelling on touched down at Manchester airport.Officers wanted to question Anthony Morrison, 32, following a robbery in Oldham in December 2011. He was due to be detained after arriving on an EasyJet flight from Amsterdam. As part of the planned operation, he was supposed to be held at an immigration desk at terminal one after the flight landed on Friday night at around 10.30pm.However, it is believed he managed to enter a secure baggage area of terminal three and then left the airport undetected, possibly through a main door. Greater Manchester police said an investigation was taking place and efforts to find him were continuing.It is believed several members of staff from the airport attempted to challenge him as he escaped.A statement from the police force said: "On Friday 6 July, police were made aware that a 32-year-old man was flying into Manchester airport from Amsterdam to be spoken to in connection with a robbery that took place in the Oldham area in December 2011."After the plane landed, the man subsequently escaped. Inquiries are ongoing to find the man and a review of the circumstances of how he escaped is under way."A spokesman for Manchester airport said it was not commenting and it was "a GMP matter".Two years ago, the airport was criticised by the UK Border Agency's chief inspector over its security. The issues highlighted have since been addressed.
