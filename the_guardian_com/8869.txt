The West Ham United defender Calum Davenport has today been charged with assaulting his sister during an incident in which he was stabbed in both legs six times. The 26-year-old had to undergo life-saving surgery following the incident outside his home in Bedford in August."I am deeply shocked and disappointed at the decision," said Davenport in a statement. "I deny any wrongdoing and will plead not guilty. For legal reasons I am unable to discuss the matter further at this time."He has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm on 28-year-old Cara Davenport. A statement from Bedfordshire police read: "Mr Davenport is currently on bail to appear at Bedford magistrates' court on 10 November."There had been fears after the incident that he would not play again but the centre-back, who has been left with a 15-inch scar on his leg, has been able to resume light training with West Ham. Writing on the club website recently, Davenport insisted he was feeling upbeat."At the moment I am still in hospital and have quite a long way to go on the road to recovery but I am feeling positive," he said. "Thanks to the club, my team-mates and fans, to the club doctors and the amazing staff at Bedford Hospital who have looked after me so well."
