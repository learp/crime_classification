Detectives hunting the murderer of mother-to-be Nikitta Grender want to trace four people seen on CCTV who might hold vital clues to the killing.The heavily pregnant 19-year-old was found dead in the bedroom of her burnt-out flat in Liswerry, Newport, south Wales, on 5 February. A murder investigation was launched after police revealed she had been stabbed twice.Grender and her boyfriend, Ryan Mayes, 18, moved into the flat six months ago and had decorated a room in preparation for the birth of their daughter, Kelsey-May.Police arrested a 26-year-old man on Wednesday on suspicion of murder. He was later identified locally as Mayes's second cousin, Carl Whant.The former soldier, who works as a bouncer at nightclubs in Newport, remains in custody after police were granted a second extension of time to question him.Whant's arrest followed news of a potential breakthrough by police, who found two knives during a search of the estate. Both have been sent away for forensic examination.Now police believe four members of the public captured on CCTV on the night of the murder may hold vital evidence in the case.A Gwent police spokesman said: "Officers investigating the murder of 19-year-old Nikitta Grender want to trace four people captured on CCTV from in and around Broadmead Park, Moorland Park and Pontfaen areas."Police would like them to get in touch as they may have seen something relevant to the investigation."These people captured could have important information for us, may have seen something that to them is irrelevant, however, it could be a vital piece of information we need."The witnesses were being asked to come forward if they recognised themselves in the images issued by the police.The first, taken from the back of Moorland Park community centre, shows a couple walking towards the bridge between Moorland Park and Broadmead Park at 3.41am. The second, taken at the same location almost two hours later, shows a man, possibly carrying a bag with a reflective strip on it. A third image shows a man walking along Fosse Road, in Pontfaen at 5.59am.The police spokesman said: "Police are continuing to search for a weapon, believed to be a knife. Forensic work is continuing to establish the type of knife."Searches are continuing at two out of six premises searched, located across the city. House-to-house inquiries are continuing and forensic analysis is also continuing."Anyone with information should call the major incident room on 01443 865 562, or 01633 838 111, or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
