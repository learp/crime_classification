PC Mark Milton only wanted to perfect his advanced, night-time driving skills when he put his foot down and took the force's unmarked 3.2-litre Vauxhall Vectra up to 159mph.His determination to "familiarise himself" with the newly commissioned vehicle's capabilities resulted in him facing six charges of dangerous driving and speeding.Yesterday, however, Ludlow magistrates' court cleared the West Mercia officer of all offences after hearing from his solicitor that he was "not driving for kicks or to impress a newly acquired female companion". David Twigg, representing PC Milton, said: "The evidence does not show driving to a standard far below that of the competent and careful driver."The court heard that the constable was recorded travelling at 159mph on the M54 near Telford, Shropshire, by an on-board video camera - turned on by himself - in the early hours of December 5 2003.PC Milton, 38, who qualified as a Grade I advanced driver in 1995, was also charged with driving at 120mph in a 60mph zone and more than 60mph in a 30mph zone. At a previous hearing he said he had taken the car out to assess its capabilities and hone his driving skills.Delivering his verdicts, District Judge Bruce Morgan said: "I can't help but see the irony that those that brought this prosecution are those very people who have purchased cars that go at this speed and paid for him to go to learn to drive at these speeds."He described PC Milton, of Bratton, Telford, as among the "crème de la crème" of police drivers and criticised the decision to bring a prosecution.He also expressed amazement at the constabulary's "total lack of policy" on when and where police drivers should practise driving at very high speeds.Emergency response vehicles are exempt from speed limits as long as it is justifiable under the requirements of duty, such as training practice.After the case, a spokesman said that the West Mercia force was clarifying the guidance issued to advanced drivers.Kevin Clinton, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said doing 159mph on a public road could never be justified. "At that speed his stopping distance would have been 1,500 feet or nearly one third of a mile."Around 30 people are killed every year in accidents involving police cars.
