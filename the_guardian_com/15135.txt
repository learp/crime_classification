A millionaire and his family are missing after their country house burned down in a suspected arson attack. It is not known if Christopher and Jillian Foster and their teenage daughter Kirsty were at home when fire broke out shortly before 5am yesterday.Osbaston House in Maesbrook, near Oswestry, Shropshire, was so badly damaged that police and fire investigators have not yet made a full search. Fire crews took several hours to control the blaze.Foster is understood to have made his money developing insulation technology for oil rigs. His house is said to be worth Â£1.2m. Friends said his finances had been affected by the credit crunch.West Mercia police has 80 officers and civilian staff on the case. Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, of the force's major incident unit, said: "There was a CCTV system at the property, which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days."The house, a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged."Two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead."Two dogs, which we believe were in a kennel block, are missing. A search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe."Forensic investigators have been at the scene and house-to-house inquiries carried out."Groves appealed yesterday for the Fosters to get in touch "if they are out there" and for anyone who could help establish their movements over the bank holiday weekend to contact police.Gordon Richards, a builder who is a friend of Foster, told the Daily Mail: "When I saw Chris a few days ago, he seemed happy, but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch."He used to have two Porsches and an Aston Martin, and he goes shooting and fishing in his spare time."Chris had just bought himself a horse, which he shows, and their daughter, who goes to boarding school, also rides."
