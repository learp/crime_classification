Criminal gangs involved in money laundering and other financial crime will escape prosecution unless the fraud investigation industry is forced to adopt recognised qualifications, the government was told yesterday.Attempts to prosecute individuals involved in serious financial crime have already been abandoned after evidence was prejudiced by untrained and unqualified fraud investigators, said Paul Carratu, president of the British arm of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners."We are seeing corporates going to the biggest advert in the Yellow Pages for fraud investigators. It is boom time at the moment and we fear that cowboys will come into the industry. Just because you are an ex-accountant or ex-policeman doesn't make you a fraud examiner," said Mr Carratu, who is also managing director of corporate investigators Carratu International. "It is increasingly important as the Serious Fraud Office focuses on more complex crimes and regional fraud squads are snowed under with work."He called for better regulation of the fraud investigation industry through the adoption of a recognised professional qualification. "At the moment, the UK investigations industry is completely unregulated," he said."The ACFE is the leading anti-fraud association in the world and in the UK we want to establish the Certified Fraud Examiner status as a recognised qualification." There are plans to introduce a licensing system for private investigators from the end of 2005. However, the government has no plans to introduce an accepted qualification.
