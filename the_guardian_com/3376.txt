A postman who failed to deliver nearly 70,000 letters and parcels over four and a half years was given a suspended prison sentence today. Prosecutor Henrietta Paget told Ipswich crown court that mail was found in Richard Appleby's living room, hallway, garden shed and loft. Appleby, 36, of Ipswich, who had worked as a postman for almost 20 years, admitted interfering with the mail between April 2004 and November 2008. David Cason, defending, said he had had a "number of problems in his personal life". Appleby was given a six-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months.
