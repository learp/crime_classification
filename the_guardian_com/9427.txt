A predatory paedophile was convicted today of raping a six-year-old girl he snatched from her bath two days after Christmas Day last year.Peter Voisey, 35, was convicted at Newcastle crown court of abducting the girl and putting her through two serious sexual assaults in a car before dumping her, naked, in a freezing cold lane 20 minutes later.Judge David Hodson warned Voisey he would be jailed for life or for an indefinite period when he sentences him on December 1. The judge said sentencing was being adjourned for the preparation of a sex offender assessment.The judge said the sentence would be decided after "the court can have a proper assessment of the risk you pose to the public at large".Voisey, also known as Smith, had snatched the girl from the bathroom of the ground floor flat in North Tyneside where she lived, after getting in through an unlocked back door.After today's verdict, a statement from the girl's mother said the attack was "every mother's nightmare".She said: "My little girl was in the bath in her own home within earshot of everyone else in the flat, the back door was shut and I'd only just left the bathroom to go to another room when she was snatched."It's every mother's nightmare to think your children aren't safe in their home. You wouldn't think you would have to lock all your doors this early in the evening to protect your children from anyone entering your home uninvited."She praised police for their work on the case. Some had questioned whether the attack had happened but the police always took the report of the attack seriously, and detectives knew of injuries the girl had suffered and the proximity of the unlocked door to the bathroom.Swabs were taken and tiny amounts of DNA were recovered from the victim. The samples were too small to provide an exact match, but Voisey was found later to have a similar DNA profile to the elements recovered.Crucially, a footprint found in the bathroom in the girl's two-bedroom downstairs flat partially matched his Diadora trainer. Mobile phone mast analysis also proved his handset was in the North Tyneside area, and not at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, at the time of the offence. His alibis, at first that he was away from the area, then that he was buying cannabis in North Tyneside, did not stand up.The jury also heard a life-long friend recall Voisey confiding he wanted to "do something" to a child after the pair drove past two youngsters aged around six and eight.The prosecution successfully applied for bad character evidence under the 2003 Criminal Justice Act to be put before the jury, who were told of a similar sex attack on a vulnerable 12-year-old stranger at a swimming bath.Voisey had been jailed for three years, reduced on appeal to two years, for the 2001 attack, the jury in the latest case heard.He told the jury at Newcastle crown court that he was sorry for the previous attack and was "utterly ashamed ... disgusted with myself".He had denied having a sexual interest in children, and, weeping in the witness box, told the jury he had "most definitely not" attacked the six-year-old.But the jury rejected his evidence and convicted him today on the 14th day of the trial.The court also heard that Voisey, who spent much of his childhood in care, had carried out two break-ins involving a sexual element.Detective Chief Inspector Jim Napier said: "There is no doubt that Voisey is a serial sexual predator who preys on young and vulnerable children."He said his view was that Voisey had been in the area looking for somewhere to burgle when he went into the flat and came across the girl."As the evidence built up against him, we became more and more convinced that he had committed this crime, which I can only describe as horrific. He was a total stranger to this family, he violated their home, he kidnapped a little girl to satisfy his own perverted desires and he has shown neither guilt nor remorse. Today's conviction should ensure that he is not in a position to harm anyone else for many years to come."DCI Napier said, given the circumstances, the girl was making good progress in her recovery from the attack. "She proved to be a first-class witness, especially considering her age, and the traumatic experience she had been through. "I was convinced very early on that the girl's account of what happened to her was not only credible, but also entirely feasible, and the investigation proceeded on that basis."He said that the sex offenders' register was a very important tool in helping to catch Voisey. He said he could not comment on the supervision Voisey had been under at the time of the attack as the council was reviewing this.
