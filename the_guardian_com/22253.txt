Luke Mitchell, the teenager found guilty of murdering and mutilating his girlfriend Jodi Jones, is expected to launch an appeal against his conviction after he is sentenced next month.Following the longest and most complex trial in Scottish history of a lone defendant, lawyers acting for the 16-year-old will spend the next few weeks poring over the decisions and summing-up of the trial judge, Lord Nimmo Smith. One plank of any appeal could be the publicity surrounding the case. There are also questions about police handling of the investigation. Mitchell's defence agent, Donald Findlay QC, raised questions about the admissibility of evidence several times during the 41-day trial. Despite there being no motive, no weapon and no forensic evidence, Mitchell was found guilty by a majority verdict of committing a savage and frenzied attack on 14-year-old Jodi. He was described by the trial judge as a truly evil and wicked youth obsessed with Satan, drugs, knives and sex. During the trial, it emerged that Jodi had defensive wounds on her arms. She fought desperately for her life as her killer repeatedly stabbed her in the woods near her home on 30 June, 2003. Yet Mitchell had no injury marks on him and his DNA was not at the scene. Much was made in court of Mitchell's interest in goth rock music and in particular his fascination with Marilyn Manson, the American cult star who is himself fixated on the gruesome death in 1947 of actress Elizabeth Short, also known as the Black Dahlia. Many of Mitchell's friends maintain his innocence. Laura Wightman, who was Jodi's best friend and is close to Mitchell, said she thought the wrong person had been convicted.
