Depicting justice blindfold may not merely be a figurative assertion of courtroom impartiality: witnesses have been shown to improve their memory of a crime when they close their eyes.Research by psychologists at Surrey University has found fresh evidence suggesting that encouraging people to block off their vision boosts their ability to remember events accurately.A study published in the Legal and Criminological Psychology journal reveals a 23% improvement in recall when participants closed their eyes as they answered questions about a film they had seen. Shutting out visual inputs reduces distractions, limiting the competing demands for attention. Eye closure helps the mind visualise more detailed images.In the first Surrey experiment, participants watched a film about an electrician entering a property, carrying out jobs and stealing items. They were asked questions such as ‘what was written on the front of the van?’ Closing eyes led participants to answer 23% more of the questions correctly.The second experiment took the memory task one step further, asking witnesses about things they had heard, as well as seen. This time, participants watched a clip from Crimewatch, reconstructing a burglary where an elderly man was attacked in his home. Covering eyes helped them recall audio and visual details.Building a rapport with witnesses may help them feel secure enough to close their eyes, said the lead author of the study, Dr Robert Nash, an experimental psychologist.“Although closing your eyes to remember seems to work whether or not rapport has been built beforehand, our results show that building rapport makes witnesses more at ease with closing their eyes. That in itself is vital if we are to encourage witnesses to use this helpful technique during interviews.”Some UK police interview manuals, Dr Nash added, already suggest encouraging witnesses to shut their eyes. “It is something that has been recommended but there hasn’t been much evidence for it until recently.”
