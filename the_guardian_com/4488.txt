A chef who fatally stabbed a teaching assistant had been in a "bad mood" and wanted to hurt someone, it was revealed yesterday. Robert Cusworth, 25, attacked Sally Garwood as she walked her dog near her Buckinghamshire home. Members of the public tried to save her but the 34-year-old could not be revived. Cusworth, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, pleaded guilty at Reading crown court today to murdering Garwood on 11 July. The Crown Prosecution Service described the attack as "utterly senseless", and praised a nine-year-old boy whose evidence helped lead to Cusworth being charged.
