Bonomo had been stabbed 196 times and Ferez 47 times. They were living in London while working on biochemistry research projects at Imperial College.Earlier today, unemployed Nigel Farmer, 33, of no fixed abode, appeared before Greenwich magistrates charged with killing the two students. He is also charged with one count of arson and a count of attempting to pervert the course of justice. He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey in October.Police are also continuing to hold a 35-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman who were arrested last night in connection with the killing.A 21-year-old man arrested at the weekend was released without charge.Farmer was arrested early on Monday after walking into Lewisham police station. Officers said forensic work at the ground floor flat in Sterling Gardens could continue for several more weeks.Detectives have renewed their appeal for witnesses who may have seen anyone at the property on the day of the attacks.Six days earlier, Bonomo disturbed an intruder stealing a laptop computer.Experts found no evidence of forced entry after the murders, suggesting that keys might also have been stolen.Two Sony handheld games consoles were also taken and credit cards are believed to be missing.Ferez's parents, Fran√ßoise and Olivier, this week appealed for those responsible for their son's death to give themselves up. "You will not be able to live in hiding forever," it said. "You may be scared and feel like a coward, but you must recognise this terrible mistake you made."
