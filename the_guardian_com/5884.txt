A female neighbour of a father who was killed in a row over his son's football appeared in court today.Kay Scrivener is charged with grievous bodily harm with intent. The 41-year-old was remanded in custody following the hearing at Wimbledon magistrates court. David Martin, a 40-year-old window cleaner, was stabbed with a samurai sword after asking a neighbour to give his son's football back on Sunday. Four other people were been arrested in connection with his death in Mitcham, south London.His wife, Angela, today described him as a "gentle giant" whose family adored him. "David was a family man who would do anything for anyone, even going without or putting himself last," she said. "He was a fun-loving, happy, gentle giant.""He leaves three young children who adored him. We all, including his extended family, are devastated by what has happened. We will miss him terribly."Witnesses to the incident said Martin was hit with cricket bats, golf clubs and metal poles in a sustained assault. His wife and children, aged 14, 12 and 10 are understood to have seen the attack. Police were called to the cul-de-sac at around 7pm and found Martin in the front garden of a house. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Last night, a 14-year-old girl and two women aged 41 and 69 were released on police bail pending further inquiries. A 37-year-old man remains in custody. Well-wishers today continued to leave bunches of flowers against the fence of the garden where Martin died. One read: "I cannot believe you have gone. Why would someone do this to you? Did they not know you were too much of a nice person for this to happen to you?" A neighbour said Martin's father, Raymond, was killed in a fight in Mitcham 20 years ago: "He was murdered ... I think there was a fight that broke out or something like that," the neighbour added.
