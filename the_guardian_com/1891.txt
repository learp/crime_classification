A mother has appealed for thieves to return a video camera containing footage of her son winning an Olympic gold. The film showed rower Zac Purchase winning the men's doubles sculls.'The whole time in Beijing and setting the new Olympic record is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,' said Sara Holyer. 'It's footage of all the people watching, the crowd's reaction, his partner Mark Hunter's family, the medal ceremony, everything. It's a personal record of the race, something the BBC footage doesn't have. I can't ever recover this.' Mrs Holyer, a special needs teacher, went to China for three-and-a-half weeks, visiting Hong Kong and Beijing with other members of her family. She had been back for several days when her home in Plymouth was broken into. A number of items were stolen along with the video camera, including a valuable handbag, wallet and prescription sunglasses. Zac, 22, has not seen the footage of his race. His mother said: 'The people who took it didn't know the footage that was on it. I would just like anyone who finds a video camera or buys it and sees the footage to hand it in to the police.'
