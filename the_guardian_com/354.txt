A 36-year-old man arrested in connection with the murder of French student Amelie Delagrange was released on bail today.Ms Delagrange was battered to death on Twickenham Green, south west London, as she walked home late on August 19. Detectives have previously linked the murder to five other attacks in south west London, including the killing of 19-year-old gap year student Marsha McDonnell.The man was arrested at a house in West Drayton, near Heathrow airport, yesterday morning. He was also questioned over the attempted murder and robbery of a woman near the same green in south-west London, in November 2002.Police said he had been bailed to return to a west London police station in January 2005, pending further inquiries. He is the fifth man to have been arrested in connection with the murder of the 22-year-old French student. At a Scotland Yard press conference yesterday, officers appealed for information about a white Ford Courier van, registration P610 XCN, which is linked to the inquiry and may now be owned legitimately by a member of the public. No one has been charged with the murder of Ms Delagrange, who was found on the green with serious head injuries. She was walking home after getting off a bus following a night out when she was attacked.She moved to London in June to improve her English. Last month, her friends and family planted a tree in her memory near the spot where she died.
