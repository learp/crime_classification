A former miner today admitted the crossbow killing of a man he believed was "trying to dismantle his house brick by brick".Robert Boyer was delusional when he shot 62-year-old Keith Frogson with the weapon, before striking him repeatedly with a sword until he was sure he was dead. The attack, which happened outside Mr Frogson's house in the pit village of Annesley Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire, was initially thought to be related to the 1984 miners' strike.Mr Frogson - whose funeral was attended by miners' leader Arthur Scargill - was a National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) activist, while Boyer had crossed picket lines during the dispute. But prosecuting barrister Andrew Easteal told Nottingham Crown Court that the strike had nothing to do with the killing. He said that Boyer had "developed a fixation with Mr Frogson" but knew nothing of him being a leading member of the NUM until after his arrest."He had convinced himself that Keith Frogson was trying to dismantle his house brick by brick, that acid was being thrown at the brickwork and that a screwdriver had been used to chip away at the bricks," Mr Easteal said. Boyer returned to Mr Frogson's house, outside which the killing had taken place, a fortnight after the attack and set fire to it, while Mr Frogson's daughter and her husband were inside.After the killing, Boyer went on the run in Sherwood Forest, constructing a shelter where he stayed for more than three weeks. Nottinghamshire Police carried out the biggest manhunt in its history, costing more than Â£1m and involving more than 600 officers. The court was told that Boyer, 42 - who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and arson, being reckless as to whether life was endangered - had been confirmed as mentally ill by doctors. He spoke only to confirm his name and enter his pleas.Boyer had originally been charged with murder and arson with intent to endanger life. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Crown Prosecution Service said: "It was only after very careful consideration and consultation that the prosecution team decided that the evidence of Boyer's mental condition was such that a charge of murder was not sustainable."A meeting then took place with the family where the reasons were fully discussed so that they would be aware of why that decision had to be made."Mr Justice Pitchers adjourned the case for 12 weeks for further psychiatric reports and an assessment at Rampton secure psychiatric hospital in north Nottinghamshire.
