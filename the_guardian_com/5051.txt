Authorities in Cambodia today charged an 18-year-old homeless man with the murder of the British bar owner David Mitchell.Tong Chen allegedly stabbed Mr Mitchell to death during a bungled attempt to burgle his flat in Phnom Penh. He faces life imprisonment if convicted, municipal court prosecutor Kry Sok Y said.Mr Mitchell, 37 and originally from the West Midlands, owned the Ginger Monkey bar in the Cambodian capital.His girlfriend, 29-year-old Jane Nye, from New Zealand, received cuts to her neck and face during the attack at the couple's apartment early on Wednesday, police said.Mr Chen entered the flat through an unlocked back door and was surprised by Ms Nye as she emerged from the bathroom, police officer Yim Socheat said.The attacker used a sharp knife to stab her and Mr Mitchell, who had heard his girlfriend's cries for help and rushed out of the bedroom.Mr Mitchell died from multiple stab wounds at the scene, while Ms Nye was flown to Thailand for treatment, the officer said.Police arrested Mr Chen around half an hour later at a nearby park as he tried to clean blood from his clothes, Yim Socheat said. No date has been set for his trial.Speaking from Cambodia, Mr Mitchell's friend Brandon Davis today paid tribute to him, saying he was popular among locals.He told BBC West Midlands that flowers had been arriving at the bar."He was the perfect bar owner, he was always sitting there making a fool of himself, having a good time," Mr Davis said. "We are all in a bit of a state at the moment. It's a very sleepy little place for the most part, very peaceful."A memorial service for Mr Mitchell would be held in Cambodia, Mr Davis added.
