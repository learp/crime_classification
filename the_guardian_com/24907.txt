Nelson Mandela yesterday compared the recent murder of a black sixth-former in south-east London with the tragedy of South Africa, 'where black lives are cheap'.Shortly before leaving for Geneva on the last day of his British visit, the president of the African National Congress met the family of Stephen Lawrence , aged 18, who was stabbed to death in Eltham by a group of white youths two weeks ago. 'I know what it means to parents to lose a child under such tragic circumstances.' He said such brutality was all too commonplace in South Africa, 'where black lives are cheap'.  The Lawrence family spent 20 minutes with the ANC leader. Later, Mr Mandela said their tragedy was 'our tragedy'.  Stephen was the fourth black man to be murdered in the south-east London district in two years. Last July Rohit Duggal, 16, was killed outside a kebab shop 200 yards from the scene of Stephen's murder.  The dead man's mother, Doreen Lawrence, contrasted Mr Mandela's gesture with the response of the British government.  'Why is it that a leader from a foreign country shows us sympathy when our government has expressed no interest at all?' she said.  Mrs Lawrence said she was sure the police knew who the culprits were but were doing nothing.  Eltham police said the investigation was 'progressing quite well'. All leads were being followed up.
