An inquest jury has ruled that neglect contributed to the death of a 61-year-old prisoner who was unable to access medication for a heart condition.During the two-and-a-half-day hearing at St Pancras coroner's court in London, the jury heard that Tom Newman, a first-time offender, died in Pentonville prison of natural causes contributed to by neglect after he was unable to access his daily medication. He died within 60 hours of arriving at the jail in July 2002. They also heard that concerned relatives had telephoned the prison, offering to deliver his medication, but staff assured them that all inmates were seen by a doctor within 24 hours of arrival and given appropriate treatment. However, Mr Newman never saw a doctor at the jail and the standard healthcare screening form - used in all prisons - was not completed. After the jury returned its verdict, the north London coroner, Anthony Reid, said he would make recommendations to the relevant authorities.Mr Newman's relatives described his death as "distressing" and "unacceptable". Shazia Khan, the family's solicitor, said the gross failure in basic medical care was an example of wider systematic failings in the prison system.A spokeswoman for the Prison Service said that it very much regretted the death and a number of recommendations about practice and procedure at Pentonville had since been implemented.
