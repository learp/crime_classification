Police have launched a murder hunt after an 81-year-old widow was found repeatedly stabbed at her home. Joyce Cregeen was found in her house in Epsom, Surrey, by a friend last Thursday. Officers said that the attacker appeared to have used a knife, although the murder weapon has yet to be found. No motive for the killing has been established and there were no signs of forced entry.Detective Chief Inspector Jo Sidaway said: 'We will leave no stone unturned to discover who is responsible for this. The killer of a defenceless, elderly woman deserves no kudos or protection from anyone who knows what has happened.'One neighbour, Dorothy Winter, said: 'This is absolutely terrible. Everybody around here is really frightened. You just don't expect this to happen, especially to a lady of Joyce's age.'
