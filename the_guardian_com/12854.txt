The extent to which children are "invisible victims" was illustrated today with the publication of a survey showing that 51% of 10 to 15-year-olds did not report crimes to the police.Only 45% told their parents they had become victims of crime and the survey's authors said there was a youth culture of not wanting to be seen as a "grass" among peers. Within the same age group, one child in five has been a victim of crime, the survey said. The study, which was commissioned by Crimestoppers in conjunction with the Daily Mirror and GMTV, found more than 40% of children were worried about crime. Almost 25% of victims within this age group said they had been targeted by somebody their own age, and nearly half knew the identity of their assailants. Theft, mugging and burglary were top of the list of worries, followed by drugs, crimes involving weapons, and murder. Boys aged under 15 were more likely to be victims of crime than girls (22% compared to 15%) and 23% of victims were mugged or were the victims of street crime. Of the 1,064 boys and girls questioned nationwide, 38% said they would be more likely to report crimes if they could do so without giving their names. Roy Clark, director of Crimestoppers, said: "What is particularly worrying is that half of the victims suffer in silence. They didn't tell their parents, they didn't tell the police. "We at Crimestoppers have long suspected that this is so and have concentrated on the plight of young victims throughout the past year. What we have found is that the young have a cultural reluctance to be seen as a 'grass'. "Some also fear retribution from those responsible. It's simply not 'cool' and a load of 'hassle' to report a crime."
