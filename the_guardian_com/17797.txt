Tony Blair is too "out of touch" to sort out the problems in the criminal justice system, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, claimed today, as law and order once again dominated debate at PMQs.After a week which has seen sentencing, knife crime and paedophile policy dominate both the tabloid and government agenda, Mr Cameron said Mr Blair was no longer "the right person to sort it out".Mr Blair hit back, insisting that whenever the government proposed tougher measures, the opposition voted against them and said it was an issue of Mr Cameron's leadership whether he would support ID cards and other forthcoming measures.Mr Cameron countered that after nine years in power and "countless" initiatives, Mr Blair had no one but himself to blame for failings in the Home Office."You are out of touch and you cannot be the right person to sort it out," he said.One possible development that came out of the clash may be that the government may move faster on new sentences for knife crime. Mr Cameron - using all six permitted questions to attack the PM on crime - said: "Two weeks ago I asked you if you would back Conservative proposals for tougher sentences for knife crime."You said there were difficult issues. This week the home secretary [John Reid] announced he would work with us to strengthen the law."Will you confirm that this will be done before the violent crime reduction bill completes its passage through parliament?"Mr Blair said: "I think what I said was that I would consider it, but there were difficulties with it. These difficulties can be overcome. We're perfectly happy to work with you and other MPs to get the legislation through as quickly as possible."The two leaders also clashed on Tory calls for a dedicated border police force at ports - part of the Conservative's US-inspired "homeland security" department proposals.Mr Blair - on the defensive after proposals for police mergers have been kicked into the long grass by Mr Reid - said:"The reason why we have been against a single border agency force is very simple. It is because we have put in an immense amount of money and extra staff and we believe the best way of dealing with this is through the intelligence-led operations, that have been very successful."It's true there is much more we need to do. We are looking at that."But if we want to protect our borders properly, the electronic borders system we are introducing is important and if we want to keep track of people in this country, in the end, we are going to have to face up to the difficult decision on identity cards."If you are still against that, you cannot be serious about making sure we know exactly who is and should be in our country." Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are opposing ID cards - as much on cost and practicality grounds as on civil liberties.
