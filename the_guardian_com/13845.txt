A senior hedge fund manager has been banned from working in the City and fined £140,000 by the Financial Services Authority for deliberately inflating the value of trading positions which caused his former employer BlueBay to pay $650,000 (£407,000) in compensation to customers.The City regulator said it regarded the conduct of Simon Treacher [pdf] as particularly serious because he was a "senior and experienced portfolio manager" and was levying the fine in an attempt to deter others.The fine is largest by the FSA for this particular type of misconduct, which involved mispricing trading positions by cutting out and pasting different figures on to broker quotes used to value assets in the funds he managed.Treacher had deliberately altered documents on seven occasions and used them to justify positions he had misvalued, the regulator said.The FSA said the total impact of these actions was approximately $27m for the month-end valuations of his funds in July, August and September 2008. "The greatest impact was in August 2008, when the misconduct led to the relevant portfolios being overvalued by $11.8m," the FSA said.BlueBay has made payments in compensation to investors in the funds affected as a result of the misconduct totalling approximately $650,000, but the regulator stressed that it was not criticising BlueBay in connection with this investigation.The regulator revealed that it had interviewed Treacher on two occasions – 7 July 2009 and 9 November 2009 – and during both of these interviews he gave misleading answers.Margaret Cole, director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said: "Our actions in banning Simon Treacher and imposing a significant fine will send a powerful message of deterrence to others who might be tempted to behave in this way.""His conduct, both in mis-marking the funds and his dealings with us as the regulator, lacked integrity. Treacher's actions undermined BlueBay's independent valuation process and disadvantaged investors in the affected funds," Cole said."By making effective use of our powers to prohibit and fine individuals who are not fit and proper to carry out regulated activities, we help achieve our regulatory objectives of maintaining market confidence and protecting consumers," she said.Treacher agreed to settle at an early stage of the FSA's investigation and qualified for a 30% reduction in the fine, which otherwise would have been £200,000.
