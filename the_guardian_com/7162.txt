Photograph: PAA stalker who attacked his ex-girlfriend with a knife at a bus stop after a campaign of harassment was today found guilty of murder.Gemma Dorman, 24, was planning a new life in Spain when she was stabbed repeatedly outside a Thai restaurant by her former lover Vikramgit Singh.Dorman had been having dinner with her fiance in Lavender Hill, south London, in July 2008, when she went out to get cash. Singh was waiting for her and attacked her at a bus shelter with a 7in kitchen knife as she cried "Get off me, get off me", the Old Bailey heard.Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, said: "It was a brutal attack on a defenceless woman." One witness described Singh's behaviour as "seeming to be frenzied".Two months before the murder, Dorman told police that Singh was stalking her and bombarding her with hundreds of text messages. Her mother had also complained about him and Singh, an illegal immigrant from India, was spoken to by an officer.Jurors heard he was "infatuated" with Dorman and paid £200 to have a large heart-shaped tattoo with her name in it on his back. In a letter to her proclaiming his love, he wrote: "Fish can't live without water. I can't live without you."The 25-year-old, of Southall, west London, claimed in court that he had given her cash totalling £260,000, as well as gifts including jewellery and computers. Singh said they had planned to set up home together and get married, only for her to dump him when he ran out of money.He said on the day of the murder he planned to ask her for half his money back but she responded by taunting him. Singh admitted the stabbing but claimed he could not remember it.He denied murder, claiming provocation, diminished responsibility, and lack of intent. But his defence was rejected by the jury, which found him guilty of murder by an 11-1 majority. He now faces a life sentence.
