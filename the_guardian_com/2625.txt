Three men were today being questioned by police after they were arrested in connection with the racist murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence.The first two arrests came last night just before Stephen's parents and deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, the officer in charge of the case, made a witness appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme. One, a 24-year-old man, was arrested in Glasgow last night in a joint operation between the Metropolitan police and the Scottish crime squad. A second man was arrested in London and, today, a third man was taken into custody. The three, not thought to be among the five original suspects in the case, are being questioned in London about the fatal stabbing of the 18-year-old by a gang of white youths at a bus stop in Eltham, southeast London, in April 1993. Although Scotland Yard says that none of the arrests came from the Crimewatch appeal, Mr Grieve said that the 70 calls received by the programme related to people police were "very, very interested in and have been appealing about". Mr Grieve said that new technology had given a fresh boost to the inquiry. "We have got new witnesses. We have got new ways of analysing the massive amount of witness statements we have already collected," he added."There are new developments in scientific evidence which are nothing short of miraculous in finding conclusive evidence," he said. New tests will be carried out on a knife and a coat which were found close to the murder scene and the police are "very close" to identifying a potentially vital witness who is thought to have been at the scene of the murder, Mr Grieve added. Stephen's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, who appeared on the programme, urged the mothers and girlfriends of any of the youths involved in the killing to come forward. "The boys would have fully confessed to them," said Mrs Lawrence. "There is one particular girl who I understand had heard from one of them about the death of Stephen and I would like to appeal to her and other mothers and young women, wives, girlfriends - anybody who would know anything to come forward and phone in." No one has been convicted for the killing but five men have at various times been arrested. The current investigation team is the eighth set up to investigate the murder and has been running for 13 months. Stephen's parents are still pressing ahead with a compensation claim against the police officers involved in the bungled murder investigation.Â• Police today arrested 62 people in a series of raids targeting known racists across London. Scotland Yard detectives detained people on suspicion of offences ranging from racially aggravated criminal damage, harassment, grievous bodily harm and threats to kill. Detective chief superintendent John Godsave, who headed today's operation, said the figure was expected to rise to at least 80 by the end of the day. Mr Godsave denied that the arrests were linked to any far-right racist group or the arrests of new suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder. "There is nothing to suggest these people are overtly political or the individuals involved are known to each other," he added.
