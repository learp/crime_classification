Six feet high and gleaming in the sunlight, this stainless steel phoenix symbolises hope arising from tragedy.From today it will stand as a memorial to Damilola Taylor, whose murder jolted the nation but who has been an inspiration to other youngsters from deprived areas. The work of art, to be unveiled by the education secretary, Estelle Morris, will stand in a garden of re membrance at Oliver Goldsmith primary school, in Peckham, south London, where the 10-year-old was a pupil until his death on November 27 2000. Damilola, who had only recently moved to Britain from Nigeria, bled to death after being stabbed in the leg on the nearby North Peckham estate, as he skipped home at the end of the school day. In the following weeks the garden - designed in memory of a head teacher who died of cancer - became a focal point for the community's grief, with floral tributes and toys placed there. The sculpture, by Alexandra Brooke (pictured), was selected by Damilola's parents, Gloria and Richard Taylor, and school governors. Its unveiling comes the day after the Taylors commemorated his death by awarding the first bursaries from the Damilola Taylor Trust to three first year medical students at King's College, London.
