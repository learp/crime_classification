A 25-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder over what police called a racially-motivated attack in a supermarket.Zack Davies, of Mold, north Wales, was arrested at a Tesco store following an attack which left a 24-year-old man from Yorkshire, who was reportedly Asian, with life-changing injuries, North Wales police said.Davies will appear at Wrexham magistrates court today.Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Alun Oldfield said: “I would like to reassure the local community that this appears to be an isolated incident and from our inquiries to date, we believe Davies was acting alone and we are not seeking anyone else in connection with this assault.“Crimes of this nature are extremely rare and we are encouraged by the large number of witnesses who have so far come forward to help us build a complete picture of what took place yesterday. However if others can also assist I’d ask they contact police.“The 24-year-old victim remains in hospital with serious life-changing injuries. He and his family are being supported by specialist family liaison officers.“I am aware there is speculation on social media about the assault and I can confirm we are treating it as a hate-related, racially and religiously-motivated incident.”
