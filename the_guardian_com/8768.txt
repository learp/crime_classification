There were calls yesterday to clarify the law after a judge said it was "a pity" charges were considered against a farmer who shot a burglar.At the burglar's trial, Derby crown court heard how John Rae, 22, targeted 73-year-old Kenneth Faulkner's isolated house at Ockbrook, Derbyshire, three times last year before the latter fired a shotgun at him. Prosecutor Michael Auty told Judge Andrew Hamilton that charges against Mr Faulkner had been considered but not brought, since his intention was to frighten; there was no evidence to suggest "anything other than acting in legitimate defence of his property and person". In addition, Rae had suffered only pellet wounds to his lower leg. With Rae admitting the offence and others, the judge described him as "an absolute menace" and sentenced him to seven years in jail. The case contrasted with the prosecution of another farmer, Tony Martin, jailed for manslaughter. The law entitles householders to "reasonable force", and no more. Mr Martin exceeded this, since the jury accepted the prosecution case that he shot his intruder in the back as he was leaving. Yesterday there were calls for clearer guidelines. Victim Support spokesman Andrew Buckingham said: "The Home Office itself says there is a lot of confusion. When there is confusion to what reasonable force is, coupled with residents' anger at being targeted, it makes for a very complex set of circumstances." Courts make allowances for fear and the need to act in the heat of the moment. There have been cases of resulting serious injury or even death considered reasonable, in the face of a severe threat to life.
