The shocking murder of teenager Shakilus Townsend, lured to his death in a "honeytrap" plot three years ago, is being dramatised by BBC3 as part of a season of programmes examining how crime affects young people.My Murder, which will air next week, tells the story of Townsend, a 16-year-old from south London who was led into an ambush by Samantha Joseph – a girl he was smitten with but who betrayed him to her ex-boyfriend and his gang.Townsend bled to death after being beaten with a baseball bat and stabbed six times. Joseph, her boyfriend, Danny McLean, and five other youths were found guilty of murder and given life terms.Written by 28-year-old playwright Levi David Addai, the BBC3 drama stars Attack the Block's John Boyega as Townsend, and has been made with the co-operation of the teenager's family."It wasn't a gang killing – it was a boy who met a girl," said Addai, who last year won the Alfred Fagon award for his play Blacklands. "I hope people don't think: 'It's just another urban drama, it's another black boy killed, it's another gang thing.'"For me, it's a story about a boy and a girl, and him trying to get with her … it's a simple story and something we can all relate to – those heightened emotions of being a teenager."The writer, who is also from south London, said the research material underlined his feeling that Townsend could have come from his own circle of friends. "I did feel like I knew that guy. It was really hard to read [the research]. He was so charming and popular."A drama seemed like the most compelling way to bring Townsend's story to the attention of the audience, said Clive Edwards, executive editor of current affairs for the BBC, who commissioned My Murder."Our job is to find the right kind of way of talking to a young audience about the issues that matter to them. Gang crime, knife crime, growing up on the streets of Great Britain – these are a very important part of that."Addai said he was keen to ensure the teenagers in his drama behaved – and spoke – in a realistic way. "I wanted to keep Shak rounded, because he wasn't an angel by any means," the writer said."Slang or youth speak is pretty much understandable – you can see what the intentions are. It was really important to capture the essence of the world that he lived in."BBC3's Criminal Britain series will include documentaries on rape and sexual violence, a programme focusing on what it means to be mugged, and an examination of what life is like for young people whose parents are in prison.My Murder, Monday 26 March, BBC3, 9pmwww.fearless.org
