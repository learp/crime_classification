A medical student was knifed to death in a "brutal, cold and ruthless" attack by a gang of men who plotted to steal his supply of the banned drug mephedrone, a court heard today.Muneeb Naseer, 21, from Bristol, was subjected to "extreme violence" during the attack in his bedroom at a student house in Liverpool last July.Alan Johnson, 30, Colin Clarke, 37, and Mark Hirst, 19, all from Liverpool, denied murder at the start of their trial at Liverpool crown court.Ian Unsworth QC, for the prosecution, said Naseer was found by his housemates with his legs bound by duct tape. His trousers were pulled down and were dripping in blood."Muneeb Naseer had been bound, humiliated, stabbed and left for dead," Unsworth told the jury. Those who knew Muneeb described him as highly intelligent, friendly, outgoing and humorous."Sadly, there was another side to Muneeb Naseer's life as a medical student. It was one that contrasted sharply with the aims of his chosen vocation."Unsworth told the jury that several months before the fatal attack, Muneeb's life became "off-balance". His behaviour changed and he "drifted" into dealing and using mephedrone, also known as "M-Cat" and "miaow miaow"."There is clear evidence that Muneeb Naseer began dealing the drug at a time when it was not illegal but continued to do so after it was banned in April last year," Unsworth said. "It was his involvement in the world of drugs that was, ultimately, to lead to his sad, premature and young death."The trial continues.
