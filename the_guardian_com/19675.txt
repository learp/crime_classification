The children's commissioner, Maggie Atkinson, has apologised to the mother of James Bulger for the "hurt" caused by her comments that Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were too young to stand trial for his murder.

Then she should resign or be sacked. To say that his killers should not have been tried in an adult court is stupid. They committed an adult crime – a cold-blooded murder that was planned and premeditated – and they were tried accordingly."The age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales was raised from eight to 10 in 1963. In most other EU countries it is 12 or 14. A 2003 UN convention on the rights of the child report called for the UK to raise the age of criminal responsibility "considerably".Fergus met the justice secretary, Jack Straw, last week to discuss the return to custody of Venables, who was freed on licence in 2001 after serving eight years in detention. Straw has refused to confirm the details of why Venables was detained and has said only that he faces "very serious allegations".
