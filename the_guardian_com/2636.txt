Detectives are to dig up part of a field in Herefordshire to search for the body of a bus conductor who disappeared more than 50 years ago, after a tip-off from a man who believes he saw his father and others preparing a makeshift grave at the time.Derek Saville, who was 25, vanished after leaving his girlfriend's house to walk home in the village of Canon Pyon, near Hereford, on the night of December 7 1954. Despite extensive searches and intense local and national media coverage, he was never heard from again.Police said yesterday that they believe there is a clear case suggesting he was murdered, after the witness, who lives in Perth, Australia, came forward to say that at the age of seven he saw his now deceased father digging what looked like a grave with a group of unknown men late one evening that month.The man walked into a police station on a visit back to Herefordshire in July 2005 to tell his story. But no police records of Saville's disappearance remained and officers began investigating, under the codename Operation Panda, only four months ago. They studied newspaper reports and interviewed retired police officers who worked on the original case.Two detectives travelled to Australia last week to reinterview the witness, and on Monday a team of forensic science experts and a digger operator will move in to search for Saville's remains.At the time of the original investigation there was speculation that Mr Saville had been threatened by his girlfriend's disgruntled former boyfriend on the day of his disappearance.Police said they were not aware of a link between that man, who is also now dead, and the father of the man in Perth. "We believe we have got a clear case to suggest he was murdered and a credible witness to suggest where he may have been buried," said Detective Inspector David Llewellin, from Hereford CID.
