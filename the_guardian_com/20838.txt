Police yesterday arrested a 53-year-old Dorset man in connection with the discovery of a woman's torso in north London.Scotland Yard murder squad detectives seized the man at his home in the West Country before bringing him to an east London police station for questioning. A group of teenagers found the torso in a suitcase they pulled out of Regent's canal in Islington, London, on Saturday, and yesterday police divers recovered her head and limbs in a bundle from the same stretch of water. Yesterday's arrest came after officers on Tuesday searched three London properties, two in Highbury and one in Holloway; items were taken away for forensic examination from one building, a flat in Conistone Way, Holloway, where searches were continuing last night. A police source said detectives suspected the dismemberment happened in the flat. The victim was a slim Afro-Caribbean woman, 5ft 3ins, in her 20s, but officers say they have no idea who she was. One theory is that she might have been a prostitute who operated in the King's Cross area, about a mile away. The dismembered body of the prostitute Paula Fields was found in the same canal near Camden four years ago. A five-year-old Nigerian boy's torso was found in the Thames three years ago, and an African ritual killing was suspected. But Commander Andy Baker, head of Scotland Yard, said he did not believe there was any ritual or witchcraft element to this killing.
