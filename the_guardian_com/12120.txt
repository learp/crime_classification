Former Labour MP David Chaytor has launched a bid to challenge his 18-month jail sentence for fiddling his parliamentary expenses.The lord chief justice, Lord Judge, and two other judges will hear an application by Chaytor, 61, at the court of appeal on 22 March.If the judges grant permission to appeal on that date they will then hear the full challenge. The prosecution will also be represented.Chaytor, who forged tenancy documents and invoices to falsely claim more than £22,000 of taxpayers' money for rent and IT work from the Commons authorities, was jailed on 7 January.Passing sentence at Southwark crown court, in London, Mr Justice Saunders told Chaytor that jailing him was one of the first steps in restoring public faith in the parliamentary system.Chaytor, a former lecturer from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, initially denied the charges. He changed his plea after failing to have the case thrown out by citing parliamentary privilege and claiming he would not receive a fair trial due to media scrutiny.He pleaded guilty to three counts of false accounting between November 2005 and January 2008.The fraud involved bogus documents he submitted to support claims totalling £22,650 for IT services and renting homes in London and his Bury North constituency.The court heard he only received £18,350 because he had already reached his limit for the IT expenses and was not awarded the full amount for one rental claim.A spokeswoman for the judicial communications office confirmed that an application for leave to appeal against sentence has been received.She said: "The application for permission, with appeal if granted, will be heard on 22 March before a court presided over by the lord chief justice."
