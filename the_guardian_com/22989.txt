A man who murdered his girlfriend's two-year-old daughter has been jailed for life and told that he must serve at least 17 years of his sentence.Dean Harris, 20, killed Amina Agboola after becoming angry at her soiling herself, prosecutors said during his trial at Cambridge crown court. Jurors were told that Harris kicked Amina so hard that she was thrown six feet across a room at her home in Yaxley, near Peterborough. The force of the blow was so severe that it tore her liver in two. Paramedics described finding her lying "like a rag doll".Harris, who had been in a relationship with the girl's mother, Sarah Racqueman, for five months, was left alone with the toddler last November despite warnings from social workers that he was dangerous and had a history of domestic violence. He was found guilty of murder in June, and was sentenced on Tuesday.Racqueman was acquitted of causing or allowing the death but admitted two charges of neglect relating to other children. She was given a suspended sentence. The court was told that Amina was found to have had a number of other injuries, including an untreated broken wrist.DI Alan Page said: "This was a horrendous case. There can be no justification for using violence against any child and Harris will have to deal with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. While no sentence can ease the pain felt by Amina's family, hopefully they will now be able to start moving on with their lives."
