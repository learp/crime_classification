A man zapped his wife five times with a stun gun during a drunken row, a court has heard.Antony Smith, 42, grabbed the Black Cobra device after his wife, Terri, smashed a mirror over his head, it was claimed.He is accused of blasting her in the stomach up to five times for between 20 and 30 seconds.Smith is then said to have dragged his wife outside by the hair before kicking her head during the incident in Swindon, Wiltshire in February.Ms Smith, 43, told Chippenham magistrates: "I felt something sharp. I was jabbed three, four, five times in my stomach, it was a sharp stabbing pain. I heard the clicky sound of the gun three or four times. I backed away. He dragged me through the front door very hard by my hair."Ms Smith said she went to her daughter's house. "I had a very black eye and the pain was bad. I was shaky, emotional and upset," she said."The police arrived at my daughter's house and advised I go to hospital. I had stomach cramps for a few days."The court heard Mr Smith bought the gun on a trip to Spain. On the night of the incident the couple, who have been married for 13 years, had been drinking in the Green Baize snooker club in Swindon.Ms Smith said she had consumed up to five pints of Carling lager and was "merry".They were watching television and eating a Chinese takeaway when she became overwhelmed with emotion at their "volatile" marriage, she said.She suddenly flipped over the coffee table and grabbed a two-metre (7ft) mirror from the wall, which she smashed over his head. "I don't know what came over me," she said.Philomena Creffield, prosecuting, said Mr Smith suffered just a small cut to the finger from her attack but then zapped her with the gun three to five times.Terri Smith was arrested following the incident but no further action was taken against her.Mr Smith denies assault. The case continues.
