The age of criminal responsibility could be "unreasonably low" in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, according to a report by the Royal Society. In these countries a child is allowed to stand trial at the age of 10 but the assessment, carried out by a panel of scientists, ethicists and lawyers looking at how developments in neuroscience should inform the practice of law, suggests some children's brains may not be sufficiently developed by that time.The age of criminal responsibility varies widely across jurisdictions. It's 12 in Scotland, 18 in Brazil and 15 in Sweden. Do you think England, Wales and Northern Ireland should raise theirs?
