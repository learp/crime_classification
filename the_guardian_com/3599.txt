A teenager yesterday broke down in tears as she recalled the moment when as a 10-year-old girl she came upon the battered body of her foster sister Billie-Jo Jenkins.Giving evidence at the appeal of her father, Si√¥n, Charlotte Jenkins also described her deep confusion after he was accused of murdering Billie-Jo.Ms Jenkins, now 18, remembered being worried that if she incriminated Jenkins, a deputy headteacher, he might not like her ever again.She also told the court of appeal that it was possible she may have said to her mother, Lois, that she "knew" her father had killed 13-year-old Billie-Jo.Ms Jenkins had flown in from Tasmania, where she, her mother and three sisters now live, to give evidence which Jenkins hopes will help prove he did not kill his foster daughter. His lawyers claim that if Charlotte and her older sister, Annie, had given evidence at his trial in 1998 they could have supported his version of events.The appeal court has been told the girls were not called because their mother had falsely told the police that they had turned against Jenkins, 46, and changed their stories.However, during her evidence, Ms Jenkins did not contradict her mother's reports of what she had been saying although she conceded her memories were hazy.Asked if she could remember the day when her foster sister died Ms Jenkins, who as a child was known as Lottie, replied: "Not perfectly."She recalled being picked up after a clarinet lesson by her father in his MG on a warm February Saturday afternoon in 1997. Jenkins then drove her and her older sister, Annie, back to their home in Hastings, East Sussex.The prosecution case is that Jenkins murdered Billie-Jo with a metal tent spike in a three-minute period after arriving back from the clarinet lesson and before he, Charlotte and Annie set off on a bogus trip to a DIY store to try to give himself an alibiMs Jenkins was not specifically asked about the length of time they were at the house but was invited by the defence to tell the court all that she remembered of the visit home.Ms Jenkins said she and her father went into the house and she "definitely" remembered going "quickly" up to her bedroom to put her clarinet away. She left the house and her father followed her soon afterwards. They began heading for the DIY store but turned back for home before they got there.Clare Montgomery QC, for Jenkins, asked who went into the house first.Ms Jenkins replied: "I think it was me."Ms Montgomery asked: "Where did you go?"Ms Jenkins' voice broke as she replied: "Into the dining room."Ms Montgomery continued: "We know you saw Billie-Jo."Tears streamed down Ms Jenkins' face as she nodded. She asked for a break and was ushered into a back room.Ms Montgomery then asked about conversations Mrs Jenkins claimed she had with her daughter which discouraged his trial team from calling the girls.Ms Montgomery asked if Ms Jenkins had told her mother she was worried about incriminating her father.Ms Jenkins replied: "I vaguely remember being worried about it but I can't remember the conversation."She was asked if she had ever told her mother she "just knew" that her father had killed Billie-Jo.Ms Jenkins replied: "I can't remember - I may have."Ms Montgomery pressed Ms Jenkins, asking: "Had you believed your father was guilty?"She replied: "I can't remember."The barrister continued: "What made you think he was guilty? What was being said to you?"Ms Jenkins answered: "I can't remember thinking it, so I don't understand why you're asking." She denied her mother had "coached" her to turn against her father.For the crown, Camden Pratt QC, had planned a "lengthy cross-examination" but having heard her evidence decided not to ask any questions.Ms Jenkins' sister Annie, 20, had declined to come from Tasmania as she felt she had only just settled in and it would disrupt her studies.However she gave a video interview, extracts of which were read out. She said she did not recall some conversations which her mother told police about.She also mentioned incidents in which Jenkins was allegedly violent to his daughters. She said he once punched her in the stomach and kicked Billie-Jo.She did not remember another incident in which Jenkins is said to have dragged her younger sister, Maya, up two flights of stairs by the ears.The appeal continues.
