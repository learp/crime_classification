All police authorities in England and Wales rebelled against the home secretary, Charles Clarke, tonight and refused to submit full plans for controversial police force mergers.The chairman of the Association of Police Authorities, Bob Jones, accused Mr Clarke of seeking to "divide and rule" leaders of the 43 forces.No police authority had submitted a full business case in time for tomorrow's Home Office deadline, despite Mr Clarke's offer of financial incentives to agree on creating as few as 12 "strategic forces", he said.Mr Jones said: "Police authorities have unanimously rejected the home secretary's plans to force these proposals through with indecent haste, and we believe there are also credible alternative options which should be considered very seriously."No police authorities have submitted full business cases to the Home Office. "Charles Clarke's offer of financial inducements to police authorities that agree before Christmas to voluntary mergers was an attempt to divide and rule and it discriminated against those police authorities who believe this complex matter should not be rushed."He added: "We are keen for further talks with the home secretary, aimed at ensuring financial support is available to all police authorities able to show their preferred option will enhance policing."We are also urgently seeking to establish that the costs of restructuring will not fall on council taxpayers."The APA launched a major rebellion over the plans last week, accusing Mr Clarke of trying to "bribe" forces into submission.The organisation estimated mergers would cost Â£600m to carry out.A Home Office spokesman said: "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's report in September concluded that the current 43 force structure in England and Wales was no longer 'fit for purpose'. "It recommended a reconfiguration of the police service based on strategic forces of sufficient size to provide both effective neighbourhood policing and to combat serious organised crime and terrorism."The home secretary asked police forces and authorities to submit responses by December 23 on their preferred options for the creation of strategic forces as well as the business cases to support these options."The government has always accepted that meeting this deadline was challenging and we are grateful to everyone for the work they have done over the past three months."He added: "We will look in detail at the submissions we have received after Christmas, when we will also announce the timetable for taking this matter forward."We recognise there will be a need for further discussions and we will be working closely with all police forces and authorities in January, including meetings with chief officers and police authority chairs to discuss the outstanding issues."Only 13 forces - less than a third of the current structure - said they wanted to take part in a merger, according to APA figures released tonight.Thirteen forces said they wanted to remain as "stand alone" forces.Another 15 have so far not expressed a preference, and the reform programme does not apply to the Metropolitan or City of London police.Mr Clarke's preferred option would have seen the 43 streamlined into as few as 12 regional constabularies.Opposition and Labour MPs say the plans are being unnecessarily rushed through, while others fear the cost of the changes would lead to council tax rises and that rural areas would lose officers to cities.The problems involved became clear earlier today when there was disagreement over a plan to merge four Midlands police forces to establish the second biggest constabulary in England and Wales.The West Midlands, Staffordshire and Warwickshire forces all backed a four-way merger that was supposed to include West Mercia police. But West Mercia declined to sign up and wants to remain as a stand alone force.The creation of a police "super force" in north-east England was also thrown into doubt after two chief constables proposed to "go it alone".The Home Office proposed merging the Northumbria, Durham and Cleveland forces.But Cleveland is resisting the proposal in favour of a smaller merger with Durham to create a Tees Valley force.
