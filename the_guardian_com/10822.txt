The troubled Premiership side, Leeds United, were thrown into further turmoil last night when player Jody Morris was charged with rape.Mr Morris, 24, was rearrested earlier yesterday following allegations that a 20-year-old woman was attacked in Leeds in the early hours of October 7, West Yorkshire police said. A 26-year-old man unconnected with United, 26-year-old Kristofer Dickie, was also charged with rape.Both men were being held in custody and are expected to appear before Leeds magistrates later today.Another Leeds player, Jermaine Pennant, 20, who was arrested yesterday in connection with the incident was released on police bail pending further inquiries.The England Under-21 star is on loan from Arsenal until December 20.A police spokeswoman said: "A 24-year-old man currently living in Leeds and a 26-year-old man from London have both been charged with rape."The charges are yet another blow to the football club which has struggled from one controversy to another this season, and where the board is becoming wearily accustomed to scandal.Last week, striker Alan Smith, 23, was questioned by West Yorkshire police about a bottle thrown into the crowd at the end of Manchester United's recent Carling Cup victory at Elland Road. He was released on police bail but has to return for further questioning.Earlier this month manager Peter Reid was sacked after a dismal start to the season. Adding to their woes are debts thought to be around £80m.Mr Morris was fined two weeks' wages - around £40,000 - by the club at the beginning of November after breaching the club's discipli nary code. His arrest in connection with the rape charge in October prompted an internal club investigation which saw him suspended for two weeks followed by a voluntary 10-day leave of absence.The suspension of Mr Morris, a former England Under-21 international, was the first time Leeds had taken such action against one of their players.The club did not suspend Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer who went on trial in January 2000 for an attack on an Asian student. Bowyer was acquitted of all charges while Jonathan Woodgate was convicted.No one from Leeds United was available for comment last night.
