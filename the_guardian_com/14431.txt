The judge and bestselling author Constance Briscoe has been jailed for 16 months at the Old Bailey for perverting the course of justice.She was convicted on Thursday following a retrial over allegations that she misled police during the investigation into speeding points given to the former Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne. A jury had failed to reach a verdict on the charge in January.Briscoe, 56, a criminal barrister and crown court recorder, has already been suspended from the judiciary and is likely to be removed from the bench.The author of two high-selling memoirs about an anguished childhood was one of the most prominent female black lawyers at the Bar.Mr Justice Baker sentenced Briscoe to four, five and seven months on each of three counts of perverting the course of justice, to be served consecutively. Her crime, he said, like that of Huhne and his former wife, Vicky Pryce, was "an act of arrogance by educated individuals who considered that respect for the law was for others".Briscoe's offence, the judge added, "strikes at the heart of our much-cherished criminal justice system which is integral to the good order of society".He praised Briscoe for her previously successful career, saying she was "a role model for others"."Blessed with intelligence, you did not get every advantage in life. You were the first person in your family to go to university. You had the privilege of being a crown court recorder and you have done all of this while raising your two much-loved children."Briscoe's experience in dealing with the media after the publication of her controversial autobiographies led her to offer her neighbour, Pryce, help in disseminating Huhne's speeding points story."When you came to provide your two witness statements to the police," Baker said, "you painted a wholly misleading picture of impartiality." He said she was helping Pryce, who wanted to ensure "the downfall" of Huhne.Briscoe's deception involved falsifying documents. "I regret that no other sentence can be justified than deprivation of your liberty," Baker explained.Briscoe almost appeared to smile as she heard her fate. "I'm very grateful, my Lord," she said to the judge.She had arrived at the Old Bailey staring at her mobile phone as she entered court two.She is now facing a criminal investigation into allegations that she fraudulently obtained medical documents from Southwark council to support her defence in a 2008 libel case. Scotland Yard said the matter was being investigated in the light of information received from the BBC.Briscoe was dropped as a prosecution witness in the Huhne-Pryce trial when it emerged in emails that although she had denied speaking to the press, she had been in contact with the Mail on Sunday over the speeding points story.She had presented herself as an "independent" witness to confirm Pryce had confided in her about Huhne, then an MEP, nominating Pryce as the driver when he was caught speeding in 2003.Huhne pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice on the eve of a planned joint trial. Pryce was convicted of the same offence following a retrial.
