The problem of serial offenders who are released from prison only to commit further crimes will be tackled this week by a new drive to boost education in jails.Half of all prisoners have the reading skills of a child of 11 or younger, rendering them virtually unemployable and creating a vicious circle that only encourages a return to crime when they are freed. Now Ministers are to announce a multi-million pound package to provide basic adult classes in jails, after research showed reoffending could be slashed by 12 per cent if every prisoner had some form of education. 'Prison is not a soft option. It has a key role to play in reducing the cycle of reoffending and we must increase the quantity and improve the quality of learning available to the 130,000 people who pass through our prisons each year,' said John Healey, Adult Skills Minister, who will unveil the new investment at a conference on prison education in Birmingham this week. Tony Blair's flagship Social Exclusion Unit is also preparing to publish a major report on reducing reoffending which will argue prisoners must be better equipped to cope with the outside world. The SEU is expected to recommend a shake-up of the current system which means prisoners get paid more for doing menial jobs such as cleaning than for attending classes. It is also understood to be considering ways in which prison warders could lead by example in joining in classes. Half of all male prisoners have previously been expelled from school and a third were regular truants, meaning thousands have no qualifications at all.
