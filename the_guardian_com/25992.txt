A man who was beaten to death in a pub brawl in south-east London could have been the victim of football hooliganism, police said yesterday.Duncan Frame, 52, of Plumstead was murdered on Saturday night during a fight at the Cutty Sark pub in Thamesmead, where both Tottenham Hotspur and Charlton Athletic football fans had been drinking during a charity event.The police were called at about 11.30pm and arrested 21 men, several of whom had been injured. One man remains in hospital. The other 20 are being questioned in police stations around London. Mr Frame was found unconscious and taken to Queen Elizabeth hospital, in Woolwich, where he was pronounced dead.Detective Chief Inspector Matt Horne said: "The death is being treated as murder and an incident room has been set up at Barking. Although we retain an open mind regarding the motive, one possible line of inquiry is that the fight was between rival groups of football fans."Peter Lowton, Greenwich borough police commander, said: "We will be working closely with the community to bring those responsible to justice."
