The deputy chief justice, Lord Justice Judge, yesterday accused the media of endangering public confidence in the independence of the judiciary by "direct personal attacks" on the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf. The appeal court judge is the second prominent legal figure to ride to Lord Woolf's defence over attacks on proposals by the sentencing guidelines council, which he chairs, to allow murderers who plead guilty up to a third off their minimum prison term. A fortnight ago the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, made a plea to newspapers to drop a "campaign of vilification". Neither named any papers but the Sun launched a campaign in September, just after Lord Woolf unveiled the council's draft guidelines. Lord Justice Judge pointed out that the guidelines followed the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which says in section 144 that there should be a reduced sentence for pleading guilty. "Nothing in that act of parliament suggests that murder cases are different from any others. So what the sentencing guidelines council - not the lord chief justice himself, or personally, or on his own - was doing in proposals was applying the law. If they had proposed that there should be no reduction for a guilty plea in a murder case, they would have been criticised, and rightly so." He told a Press Gazette/Newspaper Society law for journalists conference in central London that journalists had a responsibility to provide accurate, truthful information. The independence of the judiciary and the independence of the media were both "fundamental to the liberties which we still take for granted".
