Home Office rules on electronic tagging were changed following an application from Maxine Carr for early release under the scheme, it emerged today.The right of a prison governor to determine whether an inmate is fit for release has been removed in "exceptional circumstances" where it would undermine public confidence in the scheme.The prisons minister, Paul Goggins, said in a written parliamentary answer that "a recent case" had highlighted the fact that some offenders may be unsuitable for tagging.The final decision in such cases will now rest with the head of the National Offender Management Service, the organisation that replaces the Prison Service in June.A spokesman for the Prison Service confirmed that Carr had prompted the changes but insisted that her application would still be judged on its merits.Prison sources told the Press Association that Carr had applied to be freed early from Holloway prison in north London 28 days after being jailed for conspiring to pervert the course of justice over the Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman murders.She will be eligible for release on May 17, having served half of her three-and-a-half year sentence, including 16 months on remand.Offenders serving between 18 months and four years are allowed to apply for electronic tagging - also known as home detention curfew - if they have not been convicted of sex offences, child cruelty or racially-aggravated offences. They wear a device that sets off an automatic alarm if they fail to observe a curfew, usually at their home from 7pm to 7am.The tagging scheme was designed to clear jails of offenders who are not considered dangerous or violent. The reoffending rate for tagged prisoners stands at 5% since the scheme's introduction in 1999.
