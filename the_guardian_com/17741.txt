Three opportunities were missed to assess risks posed by a paranoid schizophrenic who repeatedly stabbed a young woman in a supermarket, a report published on Friday reveals.Samuel Reid-Wentworth, who had fantasies about killing young women, stabbed Lucy Yates around 21 times with a pocket knife, six weeks after being discharged from a mental health unit.After spotting her from a bus, he alighted and followed her into the Somerfield store at Littlehampton, West Sussex, in September 2008. The victim, then 22, survived the attack.Reid-Wentworth, who was also 22, was jailed for attempted murder under the Mental Health Act by a judge at Lewes crown court the following February and remains detained indefinitely at Broadmoor.Investigators looked at the care he had received from Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and found significant opportunities to assess the risk he posed had been missed. For example, when he was admitted to psychiatric services after assaulting two women in separate incidents with a torch and a spray can, he scrawled "October 2007 serial killer was here" under a poster on his ward bedroomÂ wall.Lewes crown court heard how Reid-Wentworth selected Yates as his intended target after having fantasies about drinking an attractive young woman's blood.He then launched what judge Anthony Scott-Gall described as a "horrific and wholly irrational" attack on Yates in front of stunned shoppers.Prosecutor Rob Hall said: "The defendant approached her from behind, put his basket down, took out a pocket knife of about nine inches and started stabbing Miss Yates repeatedly."Reid-Wentworth went on to pin her down to the ground as he repeatedly plunged the blade into her, inflicting injuries to her face, chest, back and abdomen.Witnesses to the attack, including young children, at first perceived it as a joke between two people who knew each other.When onlookers began to realise it was real, some started throwing items, such as baskets, at Reid-Wentworth to get him to stop.The report, which refers to Reid-Wentworth as Mr Z, says: "Assessment of risk was incomplete and the potential seriousness of the two assaults on the women prior to admission was still not fully appreciated."The third missed opportunity was when he was re-admitted to the acute mental health ward after the re-emergence of psychotic symptoms including thoughts of killing people."In addition, Mr Z had expressed dissatisfaction with his medication on a number of occasions and had asked to change it. The management plan at this stage contained no specific strategy to manage the increased level of risk of harm to others that Mr Z posed," the report says.In addition to the three "pivotal points" where opportunities were missed, there was also little evidence of staff attempting to establish a relationship with his mother, who was a very important part of his future care plan, the report says.After the publication of the report, Liz Redfern, director of nursing at NHS South of England, said: "It is important to remember that this attempted murder took place in 2008."I want to emphasise that the learning and the improvement of services by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust began to take place as soon as the outcome of the initial investigation [by the trust] was known."The outcome of this full independent investigation has continued to influence ongoing improvements."Investigator Derek Mechen said: "We found that a number of mistakes were made in this case."One of our key findings was that nobody in the clinical teams really understood the risks that Mr Z posed."Although it was recognised at the end of September 2007 that Mr Z should be assessed by the forensic team, the locum consultant who carried out the assessment had no forensic training and was not a forensic specialist."Mechen said there several warning signs about the risks Reid-Wentworth posed, including the assaults of the women in August 2007, the message scrawled on his wall in October that year and the discovery of a sharp piece of glass in his room the following month.He added: "Our report sets out 13 recommendations which, if implemented, will improve the safety of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's mental health services."These include developing their forensic services, reviewing patients whose diagnosis is uncertain every three months, training all staff with direct patient contact in risk assessment and management, and better liaison with patients' families and carers."
