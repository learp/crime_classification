A 26-year-old man was arrested after armed police were called to the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham today. Shops remained open for the traditional Boxing Day sales while police investigated the shooting. Witnesses told the Birmingham Mail there appeared to be a confrontation between two groups of youths in the area between Mango and Selfridges inside the mall. Police said they are holding a man who sustained injuries to his face in connection with the incident. A West Midlands police spokeswoman said a 19-year-old man was recovering in hospital from a gun shot wound to his leg.
