Yesterday's publication of the Home Office "narrative" into the July 7 bombings raised renewed calls from some of the victims' families for a full public inquiry.But it was always doubtful whether a government-produced report would command the same respect and confidence as an independent and robust public inquiry.One 7/7 survivor, Rachel North, made clear her dissatisfaction, saying: "These meetings that led to these reports took place behind closed doors ... They were internal investigations and I am not surprised that the politicians and security services have examined their work in secret and subsequently found themselves not to blame."The narrative does provide a fairly detailed account of the final movements of the four bombers. The amount of information provided in connection with the last hours before the bombings is clearly and convincingly presented, and is testimony to how painstakingly the police and security services must have worked to piece together the bombers' last movements.The report also argues - plausibly, in view of Mohammad Siddique Khan's video statement, that the men were motivated by "a twisted interpretation of Islam" and "perceived injustices carried out by the west against Muslims".The Home Office working groups on preventing extremism, set up following the 7/7 attacks, had also stated in their final report that: "British foreign policy - especially in the Middle East - cannot be left unconsidered as a factor in the motivations of criminal radical extremists. We believe it is a key contributory factor."However, remarkably, there is nothing in the report of what the Daily Mail today calls "the great unmentionable, the elephant in the room: Iraq".The new home secretary, John Reid, also today denied any Iraq link to the bombings, saying Khan had not specifically mentioned Iraq in his video statement.Just as it is important for British Muslims to face up to and counter the recent growth in extremism among a section of their community, it is equally important that the government examines its own actions, especially its war against Iraq, and asks itself honestly whether these have helped or hindered us in the struggle against terrorism.Announcing a public inquiry would be a good place to start.
