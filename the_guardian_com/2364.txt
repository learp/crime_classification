Police said yesterday that a 94-year-old woman who collapsed and died after she was burgled had been the victim of a distraction burglary a week earlier.Edna Lamont had been tricked by a man who claimed to be a builder and who stole things from her home in Failsworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester. She died in the early hours of Sunday after discovering that a window had been forced open and her handbag stolen. Greater Manchester police said they were not sure if the two incidents were linked. A postmortem found that Mrs Lamont had suffered a heart attack. Her daughter, Joyce Burrage, said: "Our family is grieving at mum's sudden and tragic death. She certainly did not deserve to end her life in what must have been incredibly terrifying moments full of fear. "Mum lived at her address for 68 years. She had wonderful neighbours and always felt safe there. She did not have any valuables - only her family photographs." Mrs Lamont went downstairs shortly after midnight on Sunday and discovered a window at the back of her house had been forced open and her handbag had been stolen. She called at a neighbour's house for help and they phoned police for her. When officers arrived, Mrs Lamont collapsed. She died in an ambulance on the way to hospital. Her death is being treated as suspicious. A 29-year-old man from Newton Heath, Greater Manchester, and a 32-year-old man from Failsworth have been arrested in connection with the second incident.
