A schoolboy who laughed after leaving a university graduate blind and bed-ridden was ordered to be detained for 5 years yesterday.The boy, who was 13 at the time, used a roadsweeper's broom to batter his victim's head as if he was "chopping wood". Muslim Yasir Abdelmouttalib, 22, had been on his way to a mosque for Friday afternoon prayers when he was attacked, Harrow crown court, west London, heard. Mr Abdelmouttalib suffered skull fractures and had been struck so hard that his brain had moved inside his skull. Doctors say he will be disabled for life. The boy was convicted last month of one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent on June 18 this year. The boy, the son of crack and cocaine addicts, was 11 when he had his first brush with the law and is already serving an 18-month detention order. Judge Nicholas Madge said there was no evidence that the attack had been "racially or religiously motivated". Had there been "the sentence would have been heavier". Steven Perian, prosecuting, said Mr Abdelmouttalib had been waiting at a bus stop. The defendant was on a bus with two friends. As it pulled up, he started shouting abuse. Mr Abdelmouttalib remonstrated and was attacked.
