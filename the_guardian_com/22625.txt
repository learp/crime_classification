A national strategy to ensure young sex offenders receive treatment must be put in place to protect children, a damning inquiry into a child killing urged today.The warning came in the official report into the savage murder of 11-year-old Wesley Neailey in Newcastle by 18-year-old paedophile Dominic McKilligan in 1998, months after being released from secure accommodation.McKilligan, who was jailed for life in July 1999, had been released from Aycliffe young people's centre in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, after committing a string of sex attacks on young boys in his hometown of Bournemouth in 1994. However, he was not eligible to be placed on the sex offenders register because his sentence - a three-year supervision order - ended just the day before the Sex Offenders Act of 1997 came into force. The report of the part eight review, Childhood Lost, warned that the current absence of a national strategy meant there were no consistent standards in terms of care arrangements, treatment methods, clinical accountability or staff training. The review - commissioned by the area child protection committees for Durham county council, Bournemouth borough council and Newcastle city council - found there had been serious breakdowns in management and communication between the 16 agencies and 200 staff involved in McKilligan's treatment. It also meant there could be no single regulatory framework or inspection system, no ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of services, and an uneven spread of services across the country, particularly specialist residential facilities.John Fitzgerald, chairman of the review panel, said a national strategy for dealing with young sex offenders was needed to ensure both the quality and geographical spread of residential treatment facilities. "Some children have particular vulnerabilities, as did the 11-year-old boy, which would be targeted by those who meant them harm," said Mr Fitzgerald. "There are lessons to be learned from this sad case that will reduce the risks to children from adolescent offenders."Renuka Jeyarajah Dent, the chief executive of the Bridge Child Care Development Service which compiled the report, said: "Predicting with certainty which young offender will kill is not possible but risks can be reduced by ensuring high quality practice and inter-agency cooperation."The part eight review - held to establish whether lessons can be learned about the way in which professionals work together to safeguard children - recommended that agencies pooled their knowledge of research, case history and assessment skills to provide "evidence based" decision making. It added that staff should also undertake further training to ensure they know how to work together effectively.In a joint statement, Bournemouth, Durham and Newcastle social services and North Tyneside health authority said they fully accepted the findings of the report and had already made improvements to their services.Newcastle director of social services, Tom Dervin, added: "Our task now is to support Wesley Neailey's family and to strengthen our working practices and relationships with the local health authority, the mental health trust, the probation service, police and other relevant agencies."The Neailey family also welcomed the report and said they were now considering taking legal action.
