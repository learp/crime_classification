The government was yesterday criticised over plans to hold inquests without juries, which campaigners fear could limit hearings into the deaths of British soldiers and people shot by police.The plans are contained in the new counter-terrorism bill published last month and allow the home secretary to withhold intercept evidence from the families of the deceased in the interests of national security or the UK's relationship with another country or "otherwise in the public interest".Although included in a bill to tackle the threat of terror, the new powers are not explicitly restricted to terrorism cases and could in theory be applied to deaths where no link with violent extremism is suspected. The provisions are designed to avoid the risk of sensitive information - such as details of secret service activities, phone-taps and surveillance - falling into the hands of randomly-chosen jurors.Privately, government officials say the new law covers only intercept evidence, but campaigners believe the power could be used more widely and effect inquests of British soldiers, the inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, and other deaths at the hands of the police.Helen Shaw, of Inquest, said: "We have serious concerns about these far reaching proposals, which have been introduced without consultation."The public will find it difficult to have confidence that these coroner-only inquests, with key evidence being suppressed, can independently investigate contentious deaths involving state agents."The coroner and lawyers would have to be vetted and the inquest would take place in secret.
