The justice secretary, Jack Straw, said today that the recall of one of James Bulger's killers, Jon Venables, to prison involved some "extremely serious allegations".James's mother, Denise Fergus, has demanded to know what the 27-year-old did to be sent back to jail, and is expected to have the chance to confront Straw in the coming days after he agreed to meet her.Justifying his decision not to disclose details of the recall, Straw said: "Our motivation throughout has been solely to ensure that some extremely serious allegations are properly investigated and that justice is done"."No one in this country would want anything other. That is what the authorities remain determined to do."Venables was released in 2001 on licence with a new identity after serving eight years for the murder of two-year-old James. He and friend Robert Thompson were just 10 when they battered the little boy to death in Liverpool.Venables was recalled to custody last week for breaching his licence terms, which include conditions such as not travelling to Liverpool or contacting Thompson.The government's refusal to give any details of the breach has prompted a storm a press speculation about what he did.The Sun reported today that he was taken back into custody after being accused of committing a serious sexual offence, while the Daily Mail said he had been working as a bouncer "for years".Straw reiterated his belief that it was "not in the public interest" to reveal the details of the breach, adding that the police and the director of public prosecutions agreed with his stance."We all feared that a premature disclosure of information would undermine the integrity of the criminal justice process, including the investigation and potential prosecution of individual(s)," he said.Fergus, 42, found out about Venables's recall on Tuesday, shortly before the news became public.She told the Daily Mail that on being told the news by a probation officer: "I threw question after question at her, but she blocked every one"."My fear was that he'd hurt another child, or any human being. I just don't want anyone else hurt by Venables or Thompson. I wanted to know that he hadn't done to someone else what he did to James and me."All kinds of horrible thoughts were going through my head, and they still are because no one will tell me what he's done. It's wrong â€“ as James's mother, I have a right to know."There are fears that Venables's recall could lead to the discovery of his new identity because of fellow prisoners' suspicions about special treatment.The prime minister said that although he understood the public "outrage" surrounding Venables' licence breach, the government would not comment on individual cases.Venables will appear before a parole board hearing within 28 days to examine why he was returned to jail.A board spokesman said it was likely the result of the hearing would be released because of the high-profile nature of the case. But the reasons for the recall were unlikely to be made public at this stage, he said.
