Joshua Karney, the man described as Britain's second most wanted paedophile, was arrested in Sussex tonight.The 29-year-old - jailed for 15 months for indecent assault in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, in 2002 - was detained when Brighton and Hove police carried out a special operation just before 6pm. Karney, who broke conditions of his release on licence, gave a false name to officers when they grabbed him as he walked along a street in Hove. He was taken to a custody centre in Brighton where his true identity was verified. Sources said Karney later admitted he had lied about his details. Brighton and Hove police said he offered no resistance after what they said was a "pro-active operation" launched after his whereabouts had been confirmed. "It was a very fast-moving operation to determine his location and then to arrest him," a spokesman said. Karney, said to be a "very high risk" offender, was expected to be transported back to Lancashire during the evening. He had been at large after failing to meet his licence conditions. There were several reported sightings of him, including one in Bournemouth, Dorset, after police appealed for help on BBC TV's Crimewatch programme. Karney, who uses several aliases including Mark Moffitt and Keiran O'Shea, had been recalled to prison for alleged breach of the sex offenders' register, on which he was placed on for 10 years.He was also wanted for theft and burglary.
