Police were keeping an open mind yesterday over whether an attack on the mother of Stephen Downing was linked to her son, whose conviction for murdering a woman in a churchyard was quashed after he spent 27 years in jail.Juanita Downing was dragged out of her home in Bakewell. She was punched repeatedly and told, 'Keep your mouth shut.' Mr Downing, now 45, was jailed for life aged 17, in 1974 for the murder of Wendy Sewell, aged 32, in 1973. He was freed this year after the Court of Appeal ruled his conviction was unsafe. Inspector Robin Gray said Mrs Downing answered a knock at the door of the home she shares with her husband, Ray, at about 8.15pm on Thursday. Her attacker dragged her down the steps of the house and punched her several times before fleeing on foot. She was treated at the scene by medical staff, but did not need to go to hospital. Insp Gray said: 'We believe that the only connection to Mr Downing is the fact that this attack happened at his parents' house. We are keeping an open mind over any connection to the murder of Wendy Sewell.' He appealed for witnesses. The only description of the assailant is that he wore blue jeans and a dark top. Speaking from the family home in Stanton View, Stephen Downing said his mother was very shaken. 'She is in quite a bad way.' Neighbours said they were shocked. Avril Prime, 59, said: 'I went to see her as soon as I heard what had happened. She was in a mess, very badly shaken up.' Another neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'It's pretty shocking. This is a quiet area. You don't get things like that happening round here.'
