Jurors in the trial of two men accused of the murder of Stephen Lawrence have been warned not to let emotion influence their deliberations.Mr Justice Treacy told the panel at the Old Bailey in London on Wednesday they must weigh up the evidence in the case without letting anger or sympathy interfere with the verdict. "Emotion, such as sympathy for the Lawrence family, has no part to play," he said. "Equally, anger at the nature of the attack on Stephen Lawrence cannot guide your decision."He told the jurors they must be "sure" of any verdict they come to, adding: "It's not necessary for every question raised in a case to be answered or for every loose end to be tied up. This is real life, it's not a detective novel."Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris, 35, deny murder.During his summing up, the judge set out key steps that jurors will need to follow in their route to a verdict. These included considering whether forensic evidence found on clothes seized from Dobson and Norris's homes got there via contamination during handling and storage, as the defence argues.The panel must also consider whether the defendants were present at the time of the attack and participated in it. If at least one member of the pair intended to kill or cause serious harm to Lawrence, then the attackers would be guilty of murder, the judge said. But if they intended to cause injury, falling short of serious bodily harm, then Norris and Dobson would be guilty of manslaughter.Treacy said: "Manslaughter is an alternative verdict to murder but it should only, and I stress that word, be considered if you have found the defendant in question not guilty of murder." He then went through the various witness accounts that the jury had heard, including details of any description of the attackers.There were some differences in the account given by Lawrence's best friend, Duwayne Brooks, and the other witnesses â€“ he said he had been chased by one of the attackers. The judge said the contrasting accounts could be because Brooks felt "a subconscious need to justify himself for running off at the time that he and Stephen were attacked".The court then heard a detailed account of the handling of exhibits, including assessments previously given by expert witness Rosalyn Hammond as to the risk of contamination.The trial is the only case sitting today at the Old Bailey, which has been especially opened during the holiday period.
