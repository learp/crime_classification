Crime has fallen by an unexpected 10% over the past year. The authoritative Crime Survey of England and Wales estimates 8m offences were committed – the lowest level since it started 32 years ago.The fall in crime seen in the 12 months to September 2013 occurred across most types of offences, and includes a drop in the murder rate to 542 homicides recorded by the police – 11 fewer than the previous year. Overall, violent crime is down by 13%, according to the survey.But the detailed police-recorded crime figures also show "signs of increasing upward pressure" in specific austerity-related crimes. These include a 4% rise in shoplifting, which is up by more than 11,000 to 313,693 offences. The police-recorded crime figures also show a 7% rise in "theft from the person", which includes pickpocketing, to 110,408 offences.The rise in shoplifting was seen in 29 of the 43 police force areas, with the largest increases in the West Midlands (up 18%), Merseyside (14%) and West Yorkshire (12%). In evidence of a new north-south divide, shoplifting in London fell by 1%.The quarterly figures also show a 17% increase in the number of sexual offences recorded by the police but the official statisticians say this is partly due to a "Yewtree effect" – more crimes being reported following the inquiry into historical sex offences after the Jimmy Savile case.A 34% increase in fraud offences is attributed to a move to a central system of recording such crimes.The Crime Survey estimates show that crime in England and Wales has now fallen by 58% since 1995, when it peaked at more than 18m offences. The decline in crime is the longest sustained fall since the second world war and has continued through the latest recession.The survey is based on interviews with 40,000 members of the public about their experience of crime and is a measure of crime against adults and households. It is independent of the police.The results show a 10% fall in household crime, including burglary, theft, bicycle theft and vandalism. A separate component in the survey estimates that 859,000 crimes were suffered by children aged 10 to 15 last year, down from more than 1m in 2009-10. Most crimes against teenagers involved violence or theft of their personal property.The contested police-recorded crime figures, which lost their "national statistics" status this month, also show a decline of 3% over the same period at 3.7m offences.The Office for National Statistics said the police-recorded crime figures for Kent, where action has already been taken to tackle allegations of under-recording of crime, had risen by 8%. This could indicate the level by which overall police-recorded crime figures would be likely to rise if similar measures were adopted by the other 42 forces.That increase could become public in the politically charged runup to next year's general election if all forces improve their compliance with national standards during the course of this year.Jeff Farrar of the Association of Chief Police Officers said the further 10% fall in overall crime was encouraging and was the lowest estimate in the entire history of the Crime Survey, which began in 1981.He said it was positive that both major measures of crime continued to fall and that the gap between the survey and the police figures had continued to narrow.He said that while there had been increases in shoplifting and pickpocketing, there were reductions across the main categories of police-recorded crime, including in particular a 9% fall in knife crime and a 5% fall in gun crime.Norman Baker, the crime prevention minister, claimed the latest figures showed the government's police reform programme was working and crime was continuing to fall: "Overall, crime has fallen under this coalition government by more than 10%, according to the Crime Survey, and this is mirrored by the fall in police-recorded crime since 2010. England and Wales are safer than they have been for decades with crime now at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981."Britain's top 10 burglary hotspotsThe postcodes of Britain's top 10 burglary hotspots – concentrated in London, Manchester and Liverpool – listed according to the number of claims made for every 1,000 people1.
