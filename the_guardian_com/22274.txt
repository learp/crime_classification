A 16-year-old girl who acted as a "honey trap" to lure her boyfriend, Shakilus Townsend, to his death and then walked off with one of his killers was convicted of his murder today.Townsend, 16, was beaten with baseball bats and stabbed at least four times by a gang wearing masks and hoods in Thornton Heath, south London, last July.Samantha Joseph was Shakilus's girlfriend but wanted to get back with her former boyfriend, gang member Danny McLean. McLean, 18, had split up with Joseph after an 18-month relationship and was jealous of Shakilus. He and five other teenagers who ambushed the 16-year-old were also convicted of murder today.Joseph, who was still obsessed with McLean, had told him Shakilus was her cousin but, aware McLean had not fallen for the ruse, she told a friend "either I get the beats, or he [Shakilus] gets the beats".CCTV pictures from the day of the attack show her wearing a floral dress as she met Shakilus and took a bus with him. She "played her part to perfection," said the prosecution, luring him to the ambush while secretly calling McLean on her mobile. Joseph, who was 15 at the time, laughed as Shakilus's attackers caught him and rained down blows with fists, feet and baseball bats before she walked away.McLean, who was injured by a bat during the attack, plunged a knife into Shakilus's chest and into his liver, inflicting a wound 15cm wide and 7cm deep. As he bled to death, Shakilus called for his mother and cried: "I don't want to die."Joseph was later seen walking off with McLean, carrying his hoodie and a handbag stained with his blood.He was wearing a bright orange bandana, the colour identifying him as a member of the "Shine My Nine" gang to which he and the other attackers belonged.Joseph had tried to erase all signs of her relationship with Shakilus after his death, deleting his online Bebo account and telling friends to erase his number from their phones.Shakilus's mother, Nicola Dyer, 34, said her son had been "smitten" with Joseph and hoped they would get married and start a family together. "I can't understand how she could have callously set him up and lured him to his death," she said.She said her son, who had been in trouble with police in the past, had been making "positive changes in his behaviour". Dyer pleaded for parents to be vigilant and prevent their children carrying knives or joining gangs."Shakilus's death was a senseless premeditated murder and nobody deserves to die in the appalling way that my son did, especially not a child," she said.Detective Inspector Barney Ratcliffe said Joseph had "knowingly and callously led him to his death".The other teenagers convicted of murder were brothers Tyrell Ellis, 19, and Don-Carlos Ellis, 18, from Thornton Heath; Andre Johnson-Haynes, 18, a former public schoolboy from Croydon who played rugby for London Irish; Andre Thompson, 17, from South Norwood; and Michael Akinfenwa, 17, from Upper Norwood.
