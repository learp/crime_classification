A Turkish waiter suspected of murdering his British girlfriend in Istanbul has won his fight to remain in the UK under political asylum, despite a fresh investigation by the Home Office.Asur Saribal, 32, claimed he was a political refugee who could not go back to his homeland, where police want to question him over the death of Anna Galliano, because he was a Kurd with links to the separatist organisation PKK and the terrorist group Dev Sol. Immigration officials believed Mr Saribal's claims that he would be tortured if he went back to Turkey, and granted him asylum. But his assertions were later claimed in a BBC documentary to be false. This prompted the Home Office to launch a new inquiry into Mr Saribal, now married and running a kebab shop in Essex. Mr Saribal claimed his father had been an activist who had died in jail and that as a boy he had sprayed anti-government graffiti on walls. The BBC2 programme claimed, however, that he came from a village inhabited not by Kurds but by an Islamic sect not persecuted by the Turkish government. He was found to have no links with Dev Sol. His father, the programme claimed, was alive in Istanbul. The only claim that did stand up was that he was a draft-dodger, and faced punishment for avoiding conscription. The immigration service, with the backing of then home secretary Jack Straw, then issued a notice of intention to deport Mr Saribal, which was upheld by the present home secretary, David Blunkett. But yesterday a high court judge quashed the notice, saying there was not enough evidence to prove Mr Saribal deliberately set out to defraud the immigration appeal tribunal, which ruled he should be allowed to stay in the UK.
