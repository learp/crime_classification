In proposing to harass and hound anti-social youths, the home secretary appears to be learning the wrong lessons from the Essex police experiment (Police should harass young thugs, May 8). There were four elements. 1) Police found that a small number of individuals were responsible for the bulk of complaints. 2) That police intelligence was poor and that approaching the community dramatically improved effectiveness. 3) Having identified a small number of individuals, resources could be targeted to ensure behaviour modification. 4) In the target community, youth facilities were almost non-existent.Jacqui Smith has focused on one element. There are alternative approaches, less costly than using the police. Social services can identify the reasons why children are out at night and out of control. Best of all, proper youth facilities can be provided, at about one third of the cost of extra policing. In a very effective project at Jarrow, when police found youths hanging round on the streets, they took them to the youth club. This approach was popular with the local police, who hate dealing with low-level nuisance. Why is the government leaping in the direction of a contentious approach without first considering more positive methods that have broad public approval?Heather McDougall North Shields, Tyne and Wear It seems that the home secretary, like Blair before her, has not properly understood the difference between respect and obedience. The latter can be commanded by coercion or harassment. The former cannot.Professor Philip StenningSchool of criminology, Keele University
