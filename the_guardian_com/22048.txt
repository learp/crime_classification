A man accused of killing Stephanie Hammill, a 20-year-old travel agent, after she jumped or fell from his moving car after mistaking it for a taxi was yesterday found guilty of kidnap.Greek electrical engineer Ioannis Revenikiotis, 28, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, is also accused of manslaughter, and the jurors at Sheffield crown court are still deliberating on this charge. The court had previously heard how Miss Hammill was attempting to flag down a taxi with her partner, James Garland, in November 2003. The black Mercedes, which was being driven by Revenikiotis, stopped, but when Miss Hammill got in, it sped off leaving her boyfriend behind and her leg sticking out of an open rear door. After 50 metres the door was slammed. Her body was found on the road at the edge of the city. It is not clear if she jumped or fell from the moving car. The jury heard she had been hit by another vehicle.Mr Garland was able to alert a passing police van and her body was found minutes later, less than two miles away.The court heard that Revenikiotis had been working in Wakefield after graduating from Huddersfield University. Following Miss Hammill's death his car was found in Greece and he was extradited.The jury were sent home for the night and will resume deliberations today.
