The Home Office has started to pay out compensation - some Â£55,000 in nine cases so far - to foreign national prisoners who have been held beyond the end of their sentence while deportation was considered, it was disclosed yesterday.The director-general of the immigration and nationality directorate, Lin Homer, told MPs that nine months after the foreign national prisoner crisis cost Charles Clarke his job only 163 of the 1,013 inmates freed without being considered for deportation had left the UK.In an update to the Commons home affairs select committee, Ms Homer also revealed 28 of the 189 foreign offenders convicted of serious crimes and freed from prison without being considered for deportation are still at large. Opposition MPs criticised the lack of progress and feared hundreds of inmates would become eligible for compensation.The nine cases in which compensation was won involved mistakes made while inmates were being held beyond their original term: "Typically compensation has been paid out in these cases due to technical deficiencies around serving the detainees with appropriate legal documents," Ms Homer said.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "At a time when our prisons are crying out for urgent extra resources it would be an insult for taxpayers' money to be spent this way as a result of the government's utter incompetence."Ms Homer told MPs they had considered 675 individuals for deportation out of the original 1,013 foreign prisoners who had been freed without being considered for deportation. So far only 163 of them had been sent home. Officials decided not to proceed in 275 cases and the courts had overturned the deportation decision in a further 31 cases, often because of the length of time the individual had lived in Britain. In many remaining cases the offender is still in jail or on remand and cannot be considered for deportation until later in the sentence.But Ms Homer did reveal that one of the original group of 1,013 freed before they were deported has, since the last update in December, been convicted of a serious offence against a member of their family.She blamed delays on the fact 440 of those who faced deportation had appealed to the courts, which took greater account of the time they had lived in Britain. She claimed many had also used last-minute legal barriers to frustrate their removal.
