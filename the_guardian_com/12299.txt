A 16-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of an Ealing pensioner who was attacked as he tried to stamp out a fire during the London riots. Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, died in hospital just before midnight on Thursday after he was attacked in Spring Bridge Road in Ealing, west London, during last Monday's unrest.The teenager has also been charged with violent disorder and four separate burglaries of commercial premises, and his mother has been charged with perverting the course of justice.Daren Streeter, head of the Crown Prosecution Service London homicide unit, which authorised the charges, said: "At this stage, there is a reasonable suspicion that the 16-year-old was responsible for the unlawful killing of Mr Bowes. It is clearly in the public interest that he be prosecuted for this offence."As with all prosecutions, we will keep the case against the defendant under review and consider any new evidence provided to us by the police during their ongoing investigation into this incident." The 16-year-old will appear at Croydon youth court on Tuesday.A 22-year-old man arrested on 12 August on suspicion of murder, rioting and three burglaries has since been bailed.Bowes, who lived alone in Haven Green, Ealing, was placed on a life-support machine following the attack, which took place as violence spread through the capital.A postmortem examination revealed he died from head injuries sustained during the incident.
