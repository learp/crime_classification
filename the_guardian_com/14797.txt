A quad bike thief being chased by a farmer took an unlucky turn into a squad of special forces soldiers, police said today. Nick Walker, 26, was working at his family's farm outside Tow Law, County Durham, on Monday when he saw a thief speeding away on a quad bike. He gave chase on another 450cc machine. They reached speeds of up to 50mph, with the thief eventually losing control after hitting a kerb. At that moment, a busload of Dutch soldiers, heading towards Otterburn, Northumberland for a training exercise, arrived and held the suspect until police turned up to arrest him.
