✤ These are exciting and inspiring times: after the blossoming of the Hollaback! movement – an initiative to fight street harassment via crowd-sourcing, we have now entered the mighty age of the SlutWalk. The inaugural SW took place in Toronto last month. Some 3,000 marchers were motivated by the controversial comments made by a police officer in a lecture to law school students on the subject of personal safety. "Women," he told them, "should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimised." The effect has been incendiary: in cities across North America, from Arizona to Wisconsin, Oregon to Illinois, they have marched, and now the world follows suit: Sweden, Argentina, Australia, with SlutWalks scheduled for London, Los Angeles and Amsterdam on 4 June. The message is simple: sexual assault is an act of violence by the perpetrator, and not ever something inspired, occasioned or asked for by the victim – no matter what she or he is wearing, or how she behaves.✤ This vaguely brings us to Beyoncé. Like many, I was rather touched by YouTube footage of the singer's surprise visit to a school in Harlem to take part in a dance class as part of the Let's Move campaign to encourage fitness and tackle childhood obesity. But I was shocked to find that the comments beneath it formed a vile pit of misogyny, with many accusing these young girls of dancing like "whores" and, indeed, "sluts". As a brief aside, let us remember that Ms Knowles's latest song is Run the World (Girls). Some days this seems more of a pipe dream than others.✤Lastly, we are delighted to learn that grrl has entered the Collins Official Scrabble Words guide. I think that means we run the Scrabble board too, right Beyoncé? Placard-waving Hollabacker? Triple-word scoring slut? Do join us on the blog at theguardian.com/g2.
