A second man has died following an arson attack on a convenience store in south London last Thursday, Scotland Yard said today.The victim was named as 31-year-old Hamidi Hamidullah, an Afghan who worked at Pricecutter Food and Wine in Clapham Road, Kennington.A Scotland Yard spokesman said a postmortem examination would be held later today.Hamidullah's co-worker Khizar Hayat was burnt to death when he was trapped in the store after the attack, which happened in daylight hours.Detectives hunting a suspected racist firebomber believed to be responsible for three recent attacks on Asian-run stores in south London arrested a 33-year-old man at an address in Stockwell, south London, on Monday.This weekend, police revealed details of two other attacks thought to be linked to that in Kennington.The first took place at a newsagent's in Tulse Hill at 1.30pm on April 14 when a bottle filled with accelerant was thrown into the premises and hit the legs of a customer, who suffered burns. No one else was injured.The second happened at an off-licence in Portland Road, South Norwood, on April 20. A lit bottle filled with petrol was thrown into the building, but the people inside were able to escape.All three attacks were almost identical, and the description of the suspect matched.
