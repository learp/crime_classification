Gordon Brown today said he would wage a "cultural war" on terrorism akin to the one adopted against 20th century communism.Stressing the importance of winning the "the battle for hearts and minds", he said it fell on today's generation to "address this threat"."We must work across society to isolate the extremists from society to protect and advance the British way of life," he told Association of Chief Police Officers' annual conference in Manchester.In a wide-ranging speech, the chancellor also proposed earlier involvement with families deemed to be troublesome."We need to intervene earlier when children show the first signs of behavioural problems," he said.Amid the continuing crisis on prison overcrowding that is likely to see Lord Falconer authorise the early release of some non-violent offenders, Mr Brown said there would be money for new jail places including fast-build units by the end of the year.However, he did not specify how much the Treasury would hand over for the construction programmeIn an echo of Tony Blair, the next prime minister proposed some parents might need to sign "parenting contracts" to "change their own behaviour".Mr Brown told delegates that he would "not shirk" from giving the police more powers to deal with weapons crime."The clear message needs to go out to young people that carrying a weapon will be dealt with seriously: five years for guns, two years for weapons."Drug dealers face being named and shamed, drugs education needed to be emphasised in primary schools while committing some crimes on public transport may constitute an aggravating factor, he said.
