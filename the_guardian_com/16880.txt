Sir William Macpherson's report on the death of teenager Stephen Lawrence is a devastating critique of the Metropolitan police, and it urges fundamental reform of race relations in Britain.He accuses the force of "pernicious and institutionalised racism" and demands that senior officers accept his conclusions as a precondition of change.In a key passage which directly challenges the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, the report says: "There must be an unequivocal acceptance of the problem of institutionalised racism and its nature before it can be addressed as it needs to be in full partnership with ethnic communities . . . Any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it extremely difficult to work in harmony and co-operate with the community in the way that policing by consent demands."The report, which makes 70 recommendations, will undoubtedly put enormous pressure on Sir Paul, who has said he will resign only if he is accused of dishonesty or criminality.However, his position is bound to be weakened by the findings, especially as he refused to accept the existence of institutionalised racism within his force when questioned at the inquiry.Sir Paul conceded there were grave failings in the way the force tackled racist crimes, and that stop and search laws were sometimes applied unfairly against black people.Sir William defines institutional racism as "the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping."Describing racism as a "corrosive disease", he details the failures of the police after the teenager's death in 1993.Their ineptitude included failing to arrest swiftly the five suspects - Neil and Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson, Luke Knight and David Norris - losing evidence, ignoring witnesses and destroying or mislaying documents.Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden, who took over the investigation 72 hours after the killing, told the inquiry that he did not realise a suspect could be arrested on "reasonable suspicion".According to extracts of the report leaked to the Sunday Telegraph, Sir William says the police "underplayed or ignored" the importance of race relations while investigating the murder. He further accuses officers of refusing to acknowledge that the attack was racially motivated.He is withering about the police internal review of the investigation, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Roderick Barker, which concluded that the Met had followed correct procedures.The report says Sir Paul should have realised the review was incompetent."There was a lack of rigour in the reception of the review document, first by Mr Osland [the Met's deputy assistant commissioner] but also those above him, including the commissioner himself. Without the need for hindsight the review should have generated questions from senior officers which may have uncovered the difficulties which have substantially been revealed in this investigation."Sir William points to discrepancies in the accounts of the two senior officers. Mr Barker said he told Mr Osland he had misgivings about the case. Mr Osland denied the claim. One of them was "palpably wrong and cannot be telling the truth".The report says Sir Paul's criticism of aggressive questioning at the Lawrence inquiry was not "appropriate or justified", adding: "It is of central importance that the Commissioner and his officers should recognise and accept" that racism is rife within the police.The report argues that progress will be "difficult if not impossible" if Sir Paul is not prepared to accept that his force was to blame for much of the anger directed at the police during the inquiry.Sir William says the only explanation for the multitude of errors and incompetencies is "pernicious racism".He suggests sweeping reforms to tackle it, including radical changes in the legal and criminal justice system and amendments to the National Curriculum to promote cultural diversity and tolerance.The report calls for the Court of Appeal to be given power to permit prosecutions after an earlier acquittal if there is strong new evidence to consider - three of the suspects in the Lawrence case were acquitted and cannot be tried again for murder.The report calls for a toughening of the Race Relations Act to make police officers vulnerable to compensation claims if they are found guilty of discrimination. At present they are exempt. If implemented, courts could award damages of up to Â£500,000 for loss of employment or aggravated damages. Other amendments would give the Commission for Racial Equality powers to launch investigations into the police.The Sunday Telegraph claims other recommendations include making it a crime to use racist language and possessing an offensive weapon, even in private.Sir William says victims' families should be given advance disclosure of evidence at inquests. The paucity of information offered to the Lawrences, he says, showed a lack of "open and meaningful communication".The Home Secretary, Jack Straw, is believed to have prepared a raft of measures to be announced on Wednesday. He will launch racial awareness campaigns for police training, improved support for victims and witnesses, and recruitment targets for black and Asian officers.He is also in favour of changes in the National Curriculum so that to make racial awareness is taught from pre-primary school age.Mr Straw is considering plans to replace the Police Complaints Authority, or endow it with greater powers.
