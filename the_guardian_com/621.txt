Just one in every hundred crimes committed in the UK leads to a court conviction, Sir Menzies Campbell revealed today as he launched an anti-crime crusade that will be at the heart of his party's local election campaign.The Liberal Democrat leader joined officers on the beat in central London to highlight a Lib Dem pledge to scrap proposals for ID cards and use the money for extra police.Sir Menzies accused Tony Blair of presiding over a decade of "tough talk and spectacular failure", pointing to a doubling of violent crime and rising levels of street crime and mugging."To fight crime effectively, we don't need to get tougher, we need to get smarter," Sir Menzies said."A liberal approach to crime is an honest approach to crime."It is based on what works rather than what sounds good. It targets the offender rather than the innocent."And it has the courage to engage with the criminal and reform their behaviour."The British Crime Survey recorded 11,016,000 offences against adults living in households in England and Wales in the year to June 2006.The Liberal Democrats insist that the figure almost trebles to around 33m if crimes against children and businesses are included.Yet the 2005 Criminal Statistics showed that 306,000 cases were sentenced by the courts that year, representing just under 1% of the total number of crimes.Sir Menzies said that individuals were twice as likely to buy a winning lottery ticket than to be convicted in court for a crime they had committed.Under the Lib Dem blueprint, criminals will receive "honest" sentences to be served in full, backed by compulsory education and training in prison to reduce reoffending, he said."Prisoners shouldn't sit in their cells for 23 hours a day, they ought to be engaged in work that is productive and useful," he said."By making prisoners do real work for a real wage, we can also instil a sense of responsibility, enhance their skills and ensure that victims are properly compensated."Prisoners will literally pay for their crimes, whilst gaining the skills and experiences needed to dissuade them from further offences."The public will also be empowered to "take back our town centres" through amended licensing powers which will make it easier form them to get nuisance pubs and clubs closed down.The proposals will form the central plank of the Liberal Democrat campaign for the local elections on May 3.
