The friend who was with Mary-Ann Leneghan on the night she was killed broke down in court today as she described being told she was also about to die.The 19-year-old, who survived despite being shot in the head, told the jury that, after being raped, her attackers asked her if she was "ready to die".The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and Mary-Ann, 16, were allegedly abducted on May 6 last year and taken in the boot of a car to the Abbey House hotel in Reading, Berkshire, where they were subjected to a lengthy ordeal of rape, torture and burning with boiling sugared water and cigarettes.The victims were then taken to the city's Prospect Park, where Mary-Ann was stabbed to death and her friend was shot in the head, but "miraculously survived", the jury heard.The teenager began giving evidence yesterday at Reading crown court in the trial of six men for murder, attempted murder, rape and grievous bodily harm.Today, as she was questioned by prosecutor Richard Latham QC about the final moments in the hotel room and being led out to the car, she broke down and the hearing was briefly adjourned.She told how she and Mary-Ann had been told to shower so she could wash the dried blood off her head, but she was then taken out of the shower to give oral sex to a man. She said she was then told to sit on top of him as he sat on the toilet seat, and he raped her.She said she was then interrupted by one of the men who said: "We are ready to go now. Let's leave these bitches now. Come on, let's do it."Mr Latham asked: "What did 'let's do it' mean?"She replied: "I didn't know exactly what they were going to do but I assumed it would be the final stage, that we were going to die, that they were going to kill us."After another forced shower, she and Mary-Ann were led out to a car.Mr Latham asked: "How did you feel in the light of what had been said to you as you were going from the room to the car?"She said: "Scared."Mr Latham: "Because you knew what was going to happen to you?"The witness then put her hand to her head and started to cry.Joshua Morally, 23, and his brother, Jamaile, 22, both of Balham, south London; Indrit Krasniqui, 18, of Chiswick, west London; Llewellyn Adams, 24, of Balham; Michael Johnson, 19, of Southfields, south-west London, and Adrian Thomas, 20 of Battersea, south London all deny murder, attempted murder, rape and causing grievous bodily harm to the two teenagers.All deny kidnap, except Joshua Morally, who admits two counts of kidnap. Jamaile Morally denies a further charge of raping Mary-Ann's friend.Friends and family wept and left the court as the teenager went on to describe how she watched as Mary-Ann was stabbed in front of her pleading for mercy. First describing how they were taken out of the hotel room and back to the car boot, the girl said she believed there were "more than two" voices in the car as they drove to the park.She said the men seemed "calm" during the journey, which ended when they arrived in the park just as dawn was beginning to break. The teenager said Mary-Ann had been "terrified" as they stepped out of the car and that she was also afraid but trying not to show it.She said the two of them were then marched on to grass and she had tried to wipe the blood from her eye. She said they were then told to kneel, touching the side of the witness box to indicate how close the two girls were at the time.The witness said pillowcases were placed over their heads and she remembered wiping the blood from her eye with the pillowcase as the men "talked quietly to each other". Recalling that she heard Mary-Ann being out of breath, the witness told the jury she lifted up the pillowcase to "peek at first" at what was going on and later lifted it completely.Asked by Mr Latham what happened next she paused for around 30 seconds before looking straight ahead at the jury and saying "she was stabbed".The court was told the knifeman wore a bandana. Asked where on Mary-Ann's body the man had put the knife, the witness said: "Her upper body, her chest, her breasts, everything."Mr Latham asked: "Was she saying anything?"The witness said: "She was asking 'please not there, please not there' whatever area she was referring to, and crying and pleading."She said that Mary-Ann then fell in a ball on the ground but the stabbing did not stop."He got more angry because she wouldn't sit up, he was telling her to sit up because he wanted to slit her throat, that was when she was saying 'not there, not there' and he was stabbing and then she fell."She went on to say that the man with the bandana had said to the other man that he wanted to shoot Mary-Ann because "she wouldn't shut up". She said the man did not go on to shoot Mary-Ann and that she heard one man say: "'No, that's for her,' meaning me."The woman told the court that the gun was put to her head and she was asked whether she was ready to die. She said an attacker then told her: "Those are going to be your last moments, seeing your friend being butchered."The court heard she was then shot and unconscious for an uncertain period of time, "possibly minutes", but when she woke up she could still hear Mary-Ann breathing. Worried the attackers might not have gone far away, the woman made her way towards Tilehurst Road where she was able to summon help.She went on to describe to the jury how, 10 days later, she identified her attackers through photos provided by the police, picking out Mr Johnson as the man who had worn a bandana and adding: "He killed Mary-Ann."The trial continues.
