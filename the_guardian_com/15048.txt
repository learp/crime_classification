A jewellery shop manager held at gunpoint during the £40m robbery of Graff Diamonds in Mayfair was involved in an inside job to steal the gems for insurance, it has been alleged during the trial of those accused of the heist.Martin Leggatt, manager of the New Bond Street store, was accused during cross-examination after telling jurors how two armed robbers had threatened to shoot staff before emptying display cabinets.Questioning Leggatt, who is shown on CCTV spread-eagled on the shop floor during the robbery on 6 August, defence counsel Courtenay Griffiths QC told him: "I don't want there to be any illusions between us, I am going to suggest that this robbery in August last year was an inside job and that you were involved in it."Mr Leggatt, dismissed the claim as "a conspiracy theory". "I would be absolutely fascinated to hear your evidence for that," he said.The barrister told Woolwich crown court that Graff Diamonds, owned by Laurence Graff who was known as the "King of Bling" and the "Lord of the Rings", had been subjected to a series of previous robberies at its stores both at home and abroad in which jewellery totalling millions had been stolen.In some cases, such as that on 6 August, they were conducted by two men wearing disguises and substantial amounts of jewellery were taken. Describing Graff as "specialists in being robbed", Mr Griffiths listed raids in 1980, 1993, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009, including a $38m (£24.5m) raid at a branch in Toyko, a $13.5m heist in its Dubai store and £20m stolen from its Sloane Street store in London."There just appears to be recurring bad luck for Mr Graff," he said. "He just seems to be getting robbed all the time of millions of pounds worth of jewellery.""Thank you for your sympathy," replied Leggatt, who has worked for Graff for 17 years.Griffiths said that one shop assistant immediately after the robbery had told police the gems stolen were worth £20m but later reports put the value at £40m."Do you understand where I'm coming from?" asked Griffiths."I've got a horrible feeling I do, yes," replied Mr Leggatt, who said he did not know the exact value of the jewellery taken.Nine men deny conspiracy to rob the store. They include Aman Kassaye, 24, and Craig Calderwood, 27, who are alleged to be the two men disguised by professional make-up who entered the store, held staff at gunpoint then made their escape by holding a shop assistant hostage. A shot was fired during the getaway. The jewellery was handed to a waiting motorcyclist. None of it has been recovered.Griffiths asked Leggatt why security guards at the store had not pressed the alarm button to alert the security firm until 4.43pm at the end of the two and a half minute raid when the robbers had left; and why they had not activated a smoke alarm that would have filled the shop with dry ice.Leggatt said he could only surmise it was to avoid "a massacre" inside the store, with two men with pistols shooting randomly in a room so thick with dry ice and smoke that "no one could see anything"."Was it for strategic operational reasons like 'Let's not call the police until after this set up robbery has taken place?'" the barrister asked.Leggatt replied: "I really relish the chance to listen to your conspiracy theories."Questioning Leggatt over his boss's financial affairs, Griffiths asked if he was aware that because of the credit crunch "Mr Graff was sitting on a load of unsold diamonds".Griffiths said Graff had "bought half a- million shares" for £28.5m in a company called Gem Diamonds on 13 November 2008, but that within four days by 17 November "the share price dropped by 35%, so he lost upwards of £10m".Griffiths said both Graff and his wife "sold their shares in Graff one month after the robbery".Leggatt said he was a shop manager and had no knowledge of Graff's share portfolio.Questioned later by Ian Bourne QC, representing Calderwood, over allegations it was an "inside job", Leggatt replied: "It seems rather one-sided for you to make these allegations which I find incredibly offensive, incredibly unfounded and totally without justification. It's totally unfair your learned friends are able to say this without any back-up whatsoever."Soloman Beyene, 25, Clinton Mogg, 42, Courtney Lawrence, 31, Gregory Jones, 30, Thomas Thomas, 45, David Joseph, 23, Benjamin McFarlane, 22, Calderwood and Kassaye all deny conspiracy to rob. Calderwood and Kassaye each deny possessing a handgun and a sawn-off shotgun. Kassaye denies kidnapping.The trial continues.
