James Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, has expressed her fury at the government's handling of the recall of Jon Venables, one of her son's killers, but has softened demands to know exactly why he has been put back in jail.Fergus, 42, said the news that Venables was suspected of reoffending had left her "all over the place" and called for those responsible for his supervision to be sacked."I do believe whoever's been protecting and looking after Venables since he's been released, I'm calling that they should be sacked," she told ITV's This Morning.She accused the government of treating the issue "like a football, kicking it one to another". "I am sick of them closing doors in my face," she said.Jack Straw, the justice minister, has announced that he will answer urgent questions in the House of Commons today at 3.30pm.In a significant softening of her demands to know the details of why Venables had been recalled, Fergus said she would not want to prejudice any possible court proceedings against the 27-year-old."I am prepared to wait a bit longer," she said. "Once it's all done and dusted, will I then get to know the full details of what they have done during the nine years [since their release]?"She said she wanted to be in the courtroom if Venables faced another trial.Her first television interview since the recall came a couple of hours after Straw, who has agreed to meet Fergus, once more defended the government's refusal to release more information about the alleged breach of licence by Venables.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "What I want to do is look at what has already been made public ... to look at that and then to make a judgment about if there's information – given that it's already out in the newspapers – we can confirm."Straw's comments followed a number of reports over the weekend that purported to reveal the reasons Venables was recalled and details of his life outside prison. The Sunday Mirror said he had been returned to prison in connection with child pornography offences. Other reports said Venables had been known to drink heavily and use drugs, and had revealed his true identity to others.Straw said he intended to give Fergus "as much information as possible" when he meets her and acknowledged that any information he divulged to her would subsequently become public.Last week, Straw said Venables had been jailed in relation to "extremely serious allegations" but it was not in the public interest to reveal the specific nature of the breach.The justice secretary said today that Venables had not been charged with any offence but was under investigation."The judgment I made, on very clear advice from others who were directly involved in the investigation, is that it [releasing more information] could be prejudicial," Straw said.He acknowledged public frustration but said that criticism of the government would have been "much more profound" had the chances of Venables going back to court been scuppered by the release of prejudicial details of his alleged offence.Straw rejected the idea that he could have denied inaccurate reports in the media, insisting that such actions would have merely led to more theories being put forward and would not have put an end to speculation.Venables and Robert Thompson, both then aged 10, lured two-year-old James away from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in February 1993, and battered him to death. Under the terms of their release, they must adhere to a series of strict conditions, including that they never make contact with each other or return to Liverpool.At the time of the trial, Venables was viewed as the more hopeful case for rehabilitation, because he was apparently more remorseful than his co-accused.
