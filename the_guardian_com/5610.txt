A fast-food worker who groomed and sexually abused 18 girls, some as young as 12, has been jailed for four years.Homayon Narouzzad, 34, from Whitefield, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Bolton crown court to 25 offences of sexual activity with a child between April 2010 and February this year.A further eight offences were ordered to lie on file and Narouzzad will remain on licence for eight years.Greater Manchester Police interviewed 37 teenage girls as part of the inquiry into his activities. The court heard he worked behind the counter of the Family Guy takeaway and lived in a flat above.Narouzzad befriended a 13-year-old and persuaded her to invite other schoolgirls there so he could carry out the abuse when he was working alone, the court heard.He paid the girls between £5 and £90, also bribing them with food and cigarettes in return for touching and kissing their feet while engaging in sexual activity or watching the girls do so.Some of the girls have been left psychologically scarred by the abuse, the court heard, with one saying she wanted to kill herself and another constantly washing herself because she felt "dirty".Narouzzad came to the UK 11 years ago seeking political asylum from Iran. He had no previous convictions and has since been granted leave to remain in the UK.Judge Maureen Roddy told him: "Each of them has suffered significant psychological harm to them that is far more difficult to treat and cure than physical scars. The impact on your victims is devastating."David Clarke, prosecuting, told the court Narouzzad was arrested in March after one girl told her mother about the abuse.A police search of the property revealed a "large number" of CDs and magazines, "relating to a sexual interest in feet", the prosecutor added. Officers traced the victims, with three aged 12, one 15-year-old and the remainder either 13 or 14.In a victim impact statement, a 13-year-old wrote: "Since this happened I feel down a lot and get very angry towards friends and family. Sometimes I wish I was dead."Iain Simkin, defending, said Narouzzad had not used force or coercion on the girls and there was no penetrative sex or touching "above the ankles".The court heard the defendant had blamed the victims and downplayed his role during questioning.Detective Inspector Jane Little, of Bury CID, said: "Narouzzad abused his position to prey on young and vulnerable girls."He reeled them in by offering them free food for friendship before progressing things further by offering cash for sexual favours."As in other similar cases, some of Narouzzad's victims did not recognise that they were being exploited and sometimes confused exploitation with genuine affection."
