With a name like his at an event like this, he could have been excused for keeping his head down. But David Blunkett decided to brave the stick of hundreds of police officers and being pursued by reporters and photographers.David Blunkett, the police constable, that is, whose namesake and first cousin is the home secretary, bete noire of the Police Federation. Both Blunketts were at the seaside town for its annual conference yesterday and took the opportunity - with a little help from Home Office spin doctors - to speak face to face for the first time in 40 years. The two Davids were friends when they were children - their fathers were brothers - but grew apart when the future cabinet minister needed to go to a special school for the blind. Clean-shaven Blunkett, now 52, stayed in Lincolnshire and became a police officer who has now served 28 years in the force, based in the traffic division. He watched his hirsute cousin rise through the political ranks. But neither man ever got in touch with the other to reminisce over their summer holidays in Skegness, where PC Blunkett's parents owned a fish and chip shop. The last time they saw each other, home secretary Blunkett still had partial sight. "I thought he was a really nice person," said the other David. "I was nine when I last saw him." The two men made contact last year when PC Blunkett's daughter, Emma, chanced on the then education secretary at Swindon station. He was campaigning for the general election. She was on her way home. "Emma said 'Hello David, I am Emma Blunkett, I think I am related to you'," said PC Blunkett. "They had a friendly conversation. Emma was about to get married and he sent her a wedding present. Yesterday PC Blunkett sidestepped questions about his cousin's performance as home secretary. He thought that the home secretary was "on the right tracks", though officers obviously "had not been pleased" with him.
