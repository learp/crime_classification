A wealthy aristocrat who stole £1.6m from a family charity intended to aid Bosnian orphans was given a two-year suspended sentence today.The Hon Jonathan Davies, 65, bought fine wines and gifts, as well as paying for school fees for one of his daughters, golf club membership, tax demands, credit cards and utility bills.But the bulk of the money – roughly £1m – was ploughed into a friend's project of developing a new spark plug.The old Etonian's betrayal came to light when a relative discovered the seven-figure chasm in the accounts, London's Southwark crown court heard. A detailed examination of documents and cheque books showed he had systematically treated the funds like a "bottomless piggy bank".The Dinam Charity, set up by Davies's philanthropist grandfather, the first Baron of Llandinam, is now in the process of being wound up after years providing help to the world's needy and other "worthy causes".The charity had donated cash to help small British charities, and fund healthcare, animal welfare projects and research into international conflict – including helping Bosnian orphans during the Balkans crisis in the 1990s.Former investment banker Davies pleaded guilty to 10 counts of theft. All were committed between 24 July 24 1999 and 14 June 14 2000, his last year as charity secretary.Sentencing Davies to a two year jail sentence, suspended for two years, Judge James Wadsworth QC told him: "You weren't subjected to anything approaching a proper audit, largely because of the family's confidence in you."It is the tragedy of this case that you were not sufficiently guided by your own honesty and decency."
