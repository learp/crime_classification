Conservative leader David Cameron has claimed that BBC Radio 1 encourages knife and gun crime by playing music that glorifies violence.Mr Cameron said the music Radio 1 plays on Saturday night - believed to be a reference to Tim Westwood's hip-hop show, which runs from 9pm-11pm - had contributed to the growing problem of knife and gun crime in the UK."I would say to Radio 1, do you realise that some of the stuff you play on Saturday nights encourages people to carry guns and knives?" he said last night in a speech to the British Society of Magazine Editors.The Tory leader said his remarks were an example of how he wants people to have "the courage to speak up when you see something that is wrong", despite the fact that "you will get a lots of bricks thrown at you" for voicing unpopular opinions.A spokesman for Radio 1 said the station took its responsibilities very seriously."We find it difficult to understand what he could be referring to," he said.Mr Cameron's comments came in response to a question from June Walton, the deputy editor of Good Housekeeping, about how the Conservatives would tackle knife crime in the wake of a series of stabbings, including the murders of 29-year-old policewoman Nisha Patel-Nasri and 15-year-old schoolboy Kiyan Prince.Speaking six months to the day after he was elected as Conservative leader, he also said media brands were more trusted by the public than politicians and had the ability to make more of a difference to people's lives.He said Jamie Oliver's school dinners campaign through his Channel 4 series was able to do in a matter of weeks what government ministers and inquiries had failed to do over a much longer period because "he [Oliver] is a trusted brand in a way politicians aren't"."Your brands," he told the assembled magazine editors, "are increasingly more trusted than a political brand."Mr Cameron was also asked by Sarah Miller, the editor of Condé Nast Traveller, for his views on the Office of Fair Trading's recent draft recommendation to overhaul radically the newspaper and magazine distribution system, which has been met with opposition from the industry.But he was forced to admit he did not know about the issue and asked Ms Miller to explain to him why she believed the OFT recommendation would favour supermarkets and put hundreds of small newsagents out of business."I will encourage Alan Duncan [ the shadow secretary for trade and industry] to looked into it," promised Mr Cameron. "We'll get Alan to talk to you and the industry and try and push things in the right direction."But Ms Miller is unlikely to be holding her breath: she said that last time Tony Blair had addressed the society she had asked him what he would do about the situation and he too had promised to look into it "but did nothing".And despite revealing that he was "uncomfortable" with some magazine content aimed at youngsters, Mr Cameron said he preferred "sensible debate", self-regulation and "leanings" rather than regulations, laws and bans, which he said was Labour's response to everything.He praised the work of the Teenage Magazine Arbitration Panel in helping improve standards.Mr Cameron's surprising attitude to buying British was also revealed during the evening.When asked by the editor of Car magazine, Jason Barlow, why he did not drive a British-made Jaguar, his lengthy answer about the merits of "green performance" cars included the admission that "I'm a great believer in buying the car that's right for you. I try to buy British when I can, but if it's not right then I don't."· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857· If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly "for publication".
