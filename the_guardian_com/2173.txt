An anniversary appeal for information on the murder of Stephen Lawrence has prompted two "very significant" phone calls, police say.The appeal was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme on Monday night, a week after the 20th anniversary of the racist attack in Eltham, south-east London.Officers are following up a number of phone calls received after the programme.Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll said they had many calls on Tuesday night, but two in particular were "very significant"."One could produce a potential eyewitness to the attack, and one gives very good background information about suspects already known," he said."In addition to that we have also had three phone calls about the green jumper or jacket and we will certainly be making inquiries around those bits of information to verify them."Lawrence, an 18-year-old aspiring architect, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Well Hall Road with a friend on the evening of 22 April 1993.

As such this investigation remains open and my team is committed to pursuing all viable lines of inquiry available to us. It is hoped this appeal will assist with our inquiries."We believe there were people in the area that night who may have seen something â€“ not the murder itself necessarily, but events or individuals leading up to the event."I am taking this opportunity to appeal directly to those people to come forward and speak to us. You may think you won't remember something from so long ago, but we would still implore you to come forward."Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8785 8310 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.
