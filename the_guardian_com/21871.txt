George Osborne's plans for a regulatory overhaul of the City are unravelling after the Treasury was deluged with concerns about his proposals to tackle insider dealing and monitor big companies.The chancellor has been forced to rethink his plan to hand powers to prosecute insider dealers to a new economic crime agency (ECA). He is also reversing a proposal to put the UK Listing Authority, which regulates companies and their communications with shareholders, into the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which oversees corporate governance.Mark Hoban, the City minister, was due to reveal tonight that the government had heeded concerns about handing the FRC new powers to deal with companies.The changes had all been proposed in a detailed consultation over Osborne's plans to break up the FSA and dismantle the system of regulation devised by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor.Osborne's main aim is to set up a prudential regulatory authority to oversee banks and "big picture" issues that could threaten financial stability. It would operate inside the Bank of England under the auspices of the current FSA chief executive, Hector Sants.Most of the remaining responsibilities of the FSA, to look after day-to-day issues affecting markets and consumers, are to be transferred into a Consumer Protection and Markets Agency. The head of the CPMA is yet to be named, although FSA director Margaret Cole is currently regarded as the favourite for the post.But a few other areas of FSA responsibility were to be handed to the ECA, along with those of the Serious Fraud Office and other white-collar crime agencies. However the Treasury has now told the FSA that the ECA will not be handed the powers to prosecute insider dealing, in a move that is regarded as sensible by the industry.If his plan had gone ahead the CPMA would have had civil powers to tackle insider dealing but criminal cases would have been dealt with by the ECA. Nik Kiri, partner at law firm Herbert Smith, said ensuring the same body had powers for both criminal and civil cases was "better from a market and FSA perspective".The FSA has recently launched successful criminal prosecutions for insider dealing and has more cases under way.The Treasury insisted that it was still determined to create a new body for white-collar crime. It said: "After much consideration we have decided that for the moment the FSA's powers of prosecution will lie with the new CPMA rather than the new economic crime agency.""The government recognises the importance to the City of London of a strong markets division being established within the CPMA and giving it these powers will make it a stronger and more credible regulator. The government remains committed to the creation of a strong and powerful new ECA to tackle serious economic crime coherently and effectively."The CPMA also looks likely to get a boost by taking on the UK Listing Authority, which was to have been combined with the FRC.Only two months ago business minister Edward Davey urged shareholders at a conference  to back the merger of the listing authority and the FRC. Davey said: "Creating a new companies regulator – perhaps better described as a corporate governance and listing authority – could provide real advantages in bringing together in one place those people considering different aspects of corporate governance."
