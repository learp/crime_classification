A Northern Ireland dentist already charged with a double murder that police attributed to a suicide pact is to be questioned about the death of a young woman at a caravan park on the north Antrim coast.Northern Ireland police are investigating whether there was any connection between dentist Colin Howell and Alexandra Hickman-Smith.The 27-year-old was found dead at her caravan at Sea Road in Castlerock in November. Her mother raised the alarm after she failed to return home to Carrickfergus from a weekend trip to the County Derry coastal resort. Her family was told at the time that she had died from diabetes.Howell, 50, was charged in January with the 1991 murders of his wife, Lesley, and RUC scenes-of-crime officer Trevor Buchanan, whose wife, Hazel Stewart, was Howell's lover. She is also charged with the two murders â€“ the victims were found dead in a car filled with exhaust fumes. She denies all charges.The dentist was charged with the double murder after he voluntarily attended a police station.He has also been questioned about the death of Lesley's father, Henry Clarke, who died five days before his daughter, apparently from a heart attack or some form of seizure.Police are also looking into allegations that Howell may have sexually molested a number of female patients while they were under anaesthetic in his dental practice.Asked about inquiries into two further deaths, a spokesman for the Northern Ireland police service said: "The police investigation in this case is focused on the murders of Trevor Buchanan and Lesley Howell. But a number of lines of inquiry are being conducted into a range of other issues and events.""Police have a duty to ensure that, in the interests of justice and completeness, every potential line of enquiry is examined."Howell, of Sea Road, Castlerock, has also been charged with indecent assault and administering an overpowering drug with intent to commit indecent assault on dates between March 1998 and December 2008.Last month, about 200 letters were sent to Howell's former patients by police seeking help with the investigation.
