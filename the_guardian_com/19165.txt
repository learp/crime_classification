A four-month-old baby boy has died from suspected abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner.Police said the baby, who has not been named, was admitted to Great Ormond Street hospital in London last Thursday but died at about 3.30am on Saturday morning.The baby's 17-year-old mother, from Islington, and her partner, 19, were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm after hospital staff called the police.The pair have been bailed to return to a central London police station in August pending further enquiries.The baby has not yet been formally identified. A postmortem examination is yet to take place. Relatives have been informed.Islington council has yet to say whether the child was known to social services, but his mother was on a support programme for vulnerable families run by NHS Islington primary care trust.A statement by the council said: "We are supporting the Metropolitan police with their investigation. Agencies including the council are currently making an assessment of whether a serious case review should be carried out."That decision will be made by the local safeguarding board."The board had 28 days from the date of the death to decide whether a serious case review was needed, the council said.Serious case reviews are carried out when a child dies following suspected abuse or neglect.The arrests come almost two years after 17-month-old Baby Peter died at the hands of his mother, her boyfriend and their lodger while on the at-risk register of Haringey council in north London. He had suffered 50 injuries despite receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over the last eight months of his life.
