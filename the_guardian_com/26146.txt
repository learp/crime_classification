A mother-of-three is to face a crown court jury over claims she threw an apple core out of her car window.Kate Badger, 26, denies the charge and has accused city councillors of wasting taxpayers' money.Wolverhampton city council officials sent her a £60 fine for the offence, allegedly committed on March 19 last year.Badger branded the move "ridiculous" and has asked a crown court jury to decide her fate. The case could cost taxpayers up to £5,000.Speaking after her first court appearance, Badger said: "I refused to pay the £60 fine because I didn't throw the apple core."I think it's a ridiculous charge because apples are biodegradable and it's not like we are talking about a huge bag of rubbish."Badger, from Tettenhall, Wolverhampton, appeared at Wolverhampton magistrates court on Tuesday. She is accused of "knowingly causing the deposit of controlled waste, namely an apple core, on land which did not have a waste management licence".The promotions worker denies tossing the fruit from the window of her Volkswagen Golf. She also denies a charge of failing to provide information about who did throw the apple. She claims it was a man she has since lost touch with.With the case at crown court, Badger could face a much stiffer sentence, including a fine of up to £20,000 or six months in prison. She has been granted unconditional bail by magistrates until the February 6 hearing.Badger said: "I'm being treated like a criminal. The council has taken it to court and they have been to photograph my car."Wolverhampton council spokesman Tim Clark said: "Authorised officers of the council can issue £60 fixed-penalty notices to anyone seen dropping litter."A fixed-penalty notice is issued in preference to a court summons for littering offences as there is no criminal record recorded if the fine is paid, and the penalty is less than that of conviction for littering."
