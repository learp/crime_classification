Police were yesterday questioning a man in connection with the death of a Manchester gangster whose claim to be behind 27 killings was due to be broadcast on television tonight.Desmond "Dessie" Noonan, who was fatally stabbed on Saturday morning and dumped in Chorlton, Manchester, had been filmed as part of a documentary on British gangland culture by the undercover reporter Donal MacIntyre. Noonan, 46, worked with Dominic, one of his seven brothers and head of the crime family based in Cheetham Hill, north Manchester. In the documentary, Gangster, for Channel 5, Desmond Noonan suggested he was untouchable, saying: "We have a lot of strong loyal people around us. If they think they can take one of us out, they are silly people." He also boasted of having "more guns than the police". Noonan was charged with the murder of a rival gangster in 1991, but acquitted after a retrial. In 1995, he was jailed for 33 months for assault. He also had convictions for intimidating witnesses. In a statement, MacIntyre denied that his documentary glamorised the family. A large turnout is expected at Noonan's funeral. When his brother Damien, a former nightclub bouncer, died in a motorcycle accident in 2003, hundreds of people lined the streets for the horse-drawn cortege. Police are still appealing for information about the death. The Noonan family believe that Desmond was stabbed while drunk by a man he had "a problem with" in the past. Dominic Noonan told the Guardian: "In the film, Dessie said that if you take out a Noonan, fireworks will go off. And they will."
