Hoax callers who try to disrupt Olympic events in Scotland with a bomb scare could face up to seven years in jail, prosecutors have warned.A "tough prosecution stance" will be taken against anyone making hoax bomb or fire calls during the Games, according to the lord advocate, Frank Mulholland."The eyes of the world are on Great Britain and Scotland will be a showcase for football competitions in Glasgow," he said."Through our action I hope the prosecution service will help to deliver a safe and enjoyable Olympic Games."The Crown Office said those who made hoax calls at any time put the lives of others at risk by diverting emergency services from genuine incidents. They also waste public resources and can create fear and cause disruption.Prosecutors fear the disruption could be more acute during public events such as the forthcoming Olympics football matches in Glasgow.Hoax callers could face up to three months' imprisonment for fire-related offences and seven years for bomb hoax offences.Detective Chief Superintendent John Cuddihy, head of serious and organised crime and counter-terrorism at Strathclyde police, said: "Unfortunately, there is a very small number of people who will try to spoil this event for everyone by making a hoax bomb call."Let me be clear: anyone who makes a hoax call will be found and will be arrested. Taking officers away from genuine incidents and wasting their time will not be tolerated."However, anyone who has a genuine suspicion about a person, a package or anything else must not be dissuaded from contacting police immediately."
