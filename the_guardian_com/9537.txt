The explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes momentarily fell asleep at the wheel of his car and crashed into a vehicle on the opposite side of the road, a court heard today.He was left dazed and bloodied by the head-on collision in Stockport, Greater Manchester, but the other motorist was in intensive care for a month with numerous injuries.The polar explorer had competed in the 42-mile High Peak Marathon in Derbyshire on the day of the incident, in March.Appearing at Stockport magistrates court, Fiennes, 66, pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.He was fined Â£1,000 and received four penalty points on his licence.The oldest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest was returning from the endurance run in his Jaguar X-type when the crash happened, on the A6 Buxton Road in Heaviley.His vehicle swerved on to the opposite carriageway and hit a Nissan Micra driven by Luigi Castaldo, who was travelling with his 10-year-old son.The force of the collision shunted the Micra backwards into another car. It then flipped into the air and landed on its roof, the court heard.Castaldo, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was flung out of the driver's side window and was trapped between the roof and the road surface; his son, who was wearing a seatbelt, was uninjured.Fiennes's Jaguar continued forward for several yards and hit the front of another car on the opposite side of the road.Prosecutor Eddie Coyle said the explorer had been "greatly concerned" for the welfare of Castaldo and had rushed to him, with others, in an attempt to free him.Castaldo went on to spend a month in intensive care, where he was artificially ventilated for 17 days.He suffered bruising to the head, a broken collarbone, a fractured right wrist, four broken ribs and damage to his femur. Both his lungs were deflated and his left kneecap was shattered.Representing himself in court, Fiennes said: "I plead guilty. I hugely regret the incident to Luigi and his family."He told the bench he had never before lost his concentration in this way while driving. "I travel 40,000 to 45,000 miles a year and it has not happened," he said.He said he had made sure he was rested for the High Peak Marathon, with extra sleep beforehand and a diet involving plenty of pasta to keep up his energy levels."There is no reason why I should have [fallen asleep] when this strange thing happened," he said. "I assumed that must have been the case."Outside the court, he repeated his apologies as he told reporters: "I am really, really sorry for what happened to Luigi and his family."Teams of four compete in the High Peak Marathon, testing their fitness and endurance and navigational skills through the night as they tackle terrain that is mostly made up of pathless peat bog.Sir Ranulph's team of veterans, called the Polar Explorers, won the charity race, the court heard.The adventurer was the first man to visit the north and south poles on foot, and the first to cross Antarctica on foot.Last May, at the age of 65, he climbed to the top of Everest, the world's highest peak, to raise money for the charity Marie Curie Cancer Care.Sir Ranulph had a double heart bypass in 2003 and suffered a heart attack two years later as he came close to the summit of Everest.He also ran seven marathons on seven continents in seven days in 2003, and climbed the treacherous north face of the Eiger in 2007.
