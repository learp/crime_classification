The hierarchy of the states of Jersey appears to misunderstand the reasons for international concern about the apparent events at Haut de la Garenne (House of Horrors, August 2).The fact that it has allegedly been the scene of horrendous child abuse is something it shares with several communities in the UK and beyond, and for which it will receive empathy. However, the wish of senior figures in the government to bury the issue to avoid perceived international denigration or losing face is appalling. The criminal investigation needs full political and community cooperation, and subsequently a full, public and open inquiry needs to look at how this happened and guard against it being repeated.
