Hundreds of thousands of criminals could have records of their offences deleted from the police database. The home secretary, Alan Johnson, has ordered a review of which criminal records are held on the police national computer (PNC) and for how long. He has ruled out removing serious violent and sexual offenders. But other offenders could have their records removed if holding them is considered disproportionate to the offence committed. The review will propose guidelines on what records should be held for how long and for what reasons. Records now remain on the PNC for up to 100 years.
