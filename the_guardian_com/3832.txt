The prime minister, Tony Blair, has announced a new crackdown on yob culture in the run up to a possible June general election, with culprits forced to clean up after themselves in their local communities.In a speech today Mr Blair singled out "liveability" as a key factor undermining pride in Britain's cities, and promised to make young vandals repair the damage they cause.And he held out the "carrot" of music and clothes vouchers for reformed young offenders who take party in community renewal work.However, the "community payback" scheme, which comes backed with government money and a partnership with the private sector, was immediately attacked both by local authorities and the Conservative party, who dubbed it another of the prime minister's "eye catching" initiatives - a reference to the infamous leaked memo from the PM last summer.Speaking to community leaders in Croydon, south London, the PM said: "Young offenders take something out of society through their offending. This scheme will allow them to put something back."These issues affect the whole country. Streets that are dirty and threatening deter people from going out. They signal that the community has lost interest. As a result, anti-social behaviour and more serious criminality may take root." Mr Blair said that he wanted to build on the youth inclusion programmes already run by the youth justice board on 70 high crime estates, which provide supervised leisure activities and personal development programmes for youngsters most at risk of offending. A privately sponsored pilot scheme is being set up by the board in London, offering rewards to youngsters - such as vouchers for clothes, music, travel or computer equipment - if they take part in community renewal work. At the same time the new community payback scheme will expand the system of reparation orders in England and Wales, so that when the victim does not ask for direct reparation, offenders can be ordered to work for the community removing graffiti, repairing vandalism and clearing up litter. Other measures announced by Mr Blair in his speech included:  A tripling of funding, to £50m, for the neighbourhood wardens programme, building on existing pilot projects designed to clamp down on nuisance behaviour  A new £30m challenge fund to create more "Home zones" - areas where priority is given to walking and cycling over traffic  Reducing the time it takes local authorities to remove abandoned cars. Pilot schemes will be set up in London to study the scope for local authorities to wheelclamp abandoned vehicles and remove them within 24 hours  Giving local authorities the revenues from specific fines and penalties, for example litter, dog fouling, and parking fines, for additional spending on local environmental and quality of life improvements. Shadow secretary of state for the environment, Archie Norman, condemned the initiative as an election gimmick, saying: "Tony Blair has had four years to address the plight of inner cities."In almost all of these areas council tax has gone up by nearly a third but the quality of life in inner cities has declined. Now in the run up to the election he produces a torrent of superficial initiatives."Local government leaders also appeared unimpressed by Mr Blair's plans, arguing that a much more extensive reform of local government financing was needed. Sir Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: "We are calling on the government to deliver a finance system to local authorities that is fair, accountable, and makes a real connection between cash raised - and spent - locally."Ask Aristotle Ask Aristotle about Tony Blair Ask Aristotle about Archie NormanSpecial report Neighbourhood renewal strategy Useful link Downing Street
