A company boss was jailed for four years today after trying to buy his second wife happiness with more than £500,000 plundered from global accountancy company KPMG.Andrew Wetherall said that when his wife's previous partner tried to reduce maintenance payments he was worried her lifestyle would suffer, Southwark crown court in south London heard.Desperate to avoid another round of marital tension and possibly a divorce, the director turned to crime to bolster his six-figure salary.The court was told that the 49-year-old, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, spent years ravaging the expenses system to shower his wife with expensive watches, top-of-the range cars and five-star holidays.He billed for imaginary flights worth nearly £500,000, almost half of which were backed by fake documents. He also altered bills, created false invoices, submitted multiple claims for legitimate expenses, and dressed up luxury holidays with his wife as business trips.But last year a colleague became suspicious about his air travel claims and started asking questions.Wetherall, who was suspended in February last year, initially tried to explain his dishonesty away by claiming he had made a simple mistake. He even offered to repay £18,000, but an investigation into his systematic betrayal of trust was launched and the company found itself £545,620 out of pocket.During a subsequent disciplinary hearing Wetherall confessed his crimes and told bosses at the top accountancy company he would repay £305,000. More money followed until he had handed back £337,228.60p, blaming the £200,000 shortfall on his lifestyle."He attributed this to legal costs from his divorce from his first wife, the purchase of a motor vehicle for himself for £60,000 and the part-payment of a motor vehicle for his current wife for £14,000," said Samantha Hatt, prosecuting.Today, the court heard he had now repaid all the cash he stole.The father-of-two, who pleaded guilty to false accounting and fraud, bowed his head as Judge Gregory Stone told him: "This is a very serious offence and I have no alternative but to sentence you to prison. The gravity of this case focuses on the breach of trust that was involved and the very large sums of money of which you defrauded your employers ‑ well over half a million pounds."Clearly you have damaged a glittering career and you have also damaged the thing that you were trying to protect ‑ your lifestyle." He continued: "This was not a case of conventional greed, but it was a case of a man who threw away his principles and took a weak and self-indulgent approach to financial and person problems. It was, if you like, a spineless approach to these problems."The judge said that in Wetherall's favour were his guilty pleas and the fact that he had repaid KPMG every penny he had stolen. "It is those mitigating factors that enable me to keep your sentence towards the lower end. You will go to prison for four years."
