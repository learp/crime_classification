A man posing as a postman stole Lowry paintings worth up to Â£1.7m from a leading collector of his work during an early morning robbery at his home, a court heard today.Manchester crown court heard how the "carefully planned and executed robbery" took place at the home of Ivan Aird in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire, in May 2007. Among the stolen items were The Viaduct and The Tanker Entering the Tyne.Casey Miller, 23, from Denton, Manchester, denies robbery.Michael Leeming, prosecuting, told the jury: "LS Lowry is an artist who will be familiar to you and his works are highly valuable and highly collectible. He is famous for capturing an era with individuals and landscapes that are largely lost to us."He said Aird was regarded as "the leading specialist in the art world" dealing in Lowry's works."He has developed a particular specialism for the works of LS Lowry, who incidentally was a friend of his parents. Aird knew him, it would appear, when he was a child," Leeming added.Although Aird's company, Grove Fine Art, advertised on the internet, he did not publicise his home address as his home was effectively a gallery.But on the morning of 3 May 2007, Aird's wife Louise was feeding her two-year-old daughter when the doorbell rang. She looked outside and saw a man dressed as a postman in an orange fluorescent jacket and took her baby downstairs with her.The man forced his way into the house at knifepoint, pushing her and her daughter on to the floor, while threatening to kill her. Her husband, who was in bed, heard her screams and was tied up by the robber. The court heard the robber was shouting: "Get down or I will kill you," at Mrs Aird, who described him as "quite aggressive and demanding".She was able to get a good look at his face and positively identified the defendant, Miller, in a video identity parade.When questioned by detectives, Miller reportedly said he "didn't know LS Lowry's works from Adam".The trial continues.
