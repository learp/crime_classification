David Scott, the chief probation officer who resigned over the murder of two French students by a convicted violent criminal and his accomplice, has launched a scathing attack on the justice secretary, Jack Straw.Writing exclusively for Guardian Society, Scott says when it comes to the difficulties of dealing with high-risk offenders released from prison, "ministerial policy has been to keep quiet wherever possible, and to resort to damage limitation when things go wrong".He says Straw's claim that the Dano Sonnex case highlights probation's failure to use its resources effectively is "symptomatic of an inherent failure to understand the probation workplace, where staff undertake skilled and often extremely difficult work daily".It also demonstrates that they have to beware "friendly fire" from those who "seek to mask a very real lack of resources with charges of ineptitude".Scott says the attitude of ministers to constant, corrosive, workload pressures in probation – the inexperienced officer in the French students case was responsible for 127 offenders – amounts to considerable political apathy and buck-passing."If there is crisis of numbers in the prison system, 10 Downing Street will be involved directly. People know when a prison is full. The contrast with probation has been stark. There is no way of determining when capacity has been reached. Instead, the workload simply increases," he said."A previous chief inspector of probation described the failure to tackle the workload pressures in the system as being like building a sandcastle with your back to the rising tide."Straw escaped serious personal criticism on Monday when he made a Commons statement detailing the failings in the case, which meant that Dano Sonnex was free to kill the two biochemistry students when he should and could have been locked up.Although Straw said he took "full responsibility" for the failures across the criminal justice system, he insisted these were not the result of a lack of resources: "Probation funding has increased by 70% in real terms since 1997. London probation underspent its £154m budget by £3.5m last year. Rather, this was a failure to use resources effectively," he claimed.But in his Guardian article, Scott says that for "Jack Straw, the justice secretary, to dismiss lack of resources as a factor in the Sonnex case and to deny that there is any such lack in the service as a whole is quite simply wrong".He says the £3.5m underspend in London and £17m nationally cited by Straw is the direct result of a decision by the National Offender Management Service in October 2008 to encourage all probation boards to maximise underspends: "Financial planning within the ministry has been so abject that it has been impossible to predict what level of expenditure probation areas could expect. Therefore money had to be kept back so that it could be carried over into the following year's budget to meet exigencies, including potential redundancies."He says that "this haphazard approach to financial affairs" is a symptom of the Cinderella or subordinate status assigned to probation by the government and Noms, an organisation whose top three tiers are dominated by Prison Service people.He says staff with senior private sector experience view the probation service's workload pressures, poor accommodation and failing information systems with dismay and disbelief.Scott adds that when he was appointed four years ago by the then home secretary, Charles Clarke, Clarke agreed that the most pressing need was to recruit more high-calibre probation officers whose judgment, authority, and initiative would be vital to the service's future. Four years later, in the wake of the Sonnex case, 140 extra probation officers are now being recruited in London, but Scott adds that most other probation areas are in the process of cutting jobs to meet stringent cuts in their budgets.Scott, a chief probation officer with more than 30 years' experience, resigned when he was told in February this year he faced suspension and a professional capability review as a result of the Sonnex case. A police sergeant has faced a disciplinary hearing and a probation officer has been sent for retraining, but no other criminal justice staff have lost their jobs over the case.Society cover story: Arrested development
