The Justice secretary Jack Straw has agreed to meet the mother of James Bulger after one of the toddler's killers was returned to custody. Denise Fergus wrote to Straw after hearing that Jon Venables, one of the two youths convicted of murdering the two-year-old in Merseyside in 1993, was back in custody after breaching the terms of his release.Fergus has demanded to know why details of Venables' return to jail have not been released to the family and the public. The Ministry of Justice would not confirm if Straw would be willing to discuss the issue or whether the meeting is simply an attempt to reassure Fergus.Venables and Robert Thompson were both held in secure homes for eight years before being released in 2001 under strict conditions, including never to return to Merseyside or to see each other again, and were both given new identities.Although details of how Venables, now 27, breached the terms of his licence have not been released, there have been reports that since his release he has visited Liverpool. It remains unclear whether he has committed a further crime.The secrecy surrounding his custody has increasingly angered Bulger's family. "Is this my son's justice?" Fergus wrote in a Twitter post. A spokesman for her said: "She believes she and the public have a right to know what Venables has done and what is to be done with him now he is an adult offender."Bulger's father, Ralph, called it a disgrace that details were not being released.Straw has insisted that it is not in the public interest to release details of Venables' imprisonment.
