Michael Barrymore has never faced charges over Stuart Lubbock's death, but the discovery of the 31-year-old's lifeless body in his swimming pool nonetheless dealt the entertainer's career a blow from which it would never fully recover.After a spell in New Zealand he returned to the UK in 2006 to attempt a comeback by joining the Celebrity Big Brother house. His most high-profile recent engagement was playing Spike Milligan at the Edinburgh Fringe, and this month he was reported to be flat-hunting in London.Barrymore, a former Butlins Red Coat, scored his big break in 1975 when he won the TV talent show New Faces, and with it a six-month West End contract. By the early 1980s he was one of the best-known faces on the small screen, with shows such as Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People attracting up to 13 million viewers and earning Barrymore a £2m-a-year deal.After an open verdict was recorded at the Lubbock inquest in 2002, during which Barrymore described himself as an alcoholic, the BBC dropped a reputed £500,000 deal for his memoirs and ITV said it would not renew his contract. He headed off to live in New Zealand, from where he filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and kept a relatively low profile.On Celebrity Big Brother, he was moved to tears by the reception he received, and proved popular enough with viewers to finish as runner-up. His portrayal of Milligan in Edinburgh received largely favourable reviews. But protesting outside was Lubbock's father, Terry.
