An al-Qaida supergrass told American authorities before the London bombings in 2005 about a weapons training camp in Pakistan attended by the July 7 ringleader Mohammed Siddique Khan, a court heard yesterday.Mohammed Junaid Babar, who was arrested in the US in spring 2004, knew Khan by the pseudonym Ibrahim when he reported his trip, but then recognised him in a newspaper photograph after the July 2005 attacks.Kingston crown court heard yesterday that Mohammed Shakil, one of three men standing trial accused of helping the July 7 bombers plan their attacks, also joined a group of five British Muslims who trained at the camp in the Malakand region.Giving evidence via videolink from New York where he is awaiting sentence, Babar described how in July 2003 Khan and Shakil, using the name Zubair, spent several days at the camp, which was to prepare people to fight jihad in Afghanistan.The men had access to three to five AK47 rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade and a light machine gun, the court heard.Babar made a video recording to be used in a fundraising promotional tape in the UK to show training for jihad in Afghanistan was continuing. The camp, run from two tents, also included prayers, talks about jihad, and "very hard" physical conditioning training.Babar said that when he saw a picture of Khan after July 7 2005: "I told them [the American authorities] that was the person that was Ibrahim. I had mentioned Ibrahim before July 2005."Babar described how Khan and Shakil made the eight-hour journey from Islamabad to Malakand with him via cab, van and pick-up truck. They had come to Pakistan to find out whether foreigners were welcome to fight jihad in Afghanistan, he said, but were persuaded to join the camp.Shakil, 31, and Sadeer Saleem, 27, both from Beeston, Leeds, and Waheed Ali, 24, from Tower Hamlets, east London, deny conspiring with the July 7 bombers to cause explosions between November 17 2004 and July 8 2005. They are accused of carrying out a two-day reconnaissance mission in London in December 2004 to help the four men who killed 52 people on the capital's transport system.The trial continues.
