A man is expected to appear in court today charged with the murder of 37-year-old Leah Questin, a care worker whose body was found in a suitcase dumped near Rochester in Kent last week, Scotland Yard said last night. Clinton Bailey, 35, of Brockley, south-east London, will appear at Hendon magistrates court. Ms Questin's remains were discovered on 24 September. She had been reported missing by a friend a week earlier, after last being seen at her home in Cricklewood, north London. The suitcase containing her body was discovered by a dog walker at a remote site known as the Old Pond.
