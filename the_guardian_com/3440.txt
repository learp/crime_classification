Police were yesterday investigating the death of a wealthy businessman after a "horrific and despicable" attack in an affluent suburb of Leeds.Three or four men set upon John Luper, 57, as he walked his dog in Alwoodley and some or all of them then broke into his home. They tied up three women, including two thought to be Mr Luper's wife and daughter. Police said the women were not hurt in the incident. Detectives have confirmed that the death was being treated as suspicious and that the motive was probably robbery. The officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Superintendent Bill Shackleton, said Mr Luper was attacked late on Monday outside his neighbour's house and dragged back to his detached Â£800,000 home. The intruders threatened the women and then searched the house before making their escape. It is not yet known if anything was taken. The women managed to break free and raise the alarm. They found Mr Luper collapsed in a room close to the kitchen. Paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The house was sealed off yesterday as forensic teams examined the scene. One local resident, who did not wish to be named, said: "It's absolutely unbelievable. This is such a nice place. You don't expect anything like this to happen. It's such a terrible shock." Alwoodley is part of the northern fringe of Leeds and is home to some of the city's richest residents. Det Supt Shackleton said the family had been through "a very dreadful ordeal". He added: "The actions of the intruders are horrific and despicable. It was a dreadful attack." He confirmed there were three occupants other than Mr Luper in the house but said they did not suffer serious injury. Mr Luper was a director of a clothing firm and a property leasing company. He was also a member and former director of the exclusive Moor Allerton golf club in Leeds.
