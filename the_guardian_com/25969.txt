Once a familiar feature of the streetscape, they won a place in the heart of science fiction fans as Dr Who's time machine, the Tardis. More than 30 years after new technology made them obsolete police boxes could be about to make a comeback as part of a drive to reduce fear of crime.The Association of Chief Police Officers said yesterday that a modernised version, with a phone linked to a police station, could be one way to increase public confidence. Inspector Ian Kelly, of Northamptonshire police, said: "It would be a modern and very visible way for a member of the public to get in touch with a police officer." In the 1950s blue police boxes, with a flashing light that could alert any passing officer to call in, were a common sight. Some had kettles and heaters, making them a stop-off point for beat bobbies. Most could also be used by people to contact police in an emergency, a beacon for victims of crime and lost tourists. But radios and police cars made the boxes redundant by the 1970s. In 1996 a replica box with an intercom link to a nearby station was opened in Earls Court in west London, and proved popular. Thanks to Dr Who police boxes have also become icons of a bygone age. Last year two in Edinburgh were granted listed status.
