Women and children who it is suspected have been trafficked into the UK should no longer be treated as criminals, according to new guidance to prosecutors issued by the Crown Prosecution Service.The revised policy follows criticism from anti-trafficking campaigners who said victims were being wrongly prosecuted by UK law enforcers.The guidance brings Britain into line with an EU directive which says that where victims of trafficking have been compelled to commit crimes, member states must not prosecute them. The CPS has lowered the threshold required to satisfy prosecutors that an individual suspected of a crime may have been trafficked.The advice now is that cases should be dropped where there is a suspicion that a child engaged in criminal activity has been trafficked. Additionally, prosecutors will no longer need evidence to show how children were trafficked before treating them as victims rather than criminals.The CPS wants to encourage more victims to speak out about their traffickers, in the hope of boosting conviction rates, said Pam Bowen, CPS policy adviser on trafficking. Between 2004 and 2009, just 48 people were convicted of trafficking offences in England and Wales."We are keen to drive up victimless prosecutions," said Bowen. "We want women to provide intelligence as well as go to court because we realise going to court is too much for some of them, or they are fearful of what the traffickers will do to them or their families."The US state department recently complained that the British government was not doing enough to address trafficking for domestic servitude in foreign diplomatic missions in London. There have been 19 recent cases of alleged trafficking of domestic workers by diplomats. These were reported to the government's anti-trafficking agency by the charity Kalayaan.But one leading campaigner for the rights of victims suggested the new advice for prosecutors did not go far enough."For a long time Britain has criminalised victims of trafficking and this continues to be the case particularly [with] people trafficked to work in cannabis farms," said Chris Beddoe, director of ECPAT UK, a group campaigning against child abuse and trafficking. "These new guidelines include some distinct improvements but they don't place any mandatory responsibility to safeguard children â€¦ it remains dependent on somebody bringing a suspect's possible status as a victim of trafficking to the attention of the prosecutor. We think the CPS should take a more pro-active approach than that."The CPS said it had told prosecutors to listen to the views of charities and NGOs, who work directly with suspected victims, rather than just the police.The number of prosecutions for trafficking for sexual exploitation alone are about 100 a year. Operation Golf, a police operation aimed at a Romanian criminal gang suspected of trafficking 181 children into the UK for begging and theft, has led to 85 convictions in British courts, but only four were for trafficking offences.Cathy Zimmerman, co-author of World Health Organisation recommendations on interviewing trafficked women, did a study which showed that 57% of women had symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder in the 14 days after being released from their situation.Vietnam is, at the moment, the country providing the largest number of children trafficked into Britain, while Nigeria is the biggest source for young women and girls led into domestic servitude and the sex trade, the CPS said.
