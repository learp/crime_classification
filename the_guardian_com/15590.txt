An investigation has been launched after a man was shot and killed by police on a quiet road in Kent yesterday. Armed officers were called to Tumblefield Road in Stansted, near Sevenoaks, just before 8am after reports that a man had been seen brandishing a gun.'At this time there are no other reports of any other people injured, and no one else was involved,' a spokeswoman for Kent police said.Last night the road was closed to allow forensic officers to examine the scene. Police sources said that early indications were that the incident was not robbery-related. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is now investigating the shooting, a standard practice following police-related fatalities.Locals described Stansted as a village of about 200 residents set in a rural area where it is common for people to hunt rabbits and pheasants.It is the second fatal police shooting in the Sevenoaks area this year. In June, 37-year-old Ann Sanderson was shot and killed by police in a car park in the town centre following 999 calls claiming that a woman was waving a gun around. The IPCC is continuing to investigate her death.
