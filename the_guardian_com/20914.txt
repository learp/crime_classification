Executives at two UK security companies have been charged with trying to bribe the defence minister of an African country following an elaborate FBI sting operation.David Painter, 56, and Lee Wares, 43, chairman and director of a British firm that sells armoured vehicles, were arrested on Monday, the US justice department said.Pankesh Patel, 43, the managing director of a UK company that is a sales agent for security products, was also taken into custody. The firms were not named.The men were among 22 people arrested in Las Vegas after the operation, during which they allegedly tried to bribe the defence minister of an African country.It is claimed they offered to pay a 20% "commission" as a bribe to win part of a $15m (£9.1m) deal to equip an African country's presidential guard. But a sales agent who they believed represented the defence minister was in fact an undercover FBI agent. No actual defence ­minister was involved.During the two-and-a-half year ­investigation, which involved 250 FBI agents, it is claimed defendants sought to obtain contracts for the sale of a range of products including grenade and teargas launchers, pistols, ammunition and explosive detection kits.Raids were carried out across the US, and by City of London police in seven parts of the UK, which they declined to name. All those arrested had been attending the 2010 Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show and Conference in Las Vegas.Assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer said: "The fight to erase foreign bribery from the corporate playbook will not be won overnight, but these actions are a turning point."Those arrested face charges under laws governing payments to foreign officials, and are also accused of corruption. These offences would involve a maximum prison sentence of five years. It is alleged they were involved in money laundering, which would carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years.All the accused are executives or employees of companies in the "military and law enforcement products industry", the Department of Justice said.
