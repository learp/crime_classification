Members of a gang that conned a 94-year-old woman out of almost £70,000 for building work worth just £250 were jailed today.The woman was one of 11 elderly victims swindled out of £200,000 for building work by David Evans, his sons and two accomplices. Two other victims were each charged £40,000 for work that should have cost just a few hundred pounds.Over five years the gang targeted vulnerable elderly people in Gloucestershire and convinced them that their homes needed maintenance work.The victims - aged between 81 and 94 - were often "confused" and were persuaded to hand over vast cheques for the "shoddy and vastly overpriced" work, Bristol crown court heard.Evans, 57, sons Buddy, 22, and Shannon, 21, and their friends Patrick Maughan, 21, and Stephen Maloney, 20, all lived on caravan parks near Gloucester. They admitted conspiracy to defraud between February 2003 and October 2008.David Evans was jailed for six years and four months, while Buddy Evans was jailed for five years and six months. Shannon Evans was imprisoned for three years and seven months and Maughan for two years and six months. Maloney was sentenced to 13 months in a young offender institution.The 94-year-old woman, from Cheltenham, handed over £68,860 for work that a surveyor later costed at just £250.Another victim, an 88-year-old widow from Gloucestershire who has Alzheimer's disease, paid £39,700 for a job costed at £780.An 88-year-old woman from Newent, Gloucestershire, spent £14,000, including £10,000 from her sister's will, for roof repairs that should have cost £1,200. The gang also charged an 83-year-old £39,100 for guttering work.Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, said: "These defendants were involved in a lengthy and determined conspiracy to identify elderly, vulnerable and trusting individuals with large savings."They were targeted and persuaded to part with large sums of money for work done badly or not done at all. They returned to their victims to extract money over and over and over again. People in a confused state were preyed upon ruthlessly – it was both cruel and callous."A proceeds of crime hearing will be held next month to decide how much money the gang will have to pay back.
