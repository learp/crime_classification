A jury is considering its verdict at the inquest of fugitive gunman Raoul Moat. Newcastle coroner David Mitford said they must return a verdict of either suicide or an open verdict.And he told them they must consider five questions linked to whether police should have used unauthorised Taser weapons on the night of his death in July 2010.The 37-year-old former bouncer shot himself in the head in Rothbury, Northumberland, after being hit by a shotgun Taser round fired by marksmen who believed he was preparing to kill himself. He was pronounced dead later in hospital.Moat had been on the run for a week before the six-hour standoff with officers in which he died.He shot himself after he was twice Tasered by police. Officers used an untested Xrep X12 Taser that had not been approved by the Home Office.The inquest at Newcastle crown court has heard the intention was to incapacitate him, allowing officers to make an arrest, but that in all likelihood there was little or no electrical discharge needed to achieve that.Moat went on the run after shooting his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, 22, the mother of his child.He also killed her new boyfriend Chris Brown, 29, and then blinded PC David Rathband after declaring war on police.Summing up on Tuesday, the coroner said the jury would have to be "satisfied so you are sure" before returning a verdict of suicide, whereas an open verdict could be decided "on the balance of probabilities".He said: "There are only two possible verdicts I think you can come to."He asked them if they were satisfied so they were sure beyond reasonable doubt that on 10 July 2010, Moat deliberately shot himself with the intention of taking his own life. If so, they must return a verdict of suicide.He went on to tell them that returning an open verdict is not "the easy way out".The coroner said the jury must also consider five questions, which he then listed.Did the firing of the Taser cause Moat to shoot himself when he otherwise would not have done so?Were the instructions to firearms officers appropriate?Was it right to fire the Tasers?Was the decision not to use Moat's half brother Angus, or his friend Anthony Wright, in direct negotiation appropriate?And was a senior officer's decision to use Tasers appropriate?Police were offered and accepted X12 Taser shotguns which were only licensed for testing in the UK and had not been approved by the Home Office.It was the first time firearms officers had seen the weapons.The shotguns were used as they fired Xrep cartridges over a longer range than conventional handheld Tasers.During the three-week inquest, Angus Moat said he believed police made a mistake in not allowing him to speak to Raoul during the standoff.On the second day of the inquest, the 41-year-old tax officer who has a different father but the same mother as the 37-year-old bouncer, said he had spoken to a senior officer about becoming a third party intervener alongside the police negotiators.He admitted he had not spoken to his brother for seven or eight years, as they had drifted apart.Angus Moat suggested police should have thrown his brother a mobile telephone if he was not able to speak face-to-face. He said he "should have been involved" in attempts to "talk Raoul down".Moat said that during the week his brother was on the run, their mother had spoken to the press and said Raoul would be better off dead, but he had not agreed.He said their mother had bipolar disorder and was "severely mentally ill and incapable of being a parent".He said his brother had attempted suicide in 1999 by taking a drug overdose and had been treated in hospital."I thought if I could speak to him it could change the way he was feeling and the way he would act."I thought the presence of some of his family members might change things."He said Raoul responded to aggression and threat, "but he also responded to kindness and friendship".The inquest earlier heard the gunman had said he would "take the shootout" rather than go back to jail.He left a message on a dictating machine three or four days before he was cornered by police marksmen.In it, he described losing the only two people who mattered to him â€“ his grandmother and his former girlfriend, Stobbart.
