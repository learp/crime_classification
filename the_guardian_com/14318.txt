A seven-year-old girl died when she was deliberately starved by her mother and stepfather during months of calculated cruelty in which she was hit with a cane if she ate too much, a court heard today.Birmingham crown court was told Khyra Ishaq succumbed to an infection in May 2008 after being starved "quite deliberately" while being kept prisoner in her own home in Handsworth, where she was forced to share a single bowl of food with five other children. If she or any of the other children ate too much, the prosecution claims, they were hit with a cane.Opening the case against Angela Gordon, 35, and her 31-year-old partner, Junaid Abuhamza, who both deny murder, Timothy Raggatt QC warned jurors that aspects of the case would upset and disturb them. He said the regime of punishment was wholly inappropriate and unacceptable in any kind of household.Raggatt said Khyra was so emaciated at the time of her death, on 17 May 2008, that her condition shocked even experienced medical professionals.He told the court: "She was but seven years old when she died, and the circumstances of her death are more than a little shocking."The infection that brought about Khyra's death was one that was caused, and wholly caused, as a result of one thing: for months – quite literally, months – she had been starved, and starved quite deliberately."Gordon denies five counts of child cruelty, alleged to have been committed between December 2007 and May 2008.The jury, which was informed that the case is a retrial, has been told that Abuhamza, who lived at the same address, has admitted five counts of cruelty. Jurors also heard that five other children who were also in the defendants' care were "similarly starved" and assaulted.Two of the other children, none of whom can be identified for legal reasons, were found to be in a state of acute, severe and dangerous malnutrition, Raggatt told the jury.He added: "They were lucky they did not contract an infection. They too were starved to a point where their lives were plainly at risk."Submitting that the defendants had acted together, Raggatt said: "What they did over a period of months was a series of things which directly led to her death."What they did was a continuous course of conduct that was cruelty of an extreme kind and had at its heart the deliberate starvation of this child, who was to all intents and purposes a prisoner in the home in which she was supposed to live and be protected."Jurors were shown pictures from inside the terraced house, including photographs of the "well-stocked" kitchen and a cane used as part of a "punishment regime".Pointing out two large bowls of fruit and tins of sweets in the cupboards, Raggatt said: "It isn't that this house was short of food. As you can see, there is lots of food in this household." But the court heard that the kitchen was kept locked by a bolt "out of the reach of the children" so that they could not help themselves to food.At mealtimes, they were given a bowl containing carrots, beans, eggs, rice or unsweetened porridge to share between them, the court heard.Raggatt said: "The essence of it was this: what they got was a single bowl of food to share between the six of them. They didn't get the means to eat it separately. They didn't get separate meals."They were given a bowl of food and they, as it were, got what they could from the bowl of food. If a child ate too much, then they would be hit with the cane that I showed you a picture of."The seven men and five women on the jury have been informed that the original trial of the defendants began last summer, but was halted after one juror fell ill and other issues arose with two further jurors.Before the prosecution opened the case, Mr Justice Roderick Evans, the trial judge, instructed the new jury not to search on the internet to find out details of the previous trial."One of the fundamental rules in trials in our courts is that juries must reach their verdicts solely on the evidence they hear in court," the judge warned them.The trial continues.
