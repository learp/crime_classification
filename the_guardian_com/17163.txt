All police forces in England and Wales may soon be given the option of using electrical stun guns if the government accepts the advice of senior officers.The Taser device, which freezes body movement for a few seconds but does not appear to cause lasting ill-effects, has been tried out by firearms officers in the Metropolitan, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, North Wales and Thames Valley forces for the past 12 months. David Blunkett, the home secretary, will decide in the next few weeks whether to offer Taser to the other 38 forces. A study of the trial by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the Association of Chief Police Officers was largely positive, and yesterday the Met police authority approved the extension of its use to non-firearms officers in specialist units. Commander Mike Messinger said: "The good thing about Taser is as soon as you take your finger off the trigger, everything is back to normal." He said the PWC researchers had been surprised at how few times Tasers were actually fired during the trial: in all but 19 of the 57 occasions on which they were aimed at someone, the person concerned stopped causing trouble once the red target dot was trained on them. If authorised generally, use of the Taser will be at the discretion of each chief constable.
