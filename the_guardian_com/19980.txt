A shakeup of the youth justice system is being planned by ministers that would see a failing punitive policy replaced by a more welfare-oriented, early-intervention approach to dealing with children in trouble. As part of a youth crime action plan to be published this summer, the Home Office has recommended that responsibility and funding for tackling youth crime - including local youth offending teams - should be moved to new, local authority-run "children's trusts".A feasibility plan is being drawn up to see if the children's trusts, which should exist in every local authority area by the end of this year, could take over responsibility for managing under-18s now locked up in Prison Service-run young offender institutions, privately-run secure training centres and local authority secure units. The children's trusts, which are designed to bring together all services for children and young people in a local area, would provide help and support to children in trouble, with education, accommodation, family counselling and supervision as well as criminal justice interventions. It is believed that ministers argue that if local authorities have to foot the bill in future for locking up teenagers they will place much greater emphasis on earlier prevention work. The debate over the youth crime action plan is believed to have triggered fresh tensions between the justice secretary, Jack Straw, who is keen to defend his 1998 youth justice reforms, which created the current system, and the children's secretary, Ed Balls, who believes a more welfare-oriented approach would produce better results. Currently, 2,430 of the 2,900 under-18s locked up are in Prison Service-run young offender institutions, at an average cost of Â£45,000 a place. It is argued that an early-intervention, welfare approach would lead to less use of all forms of custody and fewer children entering the criminal justice system. Both moves would mean a diminished role for the youth justice board, which this year marked its 10th anniversary after being set up by Straw when he was home secretary as part of a wide-ranging package of youth justice reforms. One scenario being discussed would involve the YJB retaining a commissioning role for the network of under-18s' jails and secure units, but with the children's trusts footing the bill for each place.The tensions between Straw and Balls are said to be fuelled by the fact that there is unlikely be new money to fund the youth justice shakeup, even though very little is currently spent on pre-school preventive work.Harry Fletcher, of Napo, the probation union, said insiders were predicting that the YJB was running out of time: "There are too many young people in custody and the justice model has meant that children have been incarcerated earlier than need be, and that therefore there will be a swing back to a model with the local authority as the prime agency with responsibility for young people in trouble."A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it did not comment on leaks but stressed that the YJB would have a key role in the future: "We have announced that we are planning to publish the [action plan] in the summer. Discussions on the issue continue. The YJB plays a crucial role in tackling youth crime and justice issues and will be key to the delivery of the [action plan]."An unpublished analysis by the children's and justice ministries shows that teenage reoffending rates remained largely unchanged since 1997, and that the "progressional" aspect of the system means that more and more teenagers are being locked up for breaches of punishments handed out for lesser offences.This has led ministers to believe that the number of children in the criminal justice system will only be reduced if the police are persuaded to concentrate on serious offending by teenagers, and to caution more and charge fewer teenagers in the case of minor offences. This would be politically very sensitive and easily knocked off course by a public outcry.
