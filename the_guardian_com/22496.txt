A white man whose mother has Somali roots was murdered in a 'savage attack' which may have been racially motivated, police said yesterday.Lee Phipps, 31, was found slumped on a doorstep after being fatally stabbed last Thursday afternoon. He lived with his mother, Barbara Yusuf-Porter, in South Shields, South Tyneside. Both had previously made complaints about racial harassment.Phipps was a keen photographer and had intended to take shots of snow that afternoon, but police who found his camera said no photos were taken.Det Supt Steve Wade, leading the murder investigation, said: 'Because of the reported racist incidents, this will be a line of inquiry we will pursue.'
