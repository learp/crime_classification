A racially offensive poster was pinned on the wall of a police station where a black officer was to give a talk on diversity, an employment tribunal heard yesterday.Charles Crichlow, who is chairman of Greater Manchester's Black and Asian Police Association, claims he was the victim of racial discrimination. PC Crichlow, 31, said he saw the poster advertising "slaves for sale" pinned on a wall in Salford police station, where he had arrived in July 2000 to run a one-day diversity training course. After complaining about the poster he was told the owner had taken it down and had been spoken to about it. The fact that the poster was permitted to be displayed suggested "that such material was normally condoned," PC Crichlow said. He did not feel senior officers were committed to quality equal opportunity training. "Therefore, the environment in which I had to work as a black officer was made very difficult. As such, it led me to consider that I had been treated less favourably than an officer not of an ethnic minority would have been." Greater Manchester police denies racial discrimination. The tribunal continues.
