"I'm not a typical policy-maker," Louise Casey informed guests during her now notorious after-dinner speech to senior police officers and Home Office officials. "I'm trying to bring about culture change. It doesn't come about unless you cause ripples."If ripples were what Ms Casey was after, she - not to mention the Home Office, where the antisocial behaviour unit she heads is based, and No 10, to which she also reports - is now truly drenched after her so-called "foul-mouthed rant". Her straight talking style and readiness to risk controversy have been her both strength and the characteristics that have left her exposed. For Tony Blair, overseeing Ms Casey's appointment first as head of Whitehall's rough sleepers unit (in 1999) and then three years later as "yob tsar", her unstuffy approach, her readiness to say the unsayable and focus on getting things done, were positive assets. The former deputy director of the housing charity Shelter has presented a dynamic public face of a modernising civil service. It did not take long for the outspoken non-graduate to hit the headlines: at the Rough Sleepers Unit, she urged the public not to give cash to the homeless. But some argue she is a victim of the controversial nature of her job. "She has been used as a ministerial substitute - running round the country banging the drum for Asbos," said one. "This is about limiting liability on behalf of politicians, and it seriously undermines the independence of the civil service." One former colleague praises her "inspirational leadership" but warns that her outspokenness has turned to arrogance. Another close observer agrees, saying: "She's like a Jedi knight that went to the dark side of the force."
