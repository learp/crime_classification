An inquiry into the case of an Asian police officer wrongly accused of sending racist hate mail to colleagues today again raised the spectre of institutional racism in the Metropolitan police.The inquiry into the case of Gurpal Virdi, a Sikh, also identified a "blame culture" in the force.Mr Virdi was suspended after he was alleged to have sent racist material through the internal mail system to himself and other ethnic minority officers and civilian staff. The hate mail - which included the message "Not wanted. Keep the police force white, leave or else" - was received on December 24 1997 and January 19 1998. Today a 14-month inquiry into the treatment of Mr Virdi, who has since been exonerated, said it was possible to detect institutional racism in the force's disciplinary processes."At worst, institutional racism can be detected in its processes and procedures in disadvantaging ethnic minority groups," it said.The interim report said it was concerned that the force's disciplinary process needed to be "more flexible" in the light of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry's definition of institutional racism.The inquiry, which was chaired by independent Metropolitan police authority member David Muir, added: "A blame culture of slavish adherence to rules and where common sense is punished if things go wrong, does not make grievance resolution easy to accomplish."Poor treatment of staff in turn affects the way they treat people in the community." Staff at Ealing police station who received the racist hate mail had been particularly affected by their experience and the person who sent it had still not been identified, the report said.It added: "It seems that the original investigation appeared to have concluded that Sergeant Virdi was responsible for the racist hate mail and then set about finding evidence to prove the case."Between 1998 and 2000 the Metropolitan police has seen a 68% increase in the number of racial discrimination cases taken to employment tribunals compared with the national increase of 25%, the report said.One chief inspector told the inquiry there had been a "reaction" since the 1999 publication of the MacPherson report.A constable told the inquiry: "If an ethnic officer complains he is more likely to be ostracised by his colleagues."Mr Virdi was arrested on April 15 1998 but the crown prosecution service decided not to proceed with criminal charges.But on February 7 2000 he appeared before a police disciplinary tribunal and on March 3 was found guilty and dismissed from the force.He took the Met to an employment tribunal and on August 23 that year it found that he had been racially discriminated against.Mr Virdi then appealed against the decision of the disciplinary tribunal and on November 20 2000 was reinstated. Due to legal issues relating to the employment tribunal he has yet to return to work.
