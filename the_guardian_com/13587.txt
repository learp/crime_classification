Two young brothers accused of attempting to murder two boys aged nine and 11 made a second appearance in court today in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.The pair, aged 10 and 11, sat side by side in the dock flanked by security guards during the five-minute hearing. They were remanded back to secure local authority care for 28 days.Both are charged with attempted murder and theft during an incident on 4 April at Edlington, Doncaster, where the victims were attacked in an isolated part of a former brickworks and quarry.Each boy faces two attempted murder charges and both are accused of stealing Â£5 from the older boy and a mobile phone from the younger one. No pleas have been entered.The older victim was found semi-conscious with life-threatening injuries after the younger one wandered dazed and covered in blood back to the nearby housing estate where both live. The 11-year-old victim is the younger one's uncle.The accused boys spoke in court only to confirm their names, the younger one raising his hand as he did so. He was wearing a grey Umbro sweatshirt, while his older brother had a sleeveless, grey, hooded top over a white T-shirt.There were no applications for bail and the boys will next appear at Doncaster youth court on 12 May. Commital proceedings to crown court are expected to begin the following week.Both victims are now recovering at home after hospital treatment.
