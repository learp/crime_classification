A notorious multiple killer dubbed the Black Panther must never be released from prison, a high court judge ruled today. Donald Neilson murdered 17-year-old heiress Lesley Whittle in 1975 after issuing a ransom demand. He also shot dead three sub-postmasters during armed robberies between February and November 1974. Neilson was known as the Black Panther because of his trademark balaclava.The 71-year-old had applied for a minimum jail term to be set which would have given him a chance of parole. But his arguments were rejected by Mr Justice Teare. "This is a case where the gravity of the applicant's offences justifies a whole life order," said the judge.Neilson was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment at Oxford crown court in 1976.The builder kidnapped Whittle from her home in Shropshire, leaving a ransom demand for Â£50,000. Her body was later found in an underground drainage system hanging from the bottom of a ladder to which Neilson had secured her by the neck with wire.He was caught after two policemen spotted him acting suspiciously outside a pub."The three murders of sub-postmasters involved a substantial degree of premeditation because the applicant took with him a loaded firearm which he was prepared to use," said Teare. "They were committed for gain. The victims were particularly vulnerable because of their occupation. The manner in which the young girl was killed demonstrates that it too involved a substantial degree of premeditation or planning."Other notorious criminals destined to spend the rest of their lives in prison include the Moors murderer Ian Brady and Dennis Nilsen, who was found guilty in 1983 of strangling six young men and burning and dismembering their bodies. Levi Bellfield, the former nightclub bouncer who murdered two young women and tried to kill a third and Steve Wright, the so-called Suffolk Strangler, who murdered five women in Ipswich, were both given whole life terms this year.
