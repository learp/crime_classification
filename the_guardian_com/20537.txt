The Home Office last night admitted that 21 out of 23 prisoners serving life sentences who have gone missing and been officially declared "unlawfully at large" are convicted murderers. The figures, released by the home secretary, John Reid, in a Commons written answer, show that the probation service had lost contact with 13 of the 23 released life prisoners more than a year ago; one missing "lifer" has been on the run for more than 10 years.Mr Reid also admitted the police had only been able to return to custody four of the 23 missing lifers since their disappearance was exposed three weeks ago in the row over "unduly lenient" sentences.Nick Clegg, the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesman, who secured the admission from the Home Office, said: "Serious questions need to be asked about the probation service's capacity if they can fail for a decade to supervise a serious offender."
