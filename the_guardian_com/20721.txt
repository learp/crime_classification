Police hunting Michael Cope, who is wanted for the murder and rape of his ex-girlfriend Linzi Ashton, have said that anyone harbouring him will be prosecuted.Ashton, 25, a mother of two, had also told police she had suffered domestic violence at Cope's hands. She was found with head and facial injuries at her home in Winton, Salford, on Saturday. Cope, 28, has not been seen since.Superintendent Kevin Mulligan said on Monday that Ashton had suffered a 'sustained and vicious' attack: "If anyone is harbouring this individual they will be prosecuted. This is a serious offence and we need to track down this man. He does have a history of violent and aggressive behaviour and he does represent a risk to the community."The community, or members of the community, must know where he is and they need to pass on that information to us as soon as possible and that information will be treated in the strictest of confidence."He continued: "We have got a team of detectives on this investigation that are working tirelessly to bring the offender to justice and there has been an increased police presence in the area."Cope has convictions for violent behaviour and has served time in custody, Mulligan confirmed.Police have sought Cope since April, when Ashton said he raped her.The focus of the manhunt remained in Salford with a large police presence in the Winton area, Mulligan said. "We believe he is in Salford, although he could be anywhere. He is a dangerous man and if anyone sees him out on the streets or anywhere else they need to ring 999."The bottom line here is that this is a really nasty, wicked crime and if anyone is harbouring him they have a moral duty to come forward and tell us where he is."Ashton and Cope were seen out together in Salford on Friday night. Police are keen to piece together their movements that night.Mulligan said that the force's handling of Ashton's case had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He said that Ashton's complaints were taken seriously and that a proper assessment would take place.The matter will be looked at by Greater Manchester police's professional standards division and will be the subject of an independent domestic homicide review, which will involve several agencies.
