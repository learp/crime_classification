Jill Dando was probably best known as the face of BBC hit shows Crimewatch and Holiday.Yet she almost ended up as the replacement for Martyn Lewis to read the BBC's Six O'Clock News.Although she was able to span hard-hitting and lightweight programmes, Dando realised her "girl-next-door" appeal would give her career more variety.Born in 1961 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, she had a tough start in life after having to undergo a hole-in-the heart operation.As a child she stood out from the crowd for her superb tidiness and organisational skills, so it was no surprise to her friends when become head girl of Broadoak sixth-form college.Dando began her journalism career at the age of 17 as a reporter on the local paper.Her father and elder brother, Nigel, both worked on the Western Mercury and Dando was given a job after writing a 500 word essay on her thoughts on the year 2000.But it was television that really attracted her.As a child, she had written to BBC1's Jim'll Fix It to ask if she could work in TV and she left the Western Mercury to pursue her path into broadcasting by taking up a post with Radio Devon.From there she moved to BBC1 southwest news show Spotlight.In 1988, two years after her mother died, she moved to London and to the BBC's Breakfast News.Dando's transition towards mainstream presenting came in the early 1990s when she was picked to replace Anneka Rice on travel show Holiday.Then, in 1994, she joined Nick Ross as co-host of Crimewatch after the departure of Sue Cook.In 1998, speculation was rife that Dando would become the face of the Six O'Clock News. However, she turned down the opportunity after she learned that the BBC's news and current affairs department considered her too lightweight.At the time of her death on April 26 1999, Dando was reportedly earning around Â£500,000 from work on a number of programmes, including a new show The Antiques Inspectors. She was also due to front a Panorama two-parter on organ transplants and another on the police.During her career, she was renowned for her self-effacing charm and ability to connect with viewers. But just before her death, she began moving away from her sensible image towards a racier one, appearing in black leather on the front cover of the Radio Times.At the beginning of 1999, she and consultant gynaecologist Alan Farthing announced their engagement.They had met 15 months previously after Dando had ended a seven-year relationship with television executive Bob Wheaton.In the essay that won her her first journalism job, Dando had said she hoped she would be married by the year 2000.She and Farthing were due to hold their wedding before the turn of the millennium.
