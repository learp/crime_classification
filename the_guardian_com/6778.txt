A quarter of inmates at a crisis-hit prison have been offered alcohol, one in 20 of them on a daily basis, an inquest was told today.Around 15% of inmates at Pentonville prison, in London, admitted to have consumed alcohol behind bars, the prison's head of decency and performance at the jail, Paul Baker, said.Mr Baker told a jury hearing the inquest into the death of James Corlis, who was found dead in his cell last year with a blood alcohol level equivalent to four times the drink driving limit, that most liquor was brewed on site out of fruit, sugar and yeast.He said the figures had been revealed in an internal survey of 1,000 inmates, around 400 of whom responded, and that previously the prison had been unaware that illegal alcohol consumption had been an issue.Last month, authorities at Pentonville announced that 14 prison officers had been suspended amid allegations that they were involved in trafficking mobile phones and drugs to inmates."It is impossible to eliminate the risk [of alcohol getting to inmates]" Mr Baker told St Pancras coroner's court in north London. "I have to say most of the problems in Pentonville have been associated with drugs where we have a real issue."Mr Baker said various efforts were made to stop alcoholic drinks being brought into the prison or "hooch" being brewed on site. They included the removal of empty plastic bottles, often used for the fermentation process and searches of prisoners and contract staff with access to yeast in the kitchen, which is also used in brewing. He added that none of the suspended prison officers faced alcohol-related allegations.Mr Corlis, 24, of Ilford, Essex, was found by his cellmate, Allan McLeod, early on June 12, 2005, after apparently suspending himself from the bars of his window using a bed sheet. The inquest was told that a toxicology report found that he had 3.1gm/litre of alcohol in his blood, a potentially life-threatening level.The jury heard that Mr Corlis, who had taken an overdose in 2004, had been remanded to Pentonville after being charged with threatening his former girlfriend, whose father was also an inmate in the prison.Mr Corlis' mother, Coraline Corlis-Khan, told the court that her son was "deeply concerned" about the man's presence, as his former girlfriend had made it clear that "her father would deal with him". Mrs Corlis-Khan told the inquest that her son, a keen body builder, only drank on family social occasions."He was known as the "family man" because when he was not at work or in the gym, he was with his son or daughter," she said. She added that she did not believe her son wanted to kill himself but that his actions were a "cry for help".The inquest was also told that two inquiries into Mr Corlis' death had found concerns with the training of staff and communication procedures within the prison over inmates with mental health concerns.Police had identified Mr Corlis' previous self harm and noted it on paperwork passed onto the Prison Service when he was transferred from their custody, the court was told. A nurse in the prison's reception area was worried about Mr Corlis' quietness and referred him to the prison medical officer, Dr Badrudduja Khan, who did not consider it necessary to put the inmate on a special watch.Dr Berry Beaumont, an Islington GP who carried out a clinical review of the death for Islington primary care trust, said she was "very concerned" that Dr Khan, who had been a locum doctor at the prison for seven years, "did not appear to have any formal training" in mental health care work."I would have thought there was a dual responsibility both for the doctor to make sure he has the training and for the Prison Service to ensure that anyone employed in this capacity was qualified for the job," Dr Beaumont said.Thea Walton, who conducted an inquiry by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman, which investigates deaths in custody, said concerns about alcohol misuse among inmates and the lack of communication between prison staff in respect to potentially suicidal prisoners had been passed on to Pentonville authorities. She said it was not clear how Mr Corlis attained the alcohol.Mr Baker, who described himself as third in charge of Pentonville, added that the evaluation system in place for prisoners when Mr Corlis died were "too black and white" and had now been replaced by a new "more robust" system, known as Acct, which dealt with inmates according to "degrees of risk".The jury of four men and four women returned a verdict of death by misadventure, saying the cause of death was by hanging and that Mr Corlis had an unexplained level of alcohol in his blood but there was no evidence that he intended to take his own life."I am horrified that it has taken them this long to bring in better procedures," Mrs Corlis-Khan said afterwards. "I am elated that people recognise that things went wrong and have now tried to do something about it."
