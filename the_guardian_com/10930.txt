Police were today hunting a man who stabbed to death a 25-year-old accounts manager while disguised as Father Christmas.Sikandar Shaheen was killed in his home in Leytonstone, east London, on Saturday. A Metropolitan police spokesman said the suspect was spotted near the scene on Grove Green Road wearing a red Santa hat and fake white beard. Detective Chief Inspector Keith Garnish said: "We believe the suspect wore this hat at the time of the attack." Mr Garnish has appealed for witnesses to the incident, which took place between 5.30am and 7am. Neighbours in the block of flats where Mr Shaheen lived called police after hearing a disturbance just after 6am. Officers found the victim bleeding heavily in a hallway. He was taken to hospital but later died. The hat thought to have been worn by the attacker has been recovered and police have released an image of it in a bid to jog people's memories. Mr Garnish said: "Sikandar was a hard-working, law-abiding religious man who attended mosques in the Leyton and Leytonstone area. "We are appealing for members of the mosques who knew Sikandar to assist us. "We are also appealing to anyone who knew Sikandar or knew his last movements leading up to Saturday to contact us." He added that police were keeping an "open mind" about what the motive for the murder might have been.
