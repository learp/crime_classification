Your article (Suspect in police killing was not deported, May 3) had little to do with the Home Office's failure to consider whether convicted foreign nationals should be deported. Mustaf Jammal had been considered for deportation, but his human rights precluded this. Contrary to your article, he would already have had the burden of proving that he was at risk of persecution in his home country - which, in our experience, is no easy task. The UK does not torture people or sentence them to death, however heinous their crimes, and its international obligations rightly prevent it from doing so by proxy in sending deportees to countries where there is a real risk of torture or death.Nor did Jammal's case have anything to do with memoranda of understanding. They are a controversial attempt to secure the removal of national-security suspects. They have not been deployed in "standard criminal" deportations, still less with a country such as Somalia, which has no functioning central government.Charles Clarke's response to his department's administrative failure has been to suggest that foreigners convicted of any imprisonable offence should be presumptively deported. But invidious racism lies not so far beneath the surface of the chorus of complaint that foreign nationals have been left free to offend again. We do not lock up indefinitely all British citizens who are convicted of crimes, even though reconviction rates show many will be freed to offend again. Foreign nationals equally deserve due process and proportionality before the drastic and severe measure of deportation is taken.Andrew Nicol QC (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Ian MacDonald QC (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Tim Owen QC (Barrister, Matrix Chambers) Michael Mansfield QC (Barrister, Tooks Chambers) Chris Gibson QC (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Frances Webber (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Maurice Wren (Director, Asylum Aid) Chris Randall (Chair, Immigration Law Practitioners' Association) David Rhys Jones (Advocacy Officer, Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture) Raju Bhatt (Partner, Bhatt Murphy Solicitors) Wesley Gryk (Head of Wesley Gryk Solicitors) Jackie Peirce (Partner, Glazer Delmar Solicitors) Harriet Wistrich (Solicitor, Birnberg Peirce Solicitors) Rick Scannell (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Karon Monaghan (Barrister, Matrix Chambers) Aileen McColgan (Professor of Human Rights Law, Kings College London) Raza Husain (Barrister, Matrix Chambers)  Nicola Rogers (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Laura Dubinsky (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Fiona Lindsley (Solicitor, Hackney Law Centre) Anne Singh (Solicitor, Christian Khan Solicitors) Richard Harvey (Barrister, Tooks Chambers, Chair of Haldane Society) Terry Munyard (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Simon Cox (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers)  John Walsh (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers)  Abi Smith (Barrister, Tooks Chambers) Rita Sethi (Barrister, Tooks Chambers)  Fiona Ripley (Solicitor, Southwark Law Centre) Sophia Barrett (Solicitor, Christian Khan Solicitors) Alex Bailin (Barrister, Matrix Chambers) Rachel Burley (Solicitor, Christian Khan Solicitors) Jessica Simor (Barrister, Matrix Chambers)  Lorna Skinner (Barrister, Matrix Chambers) Peter Morris (Doughty Street Chambers) Raggi Kotak (Barrister, 1 Pump Court Chambers) Catrin Lewis (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Maggie Crowley (Caseworker, Asylum Aid) Maya Naidoo (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Alasdair Mackenzie (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Phil Haywood (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers)  Liz Davies (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Charlotte Kilroy (Barrister, Matrix Chambers)  Danny Friedman (Barrister, Matrix Chambers) Marc Willers (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Wayne Jordash (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Michael Paget (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Sonali Naik (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Susan Sleeman (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Sareta Ashraph  (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Nadine Finch  (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Brenda Campbell  (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Sadakat Kadri  (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Joseph Middleton (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Sadat Sayeed (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Philippa Kaufmann  (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Anya Lewis (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers)  Maya Sikand (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Ruth Brander (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers) Rajeev Thacker  (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Mark Henderson (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers)  Nick Brown  (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers)  Femi Omere (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers)  Ulele Burnham (Barrister, Doughty Street Chambers)  Barbara Cohen (discrimination consultant) Julie Tenenbaum (Trainee Solicitor, Bateswells Solicitors) Ali Bandegani (Immigration Caseworker) Sonal Ghelani (Immigration / human rights solicitor) Ravi Low-Beer  (Immigration/ human rights solicitor) Elizabeth Storey  (Immigration/ human rights solicitor) Timothy Lawrence (PJ Ward Solicitors) Louise Hooper  (Barrister, Garden Court Chambers) Shah Qureshi  (Solicitor, Webster Dixon Solicitors)
