Four probation officers supervising two criminals who killed financier John Monckton have been suspended, it was revealed today.News of the suspensions came as an official report said there had been a "collective failure" and "serious deficiencies" in the handling of Damien Hanson and Elliot White.Hanson, 25, stabbed Mr Monckton during a botched burglary at his Â£3m home in Chelsea, west London, in November 2004, three months after being released halfway through a 12-year jail term for attempted murder.His accomplice, White, 24, who was convicted of Mr Monckton's manslaughter, was out on bail at the time of the robbery awaiting a court appearance on heroin and cocaine charges, for which he was later sentenced to three years.In today's report, the chief inspector of probation, Andrew Bridges, said the cases illustrated "the exact opposite of effective offender management".He said it was not possible to "eliminate risk altogether" when managing offenders in the community, but the public had the right to expect authorities to "do their job properly".Shortly after the report was published, the Home Office said the London probation service had suspended four officers "while a review is undertaken into their conduct in the handling of these cases".One of the most damning sections of Mr Bridges' report cites an "extraordinary situation", in which Hanson ended up reporting to a probation office in west London, even though he was supposed to be excluded from the area under the terms of his early release. This "glaring deficiency" was completely unacceptable, Mr Bridges said.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, who commissioned the report, said the "major failures" it had identified in the probation and parole services were "unacceptable".Mr Clarke said he took responsibility for the case and, while he accepted the report's recommendations, further measures might also be required. He would report on this after parliament's Easter recess.The home secretary said: "The murder of Mr Monckton was an appalling act and when the judgment was finally given, it was obvious that there were major failings in probation and parole in terms of the dealings with Hanson and White."I deeply regret that this happened and pass my full regret and apologies to the family and friends of John Monckton."The report said it was impossible to know if Mr Monckton, a 49-year-old managing director of bonds at Legal and General investment management, would still be alive if the mistakes had not been made.Five individuals involved in the management of Hanson's case, and two in the handling of White's supervision are identified but not named in the report. It was not his role to recommend disciplinary action, but Mr Bridges said: "We are very critical of the fact that individuals who found themselves having to deal with these cases, under unsatisfactory organisational arrangements, did not show greater initiative in making decisions and taking action to ensure that the cases were better managed."Crucially, Hanson was not dealt with as a high-risk offender despite having previously been assessed as such, the report found. An official risk assessment had calculated that his chances of reoffending were 91%. The parole board's original decision to release him was "defensible", but the release plan drawn up was "not fit for purpose", the report said.In the case of White, there was a failure to enforce his drug treatment and testing order properly, the report said.Mr Bridges said the cases of Hanson and White were not exceptional and it was vital that the mistakes were not repeated.Earlier this month, Hanson was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum tariff of 36 years, for Mr Monckton's murder, which means he will be aged over 60 by the time he is eligible for parole. He also received automatic life sentences for the attempted murder of the financier's wife, Homeyra, and robbery, with specified terms of 10 and six years respectively.White was jailed for a total of 18 years for Mr Monckton's manslaughter, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and robbery.The two men tricked their way into the financier's three-storey home by pretending they were delivering a parcel. Mr Monckton was killed as he tried to stop the robbers in the hallway. Homeyra Monckton was stabbed as she tried to reach a panic button. Their nine-year-old daughter raised the alarm after the killers had left.Reacting to today's report, Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo, called for more resources.He said: "During 2004, when this tragedy occurred, the London probation service was in financial chaos and facing an overspend, was undergoing reorganisation and was experiencing a recruitment freeze."He said the situation now was "still chronic" in the probation service in London but had improved since 2004.
