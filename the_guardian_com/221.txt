More sex offenders could be offered "chemical castration" under a range of "Sarah's law" measures unveiled by the home secretary today.John Reid said that families would be informed about offenders who might pose a specific threat to their children and there would be lie detector tests for persistent paedophiles.The home secretary said that the move - which stops short of publicising the whereabouts of paedophiles but creates a "presumption" for police to tell a mother that her partner was a sex offender - was part of a "radical" package to protect youngsters.Individuals provided with information could be committing a public order offence if they disclose it to others.Mr Reid told MPs: "Information should and can no longer remain the exclusive preserve of officialdom."We will therefore update the law to give the police and other agencies a duty to consider in every case whether a member of the public needs to know about an offender's history to protect the child."Chemical castration - offering sex offenders drugs to curb their libido - is not new. But today's announcement saw an expansion of the scheme.Mr Reid said it would not be compulsory, nor a substitute for punishment or prison.The Tories said that vulnerable children deserved better but the reforms were hailed a "massive step forward" by campaigner Sara Payne.The murder of her eight-year-old daughter, Sarah Payne, by paedophile Roy Whiting in July 2000, sparked a nationwide campaign for the UK to adopt a US-style "Megan's law" publicising information about sex offenders.The NSPCC welcomed the limits on information sharing, saying that "open access" for everyone could force convicted paedophiles underground and place youngsters at greater risk of assault.But the children's charity warned that the new disclosure plans could overstretch limited resources.Other moves in the package include a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the fact that 90% of child abuse takes place in a family setting, and compulsory lie-detector tests.A Home Office pilot scheme used polygraph tests on 350 offenders and questioned them about whether they had reoffended or breached their parole or community order conditions.In all, 44% were found to be deceptive in the voluntary trials, which will be followed with a compulsory scheme under today's package.New information about paedophiles' behaviour - which could be vital in protecting children and others from sex attacks - was obtained in nearly eight out of 10 cases in the pilot.At an earlier briefing Mr Reid told journalists: "We are taking some radical steps in what we are doing but it's possible to take radical steps with a degree of caution."He insisted that the measures were not the same as "Megan's law" in the US, which ministers believe has not been effective in tackling paedophilia and may have driven some offenders underground."The idea that we wanted to adopt Megan's law was never put forward by us," Mr Reid said."What we did want to do was address the campaign that Sara Payne put forward amongst others."If someone wants to call that Sarah's law, then I am delighted for her."Mr Reid said that initially three pilots would be run in different parts of the country, and legislation would be brought forward later.Mr Reid said that programmes to tag offenders and then monitor them by satellite would be extended, and methods of ensuring safeguards on paedophiles' computers would also be tested.Announcing the measure in the House of Commons, Mr Reid said: "There are very few crimes more horrific than sex offences against children."But responding to Mr Reid's statement in the house, shadow home affairs spokesman David Davies warned that the measures could drive paedophiles underground.Mr Davies also said that the proposals had implications for the police and other agencies which could hamper delivery."The NSPCC are warning that the police are overstretched and do not have the resources to manage the system properly," said Mr Davies."Then there is a much wider issue of enforcement. Without competent implementation, no policies will work. Indeed, they may give a false sense of security, but no protection.A voluntary system of "castration" through medication would also fail to curb the problem, added Mr Davies. "Whilst it may be useful in some cases, it will not deal with the worst offenders, who do not wish to reform," he said.The director of the NSPCC, Dame Mary Marsh, said: "Someone with a clean criminal record does not always have a clean bill of health; people must never be lulled into a false sense of security."The multi-agency public protection arrangements, or MAPPA, which monitor sex offenders in the community, will receive a Â£1.2m funding boost.The package of measures applies to England and Wales.The Liberal Democrats attacked Mr Reid for attempting to be "wildly populist" over the proposed measures to "castrate" offenders. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said the measures were welcome if they "work in practice", but added: "Branding voluntary hormone treatment as chemical castration does a disservice to all the parents of young children who want a calm and considered approach to an issue of such public concern."
