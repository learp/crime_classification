The uncle of schoolgirl Shannon Matthews's stepfather appeared in court yesterday charged with her abduction and false imprisonment. He was remanded in custody for a week. A van carrying Michael Donovan ran the gauntlet of a small crowd of the child's family and neighbours outside Dewsbury magistrates court in West Yorkshire. Donovan spoke only to confirm his name in a seven-minute hearing before magistrate Richard Palfreeman. He was led into the dock handcuffed to a prison officer. Donovan, 39, unemployed, is accused of abducting Shannon on February 19 "by force or fraud" as she returned home from a school swimming trip. He was also charged with "unlawfully and injuriously" imprisoning her for 24 days in his home in Lidgate Gardens, Batley Carr. Shannon was found on Friday in the storage drawer of a divan bed at the top floor flat, just over a mile from her home on the Dewsbury Moor estate.There was no application for bail and Donovan was remanded in custody at the request of prosecution solicitor Thomas Klouda. Shannon's mother Karen 32, and her 22-year-old partner Craig Meehan - Donovan's nephew - were not at the hearing, which was adjourned until next Tuesday when Donovan will appear via a video link from jail. Shannon is in the care of Kirklees council's family services, and is not expected to go home for some days. She is being questioned by specialist police officers from the biggest West Yorkshire police operation since the Yorkshire Ripper inquiry 30 years ago. They are questioning her gently, in brief periods of no more than 15 minutes at a time.A team of 60 detectives is still working on the case.
