American private prison operators will be among the companies invited to bid against the public sector to run a cluster of three prisons as part of the government's first "contestability" competition.The three prisons involved - Elmley, Standford Hill and Swaleside - occupy a 240 hectare (600 acre) site on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, and hold 2,000 prisoners, using 1,132 staff. Martin Narey, chief executive of the the newly merged Prison and Probation Service, said the competition was designed to drive up standards and was the first in a series involving both the prisons and probation services. "This is not about saving money. We will not be spending a penny less on these prisons than we do now." A new Whitehall code of practice to prevent the development of a two-tier workforce means that staff can be transferred or recruited only on the terms that currently exist for the public sector staff. At the same time it was formally announced that the legal ban on prison staff going on strike is to be lifted. The prison officers' union claimed that three of the best and most modern prisons were being put up for privatisation to tempt US companies into the British market.
