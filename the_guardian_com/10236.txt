A serial paedophile who kept a film library of his sex attacks on children as a "souvenir gathering exercise" was jailed for life yesterday.Anthony Barron, 54, from Grove, Wantage, Oxfordshire, admitted 87 charges of sexual offences relating to at least 10 girls - some as young as three - between 1995 and 2006. He was convicted by the jury of two further charges of rape and attempted rape.Judge Julian Hall said the offences were "as serious as I think I have ever come across," adding that Barron had not demonstrated a "hint of sympathy" for his victims, whom he treated "as if they were toys".He was given a minimum term of nine years before he can apply for parole and must spend his life on the sex offenders' register.Barron, himself a grandfather, went about befriending the parents of children he was to abuse through roles at primary schools, youth clubs and cub groups, persuading them to allow their children to stay at his house.Oxford crown court heard how he would later bribe the children, who were aged between three and 12 years old, not to reveal what he had done to them, by giving them ice lollies and sweets.The period of abuse extended over nine years and included attacks on two young sisters, who on one occasion he abused on the same day. On another occasion he abused a child while her mother was in the same house, unaware of what was happening.When police raided his home after a five-year-old girl told her mother what had happened to her, they found a collection of toys suitable for children from the age of two years old along with the video library which catalogued the attacks. Officers were able to make a comprehensive list of his offences by identifying children through the video tapes.Detective Constable Bob Owen, from Thames Valley police, said Barron had caused untold distress and suffering to his victims and their families. "In my 28 years service as a police officer, I have never dealt with a case of child abuse on this scale," he said. "Anthony Barron is a cunning, devious and extremely dangerous predator and a most evil man."Andrew Bright QC, defending, told the court that his client was "capable of reform" and hoped to one day be allowed back into the community to "do what he sees as his duty to go some way to putting things right".In a letter to the court Barron cited his divorce, the death of a relative and the difficulties of being a lone parent as triggers for his offending.But Judge Hall rejected this, saying: "I have no idea when you will be safe to release because I have no idea why this all started." The severity of Barron's offending was exacerbated by the way he kept video tapes of himself attacking the children."The filming you indulged in, collecting souvenirs as you chillingly put it, I can't imagine anything worse than a parent knowing that their child has not only been abused but also knowing that film exists of that abuse."Judge Hall told jurors in the case that he would excuse them from jury service for the next 10 years because of what they had gone through. "Once is enough for a lifetime," he said.The mother of one of his four-year-old victims said that Barron had appeared to care about both the children and her welfare. "He came across as really nice, genuine, charming. I was absolutely furious with him, then felt guilty with myself because I felt I hadn't protected my own children."Speaking outside court, senior prosecution lawyer Jenny Jonckheer said: "This is undoubtedly the worst case of child abuse that I have seen in my 30 years' experience of prosecuting criminal cases."My thoughts are with the victims of these crimes, the effects of which will last a lifetime."
