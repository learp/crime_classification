The senior detective who led the investigation into the murder of Jill Dando has accused the Criminal Cases Review Commission of showing a "worrying disregard" for facts in its examination of the conviction of her killer, Barry George.In a document submitted to the CCRC and seen by the Guardian, Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell makes a robust defence of his investigation into the murder of the BBC presenter and claims the commission's continued pursuit of certain issues in the case is tantamount to labelling him a liar.The emergence of the document comes as the commission prepares to make a decision after a two-year inquiry on whether to send the case back to the appeal court.Dando, 37, was shot dead on the doorstep of her west London home in 1999. Amid public horror over the murder, police investigated George, who was known to have an obsession with the news presenter, and had a conviction for attempted rape and an interest in guns.He was convicted six years ago at the Old Bailey on a majority verdict of what the judge, Mr Justice Gage, described as the premeditated killing of Dando. He lost one appeal in 2002 and for the past two years lawyers at the CCRC have been examining whether the case constituted a miscarriage of justice and should be referred back to the court of appeal.One of the central allegations the CCRC lawyers are considering is the claim that crucial evidence of firearms residue found deep in the pocket of George's coat could have come from contamination by firearms officers present at his arrest and the search of his home.The point was repeated in a Panorama programme this week, which also featured two forensics and ballistics experts who said this evidence should never have been put to the jury.In the document, Mr Campbell states that he has repeatedly made clear, over seven years, that no firearms officers were used in the arrest of George or the search of his home and has presented evidence to prove it. Clearly frustrated that the issue is still live and being considered as a possible ground for appeal, Mr Campbell, in a detailed rebuttal, says: "Let me be quite categorical about this point. Neither I nor any other member of the Metropolitan police service conducted a search of Barry George's property with firearms officers, nor did I authorise that his arrest be accompanied by firearms officers."I have stated this position very clearly since 2002 and it has not altered. The alternative is clear. I am lying and I have deliberately set out to mislead other senior officers, the CPS, the court, the appeal court and the CCRC. In addition, every member of the search team are lying. It is not the case that I am lying or mistaken in what I have explained to the CCRC."Mr Campbell says the proposition that firearms officers would have to have been present because of the nature of the inquiry was a "false premise". He said a body of evidence presented in the case showed there were no armed police in the house. He targets the CCRC, the body set up to investigate possible miscarriages of justice, for criticism."For the CCRC to adopt it as a point which merits yet further explanation and definition from me does suggest an ignoring of facts by the CCRC."New evidence unearthed by the commission is understood to include a statement from George that he was beaten over the head with a gun butt during his arrest, a point not heard at his first appeal.Mr Campbell rejects this new evidence, saying it is "nonsense and maliciously false". As evidence to prove his case, he says George was questioned for five days in the presence of his lawyer in a room equipped with video cameras and the film shows there was no injury to his head."It is this type of assertion, made without any substance and in spite of the wealth of evidence demonstrating the contrary position, that is, in my opinion, worryingly disregarded by the CCRC," Mr Campbell said.A spokesman for the CCRC said: "We are an independent public body set up to review cases to decide if there is any new evidence or legal argument which might undermine the safety of a conviction."Our work is by statute confidential and no one is in a position to know how we have investigated a case or what reasons we may have for pursuing particular lines of inquiry. We shall continue to review the case with integrity, rigour and without regard to external comment or pressure."
