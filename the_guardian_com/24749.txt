High-profile deaths - such as that of special constable Nisha Patel-Nasri, schoolboy Kiyan Prince and most recently Thomas Grant have brought the issue of knife crime to the forefront of policy and especially media attention. Hardly a day has passed recently when a knife incident, or knife culture, hasn't been on the front page - whether in relation to the current police amnesty, which runs until the end of this month, potential new laws for carrying a knife, or more tragic events.Despite all of this attention, or perhaps because of it, it is sometimes difficult to get a handle on the reality of knife crime and knife culture - a difficulty not helped by the fact that the Home Office does not keep statistics on, for example, stabbings. However, what we can say with certainty is that more people are murdered with knives (or by other sharp instruments, such as broken bottles) than by any other weapon in this country, despite the fact that the same policy and media attention was, only a matter of a few months ago, solely concerned with guns and gun culture.All of this might suggest that we are dealing with that staple of the media that politicians always seem to fall for - a moral panic (from dangerous dogs to paedophiles and foreign prisoners), but in fact knife-carrying, especially by young people, is endemic, as a recent survey by the Youth Justice Board revealed. However, what has been missing from both the public and policy discussions is why so many young people want to carry knives at all.In conducting research with young people on behalf of the Children's Society over the last four years, I became acutely aware of knife carrying as a phenomenon, and those young people who carried knives that I spoke to largely fell into two groups. The first did so because they were scared, and they felt that the adult world of criminal justice did not take their fears seriously. So, in the absence of support from teachers, social workers or the police about problems that they might be facing, they felt that they had to look after themselves and each other. Carrying a knife - which was also cheap to buy (if they couldn't get one from home) and conceal - was a way that they could confront their problems, or the problems of their friends.The second group carried knives for what might be called symbolic reasons. In other words, carrying a knife demonstrated growing up; being adult; or, more gender-specifically, "being a man". With this group a knife was a status symbol; a powerful tool that signified their rite of passage into the far-off world of no longer being young and dependent, pushed around, stigmatised and often despised.Of course there could be overlaps between these two groups, but what they hold, I suggest, is the key to what we should be doing about knife crime and knife culture - beyond the public-relations stunt of amnesties and the like.For if we take what these young people said seriously then, in the first instance, the roots to overcoming knife crime lie in listening to the fears that young people have, and working with them to find alternatives to resolve those fears without them believing that the only solution is to resort to violence. But more broadly, deeper, structural solutions seem to lie with the second group that I encountered. After all, why should young people - especially young men - believe that growing up and being adult involves carrying a weapon? Why should being a man dovetail so neatly with interpersonal violence?The answers to these questions have little to do with the criminal-justice system, knife amnesties, stiffer prison sentences or the like, but are instead firmly rooted in the type of society that we have become and the values that we say we admire, especially in relation to masculinity. So instead of dreaming up new penalties for carrying knives, communities that want to be safe from them - or indeed guns for that matter - would be far better off investing in good schools, with well-paid and qualified teachers, and in ensuring that young people, especially young men, feel valued and included and have jobs and training when they leave school.Â· David Wilson is professor of criminology at the University of Central England in Birmingham.
