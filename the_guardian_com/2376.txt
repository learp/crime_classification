Five teenagers are to appear at a Northern Ireland court today charged with the murder of a Catholic schoolboy who was allegedly cornered in an alley and beaten with a baseball bat.Michael McIlveen, who was 15, died in hospital on Monday, a day after being savagely beaten by a gang of youths in the town of Ballymena, Co Antrim, after buying a takeaway pizza in the early hours of Sunday.Detectives believe Michael and two friends were chased from a car park through the streets of the town before the attack. Afterwards he managed to stagger home and was taken to hospital. His family remained at his bedside until his life support machine was switched off on Monday evening.The charges were confirmed just hours after Michael's family and friends held a candle-lit vigil outside his home. Flowers were left outside the property in the Dunvale area.A spokesman for the Northern Ireland police service confirmed that four adults and a 15-year-old juvenile would appear at Ballymena magistrates' court.Officers were continuing to question two other juveniles arrested last night in connection with the murder.Groups across the political spectrum condemned the killing, which is believed to have been sectarian. Local politicians in Ballymena, where there have been frequent sectarian clashes, urged the community not to retaliate.Martin McGuinness, Sinn FÃ©in's chief negotiator, described the killing as needless and unjustifiable and urged civic leaders not to "turn a blind eye" to sectarianism.The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, said this week he was appalled by the "sickening" attack. Ian Paisley, the local MP and Democratic Unionist party leader, appealed for calm as the marching season approached.
