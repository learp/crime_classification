Two years on from the Macpherson report, the Guardian is conducting a survey of the 43 forces in England and Wales to find out what progress has been made. We conducted a similar survey last year. We have taken our questions from data Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary asked forces to keep, as set out in Winning the Race, and recommendations by Sir William Macpherson himself. The questions we asked included: 1. How many ethnic minority officers do you have now? And as a percentage of the total number of officers?2. What is the latest figure you have for the clear up rate of racist crimes and incidents?
