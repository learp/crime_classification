A suspected violent criminal who was freed from a prison van by armed men on Monday was recaptured in the early hours of this morning.A manhunt was launched after Wayne Connor, 20, went on the run while being transported to court from Feltham young offenders institution in west London.Connor escaped after two men wearing balaclavas stopped the prison van he was travelling in, smashed the driver's window and threatened an officer with a gun. Police warned the public not to approach the men and a search was launched using a police helicopter, specialist search teams and dog handlers.Police said Connor was arrested just after midnight at Clumber Park hotel in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, by officers from Nottingham and the Metropolitan police's specialist crime directorate.Scotland Yard said no other arrests were made and the armed men involved in Connor's escape were still being sought.Connor had been due to appear at Woolwich crown court on Monday alongside his brother Jason McInerney, 21, who escaped from custody last year when he bit a detective's nose as he jumped from the dock at Reading crown court.His other brother, Kirk McInerney, and cousin Martin Carty, both 18, tried to escape during the same incident last March, but were stopped by police.Serco, the company that runs court escort services for the Ministry of Justice, takes up to 20 vanloads of prisoners a day from Feltham to courts, prisons and police stations around south-east England.Connor is being held at a police station.
