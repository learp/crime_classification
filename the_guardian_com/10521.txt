The niece of the defence minister Quentin Davies was jailed tonight for 15 years after admitting stabbing a Frenchman to death after a drunken night out in Paris.Jessica Davies, 30, was sentenced at a court in Versailles for the murder of Olivier Mugnier, 24, an unemployed student.The court had heard how Davies met the man in a bar and then went with him to her flat in November 2007.She killed Mugnier after they had tried but failed to have sex. She was discovered naked and covered in blood at her flat in the Paris suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye after calling the emergency services.Paramedics found her kneeling Mugnier on the bed in the studio apartment and trying to stem the blood from a fatal 12cm (4.7in) knife wound to his neck.She allegedly told them: "It's me who did it. I don't know why, but I did it ... I am a monster. I just wanted to cut him a bit but it went in by itself," the nine-member jury at the court of assizes at Versailles was told.Analysis of Davies's blood showed she had taken a large amount of prescription drugs,. Combined with the alcohol – four times the legal driving limit in France – the drugs could have led to her being "aggressive", the court heard.
