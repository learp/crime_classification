Detectives investigating the disappearance of a baby more than 11 years ago have arrested two women on suspicion of murder.The investigation into the missing child born in Barnet, north London, in 2004 was launched after requests from local officers and the child abuse investigation team following a case review into the death of another child at an address in Barnet in 2015.The Metropolitan police said the case had been referred to its directorate of professional standards and also to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.A 50-year-old woman was arrested after officers attended a home in West Hendon, north London, at 7am on Monday, and later a 31-year-old woman was detained in Luton. Both were bailed to mid-July after being taken to a south London police station.Human remains thought to be those of a child, who police have not identified, were found during a search of the address on Tuesday, and the following day detectives rearrested the two women on suspicion of murder, as well as a 52-year-old man on suspicion of preventing a lawful and decent burial.The older woman has been bailed along with the man to mid-July, while the younger woman remains in police custody. A postmortem examination on the remains at Great Ormond Street hospital was inconclusive on the cause of death.A Met spokesman said: “Further tests will be undertaken and this could take a number of weeks. We will not speculate on the identity of the child until all further tests have concluded.“Given the circumstances which led to the launch of this investigation, officers from the directorate of professional standards have been informed. A referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission has been made.”Anyone with any information should contact the homicide and major crime command incident room on 020 8785 8099.
