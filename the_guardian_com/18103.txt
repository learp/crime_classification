Prisoners in Scotland could be electronically tagged after release under a plan to cut reoffending.The proposals would see the ex-convicts deemed most likely to reoffend tagged and monitored by a new "offender management" agency. The plan comes after figures revealed that 70% of prisoners in Scotland reoffend within four years of release. Civil liberties campaigners have condemned the idea and said it would breach human rights legislation.The Scottish justice minister, Cathy Jamieson, said at the weekend the policy was one of a range of measures being considered. The executive has already announced plans to tag children as young as 10 under a crackdown on anti-social behaviour. Ms Jamieson said: "It would give local communities much more confidence and might also give the judiciary more confidence if they felt there's a closer monitoring of people when they come back into the community."
