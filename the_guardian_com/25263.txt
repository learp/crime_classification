Large mapThe Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, today urged Londoners to "pull together" after four fatal stabbings within 24 hours across the capital.One of the dead was a 19-year-old man who became the 20th teenager to die in a violent attack in London this year.Gordon Brown described the latest spate of stabbings as "shocking and tragic", and said the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, would announce new measures to tackle knife crime on Monday.Later in the week, the first ever cross-government youth crime plan, including new enforcement measures and improvements to sentencing, will be published.It will also include a new approach to youth crime prevention including "tough parenting" programmes targeting the most problematic areas."The terrible stabbings that have occurred this week are shocking and tragic, and my thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have been hurt or killed in these attacks," Brown said."We will make it absolutely clear that carrying a knife is unacceptable in our country."The latest casualties died in unrelated incidents within two miles of each other.The Met's appeal for calm came as it emerged that another man had become the fifth victim of a serious knife attack in London over the last day.Calling for an end to the violence, Blair said: "There has been a tragic death toll from knife crime in London over a 24-hour period. "These attacks are not connected, nor do they all involve teenagers. Detectives have made arrests in three of the four murders. "I want to reassure the public that the MPS [Metropolitan police service] is doing everything possible, both in terms of thoroughly investigating each case and in continuing to carry out proactive operations, to get knives off the streets."He said the spate of attacks illustrated "the need for everyone to pull together to put an end to this unacceptable violence".The London mayor, Boris Johnson, said he would meet Smith to bring forward plans for investment in violence prevention work with the capital's teenagers.Johnson, who has been pushing for mandatory jail sentences for anyone caught carrying a knife, said he "deeply regretted" the four deaths yesterday."We need to do all we can to address the long-term complex root causes of violence as well as ensuring the police are providing an effective deterrent to those who carry knives and guns," he said."We are in this together, and we all need to take responsibility."The 19-year-old man who died yesterday was stabbed in a confrontation in a bedsit in Edmonton, north-east London, at about 2.30pm.Three hours later, in nearby Leyton, a 20-year-old Asian man died from a stab wound to his chest after a confrontation with a gang following a car crash.At around 8.30pm, a 22-year-old man was found with stab wounds to his head and chest in a street in Walthamstow, less than two miles away. He died an hour later.At 4am yesterday, the body of a man in his 40s was found with knife wounds behind a disused pub on Tottenham High Road.Police have not named any of the victims.The fifth man, who is in a critical condition, is in his late 20s. He was found by police in Brenthurst Road, Willesden, north-west London, with stab wounds to the back and stomach.Police said he was taken to a west London hospital. A 24-year-old woman was arrested at the scene.The 20-year-old man who died in Downsell Road, Leyton, was named locally as Adnan Patel.Detectives are investigating whether he was fleeing from the occupants of a van after being stabbed in an apparent road rage attack moments earlier.Paramedics were called as passers-by gave emergency first aid and tried to stem the bleeding, but the man died at the scene.Four people, who were arrested shortly after the attack, remained in custody at separate east London police stations.
