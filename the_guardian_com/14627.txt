Tony Blair today denied he had suffered a "Geoffrey Howe moment", as criticism from Charles Clarke continued to reverberate around Westminster.After his official spokesman had slapped down the ex-home secretary - saying Mr Blair had a "duty" to sack him over the foreign prisoners affair - the PM sweetened the pill slightly - saying he still had a "very great regard" for Mr Clarke.Speaking at a Downing Street reception for magazine editors, Mr Blair said there were "at least" three years remaining to the next general election and "what we should do is calm down, hold our nerve and get on with governing."Earlier today Number 10 responded swiftly after Mr Clarke had accused Mr Blair of lacking "purpose and direction".At the prime minister's official briefing his spokesman said the former home secretary was merely "express[ing] his disappointment" at being sacked.But he added: "It's sometimes the duty of prime ministers to decide when a department's in trouble, when it needs new leadership.Asked if he had suffered a "Geoffrey Howe moment", Mr Blair replied: "No".Responding to Mr Clarke's charge that the government was losing its sense of direction, Mr Blair said: "The fact is - whether it is health service reform, which some people may disagree with, schools reform, which some people may disagree with, energy policy, which obviously people do disagree with, pensions reform - across a whole range of issues, this is a government basically [whose] problems arise not from a lack of doing things. We are doing things. "People may disagree with the direction, but that we have a direction is very, very clear."This morning his official spokesman said it was "not surprising" Mr Clarke had not hidden his disappointment at being sacked.With two byelections - in Wales and London - later this week, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of "imploding" under the weight of the bitter row between the current and former home secretaries.Although the sacked cabinet minister insists Mr Blair should continue in office to fulfill last year's manifesto, today he publicly doubted whether the PM was too "damaged by recent events" to restore his authority.In response to Mr Clarke's attack on the home secretary, Mr Reid's official spokeswoman said: "The home secretary has the highest respect for Charles Clarke. But different home secretaries have different priorities."Mr Clarke's planned series of interviews - on the BBC and with the Times - is now at an end.In The Times today, Mr Clarke insisted that he wanted to see Mr Blair continue as PM until 2008.But he added: "I do think there is a sense of Tony having lost his sense of purpose and direction so my advice to him is to recover that sense of purpose and direction and that remains the best option."In another interview, broadcast this morning on BBC Radio 4's On The Ropes, Mr Clarke suggested that Mr Blair might not be able to recover his position."The best option would be for Tony to recover that leadership and authority and direction and to carry that through over a period of time, in my view," said Mr Clarke."Whether he is able to do that - because he has been damaged by recent events - whether he wants to do that, is not a matter for me, really."I simply observe there are a lot of doubts about it and I share some of those, that's true. But I still think that is the best way to go forward."At lunchtime Labour loyalist Stephen Pound, a parliamentary aide to Labour chairwoman Hazel Blears, said Mr Blair was the right person "more than anyone" to renew the party.However, Mr Pound warned that there was no appetite among Labour MPs for further major legislation, warning that it was "coming out of our ears". He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: "We have got a damn good body of legislation. I want to see that legislation work."Last night the shadow home secretary, David Davis, compared Mr Clarke's round of interviews to Geoffrey Howe's famous resignation speech,"It is a Blairite equivalent, a media-based equivalent, of what Geoffrey Howe did to Margaret Thatcher all those years ago," Mr Davis told the BBC.Lord Howe has declined to comment on the analogy, although there are several differences. Lord Howe had resigned rather than being sacked, and his statement was made to a packed House of Commons.The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said the government's reputation was "imploding", while Sir Menzies Campbell claimed it was "clear that the prime minister's authority is simply draining away".Tony Blair today responded to the criticism with a first-person piece in the Guardian, in which he acknowledged there was "genuine disappointment" with the government.But he fought back against recent criticism, arguing that further electoral success depended on the New Labour agenda."It is all a million miles from the last time a Labour government lost an election, after the cuts and chaos of the late 70s."
