Harold Shipman, the GP accused of murdering 15 women, calmly carried on treating patients while one of his alleged victims lay dead in his surgery, Preston crown court was told yesterday.Shipman treated three patients while the body of 63-year-old Ivy Lomas lay in a treatment room at his surgery in Market Street, Hyde, Greater Manchester. Detective Sergeant Philip Reade, who went to the surgery, told the jury: "He said he considered her such a nuisance he thought about having part of the seating area reserved permanently for Ivy." He was amazed, he said, when the doctor told him that he had not attempted to resuscitate Mrs Lomas. Carol Chapman, a receptionist at the surgery, said Shipman had seemed red and flushed when he emerged from a treatment room and said he was having trouble with a heart monitoring machine. After treating the other patients, he called Mrs Chapman into his room. "He told me he had tried to put Mrs Lomas on the ECG machine but he thought it wasn't working because he couldn't get a reading," she said. "He realised she had died." Shipman, 53, of Mottram, near Hyde, has denied murdering 15 patients and forging the will of Kathleen Grundy, one of his alleged victims. The case continues today.
