Schools and hospitals will be equipped with panic alarms and swipe card doorlocks to protect them from intruders and violent attacks on staff in pilot schemes starting next month prove effective.As part of the Â£4.6m Home Office pilot scheme Wylde Green primary school, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, will be fitted with some of the new anti-crime equipment, including doorlocks opened by Pins or swipe cards, improved lighting and fencing, and close circuit television. The school has recently been invaded by out-of-hours trespassers who have vandalised property, attempted burglary and threatened some staff. Eastbourne comprehensive, Darlington will also get the equipment next month. The two hospitals in the pilot scheme, Birmingham Heartlands and St Bartholomew's, Medway, Kent, will get the new equipment in December to help them deal with violent incidents in the accident and emergency units, as well as trespassers, criminal damage and drug abuse in the hospital grounds. Ambulance crews in Nottinghamshire are to be given protective clothing and alarms for their portable equipment to prevent theft. Hazel Blears, the Home Office minister for crime reduction, said that crimes against teachers, doctors and nurses were completely unacceptable. "They have a right to work in a safe and secure environment where they can teach children or treat patients who are also entitled to be protected," she added. She said the pilot schemes had been designed after consulting schools and hospital about what practical measures would help them. If they proved successful they would be applied nationally.
