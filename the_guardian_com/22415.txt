In a major U-turn the government has scrapped its plans to merge police forces in England and Wales, it announced today.The scheme to reduce the number of forces from 43 to about 28 was the brainchild of the former home secretary, Charles Clarke.However, the policing minister, Tony McNulty, said today that the plans to impose mergers had been "definitively" scrapped, after objections from most police forces and a failure to find ways to pay for the mergers."Enforced mergers are not on the agenda," he said. Only two forces had volunteered to merge, and that merger fell through because of financing problems.But news of the backtrack emerged in confused form, with Mr McNulty's speech this morning coming before Tony Blair, at PMQs, insisting the idea of mergers was "not off the agenda", but that to force them on unwilling forces would not be "sensible".The Tory leader, David Cameron, joked that after a year of tortured negotiations between the Home Office and the police, Mr Blair should be "charged with wasting police time".In a meeting of the Local Government Association in London today, Mr McNulty told police authority members that he wanted a new emphasis on collaboration between forces, although the government would reserve the power to enforce a merger.In his speech he said: "Are the mergers going to go through in one way or another eventually? I think the definitive answer to that is 'No'."Mr Clarke proposed the mergers because the largely rural Cambridgeshire police was perceived to have handled the Soham murders badly. He also argued that bigger regional forces would help fight terrorism and serious organised crime.However, no forces except Cumbria and Lancashire police agreed to merge, and that scheme fell through this week when the two local authorities failed to find a council tax formula to pay for the merged force.On becoming home secretary when Mr Clarke was sacked, John Reid put the proposals - already uncertain about how many merged forces there should be - out to further consultation until at least the autumn.Yesterday, in another blistering attack on his successor, Mr Clarke called the failure of the Cumbria/Lancashire merger "weak and dangerous" and said it would hamper counter-terrorism.Today Mr McNulty admitted that any police restructuring could take years to complete.He stressed that police forces had been asked to discuss with the Home Office alternative ways of dealing with shortcomings identified by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary."We have said 'Sit down with us and work out how that can happen, and how that can happen far more readily in the context of a wider police reform package, rather than it being some structural issue'," he said.Asked if there would be even one merger by the end of this parliament, the minister would only say: "We'll see."He added that the government should keep the power to force a merger at a future date "as an absolutely last resort." Yesterday - when speculation that the plans would be scrapped first circulated - the shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: "It is clear that the government has woken up to the folly of its own proposals to regionalise our police forces."The government's approach of putting it back to consultation can only have one sensible outcome, namely that we junk the 'one size fits all' approach to our police forces and pursue an intelligent, cooperative, resource-sharing approach to mending the gaps in protective services."The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, said: "Government ministers should listen afresh to alternative ideas which meet the same objective of allowing our police forces to pool resources and tackle serious crime."
