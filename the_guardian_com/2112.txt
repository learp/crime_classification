Police who launched a murder inquiry after a 21-month-old boy died at his home in London arrested his mother and a man yesterday then released the pair on bail the same morning.The boy, who has not been named, died on Monday. "The death is being investigated by the child abuse investigation command major investigation team based at East Ham," said a Met police spokeswoman. "It is being treated as murder."Yesterday the house at Bexleyheath, south London, where the family lived, was boarded up. Neighbours said police had spent the previous two days carrying out a fingertip search of the property."They arrived on Monday and arrested the mother and her boyfriend and they were here until last night, going over everything," said one woman, who would not give her name. "Then the council came and boarded up the windows and doors with metal shutters."The alarm was raised after a postmortem examination, at Great Ormond Street hospital, London, suggested the baby had died from multiple injuries.Neighbours said the woman concerned lived at the semi-detached house with her boyfriend, the baby and another son, who was seven or eight years old. "The mum was very private and not that friendly really," said one neighbour. "This has shaken the whole street."Yesterday a spokesman for Bexley council said the baby had not been on any of its "at risk" registers and was not known to social services. Police refused to confirm names of those involved in the case."A 29-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man were arrested on December 29 and were bailed," said a spokesman. "They were re-arrested on December 31 and bailed to return to a south London police station in February."
