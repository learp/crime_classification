The Valentine was sealed with an enticing lipstick kiss, but all Gary Williams got when he opened it was an ashtray in the head from his girlfriend.When the postman delivered the card last Valentine's day he had just been released from a 13-month sentence for burglary, the latest of 17 convictions dating back to 1980. The versatile criminal has a record which includes theft, handling stolen goods, affray, assault, threatening behaviour, criminal damage, shoplifting, deception and possessing ammunition without a certificate. Next month, he will go back to court but this time he will not be in the dock. Williams has won legal aid to apply for a high court judicial review against the sender of the Valentine - Sussex police. He is also claiming unspecified damages from the force, arguing that the card was malicious and caused him distress. He claims his girlfriend thought it was from another woman and clocked him with the ashtray. Officers in Brighton sent out 10 of the cards to known burglars and car criminals aged from 16-30 last year, complete with a lipstick "kiss" from a female crime intelligence ana lyst. At the time they said the billets doux were meant to be a light-hearted warning. A spokesman for Sussex police said: "I know it seems like justice gone mad, but it's true. We are being sued over this. There's nothing more I can say at this time." Des Turner, Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, said: "The Valentine's day stunt was a tasteless and stupid thing to do. Even if it was meant to be light-hearted I don't approve. It was a bullying joke and they should not have done it." He added: "It's not that I am supporting Mr Williams's claim. I don't think it has done him any harm and I don't think the courts will give him much in terms of restitution." The judicial review application is due to be heard at the high court in London on February 17 - three days after Valentine's day.
