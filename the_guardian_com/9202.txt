Two men have been arrested on suspicion of stabbing to death a bystander during Saturday's riot in Birmingham. West Midlands police said the suspects, aged 22 and 25 and both from Birmingham, had been detained in connection with the death of Isiah Young-Sam, 23, who was stabbed in the chest as he walked home along Carlyle Road, Lozells, with his younger brother and two friends. Saturday's disorder, which involved Asian and black youths, followed a meeting held at a local church to reassure the community about a rumoured sex attack.
