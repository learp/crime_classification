Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police triggered the 2011 riots across England, was holding a loaded gun when confronted by armed police who feared he was about to open fire, a jury has heard.Duggan was given the weapon just 15 minutes before he was shot, the trial of a man accused of passing him the gun was told.Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, denies selling or transferring a prohibited firearm, namely a BBM Bruni Model 92 handgun to Duggan.A jury at Snaresbrook crown court, heard the prosecution say that Duggan travelled in a taxi to pick up the weapon, but was being followed by undercover officers on 4 August 2011, the day he was killed.Opening the case, prosecutor Edward Brown QC said Duggan was followed by armed police as he collected the gun from Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London. As the vehicle Duggan was in reached Ferry Lane, Tottenham, north London officers decided to carry out a "hard stop"– that is force the vehicle to a halt.Brown said: "The armed police surrounded the cab but as Mr Duggan got out he was seen to have the gun in his hand."The police marksmen were in no doubt that this was as dangerous a position as possible – gun in hand, and he was seen to start to bring it round as if to shoot. The gun was found to be loaded with a bullet."Duggan was shot, Brown said, adding: "He fell to the ground fatally injured. From that moment until the ambulances and helicopter ambulance arrived they sought to resuscitate Mr Duggan but to no avail."Brown said a River Island shoe box in the back of the taxi had contained the gun, and had Duggan's prints on it. His fingerprints were on the inside of the base of the box and "thus is consistent with having opened the box to get to the gun", Brown said.The crown alleges that Duggan and Hutchinson-Foster exchanged four phone calls in the hour before the weapon was collected. During a four-minute stop in Leyton, Duggan was seen being handed the shoe box, the crown says.Brown said Hutchinson-Foster admitted using the same gun in an attack on a barber just six days previously.He beat Peter Osadebay using the gun at the Lagoon Salon on Kingsland Road, Dalston, east London, on 29 July 2011. Traces of Osadebay's blood were found on the gun when it was retrieved from Ferry Lane on 4 August, as was Hutchinson-Foster's DNA, the court heard.The shoebox was found in the minicab and had both Duggan's and the defendant's fingerprints on it, as well as those of Desire Cox, Hutchinson-Foster's girlfriend at the time. The gun was in a black sock with the toe end ripped to expose the barrel, and the heel open to expose the cocking lever at the back, Mr Brown said.Brown told the jury their task was to consider whether Hutchinson-Foster had supplied the weapon as the crown alleges, and not the rights or wrongs of the shooting of Duggan: "The death of Mr Duggan on 4 August last year has been regarded as the event that sparked the riots in north London, which then spread across London and then to other cities and which attracted widespread publicity in the United Kingdom and abroad."Let me say immediately there is one task in this trial that is not necessary for you the jury to confront – that is to decide one way or the other the rights and wrongs of the shooting of Mr Duggan."That is a task properly left to an inquest and the jury at that inquest who will examine this issue and likely far wider issues than those that you will be concerned with."The trial continues.
