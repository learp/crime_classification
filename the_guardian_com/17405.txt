Newquay touts itself as the UK's surf capital, a hip place for a holiday, but a senior judge yesterday dismissed it as a town to avoid if you are after a fun weekend.Sentencing two young visitors who attacked a pair of local people, Judge Jeffrey Rucker said: "I don't know if you've been to Newquay before, but in my view, attempting to have a fun weekend in Newquay is a contradiction in terms."Newquay, in north Cornwall, attracts surfers from around the world. The introduction of flights to the resort boosted visitor numbers and a branch of Jamie Oliver's restaurant, Fifteen, is to open in the town later this year. But some residents have been alarmed at the influx of young people who drink excessively and cause trouble.Judge Rucker, himself a water sports enthusiast even if he is not a Newquay fan, was told how Ross Harwood, 22, and Shaun Wheeler, 19, both from Basingstoke, Hampshire, "menaced" two local boys. Truro crown court heard that Wheeler punched one of the boys in the face outside the Safi Bunkhouse, a surfers' lodge, in the early hours in March last year. A third attacker, who was not traced, smashed a glass over the head of one of the victims.Harwood and Wheeler were ordered to pay Â£3,150, and sentenced to 200 hours' community service each. Both admitted affray and Harwood pleaded guilty to theft and possessing an offensive weapon.A local councillor, Paul Summers, admitted that such incidents were giving Newquay a bad name but insisted: "Newquay is a fabulous, fun place: I'd love to invite this judge to Newquay to the golf course for a round, and then a nice stroll across the Towan beach."
