Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by a police marksman in August 2011, had a history of involvement in gun crime and was part of a gang whose membership consisted of "48 of Europe's most violent criminals", a senior police officer has told an inquest.Duggan, 29, whose death triggered the worst riots in modern English history, had just two relatively minor criminal convictions, one for possession of cannabis and one for handling stolen goods. But Detective Chief Inspector Mick Foote painted a picture of Duggan as a serious player in the world of organised crime.Referring to the period from January 2011 to Duggan's death, Foote, the first witness to give evidence at the central London inquest, said: "Intelligence over that period and historically was a clear indication Mark Duggan was involved in gun crime."As well as gun crime, he was involved in supply of class A drugs and possession of ammunition – all of them very serious crimes."Foote was giving evidence about the four-day operation codenamed Dibri targeting six members, including Duggan, of the Tottenham Man Dem (TMD) gang, which contained "48 of Europe's most violent criminals". Duggan was described by Foote as one of the 48 "core" members of TMD but the officer said that in January 2011 Duggan had not been considered as "top of the priority list".Admitting that the intelligence varied in credibility, he said that police received reports in January and June 2011 that Duggan had fired shots and in June of that year that he was storing drugs at his home address and intended to take possession of a firearm.Police had not acted earlier to apprehend Duggan because they had "no specific intelligence" prior to 4 August – the day he was shot dead – Foote said.Confidential Metropolitan police documents shown to the jury said that TMD had been fighting with gangs from other areas, particularly the London Fields gang from neighbouring Hackney.Between them, the two gangs had been linked to 10 shootings and two murders since being put under surveillance in a covert operation in November 2008, the inquest heard.However, Foote said that by July of that year Duggan was considered, out of the six gang members targeted by Operation Dibri, "the most likely to obtain a firearm".Duggan was shot dead in north London after armed officers forced a cab he was travelling in to stop, following the receipt of intelligence that he had collected a gun. The gun, wrapped in a sock, was found on the other side of a fence three to six metres (10 to 20ft) away from where the fatally injured Duggan fell to the pavement. Foote said he was aware of allegations that a police informer, together with an officer, had come up with a scheme to plant a gun on Duggan but described them as "absolutely ridiculous". The inquest continues.
