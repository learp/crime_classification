The inquiry into the murder of Asian teenager Zahid Mubarek by a racist cell-mate will this week name at least two officials who have since been promoted and highlight a 'lack of accountability' over the killing, The Observer can reveal. Sources who have seen the report by Mr Justice Keith said it goes into detail about individual errors or oversights and criticises management failures.A major theme of the final report from the two-year inquiry, to be published on Thursday, is understood to be that a widespread focus on 'institutionalised racism' has resulted in a failure to recognise that actions by individuals at all levels contributed to Mubarek's death.The former Chief Inspector of Prisons, Lord Ramsbotham, yesterday denounced the way the incident was handled. He said that, instead of resisting an independent inquiry until ordered to hold one by the House of Lords, the government should have 'suspended a number of the relevant staff at once', including the people who had placed Mubarek in the same cell as a known racist. The officers responsible at Feltham young offenders' institution, west London, where the murder took place, should also have been suspended.Ramsbotham said the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw, should have empowered him to conduct an immediate, no-holds-barred inquiry.Having earlier issued stinging criticisms of Feltham, where Mubarek was murdered hours before he was to have been freed in 2000, Ramsbotham said: 'It was a tragedy waiting to happen.' He added: 'I find it totally extraordinary that no one has been made accountable.'Two of the people said to be named in the report - John Byrd, a prison governor who was also part-time race-relations liaison officer, and Feltham governor Niall Clifford - were promoted after the murder. In his evidence, Byrd said the need to juggle his race-liaison responsibilities with other duties had severely limited the attention he could give to race issues. During questioning, it was suggested that, even as full-time race officer, he may have been reluctant to accept the extent of racism at Feltham.In a sharp exchange, Mr Justice Keith challenged his focus during his part-time race role on compiling 'ethnic monitoring' statistics. 'Some people may say that [such a] number-crunching exercise, sitting behind a desk, is a substitute for putting the wet cloth around your head and thinking seriously, strategically about what needs to be done.Byrd rejected the idea that he had taken refuge in report-writing, but accepted that this had been his main focus, adding: 'At that time I do not think the amount of time I had allowed me to have carried out all that in-depth work.'The judge went on to say that even where ethnic-monitoring had thrown up 'areas of [racial] imbalance' in jail policies, 'I do not get a sense of anything being done in a consistent way.' He also questioned why 1997 race relations recommendations by the prison service appeared not to have been put in place until a year after Mubarek's murder.Clifford took over as Feltham's governor less than a year before the murder, with a brief to lead a three-year overhaul following Ramsbotham's call for changes. He left to take an area manager's post shortly afterward. During his appearance at the inquiry, it was suggested that by leaving, he had damaged prospects for reform at a 'dramatically failing institution', a suggestion he disputed.Ramsbotham said yesterday of Clifford's move: 'You don't promote people after something like that.'
