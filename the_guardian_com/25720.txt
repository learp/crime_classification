The jailed Premier League footballer Joey Barton was cleared yesterday of criminal damage. The Newcastle United midfielder, 25, was found not guilty at Liverpool magistrates court of vandalising a taxi after a night out in March last year.Barton was last week jailed for six months for admitting assault and affray in a separate incident linked to a drunken street brawl after a Boxing Day drinking binge. After being cleared on the new charges, he left court to return to prison at the end of the half-day hearing. The crown alleged that the player was with his cousin Joshua Wilson, 19, in the taxi in the early hours of March 4 when things turned nasty at a McDonald's in Liverpool. Prosecutor Robert Jansen said that when the driver, Michael Kay, refused to queue at a drive-through, Barton became aggressive. A row broke out, Kay refused to take the men on to their destination and Barton ripped out the driver's radio, it was claimed. But the fingerprints on the smashed screen were not Barton's and yesterday his cousin admitted in court that he had caused the damage. Kay claimed he said he would wait while the men ordered at a serving hatch but would not waste time in the vehicle queue. Stuart Driver QC, for Barton, said that when the men refused to get out, a "yellow one" call was made. It was understood as code, he said, for taxi drivers converging to deal with problematic passengers.
