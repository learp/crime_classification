Jack Straw, the justice secretary, has admitted that he has been surprised by the consequences of a policy designed to keep offenders in prison until they are deemed safe.His comments come after a high court judge said that government failings had led to the "disastrous" result that dangerous prisoners might have to be released because those sentenced to imprisonment for public protection (IPP) were not being granted access to rehabilitation programmes.Mr Straw conceded there were "funding issues" over providing courses for the treatment of offenders serving the open-ended IPP sentences.He told Channel 4 News last night that most IPP prisoners were on rehabilitation programmes, but there were problems with some who had been given short minimum tariffs. "One of the surprises in the use of this sentence is that, in many more cases than was anticipated, the actual tariff - the minimum to be served - is shorter than was anticipated," he said."That puts pressure on the prisons, and indeed on the prisoners, to complete their retraining and other programmes to change their offending behaviour. It's not so much of a problem where, as we anticipated, there was a reasonably long tariff imposed."At a hearing on Monday, Mr Justice Collins ordered that Brett James, an inmate at Doncaster prison serving an IPP sentence, should be released because his continued detention was unlawful. It was the third such ruling in recent weeks, but the judge postponed the decision pending an appeal on all three cases.The judge said: "Because of the failings of the government, a fairly large number of IPP prisoners are likely to be released if the court of appeal finds the detention is unlawful. This is very worrying."It must be recognised that the consequences are truly disastrous because I think it is inevitable that short-term lifers will have to be released whether or not they remain a risk to the public."The government responded by making a further Â£3m available over the next 18 months to ensure inmates could attend behavioural coursesMr Straw said: "We are working very hard to ensure that all appropriate programmes are in place for these prisoners.I'm not saying there is no funding issue, of course there are always funding issues and we could always do with more money."But a lot of extra money has gone in to these programmes to ensure that they are operating in a satisfactory way and some more money has been put in already."IPP sentences were introduced by David Blunkett when he was home secretary in 2005 to deal with violent and sex offenders. More than 3,000 prisoners have received IPP sentences since then and campaigners claim the policy has fuelled the prisons overcrowding crisis.The prison population last Friday stood at 80,693, with 64 prisoners being held in police cells.
