Victims of crime are being let down by under-pressure police officers, with forces botching investigations while doing well on preventing crime occurring in the first place.A report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found 18 out of 43 forces in England and Wales needed to improve investigations of offences.The annual assessment of policing found most forces were good at preventing crime and dealing with anti-social behaviour. But 18 forces needed to improve investigations, especially for burglary and assault. In part, said HMIC, this was because investigators lack experience and skills, and supervision.The report says that as a result of cuts officer numbers will fall to their lowest for a decade, to around 127,500, with neighbourhood policing suffering: “The already thin blue line in our communities is narrowing still further,” the report notes.Officer numbers are dropping as the nature of crime changes. The chief inspector of constabulary, Tom Winsor, said: “Although performing well in many respects, the police are falling behind the curve of rapidly changing criminality, policing the crimes of today with the methods of yesterday and insufficiently prepared for the crimes of the future.”HMIC said: “Basic investigative skills and victim care need to improve as do the capabilities of the police to tackle unreported crime such as cybercrime and child sexual exploitation.”Among forces that need to improve investigations were Britain’s biggest, the Metropolitan police, as well as Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire police.Only one force, Dyfed-Powys, successfully detected half the crimes it recorded, while only one other, Northumbria, detected over 40%. Detection rates for forces varied from 51% to 22%.The protection of the vulnerable and the need to get better at crime linked to technology emerge from the report as the biggest areas of concern.Winsor said virtually every crime was linked to technology and police were struggling to learn how to cope with it: “Almost all crime has a technological aspect to it now and the capability to deal with this cannot therefore be the prerogative of the specialist officer; every officer needs an understanding of it and the capabilities to deal with the cybercrime they encounter.”The report expands on this saying technology plays a part in “the means by which the crime is committed, a source of valuable evidence to trace the offender, or a source of intelligence better to understand the threat.“As people have moved their communications and shopping online, they have done the same with their insults, threats and abuse, often using social media.”Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive at Victim Support, said: “Each mistake by the police represents a lost chance for a crime victim to get justice and support. The rights the government set out for victims are meaningless unless they are recognised, respected and upheld by everyone responsible for tackling crime.”The report said too many victims of domestic abuse felt let down. There had been improvements but the response was patchy and some officers had displayed poor behaviour even in front of inspectors: “The majority [of domestic abuse victims] reported that they had at some point experienced poor attitudes from responding officers. Victims told HMIC that they were frequently not taken seriously, that they felt judged unfairly and that some officers demonstrated a considerable lack of empathy and understanding. HMIC also observed some of these behaviours during inspections.”The report finds confidence in the police is high compared with other institutions, though lower among ethnic minority Britons.It comes against a background of falling official crime figures but also of more cuts to police funding in the next parliament with 34,000 more jobs under threat and police chiefs privately fearing the service may not be able to cope.Jack Dromey MP, shadow policing minister, pinned some of the failings on the cuts: “This report is very worrying – it is just not good enough for half of police forces to be rated less than ‘good’ at investigating crime. Theresa May cannot expect to cut 16,000 police officers and still deliver the highest standards of policing the public want and deserve.”Steve White, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said most detectives in a survey it carried out felt workload pressures were the main reason victims were let down: “We have been warning there are issues around what the service can provide against cuts to funding and police numbers … We know that officers are struggling to provide the service they believe the public deserve.”HMIC’s report provides some support for this view: “Crimes are now being investigated by officers who also respond to calls for service from the public or provide neighbourhood policing services such as patrols, some of whom have not investigated crimes for a number of years.”
