Harry Redknapp lost £250,000 in a bid to save his friend's management job at Oxford United, a court heard on Friday. In interviews played out at Southwark crown court, the Tottenham Hotspur manager said Jim Smith had approached him regarding an American takeover bid at the club, suggesting the money could help keep him in a job.Mr Smith said a "mega-rich young boy" had 40 hours to complete the deal, Redknapp told police in 2009. The court heard Redknapp tell officers that the money had disappeared during the bid "18 to 20 months ago". He added: "He did not buy the club – that's the way I am."Redknapp also told police: "We are givers not takers," as he said "I don't need" to dodge a £30,000 tax bill. He claimed he wrote the Monaco account at the heart of a £189,000 bung allegation "completely out of my life".Redknapp told officers: "I have not purposely gone out to try to avoid paying income tax."He added: "I have brought up a fantastic family. To try and nick a few quid off the income tax … Why? I am not into that. I don't need that. I would rather give you a hundred grand than nick a few quid off you. That's how I live. I have got a golf day tomorrow … I give 15,000 tomorrow to Leukaemia Busters."Redknapp said Mr Smith had asked him over the phone for the Oxford United cash. Mr Smith is said to have told Redknapp the "mega-rich young boy" – Nick Merry, who used to play for Oxford – had come over and was "about to buy the club".But he only had 48 hours to complete the deal and could not get the £250,000 he needed in time, so Mr Smith asked Redknapp if he could lend him the money."I said: 'Jim, what's it got to do with me?'" Redknapp recalled. "He said: 'Harry … it'll help me, I'm the manager. If he buys it I've got a job still.'"I lend him £250,000, I ring up the bank and said: 'Look, I said, Jim's said you've got the money in five days, Harry. You've got my word' – that's 20 months ago and the guy didn't buy the club and that's how I am. I can tell you 10 stories like that."Both Redknapp, 64, of Poole, Dorset, and Milan Mandaric, from Oadby, Leicestershire, deny two counts of cheating the public revenue when Redknapp was manager of Portsmouth Football Club.The first charge of cheating the public revenue alleges that between 1 April 2002 and 28 November 2007 Mandaric paid $145,000 (£93,100) into the account.The second charge for the same offence relates to a sum of $150,000 US dollars (£96,300) allegedly paid between 1 May 2004 and 28 November 2007.
