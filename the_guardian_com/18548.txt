Police said yesterday that they would be conducting a new inquiry into a late abortion carried out on a woman who did not want a baby with a cleft lip and palate.The decision by West Mercia police follows a judicial review of the case sought by the Rev Joanna Jepson, who was born with a severe facial deformity. She believes that the doctors involved in the operation should be prosecuted. A spokesman confirmed that Acting Detective Chief Superintendent Ray Groves had been appointed to lead the new inquiry. Mr Groves said: "We will approach this investigation with an open mind and interview all people associated with this case. Our renewed investigation into this sensitive matter will be carried out with due regard to all the parties involved and in the interests of openness and public confidence in the criminal justice system." Ms Jepson, 27, a curate at St Michael's church, Chester, said she intended to continue with the judicial review to allow abortion law to be clarified. "It is extremely encouraging to hear that West Mercia police have decided to reinvestigate. Their action affirms the value of this baby's life as well as the wider public and legal importance for this issue to be addressed." The next hearing for the judicial review is expected to take place at the high court next month. Ms Jepson won permission late last year to challenge the refusal of police to bring charges against doctors who carried out the abortion. Her lawyers have argued that there should have been further investigations with a view to prosecution because an abortion could never be justified under the 1967 Abortion Act on the basis that a cleft lip and palate were a "serious handicap".Speaking in December, Ms Jepson said: "My teenage years were difficult due to facial abnormality. "I also have a brother with Down's syndrome. We both live positive and fulfilling lives."
