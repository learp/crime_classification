Protest by local residents, backed by the News of the World and their Tory MP, yesterday forced the closure of Europe's only clinic to provide intensive residential treatment of child sex offenders.The Wolvercote Clinic, run by the child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, is to close on July 31 after seven years during which it has effectively treated and assessed 300 men. The Home Office said yesterday that since the clinic, which is based at Horton hospital, Epsom, Surrey, opened in 1995, no local child had been put at risk. The clinic was due to move from Horton hospital because of redevelopment to a site at Silverlands, near Chertsey, Surrey, but protests from local parents highlighted by the News of the World has blocked that option. The Home Office minister, Hilary Benn, announced yesterday that the Silverlands option was closed and the remaining nine residents would complete their treatment outside Surrey. Hilary Eldridge, director of the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said: "It is with great regret that we have had to close Wolvercote without a designated site for relocation." Paul Cavadino of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said Wolvercote was a "centre for excellence for rehabilitation and preventing reoffending". He said its closure was a blow to public safety. But the Conservative MP for Runnymede and Weybridge, Phil Hammond, said he was delighted the clinic would not be moved to the Silverlands site in his constituency. The Home Office said that research had shown that Wolvercote was effective in reducing the risk to children. The News of the World campaigned against its relocation to Silverlands on the grounds that the site was six miles from the home of the parents of Sarah Payne, the eight-year-old girl murdered two years ago.
