The number of violent attacks on Jewish people in the UK last year reached the highest level since records began in 1984, new figures showed today.But the Community Security Trust said the overall number of "antisemitic race hate incidents" – defined as malicious acts against the Jewish community – fell by 8% from the record level seen in 2006.The trust, which styles itself as a "the Jewish community's only defence organisation", said the fall may be due to a lack of "trigger events" during 2007 which typically lead to temporary spikes.In 2006, the war between Israel and Hizbollah in Lebanon led to the highest recorded number of anti-semitic incidents in the UK, the report said. Overall, in 2007 there were a record 114 violent assaults, one of which resulted in life-threatening injuries, among 547 race hate incidents against the Jewish community.However, the CST warned the decrease from 594 such incidents the previous year did not alter the long-term trend of rising levels since the late 1990s. The remainder of the 547 race hate incidents included 328 cases of abusive behaviour, 62 acts of damage and desecration of Jewish property, 24 threats and 19 cases of mass-produced antisemitic literature.CST spokesman Mark Gardner said: "The fall in the number of antisemitic incidents is very welcome, but is less than we had hoped for. "2007 was still the second worst year on record and the worst ever for violent assaults. Over the past decade there has been a significant rise in the basic level of antisemitic incidents in our society, and it is affecting the lives of far too many British Jews."A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "While we welcome the fall in the overall number of antisemitic incidents in 2007, the wider findings from the Community Security Trust's report are of concern to the government and serve as a reminder to us all that we still have more to do to eradicate antisemitism from our society."Antisemitism must be understood for what it is - and condemned. It should be dealt with promptly and effectively through the law. "We have one of the strongest legal frameworks in the world to protect people from discrimination or persecution on the grounds of their faith or race, and this was strengthened by the introduction of the Racial and Religious Hatred Act last year."
