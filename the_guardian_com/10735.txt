Evidence of head injuries is unlikely to be sufficient on its own to charge someone with homicide, attempted murder or assault of young children, the Crown Prosecution Service said today.Updated guidance on whether to prosecute in cases of what used to be known as shaken baby syndrome, and is now called non-accidental head injury, or NAHI, says that although medical evidence of intercranial injuries is crucial, other non-medical facts are important. These might include a history of violence towards children, previous atypical hospital visits of a dead child or siblings, a history of domestic, alcohol or drug abuse and conflicting accounts of what happened.But the CPS also said that prosecutors should continue to resist defence challenges that the three injuries associated with NAHI – bleeding into the lining of the eyes, bleeding beneath the brain's dural membrane, and damage to the brain that affected function – might be explained by lack of oxygen, infection or raised intercranial pressure.The guidance updates were issued five years ago following concerns over the evidence of paediatrician Roy Meadow in the prosecution of Angela Cannings, as well as other high profile cases in which it was later decided mothers had been wrongly convicted of child murder. It includes lessons the CPS takes from recent court of appeal and high court decisions.Karen Squibb-Williams, a senior policy adviser at the CPS, said: "These are complex and sensitive cases … The guidance makes clear that it is unlikely a charge for a homicide or attempted murder or assualt could be justified where the only evidence is the triad of injuries."In cases where the three injuries were found, "the prosecutor will always consider all the surrounding circumstances and the evidence in each case before reaching a decision".However, prosecutors should also challenge defence experts' attempts to explain the injuries by other medical factors, an accidental short distance fall or as the result of a birthing injury. "It is important for prosecutors to know that the court of appeal has not endorsed the theory challenging the triad and rejected it as recently as July 2010."Each case will have its own individual facts and very careful consideration will be given to deciding whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and then whether it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution."Prosecution guidance was first issued as a result of the legal debate that followed the appeal court's 2003 freeing of Cannings, who had been imprisoned for life for the murder of her two baby sons. The convictions were ruled unsafe, but opened arguments over what weight ought to be given to the evidence of expert witnesses in such cases.
