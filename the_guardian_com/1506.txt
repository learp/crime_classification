A third man was arrested today in connection with the murder of seven-year-old Toni-Ann Byfield, police said.The 30-year-old man was arrested in south London on suspicion of the murders of the schoolgirl and her convicted drug dealer father, Bertram, Scotland Yard said. He remained in custody in a north London police station. Detectives had already been holding a 31-year-old man and a 22-year-old man in connection with the murders after arrests at addresses on Merseyside and in north-west London yesterday. The 22-year-old was today bailed to return to a north London police station in November, but the 31-year-old remained in custody. A 28-year-old woman arrested on Merseyside yesterday on suspicion of assisting an offender and being concerned with the supply of class A drugs also remained in custody. Five people had previously been arrested in the inquiry into the killing of Toni-Ann and her father in September 2003, but all were released without charge. It was thought Byfield was killed because of a drug debt and his daughter murdered so she could not identify the gunman. At the time of her death, she had been in the care of Birmingham social services and had been placed with a foster family in the city. However, when the family went on holiday, care workers placed Toni-Ann in London with a girlfriend of Byfield. Following the double murder, it emerged that Byfield was not Toni-Ann's natural father. A Â£25,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those involved in the killings.
