Criminals released early from prison because of the overcrowding crisis have committed 56 offences in just over a month, the ministry of justice said today.The programme, launched on June 29, introduced a presumption in favour of early release for prisoners serving between four weeks and four years for the final 18 days of their sentence, subject to certain criteria.Eight offences were committed in the first week and new figures released today reveal a further 48 crimes were committed by 35 parolees between July 6 and July 31.They also show that 43 offenders are on the run after failing to meet the terms of the emergency measures.The authorities have tried to recall 126 prisoners since the scheme began on June 29 but only 83 have been traced and put back behind bars.In total, 3,382 prisoners have been released since the start of the scheme.If the total for the first month was replicated for a year, the scheme would see 46,000 prisoners freed early - far higher than the government's annual prediction of 25,500.Today's figures mean that 703 inmates convicted of violence against the person have been freed, as have 78 robbers and 359 burglars.Among them was a male sex offender who was released by mistake and later recalled to jail.A woman convicted of a sex trafficking offence was also let out.
