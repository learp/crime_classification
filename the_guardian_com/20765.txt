Detectives today arrested a man in connection with the murder of a Pakistani politician who was in exile in London .The man is believed to have had business links with Dr Imran Farooq, who was beaten and stabbed near his home in Edgware, north London, in September. Detectives are thought to be investigating the political affiliations of the suspect, a 34-year-old Pakistani national.Farooq, 50, had been a leading member of Pakistan's Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) party, but had been less active in politics since the birth of his sons, now aged five and three.Farooq was attacked on his way home from his job at a chemist's shop. He was found near his home after neighbours witnessed what they believed was a fight.Farooq, who was married with two young sons, claimed UK asylum in 1999 alongside Altaf Hussain, the MQM's leader. Hussain, who also lives in exile in London, has said "enemies of the MQM" killed Farooq and they would try to kill him.While Hussain is protected by private guards and rarely appears in public following death threats, colleagues said Farooq never believed he was at risk.Detectives still want to trace two men of Asian appearance seen in the area of the murder. They have recovered a kitchen knife and a brick used in the attack.Before entering the UK, Farooq spent seven years on the run in Pakistan from criminal charges while the MQM was engaged in a battle for control of Karachi.Detectives from Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command took over the murder investigation because of the strong possibility of a political motivation to the killing.Farooq's widow Shumaila Imran, 42, said the death of the "dedicated family man" had left her and others in "shock and disbelief".The murder triggered violent unrest in Karachi, the MQM's stronghold, , with further clashes whenFarooq he was buried in November.
