A top MI5 officer has told the inquests into the 7 July bombings that every member of the security services had profound regrets about the 2005 attacks, in which 52 people were killed and hundreds injured, but rejected suggestions of any significant intelligence failure.The officer, chief of staff to the director general of MI5 Jonathan Evans but identified in court only as Witness G, told the inquests that MI5 had "no inkling of what was to befall London". It would, he agreed, be "nonsensical and offensive" to suggest the Security Service had failed to take steps to prevent an attack that it suspected was being planned.Questioned by Hugo Keith QC, counsel to the inquests, Witness G conceded that with hindsight more could have been done to identify Mohammed Siddique Khan, the ringleader, as a serious threat, given the links connecting him to known extremists before 2005.After the attacks, attention focused on surveillance material of the leaders of the "Crevice" fertiliser bomb plot in early 2004, connecting the leader of that failed plot, Omar Khyam, to two of the July 7 bombers, Khan and Shehzad Tanweer. The two were not identified until after the 7 July bombings.Keith asked about seven or eight incidents in which Khan's name – or cars or addresses linked to him – had arisen in surveillance or other intelligence work, without connections being drawn that identified him as a threat.Witness G said that, thanks to a significant increase in resources and personnel, "I certainly think things have improved substantially since then."Keith asked: "The public is concerned to know that the current system would address this kind of issue. Would it now raise a red flag?"Witness G replied: "Much depends on the name."Keith said research had found that Siddique Khan was not a particularly common name, particularly in Batley, "but there are plenty of Siddique Khans on our system".Asked if computer systems today allowed the service to cross-refer information between their databases and those of West Yorkshire police, Witness G said: "It might do."Keith also asked about a photograph, originally showing Khan and Tanweer, which was shown to an informant in US custody, Mohammed Junaid Babar, in April 2004. Khan had been cropped from the photograph shown to the informant, said Keith, and Babar failed to identify Tanweer as one of the men he had seen in a training camp in Pakistan."The judgment was that the cropped [part of the] photograph was of such poor quality it was not worth showing," said Witness G, adding: "We just don't know why he wasn't able to identify Tanweer."MI5 now has a much better understanding of the "close link" between terrorist training and attack planning, Witness G said. Asked if insufficient regard had been paid to the ease with which groups or individuals made the progression from being extremist sympathisers to active plotters, he said: "Yes, I think that is fair."Lady Justice Hallett, the coroner, had excluded members of the press and public from the court, and only the witness's words were relayed to an annex.After legal representations, bereaved family members were permitted in court, but were forbidden by the coroner from disclosing any information relating to the witness's appearance.Witness G repeatedly said that since a spending review in 2004, leading to a significant increase in funding, MI5 had developed better systems, including a "legacy review" that enabled it to analyse leads from closed investigations for any potential links to live plots. But he said limited resources meant this would always have a lower priority than plots deemed to present a more pressing threat.He also said that the service's relationship with regional police forces had greatly improved since the bombings. MI5 has previously denied withholding information on the bombers from West Yorkshire police, which had identified connections between a "Siddique Khan" and known extremists.Between 2001 and 2005, G said, the number of "primary investigation targets" relating to Islamist terrorist threats to the UK had risen from 250 to more than 800, a figure that had seen a "substantial increase" in the years since the attacks.MI5 has always insisted that at the point when Khan and Tanweer were seen meeting the Crevice plotters in February 2004, they had not yet made plans to carry out a terrorist attack, and did not do so until after they went to Pakistan in early 2005. They were not identified until after their suicide attacks.
