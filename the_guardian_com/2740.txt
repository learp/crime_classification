The Glasgow flanker Ryan Wilson has been suspended without pay for three months after being found guilty of assault.However, the 25-year-old could still feature in the World Cup after the Scottish Rugby Union announced he would be banned from international duty until 23 August – clearing him to play in the tournament, which kicks-off four weeks later.Wilson was fined £750 after he attacked two men in a fast-food shop. Charges against Warriors team-mates Ryan Grant and Rory Hughes were not proven.After being brought before a three-man disciplinary panel, Wilson was told he had been “suspended with immediate effect, without pay, from training with, and playing for, Glasgow Warriors for a period of three months”.The forward, who has nine caps, had earlier told his trial at Glasgow sheriff court that he had already been fined a week’s wages. His latest punishment will cost him about £25,000.Wilson has also been ordered by SRU chiefs to take part in a programme that will “support his personal development around the factors which contributed to the original conviction”. Although it has been made clear he does not have problems with drinking, it is understood that an element of that scheme will focus on alcohol awareness.Wilson could still feature for Scotland at this year’s World Cup after the disciplinary panel ruled he “will not be invited to play for the Scotland national team until 23 August”.He will miss the entire Six Nations, which begins for the Scots in Paris on Saturday, as well as the World Cup warm-up clashes Ireland and Italy on 15 August and 22 August. He may, however, be allowed to train with Vern Cotter’s squad before the tournament, but only after the Six Nations has been completed.A spokesman for the SRU said: “In accordance with Scottish Rugby’s standard disciplinary procedures Ryan Wilson has the right to appeal against the panel’s findings. Scottish Rugby will make no further comment at this time.”
