A 15-year-old schoolboy was gunned down in a park by "gangsters" because he refused to join their group, an inquest heard today.Jessie James was shot three times as he cycled through Manchester's Moss Side district in the early hours of September 9 last year.The inquest also heard that an off-duty police officer went back to sleep without alerting his colleagues after being woken by a member of the public who claimed to have witnessed the shooting.Today Jessie's mother, Barbara Reid, told of her pride in her son for standing up to the thugs who repeatedly tried to force him to join their gang."Jessie was cornered, pointed out and intimidated at every opportunity. He was coerced and compelled to join the gang," she said."Time and time again up until his death, Jessie humiliated the gangsters to their face by saying no to the gang."He said: 'I don't want to be, I don't want to join the gang. All I want to be is Jessie and be everyone's friend'. This infuriated the gang and because they could not stand Jessie, Jessie's rejection, they killed him."I am told Jessie showed incredible strength when challenged by the gangsters who took his life because they could not stand a 15-year-old boy's rejection."Ms Reid's evidence came on the second day of the inquest into Jessie's death, which is being held amid tight security at Manchester crown court.Many of the witnesses have given evidence from a remote location by video link. Their images have been obscured by curtains and their voices electronically distorted.The special measures have been taken in the hope the hearing will help break down the wall of silence surrounding the murder. Detectives believe people in the Moss Side community know who the gunman is but are too frightened to speak out.Ms Reid told the coroner, Nigel Meadows, that her son was shot repeatedly and "left to die alone like an animal". She added: "Jessie was brought up in the church, he knows right from wrong, he had a choice, he took that choice and now he's dead. His disrespecting the gang, that's all this is."Ms Reid, who described her son as a "charmer" with a "heart of gold", said she would never get over his death."There will always be an empty void in my heart. Jessie was snatched away from me without me saying goodbye," she said.Earlier, the inquest heard how the off-duty police officer, known only as officer A, was woken in the middle of the night by a phone call from a member of the public known as witness A.The witness, who made the call from his mobile phone, told the detective how he had seen pistol muzzle flashes and a shadow slump to the ground, the court heard.But Officer A denied being given this description, describing witness A's account of events as "vague"."If [the witness] had said to me anything about witnessing a shooting or somebody being injured or killed I would have called the duty inspector," he said.Speaking via a video link from behind a screen and with his voice distorted, the police officer told the court he had been woken after taking medication for a chest infection. The drugs had left him drowsy and affected his judgment, the officer said.The court also heard how a police patrol stopped for a "disturbance" at a nearby sports club 15 minutes after the shooting but left after discovering nothing untoward.Despite several eyewitnesses hearing gunshots and seeing muzzle flashes, the first 999 call reporting the shooting occurred an hour-and-a-half after the attack. A short time later police discovered Jessie's body lying beside his mountain bike.The inquest continues.
