Burglaries in Liverpool dropped by a third when gates were installed to seal off the alleys behind terrace houses, according to a study.As the city installed its 4,000th gate yesterday, the University of Liverpool's environmental criminology research unit published its study estimating that a total of 727 burglaries were prevented over the year, each saving an estimated Â£2,300. Burglary rates were reduced for up to a kilometre away. Other benefits are a fall in vandalism and fly-tipping. "This study shows that alley gates are beating burglary and anti-social behaviour," said Flo Clucas, executive member for housing on the city council. "We now have scientific proof that alley gates reduce crime and fear of crime." With 45% of its terraces protected, Liverpool has become the UK's second safest city and is promoted by the Home Office as a example. According to the study, residents - who have keys to the gates - take a new pride in their environment. Steven Merrall, senior research associate at the unit, said: "This is a crime prevention scheme that works. By lowering the crime rate it also improves the desirability of an area and will no doubt have a knock-on effect on the value of properties."
