Ed Miliband has called for Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News International, to "consider her position" and called for a public inquiry after it emerged the News of the World hacked into Milly Dowler's mobile phone while Brooks was editor.It comes after David Cameron described the hacking as a "truly dreadful act" and urged police to "pursue this in the most vigorous way".Police were due to meet with senior executives from News International on Tuesday morning, according to reports, with Brooks's role coming under increasing scrutiny. The current News International chief executive has insisted she would not resign.Miliband joined the Labour shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, in calling for a public inquiry into the Guardian's revelations that Milly Dowler's mobile phone was repeatedly targeted by the News of the World.The Labour leader said Brooks should "consider her conscience and consider her position", as pressure mounts on the News International chief executive.Miliband said the latest revelations in the News of the World phone-hacking saga were a "stain" on news reporting in the country. He added that the hacking "represents one of the darkest days in British journalism".Earlier Cameron, who is visiting British troops in Afghanistan, had said of the Guardian's revelation that the News of the World illegally targeted Milly Dowler and her family: "If they are true this is a truly dreadful act and a truly dreadful situation."What I've read in the papers is quite shocking, that someone could do this knowing that the police were trying to find this person and find out what happened."There is a police investigation into hacking allegations ... they should investigate this without any fear, without any favour, without any worry about where the evidence should lead them."They should pursue this in the most vigorous way that they can in order to get to the truth of what happened."That is the absolute priority as a police investigation."The home secretary, Theresa May, said news of the hacking was "truly shocking", and said it "should be investigated with great vigour".Keith Vaz told the BBC that the home affairs select committee would ask May whether there is any evidence of hacking in the Soham murders or any other cases.The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, whose force is accused of not investigating phone hacking properly in the first place, said on Tuesday his sympathies were with Milly Dowler's family."My heart goes out to the Dowler family. Whose heart wouldn't with the additional distress this must have caused them," Stephenson told BBC London."I have to be very careful to say nothing that could prejudice our live investigation but if it is proved to be true, then irrespective of the legality or illegality of it, I'm not sure there is anyone who wouldn't be appalled and repulsed by such behaviour."The BBC reported that police were to meet News of the World executives at 9.30am on Tuesday to discuss the phone hacking, although the Met police would not confirm the meeting.The BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, wrote on his blog that Brooks "is not planning to resign". Brooks was editor of the News of the World when the hacking took place, with Andy Coulson as her deputy. Coulson resigned as the prime minister's media adviser in January.Peston quoted a News International executive as saying Rupert Murdoch "is backing [Brooks] 100%".Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott  said on Twitter that he would write to the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, demanding he block News Corp's bid to take full control of pay-TV company BSkyB following the revelations about Dowler.However, John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone hacking at the News of the World should not taint the rest of Rupert Murdoch's empire."You cannot necessarily condemn the entire of News Corp just because of the actions of some individuals in another part of the organisation," he said."News International is a part of News Corp but it's a different part. News Corp is a global enterprise and I don't think one should condemn the entire organisation because something very clearly was going wrong in the News of the World."When Today presenter Evan Davies pointed out to the Conservative MP that News International had denied wrongdoings at the News of the World despite having evidence that could suggest hacking was ongoing, Whittingdale responded: "Well, they denied it to my committee."He added: "We were told that a thorough investigation had been carried out which had produced no evidence. Now, even at that time we expressed considerable doubts as to whether or not that investigation was thorough."I think now we can almost certainly conclude that it wasn't, and those are questions which still need to be addressed."Labour has already called for an independent inquiry into journalistic practices at the newspaper.Yvette Cooper said the newspaper's actions were "despicable" and called for a wide-ranging inquiry."Everyone across the country will be deeply disturbed and horrified at this shocking news," she said."The idea that private investigators working for a newspaper would hack into the phone of a missing 13-year-old girl is truly despicable."Labour MP Tom Watson called on Monday for the prime minister to act, but also laid some of the blame on his own party leader."Surely now we should hear from David Cameron and Ed Miliband," Watson said. "It's utterly disgraceful that they've let this scandal run on for as long as it has. No more cowardice – we want action."Miliband had said he was "shocked by the news of the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone".He added: "It beggars belief that anyone would undertake such a cruel and immoral act."The police inquiry must get to the bottom of who was responsible for this and who was complicit in it."Detectives from Scotland Yard's inquiry into phone hacking, Operation Weeting, are believed to have found evidence of the targeting of the Dowlers in a collection of 11,000 pages of notes kept by Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator jailed for phone hacking on behalf of the News of the World.In the last four weeks, Met officers have approached Surrey police and taken formal statements from some of those involved in the original inquiry, who were concerned about how News of the World journalists intercepted – and deleted – the voicemail messages of Milly Dowler.The messages were deleted by journalists in the first few days after Milly's disappearance to free up space for more messages. As a result friends and relatives of Milly concluded wrongly she might still be alive [see footnote]. Police also feared evidence may have been destroyed.• The following was published on 12 December 2011 in the corrections and clarifications column: An article about the investigation into the abduction and death of Milly Dowler (News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone during police hunt, 5 July, page 1) stated that voicemail "messages were deleted by [NoW] journalists in the first few days after Milly's disappearance in order to free up space for more messages. As a result friends and relatives of Milly concluded wrongly that she might still be alive." Since this story was published new evidence – as reported in the Guardian of 10 December – has led the Metropolitan police to believe that this was unlikely to have been correct and that while the News of the World hacked Milly Dowler's phone the newspaper is unlikely to have been responsible for the deletion of a set of voicemails from the phone that caused her parents to have false hopes that she was alive, according to a Metropolitan police statement made to the Leveson inquiry on 12 December.
