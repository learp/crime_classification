A Royal Navy sailor has appeared in court accused of the murder of a colleague and the attempted murders of three other crew on board a nuclear submarine.Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donovan, 22, of Dartford, Kent, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address during the short hearing at Southampton magistrates court.Donovan has been charged with the murder of Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, 36, who was fatally shot on board HMS Astute while it was docked in Southampton on Friday.He has also been charged with the attempted murders of Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37, and Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge, 45.Donovan was remanded in custody to appear at Winchester crown court on 13 April.Cases involving service personnel accused of serious offences, including murder, manslaughter and rape, have to be tried in civilian courts if committed within the UK as military courts have no jurisdiction, said defence officials, reflecting armed forces law. However, there is discretion when the alleged crime takes place within a military base or on a British warship.Defence sources with first-hand experience of criminal activities say that Royal Navy ships at sea could be regarded as British territory.Nick Hawkins, prosecuting, said the case could have been handled internally by the armed forces but it had been agreed that the case would be heard in the civilian courts."Because the defendant is a serviceman he also falls under the jurisdiction of the armed forces," he told the court.Hawkins, the chief prosecutor for Hampshire crown prosecution service, added: "The armed forces do have jurisdiction but during the course of the weekend I had discussions with the director of service prosecutions and we are in agreement this case is properly to be tried in the civilian courts and therefore should be dealt with no differently to any other murder or attempted murder cases that appear before your court."Defence sources said this did not preclude the navy conducting its own investigation into the incident. This is already under way and is likely to examine Donovan's recruitment and career as well as procedures covering the handling of disputes and of weapons handling on board ships and submarines.Submariners in the navy are all volunteers and receive extra training before they are accepted. Defence sources said they did not receive any special psychological profiling.Members of the British armed forces are more likely to be tried in a military court martial, rather than civilian courts, if they are accused of criminal acts while on operations.Soldiers involved in the abuse and mistreatment of Iraqi detainees – and in at least one case, that of the Iraqi hotel worker Baha Mousa, death – have been tried by a court martial.Molyneux's widow, Gillian, described the father of four from Wigan as "utterly devoted to his family"."Everything he did was for us. He was very proud to be an officer in the Royal Navy submarine service."The shootings took place as local dignitaries, including the city council's mayor, chief executive and leader, were being given a tour of the submarine while it was berthed at the Eastern Docks on an official five-day visit to the city.HMS Astute was cleared to leave Southampton on Monday afternoon to return to its base at Faslane, Scotland.
