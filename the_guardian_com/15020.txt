The parents of the missing British girl Madeleine McCann today released the last known photograph of their daughter before her abduction in the Algarve three weeks ago.Smiling and dangling her feet in a swimming pool, four-year-old Madeleine is shown wearing a pink smock top, white shorts and a sun hat less than eight hours before she was apparently snatched from her bed.The picture also shows her father Gerry McCann sitting with his two daughters by his side. Next to him in an orange top is his two-year-old daughter Amelie who is a twin with brother Sean.The picture was taken by Madeleine's mother Kate at 2.29pm on May 3. Less than eight hours later, before 10pm that night, Madeleine had disappeared.The girl had been sleeping in the family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, next to her twin siblings, when she was taken. At the time of the abduction, Mr and Mrs McCann were having dinner at a restaurant just yards from their children.Madeleine's disappearance has been publicised around the world but despite an extraordinary campaign to highlight the abduction there has been no news of her whereabouts for three weeks. Mr and Mrs McCann, backed by friends and family, remain convinced their daughter is alive and have set up a fund to help further publicise her disappearance.The pair held an informal discussion over tea this morning with the British ambassador to Portugal, John Buck, consular officials and British police. It is thought they may also meet Portuguese police later in the day. Mr McCann said: "Our attitude remains exactly the same, we remain absolutely determined to explore all ways of getting Madeleine back."That will focus on the criminal investigation but we have to, as a family, be open to other ways, we will keep taking advice from the professionals involved and we will continue to explore all avenues."There have been numerous sightings of girls matching Madeleine's description over the past three weeks including one high-profile claim in Morocco. Amid suggestions that the volume of lines of inquiry could leave "the one" swamped or missed, Madeleine's uncle, John McCann, said: "I think if anybody has a sighting they should report it to the police and the police will prioritise, I believe, based on how strong they believe the information to be."Today it emerged that the Catholic bishop of the Algarve, Manuel Neto Quintas, had offered to become a go-between in negotiations should a kidnapper come forward.In a Portuguese radio discussion, he reportedly said he would make himself available if Madeleine's abductor chose to contact him.
