Andrew Wragg, the man accused of murdering his terminally ill son, is to face a retrial over the 10-year-old's death, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said today.A jury hearing Mr Wragg's case was discharged last week after failing to reach a verdict, and the presiding judge, Mrs Justice Rafferty, gave the CPS seven days to consider its next move. The 37-year-old former SAS soldier, who has admitted the manslaughter of Jacob, walked free from court but will now have to start proceedings afresh. In his last trial, Mr Wragg was charged with murder after smothering Jacob, who had the incurable degenerative disorder Hunter syndrome, at the family home in Worthing, West Sussex, on July 24 last year. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and claimed it had been a mercy killing. The court was told that Jacob, who was diagnosed at the age of 19 months, would probably not have lived for more than a few years. He would eventually have been deaf, dumb, incontinent and would have suffered problems with his sight, breathing and movement. The condition is passed from mother to son and impairs growth, mental and physical development. It affects one in 150,000 boys. At the time of Jacob's death, the boy's mother, Mary Wragg, was out with the couple's other son. She returned home to find her husband cuddling the child's body. When the police arrived he allegedly said: "This was a mercy killing. My son wanted me to do it because he had a terminal illness." But the prosecution claimed it had been a "selfish killing", possibly as a "perceived way out of the situation that he found too difficult to cope with". Mr Wragg had returned from Iraq, where he had been working for a private security firm, shortly before Jacob's death. Mrs Wragg, who is now divorced, denied that she had been complicit in the killing. She carried photos of Jacob and two of his dummies while she was in court and wore a lock of his hair pinned to her clothing.
