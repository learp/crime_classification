A mobile forensic laboratory that allows DNA evidence to be analysed at the scene of a crime will begin working today.Police hope it will revolutionise investigations by giving detectives access to DNA information in eight hours. They can also compare fingerprints without leaving the scene. Currently it takes at least 24 hours for a DNA sample to be processed at a conventional laboratory, but the forensic response vehicle will allow experts and their equipment to be at the scene. The vehicle, designed by the Forensic Science Service (FSS), is being piloted by forces in the West Midlands, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. Stuart Hyde, assistant chief constable of West Midlands police, said: "Undertaking DNA checks close to the scene of a murder, for example, is a significant step forward. This will make it more likely that we will identify murderers and rapists earlier." Using satellite links, scientists in the vehicle will be able to compare finger and shoe prints with the FSS's databases. DNA samples from blood or sperm will be analysed and compared with the national database, which holds profiles of 3 million people. An FSS spokeswoman declined to say how much the new vehicle cost to develop, for "commercial reasons".
