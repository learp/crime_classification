A man prone to "extreme violence" today became the first person in the UK to be convicted at a retrial for the same crime after the scrapping of the "double jeopardy" law.Mario Celaire had been acquitted of the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Cassandra McDermott, in 2002 after she ended their four-year relationship. He was then charged for a second time after senior judges quashed that jury verdict.Celaire since carried out a hammer attack which left another woman permanently brain-damaged.At the Old Bailey, Celaire, now 31, of Sydenham, south-east London, admitted the manslaughter of McDermott in October 2001 and the attempted murder of Kara Hoyte in February 2007. They were both aged 19.The 800-year-old legal principle that stopped people being tried for the same offence was repealed in England and Wales in April 2005, allowing the appeal court to order a retrial if there is compelling evidence.The court heard Celaire was prone to "extreme violence" and had a history of abusing McDermott, leaving her bruised to the body and face.She was killed while house-sitting in Norbury, south London, for her mother Jennifer, a senior probation officer, who was on holiday in the West Indies.Celaire had either punched her or pushed her head into furniture, knocking her out and leaving her to choke on a Chinese takeaway. At his original trial he claimed she was alive and safe when he left the house.Simon Denison QC, prosecuting, said the new investigation included fresh evidence of Celaire's previous violence towards her and others.Celaire later admitted McDermott's killing to Hoyte after she found case papers from his trial and challenged him about it during their own relationship.Hoyte suffered brain injuries and is barely able to communicate after Celaire attacked her with a hammer after she, too, ended their relationship.Special arrangements were put in place at the Old Bailey to allow Hoyte to give her main testimony via a recorded interview and face questions through a videolink.Celaire, a former Maidstone United footballer, was told by Judge Paul Â­Worsley that he faced a "very significant" jail term when sentenced on 3 July after a psychiatric report.The trial marks the end of a seven-year fight by McDermott's family who were in court to see prosecutors accept Celaire's pleas.McDermott's sister, Andrea, 30, said: "We knew Mario killed Cassie. Today we have been vindicated.."
