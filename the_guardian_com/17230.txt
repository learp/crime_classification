The Serious Organised Crime Agency today claimed that in its first year of operation it had seized a fifth of Europe's cocaine supply with a street value of £3bn.The drug seizures included 73 tonnes of cocaine, 1.5 tonnes of heroin, 4.4 million ecstasy tablets, 260 kilos of opium and 1 million doses of LSD.Soca, the British equivalent of the FBI, which has been hit by allegations it is suffering from low-morale and is ineffective, also said it had recruited three "supergrasses" after laws were passed to crack down on key figures in the criminal underworld.The agency's first annual report said it had identified an initial target list of more than 1,600 of Britain's worst criminals.But Soca admitted that the full extent of the danger posed by some had not been fully realised because of the "generally poor" intelligence picture it inherited when the agency was set up last April.Of the 1,600 "most-wanted" criminals, the agency is concentrating its firepower on 160 individuals, including people caught up in money laundering, drug trafficking, human smuggling and electronic fraud.Some are thought to still be controlling their criminal empires despite being jailed.Soca, which is also responsible for executing arrest warrants for foreign suspects in the UK, was involved in the arrest of alleged mafia godfather Gennaro Patzuto in a Lancashire village last night.Soca was launched by Tony Blair to "make life hell" for organised crime. But despite having more than 4,000 officers and an annual budget of £400m, the would-be premier crime agency has prosecuted an average of just 30 people a month in its first year.Sir Stephen Lander, a former MI5 chief who chairs the agency, has acknowledged the agency has faced problems in its first year of operation, saying it will take up to five years for it to have a significant impact."The struggle against drug dealing, illegal immigration, fraud and other organised crimes will be a marathon, not a sprint," he said."But, working with others, Soca has made a good start in its first year of operation and is ambitious for what can be achieved in the years ahead."The report also outlined a huge rise in the number of cases of kidnapped Britons reported to detectives. Last year, 395 kidnaps in Britain and abroad were reported to Soca, compared with just 23 to its equivalent organisation in 1996.Bill Hughes, Soca's director general, said: "A lot of these cases are what we call bad on bad, where people are enforcing debts by taking people hostage."Mr Hughes added that harsh sentences handed to kidnappers were deterring some offenders.Soca also worked with police forces to prevent 35 potential murders, it added.The agency was formed following the merger of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, the National Crime Squad and other law enforcement bodies.Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said: "In its first year, Soca has made a real impact by seizing large quantities of Class A drugs, making well over a thousand arrests and preventing massive amounts of fraud - these are all fantastic achievements."But shadow home secretary David Davis said it was "too early to properly assess Soca's effectiveness"."There are positives from the report, including the volume of drugs seized and strengthened international cooperation. There are also points of concern. Soca has prosecuted fewer cases in the UK courts than its predecessor and missed its targets on seizing criminal assets," he said."It is critical that Soca learns the right lessons during this early period, so it can develop its operational capacity to disrupt and put behind bars those involved in serious organised crime."Many former police officers who joined the agency are reported to have asked to "return to force", and 144 former customs officers have shown interest in going back to their old department, according to law enforcement sources.Senior Soca staff have been sent around regional offices on "morale boosting" tours. An eyewitness at one meeting in the West Midlands said a respected former police officer described Soca as "shit", with no quality work or leadership.Bureaucracy appears to be lowering morale. In November, 147 officers who signed Soca contracts were told salaries had been miscalculated. Some moved homes and took out mortgages only to be told to pay back money.
