 The victim Carol Price was 17 years old and working as a clerk at Barrow town hall when she was introduced by friends to Gordon Park, three years her senior. They married in 1967 and moved into the unfinished house which Gordon was building. By all accounts, the relationship between Gordon and Carol Park was a stormy one. She had an affair with a local shipyard worker in 1972, following the birth of their son, Jeremy. However, she was able to reconcile the relationship with Gordon and they went on to have a daughter, Rachel. The couple also adopted Vanessa, the daughter of her sister, Christine, who was murdered by her boyfriend 35 years ago. In the summer of 1974, Carol formed a friendship with David Brearley, whom she met at an Open University summer course. Park was awarded custody of their three children in March the following year as Carol went to live with Mr Brearley in Middlesbrough. She was devastated and returned to Bluestones, the family home, in April but left again within a week. By August, she was back at the house. The killer Gordon Park was born in Barrow-in-Furness, the son of working-class parents, his father was a gas meter reader and his mother was a bus conductor. By the time he met Carol, his parents had built up a successful paint and wallpaper business. He became a teacher and was a respected member of staff at South New Barnes junior school in Barrow, until his retirement. Police admit that he was a man of previous good character, who had led a full life, pursuing his sailing and climbing and latterly cycling. He married twice after Carol's death, first to Catherine Sillars in 1981, which broke down. In October 1993, he married Olive (Jenny) Marshall.
