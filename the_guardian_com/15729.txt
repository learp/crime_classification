The dismembered body of a missing 15-year-old girl has been found dumped on a housing estate, Scotland Yard said tonight.Detectives, who have launched a murder inquiry, believe Rochelle Holness, of Lewisham in south-east London, was abducted on Sunday evening after she went to use a phone box. Her body was discovered yesterday on the Milford Towers estate in nearby Catford. It was in the vicinity of this estate that Rochelle had been heading. "Police were called at 11.17am [yesterday] from a flat in one of the blocks by London Ambulance Service who had been called to reports of an injured man," a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said. "A man and a woman, both aged 47, were arrested at the flat. The man was taken to a local hospital for treatment to cuts before being discharged."Officers later discovered Rochelle's body in an open area on the estate. The two people who have been arrested are being held at separate south London police stations. They are not related to the dead girl.Detective Superintendent Paul McAleenan of the Met's specialist crimes directorate, who is leading the inquiry, appealed for witnesses and information. Police said Rochelle was of African Caribbean origin. "At this early stage, it is not clear when Rochelle was killed. I want to hear from anyone who was in the area at any time from Sunday evening, 25 September, to the early hours of Wednesday 28 September," Det Supt McAleenan said."Did you see or hear anything suspicious, either inside the estate or in the roads that lead to the estate? Please be assured we will treat all information with the utmost confidence."Detectives are awaiting the results of a post mortem examination. No murder weapon has been found.Anyone who has any information is urged to call police on 020 8721 4054, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 if you wish to remain anonymous.
