7.09pm GMT19:09Guardian: Committee has looked in wrong directionThe intelligence and security committee behind today’s report has allowed its attention to wander into more speculative territory rather than on focusing on a critical period of missed opportunities to potentially stop Lee Rigby’s killers, according to a Guardian editorial.It adds that while a US internet company, understood to be Facebook, has become the “new fall guy” in the case, the failure to to prevent the killers “does not lie with that company’s understandable caution about allowing a foreign government to trawl through its accounts and data”.The editorial, which you can read in full here, says: The bleak truth is that it’s possible nothing would have saved Lee Rigby from his awful fate. Some suggest fresh UK government powers to demand information from American and other firms are the answer. But first the UK authorities would have to prove that they have used the powers they already have wisely and that those powers have been exhausted. We are not at that point. It means the committee has looked in the wrong direction, perhaps under pressure from a government with a data communications agenda of its own. If anything might have saved Lee Rigby, it would have been tougher and better interventions against known suspects. That is the lesson both of this terrible case and for the essential unrelenting work of preventing a similar horror in future.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose6.09pm GMT18:09End-of-day summaryMPs on the intelligence and security committee have published their report on the dealings of the security services with the killers of Lee Rigby, the soldier killed on the streets of Woolwich last year.Security agencies could not have prevented the murder, despite the two killers having appeared in seven separate investigations, the report finds. It identifies “errors” by MI5 “where processes were not followed, decisions not recorded or delays encountered”, and describes as “inadequate” the response of MI6 in dealing with Adebolajo. But it concludes there is little the agencies could have done, based on the knowledge they had at the time, that would have made a difference.Adebolajo was a high priority for MI5 during two operationsduring which a broad range of intrusive techniques were used but “none of these revealed any evidence of attack planning”.Adebowale was never more than a low-level subject of interest.The report accused internet companies of providing “a safe haven for terrorists” and said an unnamed internet company – which the Guardian understands is Facebook – should have done more to alert authorities to extremist messages posted by Michael Adebowale: This is the single issue which – had it been known at the time – might have enabled MI5 to prevent the attack.

Responding to the report, prime minister David Cameron said the government would commit an extra £130m over the next two years to monitor and disrupt so-called ‘lone wolf’ terrorists.Cameron said internet companies should do more to combat extremism: The truth is this: terrorists are using the internet to communicate with each other. We must not accept that these communications are beyond the reach of the companies.We expect the internet companies to do all they can … It is their social responsibility to act on this.

There are, he says, “a number of quite jarring points that emerge, some of which challenge the narrative set out by the committee and the UK intelligence agencies on mass-surveillance efforts”.The strongest conclusion in the report is the suggestion that MI5 and GCHQ are reliant on the cooperation of overseas technology companies to get hold of communications – which in turn raises questions about the value of GCHQ’s expensive and controversial bulk access programs, such as Tempora.   Satellite dish within Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) compound in Cheltenham. Photograph: Greg Blatchford / Barcroft MediaA heavily-redacted paragraph (410) in the ISC report notes GCHQ has such access – Edward Snowden documents suggested Tempora had access to at least 20% of traffic flowing through the UK – but the ISC noted in relation to one key message that even “if GCHQ had unknowingly ‘picked up’ the exchange … the fact that neither Adebowale nor FOXTROT [his unnamed correspondent] were under active investigation at the time means that the communication would not have been selected for further analysis”.The report restates and supports the intelligence agencies’ position that the UK’s surveillance law, Ripa, was always intended to have a global reach (referred to as “extra-territoriality”) and so cover US technology companies. It’s not at all clear this was the case: as recently as 2009, a Home Office consultation noted: “And overseas companies outside UK jurisdiction are not required to disclose data under Ripa and not required to retain the data under the EU data retention directive.”As such, trying to extend Ripa to cover companies globally potentially represents a significant power grab by the agencies, and by the UK – one which may not be well received by some of the UK’s allies in Europe and beyond.MI5 is largely absolved of responsibility for Lee Rigby’s murder, in part due to the difficulty of attempting to track around 2,000 people of interest at one time. Technology companies are not extended quite the same understanding, despite having hundreds of millions of – or in Facebook’s case, over a billion – users. The report not only suggests such companies should comply with UK surveillance requests, but should proactively seek out terrorists in their own network. One senior technology company staffer said this was unreasonable, asking: “Could you imagine them asking the same thing of BT?”There is a final question mark around the agencies’ public responses to the Snowden revelations, which began after Rigby’s murder in Woolwich. GCHQ officials, the Home Office and others complained technology companies were not cooperating with some requests, and that encryption meant some communications were “going dark”. They laid the blame for both at Snowden’s door. But responses from the agencies to the ISC show they were already, prior to Snowden, complaining that technology companies needed to hand over more information, and said strong encryption was already being introduced for other reasons. Given both trends pre-existed, it could leave the agencies open to the suggestion of a degree of opportunism in their responses.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.30pm GMT17:30Facebook statementA spokesperson for Facebook has given the Guardian this statement on claims that it is the company accused in the ISC report of failing to pass on information about extremist messages sent by Michael Adebowale: Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear: we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.The full report is here.Updatedat 5.31pm GMTFacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose5.15pm GMT17:15More on the news that Facebook is the previously unnamed internet company accused by the ISC today of failing to pass on information about one of Lee Rigby’s killers.Alex Hern reports: Facebook is the internet company accused by the intelligence and security committee (ISC) of failing to pass on information that could have prevented the murder of Lee Rigby, the Guardian understands.The ISC investigation found that one of Rigby’s killers, Michael Adebowale, conducted an online exchange detailing his desire to murder a soldier ‘in the most graphic and emotive manner’ with a known terrorist, five months before the attack, yet did not directly name the company concerned.‘The party which could have made a difference was the company on whose platform the exchange took place,’ states the report. ‘However, this company does not appear to regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that its systems identify such exchanges, or to take action or notify the authorities when its communications services appear to be used by terrorists.‘There is therefore a risk that, however unintentionally, it provides a safe haven for terrorists to communicate within,’ it states.The report does not name which US tech service Adebowale used, but at various points the 191-page report mentions Apple, BlackBerry, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo when giving examples of monitoring procedures.The Guardian undestands the company in question is Facebook. The report details 11 accounts run by Adebowale, with seven of those disabled by the company concerned and one closed by Adebowale himself.The ISC’s report says that the technology company closed the accounts in an automated manner for violation of the company’s terms of service. Two accounts were closed for non-terrorism related activities, but the other five were disabled for terrorism-associated reasons, including one for being part of terrorist groups.While no technology company would comment on the report to the Guardian, it is known that the posts were made in a private manner that was not indexed by a search engine, that the accounts could be members of groups, and that the company has automated systems for detecting and closing accounts for breach of terms of service.Facebook stands out among internet companies for proactively monitoring its platform to look for and remove content which raises concerns about terrorism and child safety issues. But the vast majority of moderation on Facebook is reactive, relying on reports from members of the public or on automated tools. Unlike the other internet companies consulted by the ISC, Facebook’s monitoring arrangements are heavily redacted in the resulting report.Facebook did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian, nor did it respond when directly asked if it was the subject of the ISC’s report.No other technology company would comment on the report to the Guardian on the record.

Nor did it seek further information.The report says MI6’s “minimal involvement is surprising” and “it is difficult to understand their passive approach to Adebolajo’s arrest”.The committee also expressed concern at a discrepancy between evidence from MI6 and a British police counter-terrorism unit over when MI6 was first informed of the arrest.“In any case concerning a British national suspected of involvement in terrorism (whether in the UK or overseas) it is essential that all information – whether corroborated or not – should be properly recorded. That failed to happen on this occasion,” the report says.  Michael Adebolajo, after his arrest by Kenyan police.

That was the exchange – not seen until after the attack – between Adebowale and an individual overseas [known as Foxtrot] in December 2012. In this exchange, Adebowale told Foxtrot that he intended to murder a soldier.“Had MI5 access to this exchange, their investigation into Adebowale would have become top priority. It is difficult to speculate on the outcome but there is a significant possibility that MI5 would then have been able to prevent the attack.”That was the conclusion of the intelligence and security committee, which also agreed that agencies could not themselves have obtained access to this information under current rules, as Adebowale was not under active investigation at the time.“The party which could have made a difference was the company on whose platform the exchange took place. However, this company does not appear to regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that its systems identify such exchanges, or to take action or notify the authorities when its communications services appear to be used by terrorists.“There is therefore a risk that, however unintentionally, it provides a safe haven for terrorists to communicate within,” the report says.In a further twist that seeks to shift responsibility to the internet companies, the report says that US internet providers do not feel compelled to comply with UK warrants seeking data.The exact nature of the exchange of information between US and UK agencies is a matter of debate. The committee acknowledges that UK agencies which work closely with the US intelligence agencies can still get access. The fact that US internet providers “do recognise the jurisdiction of the US courts means that the UK agencies or law enforcement can, in certain limited circumstances, ask their US partners to apply to the US courts for authorisation to obtain and share the relevant material with the UK”.However, the report adds: “In practice this is limited by the US courts to high priority investigations where there is a known threat to life.” The implication is that MI5 would not have been able to get information on an individual who in this case was regarded as low priority.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.45pm GMT15:45You can read the latest Guardian report on today’s developments here.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.43pm GMT15:43While the internet companies mentioned in the report (the firm at the centre of the claim that it should have intervened on Adebowale’s messages is unnamed) have not commented on the ISC findings – Facebook is the latest to tell the Guardian it won’t be making a statement – others in the field are pushing back at the recommendation that online activity ought to be more rigorously policed by service providers.Antony Walker, deputy CEO at techUK, the industry body, said: Tech companies take their security responsibilities incredibly seriously. Companies have taken significant steps to be transparent with the public about how they work with law enforcement and security agencies by publishing regular transparency reports. These reports make it clear that tech companies do engage with law enforcement and security agencies in the course of terrorist and other investigations and that the level of cooperation is undiminished …There are real legal challenges of jurisdiction where companies operate outside the UK jurisdiction and complying with UK law could put companies at risk of contravening their own domestic law. The only way to address these issues is by brokering diplomatic agreements and processes between governments. The report rightly focuses on the importance of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) process for providing a legal framework that enables companies based outside the UK to respond to access to data from UK agencies without the risk of contravening their own domestic law. This is best achieved diplomatic negation between national governments and in consultation with companies and other stakeholders …If the government believes that it needs additional powers to be able to access communication data it must be clear about exactly what those powers are and consult widely on them before putting proposals before parliament.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose3.29pm GMT15:29The role of the agencies: errors and surveillanceEwen MacAskill, the Guardian’s defence and intelligence correspondent, has been combing the ISC report and sends this dispatch on what it has to say about the way the security services dealt with Adebolajo and Adebowale when evidence of their extremism emerged ahead of the murder.The report praises the agencies for protecting the UK from a number of terrorist plots, averaging about one or two serious intended attacks a year: Nevertheless, when there is a terrorist attack, it is essential that there is a thorough investigation to establish whether mistakes have been made and to ensure that any lessons are learned.Here’s what the report says about MI5’s missed opportunities:SurveillanceAs the main domestic surveillance agency, MI5 had responsibility for keeping tabs on Adebolajo and Adebowale.Adebolajo, viewed as more of a priority than Adebowale, was caught up in MI5 investigations on five separate occasions, beginning with Operation Ash from May to September 2008. Concern was sparked after contact with a network suspected of terrorist links.Adebolajo was caught up in four further surveillance operations – Operation Beech, Operation Cedar, Operation Dogwood and Operation Elm – before the Woolwich attack.Adebowale was investigated by MI5 on two separate occasions: Operation Fir from August 2011 to June 2012, looking at links between UK-based individuals with an interest in extremist media; and Operation Gum, from January 2012 up until the Woolwich attack, looking at his extremist rhetoric and potential dissemination of extremist media.  Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) after they murdered British soldier Lee Rigby. Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesErrorsVarious errors were made, such as failure to follow up on recommendations to gather more information about Adebolajo. The committee expressed surprise that MI5 did not place one or both of the men under surveillance or increase the surveillance.The report says that MI5 has limited resources and has to prioritise its investigations. Adebowale was regarded as low priority and, as a result, there were significant and unacceptable delays in investigating him.The report says: Whilst we have concluded that the errors identified would not, individually, have affected the outcome, we have also considered whether there was a cumulative effect – i.e. whether, taken together, they might have made a difference. We do know that they would have led to different investigative decisions.However, it is impossible to conclude that those changes – all dependent on one another – would have resulted in MI5 discovering evidence of attack planning. We do not consider that, given what the agencies knew at the time, they were in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.There are those who feel that the intelligence and security agencies have too much power to intrude into an individual’s privacy. However, when a terrorist attack happens, the question often asked is why the agencies did not do more to prevent it. The balance between these two concerns is one that we are considering further in our separate inquiry into privacy and security issues.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.40pm GMT14:40Afternoon summaryMPs on the intelligence and security committee have published their report on the dealings of the security services with the killers of Lee Rigby, the soldier killed on the streets of Woolwich last year.Security agencies could not have prevented the murder, despite the two killers having appeared in seven separate investigations, the report finds.

You have to have legislation that is proportionate to the threat we face … Wherever you’re based, if you provide services in this country, you should be subject to our legal framework.People are indulging in extreme ideology … They [internet companies] have a responsibility to flag that up to the authorities, of course they do.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose2.13pm GMT14:13Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch, which campaigns for online privacy, is unimpressed by David Cameron’s commitment to further moves to allow intelligence agencies more access to online communications: The conclusion that a failing of an unnamed technology company should determine future legislation, whilst the catalogue of errors by the intelligence agencies is all but excused, is of grave concern.The report revealed multiple failures by the intelligence agencies to use the powers available to them to monitor communications. The government should use this report as a blueprint to re-evaluate the decision-making and record-keeping processes of the intelligence agencies, as well as the training and resources allocated within the counter terrorism community.It is vital that existing powers to combat terrorist activity are used effectively before any further intrusive legislation is considered by parliament. Failure to do this will merely increase the burden on the agencies whilst unnecessarily intruding on the public’s civil liberties.FacebookTwitterGoogle plusShareShare this postFacebookTwitterGoogle plusclose
