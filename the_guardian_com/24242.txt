The UK has seen a sixfold increase in the number of counterfeit and potentially dangerous electrical goods seized in the past four years – fuelled by demand for "branded" designer headphones and gadgets such as hair straighteners.Figures obtained by the Co-op from local councils and Border Force – the organisation charged with patrolling the UK's borders – show that the value of counterfeit electrical goods seized has risen from £2.6m in 2009 to £15.7m in 2012.During the same period budgets for trading standards – council departments responsible for identifying and prosecuting counterfeit sellers on a regional level – have been cut by 17.5% from £85m to just under £70m as part of a drive to cut costs.The data was obtained in response to a request made under the Freedom of Information Act by the Co-operative Electrical, which is concerned about the volume of counterfeit – and often dangerous – electrical goods now flooding the market.The value of fake designer headphones has risen from just over £200,000 in 2009 to more than £15m in 2012. Seizures of hair straighteners saw a comparative rise, from almost nothing in 2009 to £172,000 in 2012.In 2009 councils prosecuted 372 people for the sale of counterfeit electrical goods, a figure which dropped to 245 in 2012. Kent had the largest budget, spending just under £3m on trading standards in 2012. During this period there were four prosecutions in Kent for selling counterfeit electrical goods, while in Hertfordshire – with a trading standards budget of just under £2.7m – no one was prosecuted. The council with the lowest budget was Dorset, with just under £1.2m.In London, Westminster had the highest budget for trading standards, spending £1.4m in 2012. The lowest-spending borough was Barking and Dagenham, which had a budget of £196,497.The Electrical Safety Council reiterated that the surge in fake electrical goods was putting lives at risk. Hair stylers, children's electronic games and mobile phone chargers are items most likely to be counterfeit, and almost all contain incorrect or faulty parts that can cause fires or electrocution.
