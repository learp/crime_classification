Police investigating the murder of a British yachtsman who was attacked and thrown into the sea off Thailand's southern coast after trying to stop the theft of a dinghy from his boat have arrested three Burmese fishermen.Malcolm Robertson and his wife, Linda, were aboard their yacht, the Mr Bean, near the island of Koh Dong about 45 miles west of Satun province when it was boarded on Monday.Thai police said the three Burmese migrant workers had confessed to killing the 64-year-old after he caught them climbing on to the moored yacht.A police spokesman said the men had cut his throat as he tried to shout for help and then thrown him overboard.Police Colonel Virat Ohn-song said: "We believe from our interview with his wife that Mr Robertson was dead before he was thrown into the water."Although police and the Thai navy sent out search vessels to scour the sea, Mr Robertson's body has not been found and the search was called off late on Monday night.His wife escaped with minor injuries after the attackers fled when another boat approached.Linda Robertson, who is recovering in a Thai hospital, is reported to have said: "They wanted the dinghy and started hitting Malc about the head."She was photographed being brought back to dry land, with Thai officials assisting her as she stepped off the boat.Police who arrested the three Burmese men on suspicion of murder in Satun said the only apparent motive for the attack was to steal the yacht's dinghy.Colonel Voradee Karawanont, of Satun police, said: "We got a report from a fishing boat as the tragedy happened offshore. We tried our best to help but the murderers were not locals; they were from outside."We think in the future we will have more measures to make sure nothing like this happens again."The Foreign Office said it was "urgently pursuing the case" with Thai police.A spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that a British couple were attacked whilst sailing of the coast of Satun, southern Thailand â€¦ Our consular team in Bangkok are in touch with the next of kin and are providing consular assistance to those involved."She added: "Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. We are urgently pursuing this case with local police who are investigating the incident."The retired couple, from Eastbourne in Sussex, had been sailing their 44ft- (13-metre) yacht from Phuket, where it was berthed, to the Malaysian duty-free island of Langkawi.The Robertsons kept an online sailblog to chronicle their round-the-world voyage, which began when they left Eastbourne marina on 15 June 1998."The owners have sailed from Eastbourne, England, via the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Panama Canal, South Pacific, New Zealand, Fiji, Vanuatu and Australia, and is now in Langkawi, Malaysia," he wrote on the blog."We have loved every moment of the trip and never held back on any item that was required for [the yacht's] safety, her appearance or her maintenance."The blog was last updated in September 2007. The last entry was headed: "Still the excitement is there after nine years."Cases of piracy on yachts are rare off Thailand but the area is close to where hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Burma try to enter the country seeking work.The Thai government has been criticised by human rights organisations for towing the Rohingyas back out to sea in their rickety, often engineless boats, and setting them adrift.Last month, the Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, promised to investigate the scandal. But he gave the task to the controversial Internal Security Operations Command (Isoc), which stands accused of committing the abuses.
