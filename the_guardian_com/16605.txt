The body representing rank-and-file police officers has described the hiring of two 16-year-old community support officers as a "nonsense" that could endanger lives.Alan Gordon, the vice chairman of the Police Federation, said the "children" would be exposed to "inordinate risks" which they were ill-equipped to deal with because of their age.He was speaking as Thames Valley police defended its decision to recruit the school leavers, claiming they would be able to interact with other young people.A spokesman for the force said: "If you are good enough you are old enough."However, Mr Gordon said Police Federation members were "not happy" about the move."These children are going to be put in a uniform the public believe to be of a police officer and be expected to take on responsibilities on the streets," he said."Police officers can't protect them from the unpredictability of policing. To expect 16-year-olds to have the knowledge of life, maturity and judgment to tackle incidents is incredulous."And what about the police officers who have to work with these people? We already have concerns when officers are in a conflict situation working with PCSOs [police community support officers]."Officers are already saying to us they have to keep an eye on the PCSO's safety, as well as their own, because they are not as well trained or equipped."Mr Gordon, who said he was "staggered" that there was no minimum age for the position, suggested that some members of the public may become aggressive if young PCSOs attempted to discipline or detain them. He also claimed that officers were quite able to deal with young people themselves.The row came after Thames Valley admitted it had hired the two recruits, who are currently undergoing training before taking up their paid roles.Depending on their duties, they will have the authority to detain suspects until a police officer arrives, issue penalty notices, deal with minor offences and guard crime scenes.They will also be able to confiscate alcohol consumed in a public place, despite being two years below the legal drinking age, and to direct traffic and have vehicles removed, even though they are too young to drive.A Thames Valley spokeswoman said: "We have recruited these people because they demonstrated the skills that we need."They bring experience of being able to interact with the public, especially young people. If you are good enough you are old enough."Other police forces said today they would be highly unlikely to hire such young PCSOs.A Cambridgeshire police spokeswoman said: "Our minimum age for a PCSO is 18. The reason for that is so they have all the skills needed for the job."A large part of their work is around confiscating alcohol from underage people. They wouldn't be able to do that if they were underage themselves."
