Ian Huntley boasted of finding a quiet place to plane-spot in Lakenheath, the area where the bodies of his alleged victims were found in a ditch, the court heard yesterday.Earlier this week the jury was shown the ditch where the bodies of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were found 13 days after they went missing. It ran beside a track which ended at the Lakenheath airbase perimeter fence. The prosecution alleges Mr Huntley knew the area well and selected the spot through his local knowledge. Yesterday Benjamin Hickling, a salesman, described discussing with him their mutual interest in planes. "He said he had found an area [near the base] that he very often went to. You were not supposed to go down there - it was a very quiet area. He used it to see aeroplanes take off. He said 'No one ever goes down there'."
