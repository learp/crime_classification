The father of Madeleine McCann, the four-year-old British girl who disappeared in southern Portugal more than two weeks ago, was back in the UK today for a brief visit aimed at finalising a campaign to lead the search for his daughter.Gerry McCann, a consultant cardiologist, arrived back last night and was visiting the family home in Rothley, Leicestershire, before returning to Portugal, said his brother, John McCann. "I think he's flying back tonight," Mr McCann said.It is the first time either of Madeleine's parents has left Portugal since she was apparently snatched from the family's holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz 18 days ago.Holidaymakers in the town and Portuguese people across the country stood silently today in solidarity with Madeleine's family.The one-minute silence, initiated by an anonymous chain email circulated around Portugal at the weekend, was observed at midday. In Praia Da Luz shoppers and workers stood still to think of Madeleine.The initiative was given the blessing of the family, who are spearheading a campaign to imprint Madeleine's image on the minds of people across Europe and north Africa in the hope that she will be found.Madeleine's mother, Kate, who is apart from her husband for the first time since the abduction, observed the silence privately in her holiday apartment where she has remained with the couple's two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie.Despite the lack of a breakthrough in the police search for the girl, the McCanns have battled hard to keep their daughter's disappearance in the news, with a series of high-profile celebrity appeals for her return and a massive publicity campaign throughout Europe.Madeleine's great uncle, Brian Kennedy, who is heading a fund launched last week to help find the girl, said today he did not know what Mr McCann would be doing in Britain."We were informed yesterday that Gerry intended to make a brief, private visit home but we were not told the reason, other than that it was mainly regarding legal matters. It is probably concerning the fund we have set up," he said."We have no information as to Gerry's present whereabouts and we are not sure whether we will see him before he returns to Portugal."I know his visit was planned to be very short. This is all I can say at present and we thank everyone for their continued support."Despite criticism alleging media overkill of the Madeleine McCann story from commentators in Britain and Portugal in recent days, the family remains determined to keep coverage on the boil.Their website, findmadeleine.com, has so far received more than 100m hits.The press was allowed closer to the family over the weekend, as Mr McCann and his wife appeared to accept that a certain loss of privacy was a price worth paying to keep Madeleine's case in the public eye. A press photographer was allowed to take pictures of them playing with their twins.Meanwhile, the self-styled Team McCann, made up mainly of a small but determined group of friends and relatives, continued to try to build a global campaign to find Madeleine.The British government has provided a media relations expert to help the family. A new government media adviser is due to arrive this week.Police followed up fresh leads over the weekend, including sending a diver down into a well by an abandoned farm on the outskirts of Praia da Luz.
