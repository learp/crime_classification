Violent crime in England and Wales rose in the third quarter of last year as overall crime levels fell, government figures revealed today.The total number of crimes recorded by police from July to September last year fell 6% period on period to 1,395,900, but the figure includes a 7% increase in violence against the person to 268,100 offences in the three months.The home secretary, Charles Clarke, also published separate data showing a 5% increase in the number of firearms offences in the year to September, reaching 10,670 incidents, or 500 more than in the previous 12 months.Ministers insisted that, despite the rise in the recorded figures for violent crime, the risk of being a victim of crime was at its lowest for more than 20 years. The separate British Crime Survey, which is based on interviews with 40,000 adults, showed 9% fewer violent crimes year on year and a 36% fall since a peak in 1995.Non-violent crimes in the recorded data - based on crimes reported to police - showed a 23% fall in the number of domestic burglaries and 17% decrease in vehicle thefts.Further figures on murders in England and Wales in 2003-2004 showed the first annual fall since 1996. There were 858 deaths initially recorded as homicide, a fall of 18% on 2002-2003, or a fall of 2% when the cases of Harold Shipman were excluded from the previous figures.Recorded sexual offences rose 22% in the quarter from 13,900 in July to September 2003 to 17,000, but officials said this was due to changes in the way the offences were counted.Mr Clarke said tackling violent crime was his biggest priority, but insisted that it had fallen when the statistics were examined "in the round". He said the recorded rise was due to an increase in the number of crimes reported to police and changes in the way various offences were classified and recorded.The home secretary said he "made no apology" for encouraging people to report violent crime and insisted he would never look for "cheap headlines" by discouraging the reporting of serious offences."Appalling crimes, sometimes horrific crimes, are not even reported because the victims are too frightened to do so."We are trying to encourage the reporting of violent crime. I make no apology for getting violent crime reported or for changing the way it is reported because that is what we need to do."Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, said the figures showed that too many people were still finding themselves on the receiving end of violent crime."The rising tide of alcohol-related violence has happened under Labour, and they must take responsibility. Unless local authorities and local police are prepared, pressing ahead with plans for 24-hour licensing is a recipe for disaster," he said."The best way to tackle crime on our streets is to scrap Labour's flawed plans for ID cards and use the money instead to put 10,000 more police on the beat."Another study out today, the 2003 Crime and Justice Survey, shows that 26% of the estimated 3.8 million active offenders account for 82% of all offences, or just under one million people, but the Home Office is targeting 100,000 prolific offenders across England and Wales in a new campaign.Home Office minister Hazel Blears said the government was targeting the "heart of people" causing the most harm. "Around that, there will be other people who are prolific that aren't necessarily causing the most harm in the community," she said."What this survey confirms to us is that there is a core of people responsible for serious offending in this country."
