Shannon Matthews has had a comfortable and settled night, and is starting on the road to recovery following her ordeal, according to West Yorkshire police.The nine-year-old girl, who had been missing for 24 days and was discovered last night hidden in the base of a bed in a flat less then a mile from her family home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, spent last night watching DVDs, ate breakfast this morning and has been playing with a kitten.Although she has been briefly reunited with her parents, Shannon was made the subject of an emergency police protection order last night and will not be allowed home until police have finished talking to her.Her mother Karen Matthews, 32, and stepfather Craig Meehan, 22, looked tired and drawn as they left Dewsbury police station at 8pm last night. They spent last night in a hotel and hope to return home with their daughter today.Police arrested the 39-year-old uncle of the schoolgirl's stepfather on suspicion of Shannon's abduction at the flat in Lidgate Gardens, in the Batley Carr area of Dewsbury. "Shannon has been away from home for almost four weeks," said a West Yorkshire Police spokesman. "As part of our ongoing inquiries, and following medical checks, West Yorkshire Police will begin the process of interviewing Shannon."This may be a long process but throughout this inquiry our main focus has been and continues to be Shannon's welfare."We have therefore taken the decision that, for now, it is in Shannon's best interests that she be made subject of an emergency police protection order."This will remain in place until we have had time to establish the full facts of what happened in the time since her disappearance."Shannon disappeared after leaving Westmoor Junior School on February 19 following a swimming trip.West Yorkshire Police reportedly went to the flat where the schoolgirl, described as timid by neighbours and friends, was found after receiving tip-offs from a neighbour and the charity Missing People.Neighbours said Donovan had lived in the flat for three or four years. He was described as a loner who "kept himself to himself".Christopher Heaps came out of his home at number 4 Lidgate Gardens just after midday yesterday after hearing banging and saw police smash the door of the flat down."About five minutes after that a policeman came out with a girl under his arms," he said. "I said to the policeman 'Is that Shannon?' and he said 'Yeah, this is Shannon'."Heaps said a woman in the downstairs flat triggered the raid on Donovan's flat after telling officers who knocked on her door, that she had heard "little footsteps" in the flat above her.Many residents on Moorside Road celebrated with a huge street party last night.Scores of neighbours gathered at the community centre to set up disco lights, let off fireworks and crack open bottles.A huge banner saying "Welcome back, Shannon" was draped across the street as the crowd tore up the leaflets they had printed appealing for help to find the youngster.
