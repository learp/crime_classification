The shocking murders in Greater Manchester come at a difficult time for police forces in the north of England. Work is never easy and often dangerous for the officers on the beat, as the deaths of Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes tragically remind us; but rarely can there have been such a coincidence of problems and challenges at leadership level.The report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel renews long-standing difficulties for South Yorkshire police in spite of the 23 years which have passed. It has also led the West Yorkshire police authority to refer the county's chief constable Sir Norman Bettison to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.Sir Norman denies any wrong-doing and welcomed the step, saying that it was: time this moved into a more formal and legal inquiry, where it can be considered, analysed and fully assessed. North Yorkshire police has a temporary chief constable after its police authority decided not to extend the five year term of Graham Maxwell who admitted gross misconduct over a relative's application to join the force, and retired in May. His deputy Adam Briggs was disciplined after a related charge of misconduct was upheld against him, and has since retired.Cleveland's chief constable Sean Price will not have his term of office renewed next year and is currently suspended with his deputy Derek Bonnard over similar allegations of misconduct relating to the employment of the daughter of the chair of the police authority Dave McLuckie. Both men, who were actually arrested by their own officers last year and have been the subject of an IPPC investigation, strongly deny misconduct and say they will clear their names.Last week, the temporary chief constable of Cumbria, Stuart Hyde, was suspended by the county's police authority following allegations of serious misconduct which have also been referred to the IPPC.All the forces have reassured the public that policing continues as normal and to a high standard, but the issues raised are going to present a formidable challenge to the new police and crime commissioners for whom we vote on 15 November, in all 41 policing areas in England and Wales outside London where Boris Johnson is PCC as elected Mayor (and has flexed his muscles). The situation also has obvious relevance to the Government's hopes of introducing outsiders to the police service at senior levels, which has provoked much resistance within forces.Forecasts of the level of interest in the elections have been dire, with suggestions that as few as 18.5 percent of us will turn out to vote. A little homework into the issues described above could – and should – change that. There can seldom have been more powerful arguments for the northern public to exercise its democratic powers on a matter which is the subject of so much vigorous and important debate.
