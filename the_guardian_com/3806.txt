An acid attacker who left a 25-year-old man severely disfigured in a horrific plot to avenge his family's "dishonour" was jailed for 30 years today.Mohammed Vakas was found guilty by an Old Bailey jury of plotting to murder Awais Akram. The victim was targeted because of his intimate relationship with Sadia Khatoon, 24, a married businesswoman he had met on Facebook, the court heard.When her husband, Shakeel Abassi, and Vakas, her brother, found out about it, they persuaded her to lure Akram out of his flat to the scene of the attack.There the victim was beaten and stabbed before Vakas poured concentrated sulphuric acid over his head, leaving him with 47% burns and fighting for his life.Vakas, 26, of Walthamstow, north-east London, was found guilty of conspiring with Khatoon and her husband to murder Mr Akram.Fellow attackers Mohammed Adeel, 20, also of Walthamstow, and a 17-year-old youth, who can now be named as Fabion Kuci, of Harlesden, north-west London, were convicted of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.Adeel was jailed for 14 years and Kuci for eight years. Khatoon and her 32-year-old husband have disappeared in Pakistan and detectives said they now feared for her safety.Akram, who survived the attack but continues to undergo treatment for his injuries, has described how he was in so much pain at the time that he wanted to die.Judge Brian Barker, the common serjeant of London, said: "The facts of this case are horrifying. This was a remorseless and a heartless plan."It was to punish and kill Mr Akram in the most cruel and sadistic way. The reason can be deduced as being an unacceptable relationship with Sadia Khatoon and Awais Akram."This was a terrible crime and all right-thinking citizens reject the premise on which it was done. There is no honour, and plots and actions such as this have no place in our society."Describing the harrowing evidence given by Akram in the trial, he said: "Few of us will have seen anything like that before and we must all hope we don't see anything like that again."Police hailed Akram's bravery in coming forward to give evidence against his attackers despite being deeply traumatised by what happened. One officer described him as an "incredible young man".
