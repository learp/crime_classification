Shafiollah Shaida, 34, manages the Pizza Go Go takeaway in Wellingborough Road, ­Northampton, one of the ­outlets police identified as linked to the smuggling ring.In common with many of the Afghans arrested working in the pizza gang's premises, Sahida paid people smugglers to get him into the UK. He arrived here in 2000 after a journey overland from his home in Afghanistan in the backs of lorries and said he now has refugee status in the UK."I used an agent in Afghanistan to get here," he said. "It cost $10,000 (£6,245) even back in 2000 and took me two-and-a-half months to get here. I could not say exactly which route we took as it was in the backs of lorries and we were smuggled at night time. We would stop and change lorries at night in places I could not recognise. The ­journey was very hard indeed."He said he met Niazi in Rochester in Kent where the two worked in a pizza outlet before he moved on, ending up in Northampton."He was a very quiet person, polite and good-mannered," he said. "We had no idea they were doing this big ­smuggling operation".Today, most of his team in his busy branch of Pizza Go Go making and delivering pizzas are still Afghans. "This is a very hard job," he said."We have to shut the shop at 2am and we are cleaning until 3am. It ishard work for little pay and there are not many workers here who want todo it."
