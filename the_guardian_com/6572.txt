Investigators are warning that the proliferation of indecent images online and the spread of high-speed internet connections are putting more children at risk.The Child Exploitation and Online Protection (Ceop) centre in its annual report on Tuesday warns that there is a consequence to the proliferation of paedophile material on the internet.Peter Davies from Ceop revealed it is one of four key threats to children the agency is tackling. Ceop released its annual report as Stuart Hazell, 37, was being sentenced for the murder of 12-year-old Tia Sharp in Croydon, south London. Hazell had accessed indecent images of children and incest websites before sexually assaulting and killing Sharp last August.Ceop also revealed that the number of children rescued from sexual abusers had risen by 85% last year to 790. The figure is the highest since Ceop was launched in 2006. Some 2,255 children have been safeguarded since then.The annual report revealed Ceop dealt with 18,887 reports of abuse from the public and industry – a 14% increase on the previous year with an average of 1,600 reports per month.Davies said the four key threats to children in the coming year were:• The proliferation of indecent images of children – particularly the production of still, moving and live-streaming of child abuse images.• Online child sexual exploitation – with a focus on the systematic sexual exploitation of multiple child victims on the internet.• Transnational child sexual abuse – including both transient and resident UK nationals and British citizens committing sexual offences abroad.• Contact child sexual abuse – particularly the threat posed by organised crime-associated child sexual exploitation and the risks around missing children.The latter threat relates to criminal gangs targeting children in cases such as the Rochdale grooming ring and Operation Revolver which uncovered gangs of men abusing girls they had met and groomed on the streets of Derby.
