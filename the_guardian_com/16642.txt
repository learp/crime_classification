The parents of Madeleine McCann are facing up to the possibility that she is dead but cling to the hope that their next phone call will tell them she has been found alive, their spokesman said today.Clarence Mitchell spoke of Gerry and Kate McCann's "turmoil" over losing their four-year-old daughter, which he said had been made many times worse by their being made official suspects in the case."They are a family facing possible bereavement. They hope desperately that the next phone call is 'We have found her and she's OK,'" Mr Mitchell told a press conference in Rothley, the McCanns' home village in Leicestershire."I am not naive but that is still a possibility. It's turmoil at times. It's every parent's worst nightmare. And then to have that extra pressure heaped upon them. It's the worst situation times two, times 10."The McCanns have said they will continue to believe that their daughter is alive until evidence proves otherwise.After Madeleine's disappearance on May 3, the parents said they would feel guilty for the rest of their lives about leaving her in the holiday apartment in the Algarve's Praia da Luz resort. The McCanns believe Madeleine was taken from her bed while they dined in a restaurant next door.It was reported earlier today that the family had hired a private security firm with extensive experience of kidnapping situations to help find Madeleine.A source close to the couple's legal team told reporters that Control Risks Group had been working with the family since May and is in regular contact."You can assume that Control Risks are doing some of the things that the Portuguese police can't do," the source said.An insurance expert founded the company in the 1970s, utilising former SAS soldiers to help combat the kidnapping threat to businessmen in south America.Control Risks describes itself as a "leading international business risk consultancy", helping corporate, governmental and non-governmental organisations.The firm's website says that over the past 32 years it has worked in more than 130 countries for more than 5,000 customers. Its main clients are multinational firms and government departments and employs some 200 security staff in southern Iraq, mainly protecting Foreign Office and Department for International Development personnel.
