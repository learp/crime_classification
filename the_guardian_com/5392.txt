Scotland Yard yesterday attacked the BBC's standards and ethics after an official report found no evidence to support allegations in a BBC documentary that the force covered up claims that a corrupt officer thwarted the hunt for Stephen Lawrence's murderers.The Guardian has learned that the Independent Police Complaints Commission report will exonerate the Yard over BBC claims that the Metropolitan police kept vital testimony about a corrupt officer from the public inquiry into why the first murder investigation was bungled.After being cleared by the IPCC on every charge, the Yard last night accused the BBC of lacking balance, hype and ignoring evidence available before the programme was broadcast that one of its central allegations was wrong. The corporation said it was standing by its reporting and it was "in the public interest" to report the allegations.Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in April 1993 at a bus stop in south-east London. The Macpherson inquiry found that Met's errors and racism meant his killers are still free despite a torrent of early information pointing to five prime suspects. In July 2006 the BBC broadcast allegations by a former detective that Detective Sergeant John Davidson, a senior officer in the first Lawrence murder team, was bribed by the gangster father of one of the prime suspects.Mr Davidson denies the claims that he was in the pay of Clifford Norris, whose son David was one of the main suspects.Neil Putnam, who was jailed for corruption, went on to allege that he first alerted Scotland Yard about Mr Davidson's corrupt role in 1998. The IPCC describes as "unsubstantiated" Mr Putnam's allegation that he told police officers of a corrupt link between Clifford Norris and Mr Davidson.The IPCC also says there is no basis to the most serious allegation in the BBC documentary, that the Yard had kept Mr Putnam's allegations of corruption in the Lawrence investigation from the Macpherson inquiry.The IPCC says: "There is no evidence to suggest that the Metropolitan police withheld information concerning the integrity of Davidson from the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. In fact it is clear from the correspondence obtained during the investigation that the MPS ensured Sir William Macpherson was aware of the emerging facts concerning the allegations around Davidson."The IPCC also says it cannot establish a "link" between Mr Davidson, Clifford Norris "or any corruption in the original Stephen Lawrence murder investigation". The IPCC report concludes: "We have found no evidence in support of the 'allegations' made during the programme." What particularly angered the police was that as well as being the subject of a prime-time documentary, they also led the BBC's 10 o'clock news and Newsnight, and were reported across several BBC networks in an attempt to set the news agenda.Scotland Yard said: "We were disappointed that the BBC compounded the issue by choosing to utilise the full weight of their very powerful publicity machinery to inflate disproportionately the importance and value of their findings about alleged corruption."A senior Yard insider told the Guardian: "It was sensationalism, it was arrogant. They became blinkered into believing what they wanted to believe. They were determined to have this story and discounted evidence to the contrary, which is what bad detectives do."In a statement the BBC said: "The police investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence is one of the most high profile criminal investigations of the last two decades and is of overwhelming public interest. We considered it our duty to bring these serious allegations before the public and fully reflect the response of the police. We stand by the journalism of the programme."Imran Khan, solicitor for Stephen's mother, Doreen Lawrence, said the family had no faith in the IPCC: "The report does not get to the bottom of this issue, and it is a wasted opportunity. It is a bit rich of the Met to bash the BBC." The IPCC report reveals that a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer who worked on police corruption cases claimed he knew of an association between Mr Davidson and Clifford Norris, but had no documents to back this up.The report does reveal that the Met investigated the possibility that corruption might have blighted the first investigation, but found no evidence.
