A 13-year-old girl has been accused of "terrorising" vulnerable shoppers in a series of violent mobile phone robberies which repeated court appearances have failed to stop.The powerfully built girl, who stands 5ft 9in tall, is alleged to have absconded or taken leave from children's homes after successive remands, only to be arrested and returned to court following further phone muggings. She faces eight charges of robbery in central Leeds and detectives are questioning her about another recent incident. Her case may be one of the first tests in juvenile courts of the tough new approach to mobile phone theft ordered last week by the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf. West Yorkshire police said yesterday that problems over the girl's allegedly repeated offences stemmed from magistrates' limited powers to remand very young defendants in secure homes if they have no previous conviction. Lord Woolf's guidelines calling for longer sentences for mobile phone robbery specifically said that they should be used regardless of the offender's age or record. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with attacks on phone users ranging from a 15-year-old girl to a woman aged 29. She is also accused of operating in Leeds's busy pedestrianised shopping precinct with another 13-year-old girl, who is accused of four robberies and a public order offence. The second girl is also being questioned about three further phone thefts. The Woolf guidelines were put into action immediately in London this week, when a phone thief who robbed and beat a 16-year-old boy was given four years in jail. A 19-year-old from Bradford, Tim Lee, was yesterday recovering from stab wounds received this week when he fought back after two men attacked him for his mobile phone.
