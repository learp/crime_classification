It was a curious case. In the dock: a senior officer from Greater Manchester police (GMP) who was once so highly regarded by the force that they used him on a recruitment poster.

It was, he told the Guardian afterwards, the culmination of a two-year “orchestrated smear campaign” waged against him by some elements of GMP.The 48-year-old has been suspended on full pay for more than two years while officers from GMP’s professional standards division carried out a string of investigations into him. He claims he was exonerated of all of the allegations, which included claims of money laundering, fiddling his mileage claims and dodging council tax. Now, the Guardian learns, Buttress has got his job back. “We have lifted his suspension and are assisting his return to work,” said a force spokesman on Friday.Perhaps remarkably, Buttress insists he is keen to resume his police career within the same force he accused in court of putting him through “hell”.He will start at an office job in Stretford once he is assessed as fit to work by the force medical examiner.
