James Hanratty (25) was hanged at Bedford Prison yesterday for the A6 murder. Hanratty, a Roman Catholic, was visited by Father Hulme, a Roman Catholic padre, half an hour before his execution.A crowd of 200 stood silently outside the prison. It included three Oxford students who had kept a vigil of protest all night. Their banners read "No legal murder" and "Hanging is no answer." Another banner, carried by a member of the Plymouth Brethren read: "Thus said the Lord, be sure your sin will find you out."A verdict that Hanratty was judicially executed in accordance with law was later returned by a jury at an inquest at the prison. Dr Rhys Oliver, the prison medical officer, said he was present when the death sentence was carried out. In his opinion, death was by hanging and was instantaneous.
