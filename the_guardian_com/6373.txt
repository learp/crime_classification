Prostitution should be legalised in order to protect sex workers from assault, exploitation and drug dependency, the editor of the British Medical Journal said today.Allowing prostitutes to work in licensed premises would help prevent child prostitution, people trafficking and slavery, Fiona Godlee, the journal's editor, said.Writing in the BMJ, she welcomed the government's plan to allow three prostitutes to work legally in so-called "mini-brothels", but said this did not go far enough to make sex work safe.The prime minister's official spokesman last week insisted that allowing three prostitutes to work together did not equate to legalising brothels.However, Dr Godlee said: "It is surely time for an end to the arguments of moral opprobrium and for some bolder steps towards legalisation if we are to improve public health and human rights."She also backed research, published in the latest edition of the BMJ, which warned that the government's new plans to cut street prostitution would threaten the health of sex workers.The researchers - Petra Boynton, of University College London, and Linda Cusick, of the University of Paisley, said sex workers would be reluctant to report abuses or seek help to tackle drug problems as long as prostitution was illegal."Currently, children are sexually abused, people are trafficked and enslaved, and vulnerable individuals, including those with drug dependency or mental health conditions, are coerced and controlled, often by organised criminal gangs," they said."Neither adult sex workers nor clients dare to report these abuses for fear of exposing their own involvement in sex work."The researchers said a licensing system would help ensure that children were not employed in brothels, sex workers were not in possession of drugs and foreign nationals had work permits.They added that the government's proposed crackdown on street prostitution and kerb crawling would displace sex work to less safe locations where women would have to solicit more directly and would spend more time on the streets."These conditions are directly linked to increased violence, pressure to abandon safer sex practices, and increased public disorder, including vigilante attacks," the researchers said.
