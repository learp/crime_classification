The body of an elderly woman stolen from her grave by animal rights activists was reburied today more than nine years after she was originally laid to rest.Relatives of Gladys Hammond gathered at St Peter's church in Yoxall, Staffordshire, to see her remains reinterred 18 months after her body was removed from the churchyard.Mrs Hammond was returned to the ground after a small service of reading, prayers and some of her favourite hymns, attended only by members of her immediate family.The Reverend Jenny Lister, who conducted today's service as well as Mrs Hammond's original funeral, said she had been "shocked and numbed" by what had happened.Speaking outside the church after the service, she said: "Nothing in my training or experience as a parish priest has prepared me to deal with such a serious desecration of a grave."She thanked the "caring and loving" local community for their unity in supporting Mrs Hammond's family through their ordeal.In a statement read out following the service, Mrs Hammond's daughters, Janet Palmer and Margaret Hall, said: "The past 18 months have been dreadful."We are extremely relieved to have been able to return our mum to her resting place at St Peter's. We hope that life for us, and the local community, can now return to normal as we start to put these awful events behind us."Staffordshire police said the churchyard would remain closed throughout the day to give the family peace and privacy.The remains of Mrs Hammond, who was 82 when she died in 1997, were found on Cannock Chase, an area of heathland in the Midlands, earlier this month.Mrs Hammond was the mother-in-law of Chris Hall, who ran Darley Oaks Farm in Newchurch, Staffordshire with his brother John. The farm bred guinea pigs for medical research.Three animal rights activists were jailed this month for their part in a six-year campaign of violence and intimidation against her family, which culminated in the theft of her body in October 2004.The farm's owners, their relatives and farm staff had their homes attacked with firebombs, paint stripper poured over their cars and bricks thrown through their windows.The intimidation proved too much for the family and they stopped breeding guinea pigs in January.Detective Chief Inspector Nick Baker, who led the police investigation, said: "It is hard to imagine how it must feel to have to bury a loved one for a second time."We hope they draw comfort from knowing that Mrs Hammond has been safely returned, and that it gives them the strength to put such a shocking ordeal behind them."John Ablewhite, 36, Kerry Whitburn, 36, and John Smith, 39, were each jailed for 12 years earlier this month after pleading guilty to conspiring to blackmail the Hall family.Josephine Mayo, 38, was jailed for four years after admitting to a more minor role in the six-year campaign.
