A nurse found tied up in the boot of her car wearing just her nightclothes may have been there for up to 10 days, detectives said yesterday. Magdeline Makola, 38, was reported missing by colleagues after she failed to show up for work at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. She was last seen finishing a shift at the hospital at 8am on 15 December.During the time she was missing her credit cards were used and last night police said they were looking for a black man who had been introduced to Makola a number of years ago.A widespread search for her red Vauxhall Astra ended when the vehicle was found on Boxing Day in Meadowside Place, Airdrie, 20 miles from her house. Officers who heard noises coming from the boot discovered the nurse after breaking in through the windows. Despite suffering from hypothermia, dehydration, trauma and superficial injuries, including scratches to her face, she appeared otherwise unharmed.Makola, a naturalised British citizen who came to Britain six years ago from South Africa, was taken to Monklands Hospital in Airdrie where she was guarded by police officers until detectives were able to question her about her ordeal yesterday.A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said the nurse was "severely traumatised" and they were looking for a black man, aged between 20 and 40 with dreadlocks. Although the man was not Makola's boyfriend he was known to her, having been introduced by a mutual friend about five years ago. Police said the vehicle had been seen on the M8 motorway between Edinburgh and Glasgow, in the centre of Glasgow and in Chapelhall, Airdrie, during the time Makola was missing.A statement from NHS Lanarkshire yesterday said that Makola was "stable and comfortable". One neighbour described her as quiet but friendly. "She kept herself to herself but would smile and say hello when I saw her. It sounds like she's had an awful time."
