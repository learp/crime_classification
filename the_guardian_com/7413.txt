The search for missing Madeleine McCann is winding down more than nine months after she vanished, the Portuguese authorities said today.The Portuguese justice minister, Alberto Costa, told a parliamentary commission in Lisbon the police investigation into the four-year-old's disappearance was nearing its end."We are at a stage now where we are approaching the conclusion of the process," he said.Costa said he could not provide any details of the investigation launched after Madeleine vanished on May 3 last year while on holiday with her family in the coastal resort of Praia da Luz.Clarence Mitchell, the spokesman for the girl's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, said: "I am not going to react specifically to what the justice minister has said to parliament."However, if the case is coming to a conclusion, we hope it will conclude shortly with the finding of Madeleine and her being reunited with her parents. That is the only satisfactory conclusion for us."Costa was questioned by MPs about comments by Alipio Ribeiro, the head of Portugal's national Policia Judicia, suggesting detectives had been "hasty" in treating Gerry and Kate McCann as suspects.Costa said there was no indication Ribeiro had broken Portugal's secrecy laws banning public discussion of ongoing cases.Last month, the Portuguese attorney general granted detectives an extra three months to pursue their inquiries. Police said they requested the extension because of the "unusual complexity" of the case.
