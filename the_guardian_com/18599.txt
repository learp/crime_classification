Senior officers are bracing themselves for the publication next week of the most damning official report into policing in modern Britain since Lord Scarman's devastating critique into the causes of the inner city riots, 20 years ago.The pending publication of the inquiry into the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence has already concentrated the minds of senior police officers across Britain. In preparation for the biggest upheaval in the service in years, they have queued up in the past few weeks to an-nounce initiatives to prove their commitment to what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, has called "an anti-racist police service".When the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, set up Sir William Macpherson's inquiry, he privately told friends that there was a lot more to come out, not only about the details of that tragic investigation but about the very nature of policing in Britain.Even before its publication, Sir William's report has had a major impact - with Sir Paul, Britain's most senior police officer, having to publicly defend his job.Others in the criminal justice system have tried to divert attention by claiming that the Home Office is suppressing research into the true scale of crime by black youths. The Police Federation has complained that senior officers have failed to defend the force from the "blanket charge of racism" from "people who have been crucifying the service".But as Mr Straw made clear last week before the House of Commons home affairs committee, a response to the Lawrence report is needed from every police force in Britain, including those in the "mainly white" shires of England and Wales.The response will not only cover the specific details of the failures of the Met's investigation into the Lawrence murder but more fundamental questions about police training, about the way race-hate crimes are reported and pursued, and about how the police deal with victims and their families. As John Grieve, the head of the Metropolitan Police's violent and racial crimes unit, put it: "I want to go out and nick a few racists."A Guardian/ICM opinion poll last week highlighted the extent of the crisis of public confidence in the police. Its disturbing finding that one in four people believe most police officers are racist underlined Sir Paul's warning that "the problem of racism in the service is real, significant and must be addressed", and could not be dismissed as "just a few bad apples".This grim analysis is confirmed in the HM Inspectorate of Police report, to be published alongside the inquiry, which shows that almost every police force in Britain is failing in its duty to recruit and retain black or Asian officers. Only three of the 43 forces are officially seen to be making sufficient effort.The inspectorate found that only 2 per cent of the service in England and Wales 2,483 officers are from ethnic minorities. Mr Straw will demand next week that the figure moves swiftly towards the 7 per cent that black and Asian people comprise in the general population. He also wants forces which cover inner city areas with high ethnic populations to have proportionately higher numbers of ethnic police officers.The Home Secretary regards it as a scandal that eight police forces have fewer than seven black or Asian officers each.The drive for new ethnic recruitment targets will not be confined to the police. Similar targets will be announced for the whole criminal justice system, including the prisons and in Whitehall, as ministers try to grapple with persistent complaints about the lack of black faces in senior positions.Some of the most fundamental changes will take place in police training. Race relations training will be extended to all 127,000 police officers in Britain.Convicted racists will go through new "anti-racism offending behaviour programmes" pioneered by the West Midlands probation service, which has tried to tackle even the most hardened member of extreme rightwing racist and violent groups, such as Combat 18.At the same time a new national system is expected to be set up to identify the racial background of all victims of crime, to reveal the full extent of racist crime.
