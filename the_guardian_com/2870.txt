The Crown Prosecution Service has apologised to a woman over failings that led to the collapse of an assault trial in which she was the alleged victim.It is the second time in a month that the CPS has apologised to alleged victims after trials have collapsed.The woman, who wants to be known only as Diya, was waiting to give evidence against her alleged attacker, at Ealing magistrates court in west London, when she saw him walk free after the CPS lawyer had offered no evidence.Diya, who is in her 30s, said that the experience had ruined her life."They have taken away my right to give evidence, my day in court, my right for closure, everything. Now they are telling me the case can't be re-opened. I've been going through hell."The defendant, who she had a brief relationship with, began harassing her and was eventually charged with assault and harassment.As she prepared to give evidence against him in court, she asked if she could use special measures to testify from behind a screen, but she was told that they had not been requested in time.She said she would go ahead and give evidence without screens. But as she approached the courtroom, she saw the defendant thanking his defence team and walking free.She then learned that the CPS lawyer had offered no evidence and the defendant had been formally acquitted."I went into the court and asked what was going on. They said it was a matter between me and the prosecutor. I demanded answers from the prosecutor but he did not reply," she said. "I was in despair. I was left crying on the floor."Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for the CPS in London, said: "I would like to offer my apologies to the complainant in this case as it is clear that she did not receive the service to which she was entitled and which we provide as a matter of policy."I have asked for a full inquiry into the circumstances which led to our decision to offer no evidence in this case. Once that is concluded, I will offer to meet with the complainant to advise her of the steps we have taken to ensure these unsatisfactory circumstances are not repeated."Last month, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) apologised to another woman for "failings" in the trial of a man accused of sexually assaulting her.The woman, who was awarded Â£16,000 in damages, was wrongly blamed for the collapse of the case against her alleged attacker.
