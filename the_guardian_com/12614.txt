When the people of Kent are calling on us to take a tougher line on criminal damage, we are, of course, going to act when someone smashes the window of a moving car, whatever their age or intention (Police's icy response to child's snowball, February 4).Readers should imagine themselves in this situation: driving along when something suddenly shatters the back window. This is very frightening and potentially very dangerous. Because the driver in this case was an off-duty special constable - someone who gives his time voluntarily - he knew how to respond. He acted in the way I would expect every Kent officer to. To portray the event as trivial is missing the point. Had the person responsible been a 16-year-old boy wearing a hooded top, and had the driver been a mother with a toddler in the back seat, we would have been condemned if we hadn't acted. Criminal damage is a big concern and a recent survey we carried out shows it is one of the things young people worry about most. In this case, we decided not to prosecute for criminal damage because we felt a formal reprimand was enough. This does not leave Miss Hodges with a criminal record, as you suggested, although details remain on police files until she is 18. We hope she has learned her lesson.
