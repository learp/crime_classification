For decades, it has been a sunnier home from home for scores of Britain's most notorious villains. But their sangria sipping days could be over if a new campaign targeting expatriate criminals on the Costa del Sol is successful.Crimestoppers, the UK crimefighting charity, has set up a dedicated Spanish telephone line to gather anonymous tipoffs about British gangsters believed to have fled to the tourist haven.The Málaga coast is as famous for some of its former residents - such as M25 road-rage killer Kenneth Noye and Security Express robber Ronnie Knight - as it is for its beautiful scenery.The UK and Spanish authorities believe some of Britain's most dangerous men are holed up there, and that they are carrying on with their criminal careers.Crimestoppers is circulating descriptions of British suspects believed to be on the Costa del Sol and urging law-abiding expats to shop their criminal neighbours with impunity by ringing the confidential hotline set up as part of a three-month pilot project, Operation Captura. Those featured on the Crimestoppers website, with photographs and descriptions, include James Hurley, the convicted killer of a police officer who made his getaway while being transferred from one prison to another, and Clifford Hobbs, who escaped on his way to court to face charges for a £1.25m security van heist. Others are wanted for kidnapping and murder, drug trafficking and counterfeiting.British and Spanish police are working with the Foreign Office and Spanish telecoms company Telefonica on the Captura scheme.About 17 people are arrested every day in the UK as a result of information given to Crimestoppers, and one a week is charged with murder, so police are optimistic about the Spanish scheme.Dave Cording, Crimestoppers' director of operations, said: "These criminals are living a charmed life in Spain, avoiding arrest, and some are still committing serious crimes. We particularly want to promote this campaign to the law-abiding British expat community in Spain, some of whom may unknowingly be living next door to a wanted criminal."The Spanish freephone number - 900 555 111 - will put local callers through to English-speaking handlers in the UK, to whom they can talk in privacy."You can help expose these criminals and stop them carrying on with their criminal activity here in Spain and in the UK," said Mr Cording, a retired chief superintendent of Surrey police. "Call us safely and anonymously. Your call will not be traced or recorded."Michael McDonagh, an acting superintendent with the Metropolitan police, said: "The Met is fully supportive of this project and this valuable partnership. We always find Crimestoppers' role, providing us with anonymous information, is a vital route to tracking down the most wanted criminals."There has been an extradition treaty in place between Britain and Spain since 1985, and the introduction of European arrest warrants in 2004 has simplified and speeded up the process of bringing British citizens back to the UK for trial.Five of the fugitivesJames HurleyJailed for life over the shooting murder of Hertfordshire constable Frank Mason during a robbery.
