Thousands of probation officers across England and Wales are due to stage a 24-hour strike from midday on Tuesday in protest at plans to privatise 70% of their work.The National Association of Probation Officers (Napo) said it expected 7,500 of its members to take part in what is only the fourth such strike in the probation service's 106-year history.Ian Lawrence, Napo's general secretary, said: "These are unprecedented times for our members as they fight to save the 106-year-old probation service. They strongly believe, along with other criminal justice agencies and experts that Chris Grayling's plans will undermine public protection and put communities at risk whilst also not providing the adequate service offenders need to turn their lives around."The Ministry of Justice has said that it will put contingency plans in place. It says that more than 700 organisations from across the world have expressed an interest in the contracts.The justice secretary has invited private companies, charities and probation "mutuals" to bid to take over the supervision of 225,000 medium and low-risk offenders on a payment-by-results basis.Under the plan, 21 "community rehabilitation companies" will supervise those released from prison and those serving community punishments. For the first time 50,000 short-term prisoners will also get "through the gate" supervision and help. A smaller national probation service will be responsible for managing high-risk offenders and public protection cases.The chairs of three probation trusts, which are to be abolished in April under the plans, have written to Grayling to demand a six-month delay claiming the current timetable, which will ensure the changes are embedded before the general election, will put public safety and lives at risk.The strike comes as the Serious Fraud Office announced it had launched a formal criminal investigation into two major potential bidders, G4S and Serco, in connection with allegations of overcharging worth tens of millions of pounds on their existing justice ministry contracts to provide electronic tagging of offenders.Lawrence said: "It is wholly unacceptable that these two companies are allowed to bid for the Probation Service while still under investigation for fraud regarding tagging and given their recent track records with the Olympics, private prisons and prison transport."The probation service is possibly the best performing public service we have, meeting and exceeding all government targets, reducing re-offending and being awarded the British gold award for excellence in 2011."Justice minister Jeremy Wright has described the strike as "in favour of the status quo and high reoffending rates".
