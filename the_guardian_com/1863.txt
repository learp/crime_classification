Joint raids in France and Spain have broken up a sophisticated people-smuggling network being operated throughout Europe that had been transporting Chinese illegal migrants mainly to the UK and US.The arrest of about 75 people, 51 of them in Spain, including two of the organisation's masterminds, dismantled an international criminal network that was charging €40,000-€50,000 (£34,000-£43,000) to transport illegal immigrants from China and provide them with false papers.According to Spanish police sources the same network, which had been under investigation since 2011, was also implicated in sex trafficking.The gang allegedly used Barcelona as a stopping-off point for illegal migrants while false documents were prepared.In addition to the arrests, police said they had found dozens of fake passports, for countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Singapore.Investigators depicted a complex hierarchical network, consisting of largely independent cells, whose ultimate bosses were based in China. Gang members based in China recruited would-be migrants, and accompanied them throughout the voyage, disguising them as tourists to cross international borders.A police statement said: "Spain was the last step, the springboard for the [migrants'] final destination, usually the UK or the US."
