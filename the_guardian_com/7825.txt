The soldier who was killed in the knife attack in Woolwich has been named as Drummer Lee Rigby, of the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.The Ministry of Defence released his details on Thursday, a day after the stabbing near the barracks in south London where he had been stationed.The MoD confirmed that Rigby, 25, was the father of a two-year-old boy, Jack. The drummer was born in Manchester and joined the army seven years ago.He initially served in Cyprus, but returned to the UK to stand guard outside the royal palaces as part of his battalion's "public duties commitment".Three years ago, he was sent to Afghanistan as a member of the Fire Support Group in Patrol Base Woqab in Helmand province.Lieutenant Colonel Jim Taylor, commanding officer of the Second Fusiliers, said: "Drummer Lee Rigby was a dedicated and professional soldier. He was a real character within the Second Fusiliers. Larger than life, he was at the heart of our corps of drums."An experienced and talented side drummer and machine gunner, he was a true warrior and served with distinction in Afghanistan, Germany and Cyprus. His ability, talent and personality made him a natural choice to work in the recruiting group."He will be sorely missed by everyone in the Second Fusiliers. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this incredibly difficult time. Once a fusilier, always a fusilier."
