A leaked report into the prison service has accused more than 1,000 officers of corruption - prompting claims the system is "institutionally corrupt".It says staff are involved in a range of crooked practices, from bringing mobile phones and drugs into jail to accepting cash payments from inmates for transfers to less secure prisons.The document, which was leaked to the BBC, also found that in many cases even when evidence emerges no action is taken to tackle the problem.It concludes that only a minority of employees are involved, and that most staff operate in an honest way.But Mark Leech, editor of The Prisons Handbook, the annual guide to the penal system in England and Wales, said the report revealed the service was "institutionally corrupt".The study, by the Metropolitan police, states that corruption often starts with "inappropriate relationships" between prisoners and staff - and that there are currently nearly 500 such relationships.Other staff members have moved on to more serious corruption, including smuggling drugs into jails, it said.As part of the inquiry, police visited senior prison service officials, including area managers and governors.One area manager told them he knew of 70 reports filed by officers identifying colleagues as corrupt that had never been referred to headquarters, and that no action had ever been taken as a result.Mr Leech said: "This report reveals that what was claimed to be a few isolated cases of corruption is in fact the tip of a huge iceberg of dishonest practices that has infected the prison service nationwide."The report shows that what the prison service currently has in place to tackle corruption is woefully short of what is actually needed."The report quotes one unnamed prison boss as saying: "Here corruption is endemic... I've identified over 20 corrupt staff, but there may be more."Another says: "I currently have 10 corrupt staff and I am managing the threat they pose to my prison. Positive mandatory drug testing figures are over 20%, so it must be staff bringing in drugs."Prison service director-general Phil Wheatley acknowledged that there was a problem, but insisted it was being tackled.He added police should continue to investigate allegations of corruption, and there was no need to create a new specialist force to deal with the issue.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I have no doubt that we have to regard this as something that is serious and work hard at it."There is always a problem about bent staff. It is an ongoing problem with prisons. We need to be alert to it."However, he added that the prison service had recently experienced record low levels of escapes and positive results in mandatory drug tests.He described corrupt officers as a "small but important minority" of staff and said action was being taken in cases "up and down the country".He also rejected suggestions that prison officers fail to report one another for corrupt practices out of loyalty."Most prison staff hate those who are corrupt," he said. "They are dangerous to you, they may bring in a weapon that could be used against you. So there is no loyalty to people behaving in this way."Brian Caton, general secretary of the Prison Officers' Association, said there were approximately 19,000 prison officers currently working in England and Wales.He said: "The most irresponsible thing I find in this is that the prison service seem to understand that there is this amount of corrupt prison officers, and are prepared to do not much about it."He blamed the high level of corruption on poor pay and an inadequate recruitment process.However, he also acknowledged that his organisation had a part to play in tackling corruption.He told the Today programme: "If the prison service has sat on this report, or was aware in any way that there is corruption to this extent and inappropriate relationships to this extent, I find it absolutely unforgivable that they have done nothing about it and certainly haven't discussed it with us."I joined the prison service in 1977. It was then a stricter vetting process, a lot stricter interview process to get into the prison service than the police, for obvious reasons."Criminology professor Tim Newburn, of the London School of Economics, carried out a report on corruption for the prison service six years ago.He told Today: "This is an institutionalised, widespread set of misbehaviours - albeit by a very small minority of staff - with a significant problem for control, order, discipline and crucially for ethical conduct within the prison service."
