   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Scotland Yard has released CCTV footage of two police officers who were mown down as they chased looters during last week's riots.The officers were hit by a green Citroen that was driven at them at high speed in Waltham Forest, north east London, as they dealt with reports of a group looting a clothing store at around 1am last Monday.Detectives investigating the attempted murder of the officers said the footage has been released to encourage people to come forward and identify those responsible.A Scotland Yard spokesman said the Citroen was driven at the PCs, who are both based at Paddington Green police station, in Royston Avenue as they tried to deal with reports of looting at the Aristocrats clothing store on Chingford Mount Road.One suffered knee and leg injuries and the other sustained shoulder injuries, the spokesman said. They were both taken to hospital and are recovering at home while they wait for further specialist treatment.The spokesman said one officer was hit so hard that some of his body armour came off and can be seen lying in the middle of the road after the collision.After the incident, the car, which has the registration number Y132 GHJ, turned right on to Chingford Mount Road and right again on to New Road before it was lost.Police said the unknown number of occupants have still not been identified and officers are trying to trace them.Detective Inspector Cliff Haines said: "We are treating this as attempted murder. "These individuals clearly had no regard for the safety of the officers or anyone else in their path."Judging from the footage and the speed at which this car is being driven, I can only assume that the intention was to cause serious harm and injury."It is only sheer luck the officers did not sustain more serious injuries."He urged anyone with any information that could identify the people in the car to contact the Operation Withern incident room on 020 8345 4142 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
