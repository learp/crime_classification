A British nurse arrested as part of an international investigation into cannibalism has insisted his involvement was because of "fantasy" and his "stupid" online writing.Dale Bolinger said he had written "stupid things" online because it was "funny".The 57-year-old is being investigated over alleged links to American police officer Gilberto Valle, who is on trial in the US accused of conspiring to kidnap, kill and eat six women he knew.The 28-year-old denies the charges but the New York court has heard he was in online contact with a Briton who seemed to be acting as a mentor on cannibalism.Bolinger, of Canterbury, Kent, was arrested on 21 February on suspicion of conspiracy offences, but also on suspicion of grooming and possession of child abuse images along with another man.The nurse told the Times: "None of this is real. It is all fantasy. I have spoken to the police and they are undertaking inquiries."He added: "It was my stupidity. Because of going online and saying stupid things and putting stupid things about, thinking that it was funny."The father-of-two has reportedly been suspended by employer East Kent Hospitals University NHS foundation trust.Bolinger was unavailable to comment at his end-of-terrace home.A Kent police spokesman said: "Two men, aged 57 and 30, from the Canterbury area were arrested on February 21 for conspiracy offences, grooming and possession of child abuse images."The two men are currently on police bail whilst inquiries continue."Kent police has been in contact with US law enforcement agencies in relation to this investigation. We can confirm it is in relation to the Gilberto Valle case in the US."James Godden, 31, who lives near Bolinger, told Kent Online: "We saw police here from about 7am last Thursday and they were all day."They had forensics teams and sniffer dogs in the house. We don't know him and have never really seen him."
