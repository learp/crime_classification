Gun crime in England and Wales dropped by 14% last year, the murder rate was down by 9% and overall crime has remained broadly stable, according to Home Office figures published yesterday.But ministers face worrying signs of persistent problems in street crime, with the number of armed street robberies rising by 9% to 1,439 attacks, and increases in drug offences and vandalism.The quarterly crime figures also show the government is struggling to reassure the public over antisocial behaviour problems, with four out of the seven indicators used - including those saying drug users, teenagers hanging around and people being drunk or rowdy are a big problem in their area - are all going in the wrong direction.The annual homicide and gun crime figures published yesterday reveal the decline of the traditional armed robbery, with raids on banks, post offices and building societies all falling sharply over the past 10 years. Alarmingly, however, this has been accompanied by a 46% rise in the use of firearms in residential robberies to 645 cases in the last year.The three sets of crime figures published yesterday are: offences recorded by the police from July to September 2006 compared with 12 months previously; the latest sweep of the British Crime Survey, (BCS), which interviews 40,000 adults about their experience of crime, covering the same period; and the annual homicide and gun crime figures for the financial year to April 2006.Overall, they show that the risk of becoming a victim of crime in England and Wales has gone up from 23% to 24% but remains at a historically low level after peaking at 40% in 1995.The homicide figures show that 766 people were murdered in 2005-06, including the 52 victims of the July 7 London suicide bombings, a fall of 9% on the previous year. This is the third year in succession that the murder rate in England and Wales has fallen after a sustained 40-year rise from the 1960s, which peaked in 2002-03 at more than 1,000, including the 172 victims of Harold Shipman.The fall in gun crime, down from 11,371 incidents to 9,728 in the year to last September, was welcomed by the Home Office minister Tony McNulty. But he acknowledged the small increase in residential robberies involving firearms: "We have some of the toughest firearms legislation in Europe. Anyone convicted of having a prohibited firearm faces a minimum five-year sentence."The number of people killed in gun attacks was unchanged at 57 - down from a peak of more than 70 two years ago.The rise in armed residential robberies from 345 in 2003-04 to 645 last year is an alarming trend but it may partly be accounted for by a similar decline of 200 incidents recorded by the police as firearm burglaries. The long-term decline in the number of armed robberies on banks, post offices and building societies revealed in the figures spells the death of the elite "blag".The number of armed bank robberies has fallen from 240 in 1995 to only 59 and those involving post offices are also down, from nearly 400 to 108 over the same period. The decline is not explained by branch closures but rather by much improved security measures which have made such premises a "hard target".The total number of armed robberies rose by 10% to 4,120 from 3,674 over the last 12 months but it is still below the peak of nearly 5,500 such attacks five years ago.The quarterly crime figures also show that the police have some way yet to go on street crime, with vandalism rising by 11% to an estimated 2.9m incidents, according to the BCS. The 9% rise in drug offences recorded by the police is believed to be down to a surge in formal warnings for cannabis possession.The police recorded crime figures show a 3% fall in all crime, with the BCS indicating a "statistically insignificant" 4% rise, leaving the impression of a broadly stable crime picture. Both sets of figures continue to show continuing falls in burglary and car crime. Violent crime fell by 1% on police figures and rose 2% according to the BCS.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said that robbery was a serious violent crime and the figures illustrated Labour's continued failure on crime.The Liberal Democrat leader, Menzies Campbell, said they showed that tough talk and endless new legislation had done nothing to make us safer, with street violence and vandalism still rising month by month.Seasonal variationsJanuary is the worst month for domestic burglary, possibly because thieves take a break over Christmas, according to Home Office research. The study of seasonal crime patterns for a decade shows violent assaults, sex crimes, arson and bicycle thefts all peak in the summer and drop during the winter. The opposite seasonal calendar seems to apply to car crime and domestic burglaries, which peak in the winter and go through troughs in the summer. The researchers found 11% more burglaries in January than the annual average. "This may be due to burglars resting over Christmas, then having to over-compensate in January (when there are also more new goods in homes to steal)," the researchers said.
