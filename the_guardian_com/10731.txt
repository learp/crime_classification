A 30-year-old man was jailed for life today for the murder of a young father outside the Ministry of Sound nightclub last August.Ranjit Nankani was told he must serve at least 18 years for deliberately driving a Mitsubishi Shogun 4x4 into Gary Johnson, 25.CCTV pictures of the incident showed how Johnson was struck on the pavement opposite the south London club and thrown into the air. Johnson was then carried along on the bonnet of the vehicle and was partially decapitated as his head struck a wall. He died instantly.A friend of Johnson's, Dwayne McPherson, produced a gun and fired several rounds at Nankani, who was struck by one bullet but survived.Nankani, of Croydon, south London, was found guilty of murder by an 11-1 to majority at the Old Bailey last week. The court heard that on the night of the attack he was at twice the drink-driving limit, having shared between two and four bottles of champagne with his friends, and drunk five or six glasses of brandy and Coke.Nankani waited outside the club after he and his friends had been ejected following an argument in which he was accused of treading on Johnson's toe. It had been claimed someone may have had a gun and threatened Nankani with it, the court heard.Judge Stephen Kramer told Nankani: "What you did must have involved a degree of premeditation. It was a targeted revenge attack on a crowded public street when people were leaving the club to go home."You waited and you used your vehicle as a lethal weapon in the streets."One witness described you as being raging mad, doubtless at what you felt to be the unfair way you and your friends had been treated."What you did was not, as you contended, an accident. The jury have found that your driving was a deliberate, targeted revenge on Gary Johnson."As he was led away to begin his sentence, Nankani shouted: "They were gang members and that gun is still out there. I'm sorry for the death of Mr Johnson."McPherson, 28, of Sydenham, south east London, was convicted of attempted murder and will be sentenced on 10 September.
