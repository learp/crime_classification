The Metropolitan police was seriously flawed in its response to the stabbing of young father Peter Woodhams, who was shot dead seven months later, an investigation has concluded. The 22-year-old had endured a campaign of violence and bullying by a teenage gang, which began in January 2006 when he was slashed across the face and stabbed in the neck.But police failed to take action, and Mr Woodhams was repeatedly shot outside his home in Canning Town, east London, in front of his three-year-old son Sam after he confronted youths who threw a stone at his car.Following his murder last August, the satellite TV engineer's fiancee, Jane Bowden, 24, claimed she had phoned police every day for five weeks after the first attack but officers never took a statement from her.Peter Woodhams had told officers: "I can't go out any more because I am scared. I am scared for Jane and Sam because they can't go out."Last night an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report said "serious flaws" had been identified in the way the Metropolitan police had investigated the stabbing.Two officers are facing disciplinary hearings over their conduct while three received written warnings for their failings, and a detective constable was given "words of advice".The IPCC promised to fully announce the hearing findings once complete.In May, 17-year-old Bradley Tucker was jailed for life at the Old Bailey for murdering Mr Woodhams but nobody has ever been charged with the knife attack.After Tucker's conviction, Mr Woodhams' father, also called Peter, said he was "gobsmacked" about the handling of the earlier attack, and said he held the officers involved "personally responsible" for his son's death. In a victim impact statement read to the court in March, Mrs Bowden said the "vicious and callous" murder had devastated her family."Peter and I had everything to live for - we were a young family getting started in life, setting out on our future together," she said."One minute Peter was our future and within seconds, he is our past. Parents without a son, siblings without a brother, a woman without a partner and, more than anything, a son without a father."Amid the furore that followed the murder, Scotland Yard apologised to the victim's family.
