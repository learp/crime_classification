A sniffer dog searching a second underground chamber at a former children's home in Jersey gave an initial positive "indication", police said today.The dog, which is trained to search for blood and human remains, was sent into the bricked-up room under the Haut de la Garenne home, where a child's skull was unearthed two weeks ago.A Jersey police spokeswoman cautioned against drawing premature conclusions. "The dog has given an indication but it's very close to the scene of the find in the first cellar," she said.Detectives investigating allegations of child torture and sexual abuse in Jersey broke into the second chamber today.The sniffer dog went in through a hole in the ceiling. Police said a forensic team would follow "depending on if anything is found"."Obviously, if [the dog] finds something significant, then that slows down the whole operation. Hopefully we will find a little rubble or an empty room," a spokesman said. It is thought the second room is up to three times the size of the first chamber, which officers entered on February 27. The development came as the island's police said former officers are trying to discredit the investigation.The force said several former officers who had left in recent years following corruption allegations were conducting a smear campaign to rubbish detectives leading the inquiry.More than 160 people have claimed they were beaten, drugged and raped at the home from the 1960s to the 1980s.A Jersey police spokeswoman said a letter or email had been sent to a number of national newspapers aimed at discrediting the inquiry.She said a former officer had also approached a politician connected with the child abuse allegations and warned him not to trust or cooperate with detectives leading the inquiry."We would emphasise that there is at present no evidence to suggest that these officers were involved in any so-called 'cover-up' of former offences of the type being investigated," she said."The focus of the inquiry team remains the detection of people who have committed offences against children and we will not be deflected from this."She said no current Jersey ministers were thought to be involved in the smear campaign.Last week the detective leading the inquiry, deputy police chief Lenny Harper, said he was considering suing the island's health and social services minister, Ben Shenton, for an email in which the politician referred to him as "Lenny Henry". Harper said the email was a "clear attempt to damage the inquiry".Police believe there is a network of four secret rooms at the home but have struggled to access the bricked-up chambers.Fragments of bone, blood spots and graffiti reading "I've been bad for years and years" were found in the first hidden chamber.Police are still awaiting tests on the bone and blood samples to help them trace and date the finds.Investigators apparently expect to make three arrests within a fortnight - two on Jersey and one on the mainland UK.Harper told the Sunday Telegraph police were concerned that one incident could have led to the death of a child."We have a particularly graphic account of an incident which still causes us concern," he said."We can't say that a person definitely died, but if you look at it you have to think there is a strong possibility that the person died â€¦ this person was never seen again."
