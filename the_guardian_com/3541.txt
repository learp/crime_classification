They may not even have known what happened but may have vital evidence, and it is crucial they contact us as soon as possible on [the force's non-emergency contact number] 101."Yesterday's events were truly tragic and it's extremely important everyone comes forward and speaks to us. We will also be able to signpost them to professional agencies who can help them come to terms with being witness to such a tragedy."
