Two new jails are to be built to ease serious overcrowding in the prisons system, the home secretary, John Reid, announced today.In a speech at the site of one of the planned jails - to be built next to the Ashworth high security mental hospital, on Merseyside - Mr Reid said the move would provide an extra 1,300 prison spaces.He said the public wanted more people in prison for their own safety, but warned that this put inevitable pressure on the existing jail system.Planning permission had already been granted for the 600-place Merseyside jail, to be called HMP Kennett, the home secretary said. It is being built in addition to a "temporary" 350-place jail on the site, announced last month and due to open in the spring.The second new prison, with 700 places, is planned for a site next to Belmarsh, in south-east London, although planning permission for the scheme had not yet been granted.While Belmarsh is one of the most secure prisons in the country, holding a number of convicted terrorists, the planned new prison is expected to be a lower risk category C facility.The plans come with the country's prisoner population having exceeded 80,000 for the first time - the highest per capita in western Europe - and Mr Reid said he wanted to create space for at least another 8,000 inmates by 2012.He said the increase in prisoner numbers was due to a series of factors including stiffer sentences, proper enforcement of bail conditions and community sentences and the use of indeterminate sentences.The latter measure alone currently accounted for an extra 2,200 people in jail, and this figure is set to rise to 12,000 by 2012.Mr Reid said the increase in inmate numbers due to indeterminate sentences reflected the desires of the country despite the pressure it put on the system."That is something that the public wants, that the public demands in terms of their own protection, something it is right to do, but something that puts considerable pressure on prison places," he said.He said the recent fatal shootings of three teenage boys in south-east London in less than two weeks emphasised the need for robust law and order policies."When we look at the recent awful, violent, tragic deaths in London and elsewhere, of course we all realise that police action and prison places on their own will not necessarily solve this problem," he said."But the problem will not be solved ... without firm police action, firm powers and sufficient prison places. They are a necessary, though not sufficient part of the solution to some of these awful crimes."The shadow home secretary, David Davis, condemned the plans as "far too little, way too late", complaining that overcrowding meant prisoners were not receiving proper rehabilitation while in jail. For the Liberal Democrats, home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg said the entire policy needed to be re-thought as "Labour's policy of mass incarceration isn't working".After his speech, Mr Reid was due to inspect work on the new temporary facility at Maghull. Hospital wards and office buildings are being refurbished to house adult male offenders, and a secure perimeter fence will be constructed.New prisons cost between £100,000 and £125,000 per place to build, meaning the 8,000 places pledged by 2012 will come with a £1bn price tag.Prison overcrowding has become a serious worry for the Home Office, adding to a series of problems faced by Mr Reid since he took over at the department in May last year.One of the biggest has been the revelation that more than 1,000 foreign prisoners had been freed without first being considered for deportation.Last month, the chief prisons inspector, Anne Owers, said overcrowding and poor planning meant there was a "serious crisis" in the prisons system, which could not be addressed by extra cells alone.Also in January, the Home Office was criticised for advising judges that jail terms should only be given to serious, violent or repeat offenders.
