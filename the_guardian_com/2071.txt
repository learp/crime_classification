The mother of the teenager who murdered Rhys Jones was jailed for three years yesterday after she admitted lying to police during the investigation into the innocent schoolboy's killing.Janette Mercer, 49, who admitted perverting the course of justice, knew her son Sean had told police "a pack of lies" but gave an inaccurate statement to detectives which backed his story.Liverpool crown court was told she supported the false claim of Sean, aged 18, that he was not the owner of a black and silver Hardrock mountain bicycle. The bike had been captured on CCTV being used by the gunman.Rhys, 11, was shot dead by Mercer in Croxteth Park, Liverpool, in August 2007 as he walked home from football practice across a pub car park.Also sentenced yesterday for lying to police were Francis and Marie Yates, the parents of 21-year-old James Yates, who was jailed for his role in helping Mercer try to cover up the murder.The couple, from Croxteth, both admitted to perverting the course of justice. Marie Yates was jailed for 18 months and Francis Yates was given a four and a half year sentence for helping Mercer with a false alibi.Yesterday Judge Henry Globe told Janette Mercer: "Your son was a key suspect in the murder and you knew he had told a pack of lies. You backed him up and you told more lies."Speaking outside court after the hearing, Rhys's parents Stephen and Melanie said they felt they had "finally got complete justice" for their son.They said: "In our eyes Mrs Mercer and Mr and Mrs Yates have always been as guilty as their sons."
