A judge yesterday ordered that a teenager who battered to death a 10-year-old girl after a game of cricket on a summer evening should be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure.Kieron Smith, 18, was convicted last month of the murder of Lauren Pilkington-Smith, who lived near his home in Leigh, Greater Manchester. He will serve a minimum of 15 years.Mr Justice Mackay told Smith, who was 17 at the time of the attack: "You led an empty and aimless life and did nothing to fill your days ... You were an immature young man, but you knew full well how to behave with younger children and you knew what you did that day was wicked beyond belief."Smith, who left school aged 12 and had no friends his own age, led Lauren to woods where he struck the side of her head at least 10 times with a blunt object, possibly a cricket bat. He also beat her with a cable, and pushed a sock into her mouth and twigs into her nostrils. He removed some of her clothes, although there was no evidence of a sexual attack, and then tried to hide her body in the undergrowth. The body was found later that night by her grandfather as relatives searched the area.The judge told Smith he would have to wait 15 years before being considered for parole and warned him that his term, the juvenile equivalent of a life sentence, could be much longer if he continued to claim he was innocent. "[Lauren] viewed you as her friend and playmate and you abused that trust and confidence."Smith had claimed to suffer from Asperger's syndrome, but there was no medical evidence to suggest he had any mental disorder.
