A teenage bully was facing life imprisonment yesterday after being convicted of murdering a man who tried to stop him picking on his son. The 16-year-old boy stabbed the father-of-three through the heart when he confronted him for threatening his son.The Old Bailey heard how the youth and his 14-year-old friend, who was found guilty of blackmail, waged a campaign of intimidation against the victim's 13-year-old son. The pair, who denied the charges, hung round the boy's home last December, demanding he give them Â£20 and a copy of the computer game, Grand Theft Auto. The 14-year-old warned him to hand over the game and the cash or he would kill his father.Neither of the defendants, both from Brixton, south London, can be named because they are juveniles. Judge James Stewart QC also ordered that the bullied boy, who gave evidence against the defendants, should not be identified, meaning his father cannot be named. The court heard the boy told his 35-year-old father about the threats and on December 16, the defendants were again cycling around the boy's home.The father tried to phone police but was put on hold, and, ignoring his wife's and son's pleas, went outside to remonstrate with the pair. The older boy stabbed him with a single wound to the heart. He managed to stagger home, where his family called an ambulance to rush him to hospital, but he died within a couple of hours.When arrested, the 14-year-old at first claimed he cycled off without seeing the stabbing but changed his story when shown CCTV footage, although he denied making threats or demands. The older boy gave a false alibi when arrested, but then changed his story, alleging he drew a Swiss army knife in defence because he thought the father was going to beat him up.Both boys were remanded in custody until October 7 for reports, but the judge warned the 16-year-old that he faced a mandatory life sentence.Detective chief inspector Stuart Cundy said outside court: "This was the callous murder of a man trying to protect his son."
