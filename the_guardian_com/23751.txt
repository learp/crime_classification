A 16-year-old stabbed to death in a London street was today described by his headteacher as a "friendly, gentle and peaceful" boy who the school would greatly miss.Kodjo Yenga was stabbed in the heart and leg on Wednesday evening after reportedly being chased along a street by young people wearing school blazers and shouting "kill him".Paul O'Shea, the principal of St Charles Catholic sixth form college, in west London, said the teenager had an "excellent record" from a school in Hammersmith.He said Kodjo, who had joined the North Kensington college in 2005 and was studying A levels in business, IT, French and design, was "regarded with great affection" by students and teachers."He was a fine young man and we will miss him greatly," he said.A post-mortem examination found that Kodjo, from Notting Hill, west London, died from a single stab wound to the heart.Nine males, aged between 13 and 21, have been arrested over the murder and were today being questioned by police.Today, friends of the schoolboy left flowers, candles and messages at a wall near where he was attacked.The white wall has been transformed into a makeshift shrine with handwritten graffiti tributes in marker pen, most of them addressed to Kodjo's nickname "Kizzle".Natalie Hunter, a friend of the dead teenager, told Sky News: "No one was there to help him. Noone stopped it. I don't understand why kids are killing kids."Things like this have got to stop. He was at college; he had his life in front of him and now he's going to be six feet underground."Another friend described Kodjo's girlfriend as "heartbroken".Detective Superintendent Vic Rae today appealed for witnesses to the "meaningless and despicable crime".He said Kodjo had been walking with his girlfriend in Hammersmith Grove on Wednesday evening when he was approached by a large group of youths."He was then chased, caught, beaten and stabbed," he said. "We are looking at a nightmare come true for one young man and his family and friends."Det Sup Rae said 40 witnesses had already come forward, at least 10 of whom were considered "significant".One resident of Hammersmith, where the stabbing happened, said there was a lot of shouting and screaming in the street."I went outside and saw a crowd of about 10 kids chasing one boy along the road in and out of the cars."Some of them had armed themselves with three-foot wooden sticks from a skip. The boy was backing off, and had his arms up to protect himself while they were whacking him with the sticks."Kodjo was taken to Charing Cross hospital but died shortly after 6pm.Last month, three teenagers were killed in London and a number of other teenagers were stabbed across the country.
