Police were questioning a man last night after a fight between groups of Iraqi Kurds and Turks in Bristol city centre in which seven people were stabbed.Three of the group were taken to hospital suffering from multiple wounds after the clash on Saturday night on the waterfront. Detective Chief Inspector Geoff Spicer of Avon and Somerset police said: "We don't know if it was racially motivated. The victims are Turkish and there is an indication the antagonists may have been Iraqi Kurds. From our initial investigation it would appear like that and it is primarily the Turkish people who ended up in hospital. The man arrested is an Iraqi Kurd. "It is possible there is a racial element between those two groups of men as opposed to a wider racial motive." DCI Spicer said the police were having difficulty communicating with the Turkish men and needed to bring in translators from London. An underwater search team trawled the marina outside the Chicago Rock Cafe looking for a knife which detectives believe was thrown into the water after the fight. DCI Spicer said another knife had been recovered on the waterfront.
