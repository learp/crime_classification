A "foot soldier" who took part in a botched plot to rob and murder the singer Joss Stone has been jailed for 18 years.Junior Bradshaw, 32, accompanied the "mastermind" of the conspiracy, Kevin Liverpool, on a trip to Devon where they planned to kill the 26-year-old soul musician at her remote home.Liverpool was jailed for life earlier this year but on Tuesday Bradshaw was also given a lengthy sentence after the judge rejected the suggestion he lacked the mental capacity to take part in the plot.The pair drove to the West Country from their home in Manchester in a car containing weapons including a samurai sword, hammers and a chisel.They intended to find Stone's home, rob her of £1m they believed she had in a safe, kill her and dump her body in a river.Police stopped the pair after neighbours reported they had seen them acting suspiciously and Bradshaw and Liverpool, 35, were found guilty at Exeter crown court of conspiracy to murder and rob the singer.In mitigation, Martin Meeke QC said Bradshaw had "fundamental intellectual impairment" and was easily influenced by others.But Judge Francis Gilbert QC said the jury's verdict showed it believed Bradshaw knew full well what the purpose of the trip to Devon was. The judge said Bradshaw had the "capacity to join in the conspiracy to murder for purposes of obtaining money" and told Bradshaw: "Liverpool was the instigator and you were the foot soldier, you were a party to what he intended to do."When Liverpool was jailed for life, he wes told he could not be considered for parole until he had served 10 years and eight months. Bradshaw will be eligible for release from prison once he has served half his sentence – minus the 25 months he has already spent on remand.
