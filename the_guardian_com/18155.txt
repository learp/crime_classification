Ever since his 20s, when he drew a toddler playing with a cat in a series of impressionistic sketches, Leonardo da Vinci had tried to capture the fun of children at play. In his design for The Madonna of the Yarnwinder, he achieved it. This painting is a monument to childish energy. He does not expect us to search for theological significance in its touching observation of a cheekily playful child steadied by a loving, tender mother.But it is a masterpiece with a catch. How much of this painting did the master actually do?Leonardo definitely designed it – an eyewitness account describes him doing so. But the Duke's painting is one of several versions of the picture, none of which can be entirely by Leonardo.There are lots of weaknesses as well as strengths: its landscape has none of the intensity of those painted by his own hand, nor could you seriously set this Madonna's face alongside that of the Mona Lisa for quality. No one disputes it was made in his workshop by his pupils, but how much did he help?Since it was exhibited at the National Gallery of Scotland in 1992, arguments for a heavy involvement by him have got a hearing. Recent scientific studies appear to prove that Leonardo sketched out the design on the canvas – changes of mind are visible under the paint.It's undoubtedly a lovely thing; and even a picture he got his pupils to knock up under his supervision is something to treasure. The merest touch of Leonardo's genius is better than almost anyone else's signature work.Jonathan Jones is author of The Lost Battles: Leonardo, Michelangelo and the Artistic Duel that Defined the Renaissance, published by Simon and Schuster
