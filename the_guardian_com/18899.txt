A dead woman believed to be missing 18-year-old Laura Torn had been strangled, police said today.The body was discovered shortly before 6pm yesterday close to a rough farm track near the village of Misson in Nottinghamshire, and while it has yet to be formally identified, police said they believe it is Ms Torn's. She was last seen in the market square of Owston Ferry, her home town in north Lincolnshire, after leaving the Crooked Billet pub in the early hours of April 27. A post-mortem examination was carried out today by Home Office pathologist Phillip Lumbon at the Medico Legal Centre in Sheffield. A Humberside police spokeswoman said: "The post-mortem concluded that the female died as a result of injuries consistent with strangulation." Earlier the spokeswoman said: "At this stage, the body has not been formally identified, but police do believe that it is missing 18-year-old Laura Torn." She said that a number of personal items believed to be in Ms Torn's possession when she disappeared had yet to be recovered. "Police are appealing to the public to keep an eye out for the missing items in case they have been dumped somewhere," she said. The missing items are a Sony mobile telephone, a silver watch with a purple face, one large silver hooped earring and a denim handbag with a floral-patterned shoulder strap. Ms Torn's family were today being comforted by police family liaison officers at their home. The discovery yesterday came after a 10-day search by Humberside police of a five-mile stretch of the river Trent, which runs through the village, and of the surrounding countryside. Last week a black boot belonging to Ms Torn was discovered on the riverbank. A 31-year-old man arrested on suspicion of Ms Torn's murder was still being questioned by police today after Scunthorpe magistrates granted an extension of custody time. Police can now hold the man until 6.30am tomorrow.
