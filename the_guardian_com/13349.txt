A hairdresser accused of helping four men disguise themselves for the biggest robbery in Britain said that she assumed she was making them masks for a video or theatrical performance, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.Michelle Hogg, 31, from Woolwich, south-east London, was the first person arrested by Kent police over the Â£53m robbery of the Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent, in February last year. She is one of eight pleading not guilty to conspiracy to rob and kidnap and to handling stolen goods. She refused to name the four men because she was "terrified" at what might happen to her and her family.Ms Hogg, who studied theatrical make-up at the London College of Fashion, was arrested the day after the robbery at her home. She had been asked to make prosthetic masks for four men over a two-week period just before the robbery.She said in a statement: "I may have done some work innocently. I would like to assist police further ... but I am terrified as to what may happen."Ms Hogg said she had never met the men before and was never told what the disguises, consisting of latex, false hair, greasepaint and modelling wax were for.The jury heard how the Securitas staff escaped from the depot. The young child of depot manager Colin Dixon, who had been taken hostage with its parents and Securitas staff, slipped through a gap in one of the cages in which they were held.The case continues.
