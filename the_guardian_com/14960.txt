A charity that helps battered women today launched a website giving children advice on dealing with domestic violence.The site, called the Hideout, provides information on the warning signs of domestic abuse and advises children what to do if their mother or father is affected by it.It also aims to help youngsters who have been victims of abuse, whether by relatives or their boyfriend or girlfriend.If children are interrupted while using the website, they can click on a special "panic button" which switches the screen to another site such as Top of the Pops.The Hideout also explains how children can delete the history of which websites they have visited in case an abusive relative tries to trace their tracks.Features on the site include a quiz which helps children recognise whether they or one of their parents is a victim of domestic abuse, plus advice on staying safe, how to get help, their legal rights and giving evidence in court.There are also games where they can explore their emotions by spraying graffiti on a virtual wall or design a leaf to add to an "emotions tree". The website gives feedback on what emotional state their drawings convey. For example, a white leaf may suggest they are peaceful and calm, but could also signify they feel cold and isolated.The chief executive of Women's Aid, Nicola Harwin, said: "Last year over 20,000 children stayed in refuges in England and we know that many more live with the daily fear of domestic violence."Children and young people can be enormously affected by domestic violence, whether as witnesses of violence in the home, direct abuse from a parent or in their very first relationships."Children and young people often feel powerless or guilty at being unable to stop domestic violence and The Hideout will play a vital role in providing information and helping them find the support that they desperately need." The website's launch follows research published last month that revealed nearly one in five teenage girls had been hit by a boyfriend and a third had experienced domestic abuse at home.The survey of 2,000 girls with an average age of 15 by Sugar magazine and the NSPCC also found more than 40% said they would "consider giving a boy a second chance" if he hit them.The Hideout was launched by pop star Will Young, a celebrity ambassador for Women's Aid, plus other stars including chef Gordon Ramsey and Jacqueline Wilson, author of the Tracey Beaker children's stories.
