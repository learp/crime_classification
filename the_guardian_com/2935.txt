The probation union Napo today confirmed that four of the six men convicted of the murder of Mary-Ann Leneghan were on probation at the time of the attack.Adrian Thomas, 20; Michael Johnson, 19; Jamaile Morally, 22; and Indrit Krasniqi, 18, were all under supervision when they abducted the 16-year-old and her friend in May last year.Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of Napo, said two had been on community punishment orders, one on a probation order and the fourth on a combination of the two.Thomas, seen by police as the ringleader, had been given an 18-month rehabilitation order six months before the killing for possession of cannabis and a bladed article.He had previously received a referral order and community service for possession of cannabis, heroin and cocaine.Johnson, who stabbed Mary-Ann to death after the girls were taken to a park, had been given a community service order for assaulting a police officer and possessing cannabis a week before the attack.Apparently the most violent of the group, he had previously been sentenced to three and a half years in a young offenders institution after abducting a 13-year-old boy with learning difficulties.During the attack in 2000, Johnson, then 13, and two friends tied the boy upside down with a rope and beat him unconscious, fracturing his skull.In 2003 he was given an 18-month detention and training order for assaulting two minicab drivers, causing affray and possessing a broken bottle.Jamaile Morally, who was convicted of murder along with his brother Joshua, was given a community rehabilitation order seven months before the murder for handling stolen goods.He also had convictions for possessing an offensive weapon, possession of cannabis and obtaining property by deception.Krasniqi had been order to do community service just four months before the murder, for obstructing a policeman and driving without insurance or a licence.He had been given a referral order the year before for two common assaults and was warned for possession of cannabis in 2003.Joshua Morally was not under probation supervision at the time of the murder but has convictions dating back to 1999 for robbery, shoplifting, criminal damage and taking a vehicle without consent. Llewellyn Adams, 24, a university student, is the only one of the six with no previous criminal record.
