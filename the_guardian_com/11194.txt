A senior police officer today defended the decision to take the race-fixing case against the jockey Kieron Fallon to court after an Old Bailey judge threw it out.Patrick Rice, the City of London police commander, said the force had "no regrets", adding that he was confident officers had conducted a "thorough investigation".Rice said it had been a "complex and high profile case" in which initial inquiries had suggested there was "significant evidence of criminal activity"."This activity could have had the result of seriously defrauding the betting community and undermining confidence in British horseracing," he added. "We made the decision, therefore, to take on the case in the public interest."The case failed to convict Fallon and five other men of conspiracy to defraud by fixing 27 horse races between December 2002 and September 2004.Rice said there would now be a review of the investigation, which was the largest of its type ever undertaken.Officers conducted more than 500 interviews, took over 1,300 statements and provided more than 5,000 exhibits and almost 40,000 pages of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service."A decision to bring charges was made by the Crown Prosecution Service more than two years after the investigation commenced," Rice said."An investigation of this nature carries risks. We followed the intelligence we obtained and went to where the evidence led us. We will not shirk our responsibilities when it comes to investigating allegations of corruption, wherever they lie."He said the force was disappointed by the decision to throw the case out, but "appreciate the reasons for it"."We believe we presented some compelling evidence, and it is a pity that the jury did not have the opportunity to consider all the evidence we had gathered," he added."We will now reflect on the judge's comments and conduct a review of the investigation. If there are lessons to be learned, we will learn them."City of London police were investigating Fallon and five others including Miles Rodgers, a former racing syndicate director.However, they reportedly only agreed to take on the inquiry after other forces turned it down, and were heavily criticised for only pressing ahead once the British Horseracing Authority had agreed to fund it.Rodgers' barrister, Peter Kelson QC, told the judge City police had received an assurance about funding from Ben Gunn, a Jockey Club director.Kelson read a statement from the City commissioner, Mike Bowron, which said: "I was advised that a verbal agreement had been reached with Ben Gunn of the BHA, undertaking them to meet additional costs incurred by the force in investigating this matter."This agreement appeared proper to me because it was apparent that an investigation of this magnitude would have major implications and costs to the force."Kelson said the force had exceeded its legal authority in seeking funding from the complainants in the case."They didn't have to take this investigation, but they took it because there was an agreement over money," he added. "This is a mess. It's a grotesque abuse of process."The BHA denies the agreement was made, saying no formal request was put in writing.During the trial, the chief investigator, Acting Detective Inspector Mark Manning, was criticised because he had been offered a job with the Jockey Club.Manning admitted he might take up the post in the security department after his forthcoming retirement from the police, and said he saw nothing wrong with being interviewed for it just before the trial began.
