A man has appeared in court accused of killing Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon Common more than 15 years ago.Robert Napper, who was charged last week with killing the 23-year-old former model in front of her two-year-old son, appeared via videolink before a packed courtroom at City of Westminster magistrates court in London.Wearing a black button-down shirt and black and white tie, the balding 41-year-old spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth before listening quietly to proceedings.At the end of the 20-minute hearing, senior metropolitan district judge Timothy Workman granted Napper bail on condition he remains detained in Broadmoor psychiatric hospital.Napper could only be removed in the case of a medical emergency and under the supervision of police and the health authorities, the judge ordered.Another condition was that he must submit to medical examinations so that psychiatric reports can be prepared.The case was committed to the Old Bailey for trial and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 20.The judge thanked him for attending court, to which Napper nodded and replied: "Thank you."Napper was charged after a review of the Nickell case. The former model was killed as she walked with her young son on Wimbledon Common on July 15 1992.
