A father who murdered his four-year-old son in revenge for his wife's affair was jailed for life yesterday after a jury refused to believe his claims of a fit of madness and voices in his head.Christopher Hawkins called out "I love you, Donna" to his 14-year-old daughter, who survived multiple stab wounds in the same attack and managed to alert neighbours before collapsing in the street.He was accused of faking grief over the tragedy in September at Slaithwaite, near Huddersfield, where he went for a beer at his local pub after the killing and told staff and customers what he had done.Mr Justice Wilkie, setting a minimum 21-year term at Leeds crown court, told him: "You have not had the moral courage to face up to what you did, blaming instead something evil inside you."I am satisfied that you used your son cold-heartedly as a vehicle for avenging yourself on your wife. Although to this court, and after the event, you professed great love for Ryan and mourned his passing, in my judgment, having seen you give evidence and had the opportunity to assess your genuineness, these were crocodile tears."The court heard that Hawkins, 47, had stabbed Ryan with a carving knife nine times, twice penetrating his heart. The attack in the sheet metalworker's terrace house, took place the day after the 17th anniversary of his marriage to Valerie Gee, who left him last May after telling him that she no longer loved him.Hawkins was furious to discover soon afterwards that she had started an affair months earlier with a taxi driver, Lee Tinker, at a minicab firm owned by her uncle, where she worked on the callout desk. The court heard that he had plotted revenge, scribbling a note that he would kill Ryan and himself on the child's fourth birthday in September.Instead, Hawkins first attacked Donna while her 16-year-old sister, Natalie, was out of the house and then told her that he was going to kill her brother. "I am satisfied that but for the speed and skill of the doctors at Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, you would have faced two murder charges," the judge told Hawkins. He praised Donna for the calm way she gave evidence in the eight-day trial, in contrast to her father's lies and evasions. As he was escorted from the dock, Hawkins turned to face Donna and Natalie in the public gallery and said: "I love you, Donna, I love you, Natalie." The children's mother said in a victim statement to the court that Donna would never get over the psychological scars of the attack.
