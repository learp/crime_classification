A 12-year-old girl appeared in court today in connection with an alleged attack on a fellow school pupil who was slashed across the face. The schoolgirl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of wounding another 12-year-old girl following an alleged incident at a Sheffield school on October 19. The youngster, from the Sheffield area, spoke only to confirm her name, address and age during a brief appearance at Sheffield youth court. The case was adjourned for a further hearing at the same court on December 20. The schoolgirl, who attended the hearing with members of her family, was granted bail by district judge Sheila Driver on condition she does not contact the alleged victim or go within half a mile of the school where the incident is alleged to have taken place. The alleged victim, who also lives in Sheffield, had to have 30 stitches in her face after she was attacked with what is believed to have been a blade from a pencil sharpener.
