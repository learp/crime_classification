A pensioner who spent two years planning to kill his estranged wife was last night sentenced to life after pleading guilty to her murder.Bristol crown court heard how Philip Ford, 67, battered his wife Therese, 63, with a frying pan as she slept in their house in the Longlevens area of Gloucester. Ford was traced in his blue Reliant Robin in mid Wales and charged with murder. On March 22, when Mrs Ford failed to turn up for work, the couple's daughter, Susan, went to her parents' house and found her mother lying dead on the floor. The next day Dyfed Powys police found the defendant sitting in his parked car in a lay-by in the Elan Valley, mid Wales. He told police he had tried to gas himself but failed when the hosepipe melted. Neighbours had reported "blood-curdling cries" for help on the night of the murder. Mr Ford told them he had had a nightmare and apologised for the noise but the neighbours contacted police. The court heard that the couple had had a difficult relationship and that Mr Ford had been planning the attack for two years - but the last straw came when Mrs Ford recently started divorce proceedings. Don Tait, prosecuting, said: "He simply could not face the unequal division of the matrimonial assets and could not leave the... lion's share to his wife."
