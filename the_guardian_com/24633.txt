Street crime soared by 38% in London over the last year, according to figures released yesterday. There were 70,000 muggings - an average of 192 a day - across the capital and this rise fuelled an overall 6% increase in crime.Between April last year and March this year there were 1,057,360 recorded crimes, according to Metropolitan police figures. There were 190 murders, up 11%, and nearly 10,000 sex offences, up 13.5%. The clear up rate was 14%. Police said a significant factor in the number of street robberies remained mobile phone theft. A phone is the sole item stolen in a third of all street robberies. Commanders in London boroughs also had their resources stretched after September 11 when 1,500 officers were moved to patrol the centre of the city.The Met has responded to the rising tide of street crime with Operation Safer Streets which saw 250 traffic officers being used to tackle crime in the worst affected boroughs. Deputy assistant commissioner Tim Godwin said street crime levels for March this year showed only a 1.3% increase compared with the same month the previous year - the 38% figure was taking both years as a whole. He said: "As well as building on this encouraging start to safer streets we have been studying the detailed figures and borough comparisons carefully so that we can understand the underlying trends and continue to target the safer streets initiative effectively. Importantly we have to look at why so many people, particularly young people, are engaging in crime. Arrests were also up for possession of offensive weapons, car crime, burglary and supply of class A drugs, he said. Press Association
