A man has been convicted of the murder of Sikh waiter Surjit Singh Chhokar 17 years after he first stood trial for the killing.The victim’s family sobbed and embraced in the public gallery as Ronnie Coulter was found guilty of fatally stabbing the 32-year-old in Overtown, North Lanarkshire, in November 1998, after a row over a £100 cheque.In one of Scotland’s longest-running and most controversial murder cases, Coulter was retried following a change in the double jeopardy law in 2012.The case was officially reopened four years ago after a lengthy campaign for justice by Chhokar’s family, supported by Scotland’s leading human rights lawyer, Aamer Anwar. On Wednesday Anwar described the verdict as “not a cause for celebration but relief that finally justice has been done”.The failure of two prosecution cases in 1999 and 2000 led to a public outcry, and comparisons to the Stephen Lawrence case. Two official inquiries were launched, with one finding the prosecution and police guilty of institutional racism. The then lord advocate, Colin Boyd, admitted that Chhokar’s family had been failed by the system.Following the verdict, Anwar said: “At the end of the second trial in 2000, I stood on the steps of this court accusing our justice system of acting like a gentleman’s colonial club, of being arrogant, unaccountable and institutionally racist. But today the Chhokar family want to thank the prosecutors, Crown Office and Police Scotland for their unwavering commitment to justice. They have shown themselves at their finest.”During the four-week trial at the high court in Glasgow, the jury heard that Coulter, his nephew Andrew and another man, David Montgomery, went to see Chhokar on the night he died following a row over a stolen Giro cheque.The trio confronted the waiter in the street as he returned home from work with a takeaway meal and, after an altercation, the father of two collapsed and died of massive blood loss after being stabbed three times, once straight through his heart.Coulter denied murdering Chhokar, lodging a special defence blaming his nephew and Montgomery for the killing.The court heard that Coulter had been cleared of murder following a trial in 1999, and that Andrew Coulter, who was convicted of stabbing and killing another man in 1999, and Montgomery were also cleared of the murder in 2000.Both men gave evidence during the most recent trial and admitted being present on the night Chhokar died, but denied murder.For the defence, Donald Findlay QC argued that members of his family had conspired to make Ronnie Coulter a “scapegoat” for the murder, claiming that the trial had heard from witnesses who were “determined to say what they wanted to say for their own personal reasons”.But the prosecution dismissed the theory, with Alex Prentice, QC for the crown, urging the jury to ignore the unusual features of the case and describing the two previous trials as “largely irrelevant”.The jury heard Ronnie Coulter’s former sister-in-law describe an alleged confession made when she visited him in Barlinnie prison while he was on remand awaiting the first trial.She was asked by Prentice: “Did Ronnie Coulter ever say anything about the death of Surjit Singh Chhokar?” She replied: “He said ‘I stabbed him. I stabbed the Paki bastard.’”The third trial was attended every day by Chhokar’s 73-year-old mother, his sister and her children. His father, Darshan, died last October. Responding to the verdict, DCS Clark Cuzen acknowledged the “years of uncertainty” the family had endured, and said: “If Darshan Singh Chhokar was alive today, I can only imagine his feelings at seeing justice being served. He added: “It is important to recognise the tireless campaigning for justice over the years by the Chhokar family and their lawyer, Aamer Anwar. I hope they can take some comfort from today’s verdict.”Describing the “complex and challenging” two-year investigation that led to Coulter’s conviction, Cuzen said: “Through the passage of time, people can change allegiances and new evidence can come to light through independent statements. This tireless activity ultimately revealed fresh evidence that pointed the finger firmly at Ronnie Coulter as the man responsible for the violent and calculated attack on Surjit Singh Chhokar.“Whilst we were unable to find evidence of racial motivation at the time of the murder, there was evidence to support the fact that Ronnie Coulter described Surjit using racist terms when confessing to the murder. “Surjit Singh Chhokar was a well-liked member of the community and did not deserve to be the victim of a sustained period of intimidation which ultimately led to his murder.” The judge Lord Matthews told Coulter: “There is only one sentence I can pass of life imprisonment. The only question for me is how long you should serve before being eligible for parole.”Calling for background reports given the relatively minor nature of Coulter’s previous convictions and his mental health issues, he deferred sentence until 31 October.
