Two unemployed men who admitted conspiring to burgle the home of a farmer who was later charged with murder were jailed yesterday.Brendan Fearon, 29, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, was jailed for three years at Norwich crown court. Darren Bark, 33, also from Newark, was jailed for 30 months. He was also ordered to serve an extra 12 months for an unrelated burglary. Both men pleaded guilty to conspiring to burgle the home of Tony Martin, 54, in Emneth, Norfolk, in August last year. The court heard how Bark and Fearon had set out to burgle Mr Martin's home with Fred Barras, 16, a Newark market trader. Martin had opened fire with a shotgun when he disturbed Fearon and Barras, the court heard. Barras died as a result of his injuries. Fearon suffered wounds to his upper thighs. Martin has been charged with murdering Barras and with causing grevious bodily harm to Fearon. He is awaiting trial. Judge Mellor said publicity surrounding Martin's case had not affected the sentences on Fearon and Bark. Ian James, prosecuting, told the court that Fearon had planned the burglary and persuaded Bark to drive to Emneth. Fearon had targeted Martin's home after hearing other people talking about the property in a pub, the court heard. The trio, who all had links to the travelling community in Newark, believed that they would be able to steal small antiques. Fearon and Bark asked for seven other offences to be taken into consideration.
