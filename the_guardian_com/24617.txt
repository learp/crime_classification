The son of a renowned philatelist who stole part of his late father's stamp collection to fund his obsession with a single fruit machine in a bookmaker's shop has been spared jail after his mother asked for leniency.Joseph Jennings, 29, who raised almost £14,000 by selling off the stamps at knockdown prices to unsuspecting dealers, was given a two-year community order.Describing the thefts as "mean" and prolonged, judge Paul Farrer QC at Birmingham crown court told Jennings he had avoided prison because of his guilty plea and his mother's desire to see him helped rather than punished.Jennings, of Harborne, Birmingham, appeared to listen intently in the dock as the judge described Stella Jennings's approach towards her son following the thefts as "loving, responsible and generous".Accepting that the death of his father had had a significant impact on Jennings, the judge added: "Since 2009 you have suffered from a gambling addiction."When your father died he left all of his property to your mother and that included a very valuable stamp collection, which the family were plainly proud of. It was also a significant part of your mother's pension planning."You took items from that stamp collection over a prolonged period of time and you sold them to dealers, for which you received just under £14,000."The stolen items' true value was undoubtedly much higher, said Farrer, who was told that three-quarters of the stamps had been traced and returned to Mrs Jennings.Peter Jennings, who died aged 65 in September last year after a long illness, worked as press secretary for the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Birmingham and wrote articles about philately.Iain Suggett, for Joseph Jennings, said the latter's grief over his father had played a part in the thefts. He said: "My client liked a particular fruit machine – that's where the money went, into one machine."The case was "very, very tragic" on many levels, added Suggett, who confirmed that Jennings was now reconciled with his mother. Jennings was also ordered to undertake 150 hours of unpaid community work and pay a £60 victim surcharge as part of his sentence.
