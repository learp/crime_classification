The prime suspect in the murder of a Norwegian student could be forced from his safe haven in Yemen by the political fallout following the attempted bombing of an airliner on Christmas Day, the father of the victim said today.Farouk Abdulhak, the 22-year-old son of a billionaire Yemeni businessman, has been named by Scotland Yard as the man wanted concerning the rape and murder of his girlfriend, Martine Vik Magnussen, in London two years ago.Since her semi-naked body was found, part buried in rubble in the basement of his flat, Abdulhak has fled to Yemen via Egypt.With no extradition treaty between Britain and Yemen, detectives have been unable to bring him to the UK to stand trial.At a pre-inquest hearing yesterday, Magnussen's father, Odd Petter Magnussen, suggested Farouk could be "voluntarily" extradited by Yemen in return for cooperation sought from the UK and US to fight terrorism.The Yemeni government asked for help after it emerged that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who allegedly attempted to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, had been recruited and trained by al-Qaida within Yemen.The Westminster coroner, Dr Paul Knapman, said yesterday that an "impasse" had been reached in the murder investigation.Speaking after the hearing, the victim's father called for political pressure to be put on the Yemeni authorities."This question of justice is something that has to do with right and wrong. Irrespective of the political or religious environment in the world, justice has to prevail," he said."That is the question the suspect's family have to deal with, and I hope they come to the conclusion that will be in line with the police here and our family."Detective Chief Inspector Jessica Wadsworth, who led the inquiry, said all efforts to get Abdulhak to Britain to stand trial had been unsuccessful. "It is a frustrating place to be," she added. "We have worked closely with Mr Magnussen and all the authorities to do everything we can to secure his [Abdulhak's] return to the UK. We want to make it clear it is something we will pursue until we find justice for Martine."A European arrest warrant has been issued for Abdulhak, and Wadsworth said every effort was being made to pick him up should he leave Yemen, as police believe he occasionally does in a private jet.Magnussen was last seen by friends leaving the Maddox nightclub in Mayfair, central London, with Abdulhak in the early hours of 14 March 2008. The two were students at the Regent's Business School and were part of the same international social set. Abdulhak's father is the billionaire businessman Shaher Abdulhak, who founded Shaher Trading and whose empire includes petrol, soft drinks, tourism and property.
