Detectives investigating the disappearance of the businesswoman Carole Waugh have issued CCTV images of a man they are seeking as part of their inquiry.On the footage the man is seen at a cash machine outside Sainsbury's in Crown Road, Enfield, at approximately 2.55pm on 10 July 2012, where a bank card belonging to Waugh was used.The transaction is one of a number carried out by a group of individuals who police believe may have abducted the 50-year-old businesswoman in order to take over control of her life and finances.At least three women and several men have impersonated Waugh in order to steal money from her, and a man is also known to have posed as her brother Chris, on a number of occasions in an attempt to sell her £650,000 flat in Marylebone, central London.The last time Waugh's family saw her was over the Easter weekend in April at a family gathering in Durham, where her mother lives.Police have also discovered that a "significant amount of property" had been taken from her flat. An extensive forensic search is being carried out at the property.Initially the case was dealt with by a team of local officers when Waugh's family reported her missing in early May. But last Thursday concerns grew and the investigation was handed to DCI John McFarlane of the homicide and serious crime command.It emerged on Wednesday that after her family filed a cause for concern report with the Metropolitan police in early May, an officer went to her flat and gained entry. The officer reported back to the family that there was nothing untoward inside.But police now believe the flat might have been the scene of an abduction by individuals intent on taking over Waugh's identity. It is believed they might have returned to the flat more than once after her abduction. Police are examining Waugh's relationships with friends in London, her business connections and her habits in an attempt to find those responsible.Waugh's brother Chris travelled to London on Wednesday to make a public appeal for information to help find his sister."We are all very proud of my sister," he said. "We are from a mining community in the north-east and Carole wanted to improve herself and take any opportunities that life offered her. She is very focused, strong and driven and her big break came when she got a job in an oil company working in Libya, which she loved, returning to London in 2008.""We are all very concerned about Carole. Her disappearance is completely out of character and we are extremely anxious and afraid for her welfare."I appeal to anybody that has worked with Carole, socialised with Carole; has met or knows of her, to come forward with any small bit of information they may have and assist our family – as that information may fit into the jigsaw that could help us to locate Carole sooner rather than later."McFarlane said his investigations had revealed that a tall, white man in his 50s had been impersonating Waugh's brother on several occasions up until the end of June."We now know that, in addition to at least three women impersonating Ms Waugh, a man has also been impersonating her brother Chris and endeavouring to raise finances, including trying to sell her flat."There are also a number of her personal possessions that cannot currently be located."I'm very concerned for her safety and I appeal to anyone who has known her since she returned from Libya in 2008 to get in touch with us as soon as possible."Ms Waugh had a circle of friends and I have spoken to a number of them; however, I need to speak to more so that I can build a complete picture of Carole's life, that includes anyone who has met her socially or personally."Eight people have been arrested. Seven have been released on police bail and a man has appeared in court in connection with the case.Anyone with information is asked to contact the incident room at Sutton on 020 8721 4205, or the anonymous Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111.
