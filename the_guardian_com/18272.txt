Effective policing is impossible without trust between police and public. Citizens will offer vital information, collaboration and tolerance of inevitable mistakes to a police force they trust. The police in turn need to feel that the expectations of them are reasonable.It is an obvious bargain, but recent cases involving the regulation of the police show how far we are from achieving that balance, thus endangering a relationship on which our safety depends. The resignation last week of Cambridgeshire's chief constable, Tom Lloyd, for an incident in which, when drunk, he made bawdy suggestions to a woman officer is the highest price he could pay - and treats an indiscretion as seriously as gross professional misconduct, which seems disproportionate.The arrest of two police marksmen for shooting Harry Stanley, whom they mistakenly believed had a gun, is no less problematic. Charges of manslaughter, gross negligence and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice may be justified. But the men could face murder charges, which smells more of a desire to appease the understandably outraged Stanley family and media supporters than to serve justice. Together, such cases generate distrust between police and public. We need realistic expectations of the moral standards of guardians of the law. The case of the police marksmen highlights a different problem. Here, we need to look at introducing a system of murder charges for police and civilians alike.Without proportionate sanctions for perceived police crimes and misjudgment, the important bond of trust between police and public will break down.
