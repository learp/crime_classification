One of the foreign prisoners released without being considered for deportation has since committed a murder, the Immigration Service admitted today.In a letter to the home affairs select committee, Lin Homer, head of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, also revealed that only 46 of the 1,000-plus prisoners involved in the crisis have so far been deported.It pointed out that the former prisoner who recently committed a murder could not have been deported under current immigration rules.The offender, who is now serving a life sentence for murder and other offences, is a long-term resident with either Commonwealth or Irish citizenship.The home secretary, John Reid, has asked for the deportation rules for these citizens to be reviewed alongside a broader shake up of the immigration system.The revelation that 1,019 foreign prisoners had been freed from jail without being considered for deportation - including murderers, rapists and paedophiles - led to the sacking of Charles Clarke in May.Today's letter reveals that after rechecking the information the actual number of offenders falling into this category has been reduced to 1,013. It explained that some offenders who had used aliases had been had been counted twice.Ms Homer apologised for the error."The deficiencies in our system in terms of their ability to produce accurate information enabling us to meet the challenges we face, is a key aspect of the review of the IND and the wider review of the Home Office now underway," she said.She also revealed that of the 189 most serious offenders on the list, decisions had now been made to deport 137 of them. Of these 68 have been detained, 15 are on bail and four have already been deported.Ms Homer insisted that the number of deportations will increase "as the internal processes are speeded up, the practical consideration affecting deportation are tackled and as the statutory processes are completed".Earlier this month Ms Homer, said it would take "years, not months" to sort out problems in the immigration service.She was also criticised by the committee for failing to provide even "very basic" information about the offenders.
