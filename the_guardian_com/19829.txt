"Robocop" Ray Mallon, the pioneer of tough US-style "zero tolerance" crime-fighting, is to chair a policy group on policing for the influential Conservative think tank Centre for Social Justice, the centre announced..Mallon, well-known by his nickname of "Robocop", was the head of Middlesbrough's CID before becoming the city's independent mayor in 2002.He wants to find ways to fight "policing by prescription", encouraging forces to focus on overall crime prevention rather than responding to national government performance indicators, he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning.But Mallon was sceptical of the key Tory policy of electing police chiefs, saying he preferred to see police officers rise through the ranks to become chief constables."There is some merit in looking at it, but my view is that, at the present time, we have got it just about right," he said."What I want is chief constables freed up to do the job. At the present time, it is policing by prescription and, whether it is Devon and Cornwall or Northumbria, the key performance indicators are the same." "The chief officers of police are told what to do, rather than making the big decisions on the ground."Mallon made his name cutting crime through cracking down on lesser offences in Hartlepool, then Middlesbrough, but resigned from the police force to run as one of the country's first elected mayors.He left after a massive inquiry into corruption within Cleveland police, having been cleared of criminal wrong-doing but still facing internal disciplinary proceedings.Re-elected in 2007, Mallon has maintained his political independence but has described himself as "a socialist type."The CSJ, set up by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, is becoming an increasingly important voice in the Conservative party.Duncan Smith said Mallon's agreement to chair the group was a "great bonus" to the centre."He understands the wider political responsibilities of policing," said Duncan Smith. "His record stands for itself."As well as the policing group, the think tank is running criminal justice panels on sentencing, youth crime and prison reform. The prison reform group is chaired by the former minister, Jonathan Aitken, who completed a jail sentence for perjury. The groups are due to report by the end of next year.
