Britain is on the brink of a diplomatic crisis with Russia that could see the tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats and the withdrawal of British cooperation in several key areas, including counter-terrorism, trade, education and social affairs.The Foreign Office and Downing Street are preparing to send a strong signal to the Kremlin over its refusal to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, the former KGB agent suspected of murdering Alexander Litvinenko in London last November. On Monday, Russian prosecutors formally announced that Mr Lugovoi would not be handed over to the UK on the grounds that the Russian constitution prevents his extradition.Earlier today, the spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, Mikhail Kamynin, warned that London was now in danger of jeopardising its entire relationship with Moscow "for the sake of one man"."I don't understand the position of the British government. It is prepared to sacrifice our relations in trade and education for the sake of one man. I'm surprised," he said, adding: "Our position is clearly in line with Russia's constitution and legislation."The government is now weighing up counter-measures designed to show Britain's extreme displeasure at the Kremlin's decision, and the seriousness with which it takes the "terrible" murder of Mr Litvinenko, a British citizen.A response is likely within days and the Foreign Office is expected to present a report to parliament next week setting out the punitive steps Britain will take.Foreign Office officials are bracing themselves for immediate and furious reprisals from Moscow, which could include tit-for-tat expulsion of British diplomats. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has angrily dismissed Britain's request to extradite Mr Lugovoi as "stupidity".The Kremlin has already waged a campaign of intimidation and harassment against the British ambassador in Moscow, Tony Brenton, through activists from the pro-Kremlin youth group Nashi.Protesters picketed the British embassy, jumped in front of the ambassador's car, and heckled his speeches. The anti-UK campaign has spread to the British Council, which has been raided by tax officials wearing balaclavas and was last month told to move out of its offices in the city of Yekaterinburg.At the same time, both BP and Shell have been forced to yield major gas-field assets to the Russian state gas firm Gazprom.Since the Crown Prosecution Service charged Mr Lugovoi with murder in May, Kremlin officials have encouraged the Russian media to blame Mr Litvinenko's death on the exiled Russian former oligarch Boris Berezovsky and MI6.TV channels have also run lengthy interviews with a Russian who claimed that MI6 tried to hire him, and that Mr Litvinenko poisoned himself. In a surreal press conference in Moscow, Mr Lugovoi blamed the murder on Tony Blair, Mr Berezovsky and the Georgian mafia.Privately, however, Downing Street officials believe that the Kremlin would have delivered Mr Lugovoi for trial in London had it wanted to.The director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald QC, has made clear that it is not "acceptable" for Mr Lugovoi to be tried in Russia instead, since the Russian court system is susceptible to political pressure.On Tuesday, Gordon Brown expressed his own frustration. The prime minister's spokesman said: "Russia's refusal to extradite Mr Lugovoi is extremely disappointing and we deeply regret that Russia has failed to show the necessary level of cooperation in this matter."He continued: "Russia is an important partner on many issues and we continue to seek a constructive relationship, but we need to carefully consider our range of cooperation. Russia has to accept that it has responsibilities too ... this is a serious matter."Downing Street officials hope that Britain's tough stance with Moscow will win the support of fellow EU countries, which in turn will help Britain to weather what looks like an imminent diplomatic storm.At the same time, both the UK and Russia are keen that the row does not adversely affect burgeoning business ties, despite Mr Blair's warning last month that the affair might damage British investment in Russia. Britain is Russia's largest foreign investor, with interests of over Â£3bn.None the less, officials recognise that Britain's relations with Moscow - already at their worst level for two decades - are about to deteriorate still further. They hope that after a period of coolness, things will eventually improve.Mr Putin has been personally incensed by the UK's failure to extradite Mr Berezovsky to Moscow, where he has been charged with money laundering and attempting to plot a coup against Mr Putin.Mr Litvinenko, who lived in north London with his wife and young son, died last November, aged 44, three weeks after being poisoned at the Millennium hotel in Mayfair with radioactive polonium-210. His associates later claimed that he wrote a deathbed statement accusing Mr Putin of being behind the crime.
