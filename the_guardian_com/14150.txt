Many killings now classed as manslaughter will be upgraded to murder and offenders subjected to stiffer sentences under proposals yesterday from a government-commissioned review.The Law Commission's proposals for the biggest shakeup of homicide law for 50 years recommends three tiers of homicide - first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter - to replace murder and manslaughter.But the commission has changed its mind over a recommendation in its original consultation paper, which meant that some killings which attract a mandatory life sentence would no longer do so.It has revised its proposed definition of first degree murder - the only offence which would be subject to the mandatory life sentence - to bring it broadly into line with the current definition of murder which requires an intent to kill or to cause serious harm.The report will be taken to its next stage next year by the Home Office, which will launch a consultation on policy issues and sentencing in homicide cases.A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We do not see these proposals as a watering down of homicide laws, and would not accept them if they did. But we will need to consider the proposals very carefully."
