A confrontation in the crowded Westfield shopping centre just before the Olympics led to murder and a pitched battle between two gangs, a court has heard.Liam Woodards, 24, was stabbed in the chest after glasses and a yoghurt pot were thrown at rivals.As he lay dying, youths began fighting, throwing metal chairs and brandishing two knives, the Old Bailey was told onThursday."It was a joint pitched battle," said Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting.Nii-Azu Kojo Smith, 18, of Hackney Wick, east London, denies murder at the site next to the Olympic Park in Stratford, also in east London, on 29 June.Seven others aged between 18 and 25 deny violent disorder, while a further five people have pleaded guilty to various offences, the jury was told.Jafferjee said it was not known if there had been a history between the two groups or whether the confrontation was "gratuitous and opportunistic violence".But there had been "an atmosphere of menace" with "verbal posturing" between the two sides during the build up.At 4.20pm on 29 June, the groups converged and after a number of verbal exchanges they moved towards some central stalls with Woodards ending up among the rival youths.Jafferjee said there was little doubt that Woodards had been "confrontational and mouthy" in the escalating atmosphere.A glass and a yoghurt pot had been thrown by Woodards' group, then a third item, a glass or yoghurt pot landed on or near Kojo-Smith.Jafferjee said: "The deceased did not throw anything. His only crime was to have been mouthy."His misfortune was to be closest to Kojo-Smith who was confronting the other man just before the item landed."Kojo-Smith allegedly produced a knife as Woodards moved away."In an utterly disproportionate and lethal reaction, Kojo-Smith lunged forward and stabbed the retreating Liam Woodards in the chest."This was as needless as it was cowardly. Mr Woodards was an easy and mouthy target."The trial continues.â€¢ This article was amended on 26 April 2013.
