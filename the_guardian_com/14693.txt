The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry team has accepted responsibility for the publication of informants' names and addresses in their report, and said: "It's a mistake". A spokeswoman admitted the debacle which has forced the Home Office to suspend distribution of the appendices of the report was "hugely embarrassing". The team called on the media not to reproduce sensitive information contained in one of the appendices while the document was reprinted.  A spokeswoman said: "It's a mistake, it's our responsibility and we very much regret what's happened."  In a formal statement, the Inquiry Office said: "The Home Secretary published in full the report and appendices we submitted to him, including an appendix which contained information which the inquiry should not have disclosed.  "The media are requested not to reproduce the information in Appendix 11 pending the reprinting of the appendices volume."  The spokeswoman confirmed the first the inquiry team members knew about the mix-up was when they were contacted by Scotland Yard. They contacted the Home Office and taken the appendix off the Internet immediately.  However, she said there was little that could be done to retrieve copies of the report which had already been distributed. New versions were being reprinted and would have the sensitive information blanked out.  Sir William Macpherson, the report's author, would not be making any comment on the error.  While acknowledging the seriousness of the mistake, she said she hoped it would not obscure the important issues raised by the report. She said: "Obviously I'd very sorry to see this overshadow all discussion of the report and the main issue."
