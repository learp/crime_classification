Perhaps it was a joyrider; perhaps it was a bus anorak achieving the ambition of a lifetime at the wheel of a 53-seat single-decker.Whoever it was, police in south Wales want to find him before he takes to the streets again with a merry cry of "Any more fares!" Not content with taking the bus from a depot in Blackwood, Gwent, the mystery thief set off along a recognised bus route, picking up and dropping off passengers - and collecting fares. Four hours later, the bus, minus a wing mirror and plus a scrape down one side, was found a few miles away. Islwyn Borough Transport, a company owned by Caerphilly council, raised the alarm after discovering the bus, due on a school run in nearby Bargoed, was missing.Its disappearance remained a mystery until a rival bus firm got in touch. Did Islwyn know that one of its vehicles had been plying his route picking up his passengers? "He seems to have known the bus route to pick up the passengers and the route is very tricky," said managing director Roger Sims. "We have had no complaints from passengers. We had a laugh about it once we got the vehicle back in one piece." But the thief may be trapped, thanks to the work of a happy bus spotter who not only watched the buses on the day of the crime but also filmed them: he has handed his videotape to detectives.
