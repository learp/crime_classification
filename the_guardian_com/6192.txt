The search for the body of missing five-year-old April Jones will finish next month after an exhaustive six-month hunt.What is believed to be the biggest concerted police search operation mounted in the UK looks certain to end without success.April disappeared from the housing estate where she lived in Machynlleth, Powys, on 1 October. Since then a methodical examination of thousands of acres of rugged terrain around the town has continued unabated.Bad weather has forced specialist search teams to cancel the ongoing search operation this week.Search teams totalling more than 130 people are due to rest over the Easter break as the six-month anniversary of April's abduction approaches.Dyfed Powys police said the search operation would be concluded by the end of April.A "reactive team" of search officers will remain on duty ready to respond to any new information which comes to light.More than 60 sq km (14,380 acres) of terrain, taking in 300 separate locations, has been searched."The terrain is extremely challenging. The mountains, gorges, streams and waterfalls in the area mean extra care has to be taken and specialist safety equipment has to be worn," a Dyfed Powys police spokesman said."The force made a commitment to search until all viable lines of inquiry were complete."The teams have worked through a detailed plan that was based on information from the investigation and national best practice guidance. Throughout the search a range of specialist resources have been used from various agencies including police marine units, experts in searching confined spaces and mines, fire and rescue urban search and rescue teams, the coastguard and mountain rescue teams as well as specially trained CSI dogs from all over the UK."There is no searching taking place this week due to inclement weather and there will be no searching carried out over Easter."Mark Bridger, 47, was arrested the day after April's abduction. He was later charged with abduction and murder and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.He is scheduled to stand trial at Mold crown court on 29 April.
