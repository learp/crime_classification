The father of Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Billy Wright is expected to take legal action if today's report into the death of his son inside the Maze prison fails to conclude there was collusion between the state and his son's republican killers.The inquiry into Wright's death, which has cost Â£30m, is expected to be highly critical of security around the jail in December 1997 when the loyalist leader was shot dead by two Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) inmates.The Guardian understands that David Wright is already receiving legal advice on his next move if collusion is not at the centre of the report.One of Wright's killers, John Kennaway, claimed that "security was a joke" at the time they shot the LVF founder, but Kennaway, who later died in Maghaberry jail, denied any collusion between the INLA and any branch of the security forces.The report is due to be published this afternoon after the Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Paterson, addresses the House of Commons and is expected to be highly critical of the Prison Service.The murder, just two days after Christmas, threatened to wreck the tense all-party political negotiations in the months before the signing of the Good Friday agreement the following year.Wright, from Portadown, Co Armagh, who was linked to up to 20 murders of mostly Catholics, was sitting in the back of a prison van waiting to be taken to meet his visiting girlfriend when he was shot seven times.Three republican prisoners belonging to the INLA, a republican breakaway faction, were involved.Two of the three, Christopher "Crip" McWilliams and John Kennaway, had been transferred into the same H-Block as Wright the previous May, just weeks after Wright was moved from Maghaberry prison, also near Lisburn, Co Antrim, to serve out an eight-year sentence. The INLA had previously tried to kill Wright in Maghaberry.The two men and a third man, John Glennon, armed with a semi-automatic pistol and a double-barrelled .22 Derringer, moved in to kill him after hearing his name announced over the prison public address system.They surrendered themselves to prison staff after negotiations with a Catholic chaplain and were later sentenced to life imprisonment but released early under the terms of the 1998 peace deal.McWilliams later died of cancer while Kennaway took his own life while being held in Maghaberry prison.
