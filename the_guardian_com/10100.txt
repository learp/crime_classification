Japanese businessman acquitted over murderNothing could have prepared observers of Japan's criminal justice system for today's acquittal of the Japanese businessman Joji Obara in the case of Briton Lucie Blackman's rape and drug-related death.Although he was sentenced to life in prison for the rapes of nine other women - including one that resulted in death - his acquittal of causing Ms Blackman's death came as a shock in a country where more than 99% of cases that go to trial end in a conviction, often on the basis of confessions made during the investigation.Human rights campaigners have criticised Japanese police for relying on confessions made under duress, with suspects made aware that their cooperation could result in a lighter sentence.But in a verdict that caused widespread consternation, Obara - who had vehemently denied all the charges - was found not guilty of drugging, raping and killing Ms Blackman in July 2000.Her remains were found encased in cement in a cave not far from his beachside apartment, south of Tokyo, in February 2001.The ruling said prosecutors had failed to prove he had caused her death and dismembered her corpse, despite a large volume of circumstantial evidence."The court cannot prove that he single-handedly was involved in her [Ms Blackman's] death," the judge, Tsutomu Tochigi, said in his statement.He acknowledged that Ms Blackman had been with Obara before she vanished, but said there was no evidence that he was directly responsible for her death.Obara was acquitted despite evidence that he had bought, among other items, a chainsaw and a vinyl sheet just days after Ms Blackman went missing. He is also known to have bought cement at around the same time."Even if the accused was involved in some way in damaging and abandoning the corpse, we must say it is not clear in what form and to what extent he was involved," Mr Tochigi said.The verdict stands in stark contrast to those given in other high-profile cases in recent years.In 2002 Masumi Hayashi, a housewife, was sentenced to hang for killing four people and making dozens of others ill after lacing their curry with arsenic at a village festival in 1998.Hayashi - who insisted she was innocent and later refused to testify - was convicted on the strength of circumstantial evidence.Today's verdict is surprising in another sense. Suspects who, like Obara, refuse to admit their guilt can often expect to receive a harsh sentence, not an acquittal.Last month, for instance, the internet tycoon Takafumi Horie was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for securities fraud, despite clear weaknesses in the prosecutors' case.Horie had denied the charges while his colleagues, who pleaded guilty, received lighter sentences.
