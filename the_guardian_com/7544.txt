The government's approach to tackling concerns about the number of young people stabbed to death this year comes under scrutiny on the front pages of three of today's papers - and the reaction is overwhelmingly negative.The Guardian has details of a report by Manchester University's school of law, which says tactics to fight knife crime are based on "flawed" assumptions. Those assumptions include that gangs are tightly organised, specialise in dealing drugs, that their violence is provoked primarily by turf wars and that most street gangs are black.The Telegraph reports that families have criticised the "shock tactics" unveiled by the government yesterday that would see young people caught carrying knives taken to hospital to visit the victims of knife attacks. That approach receives further criticism on the inside pages of today's papers. The Mail, Sun and Telegraph's favoured approach, as outlined in their editorials, can be summarised by the title of the latter's leader: Prison is the only place for knife carriers.There is short shrift for the "shock tactics" in the blogosphere. Zedbrar, from north London, posted this - somewhat depressing - comment on thestudentroom: "I think it is stupid. I could walk in a hospital and see a crash victim from a car accident. Wont stop me driving, i don't even know the person. I've had people come to my school and show picture of violent crime and tell people to stop...still doesn't effect me or anyone else. The only time people will generally get shocked is when it happens to someone they know or to themselves. But then most youth will want revenge..."Do you think the government is being too soft? Or would locking up youths caught with knives just turn them into hardened criminals? Â· This is an edited extract from the Wrap, our digest of the daily papers.
