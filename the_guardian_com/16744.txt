The parents of Madeleine McCann are considering hiring a top PR adviser to manage their media campaign, signalling a change in strategy a week after being declared official suspects in their daughter's disappearance.Kate and Gerry McCann have been in discussions with Phil Hall, the former tabloid editor turned media consultant, following the resignation of their media spokeswoman, Justine McGuinness, the Guardian has learned.Mr Hall, former editor of the News of the World, is among a number of high-profile PR figures consulted by the McCanns with a view to managing the global interest in their case.Mr Hall confirmed yesterday that he had been in discussions with the couple. "I have spoken to them a number of times and offered advice and [help] assessing the situation and what they are doing going forward and whether they need someone full-time or part-time," he told mediatheguardian.com.Meanwhile, social workers visited the McCanns at home yesterday after the couple invited them for talks about two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie in the light of their being named as suspects in Madeleine's disappearance.It is standard practice for a mother or father named as a suspect overseas to have their case considered by British authorities. In these cases social services can, in theory, take children into care or place them on the "in need" or "at risk" registers.Mr and Mrs McCann have been pursuing an energetic media campaign to maintain the high profile of the search for their daughter since her disappearance on May 3, during which they have contacted senior Fleet Street and PR figures for advice.Ms McGuinness, a public affairs consultant and former Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate, has been acting as their official spokesperson since July. Her resignation is not related to recent developments in the case, the Guardian understands.The move follows a similar shift in the couple's legal strategy, after they were named as suspects last Friday. They have contracted a highly respected team of British lawyers to work alongside their Portuguese representation, who have advised them that they must not discuss any details related to the investigation. Mr and Mrs McCann, who have since returned to the UK, vehemently deny involvement in their daughter's disappearance and presumed death.It is not clear how the couple plan to pay for the services of PR advisers. On Wednesday the couple said the Find Madeleine campaign fund, which has raised more than Â£1m in public donations, would not be used to meet their legal expenses.In a separate development, investigators on the Algarve have asked the magistrate presiding over the case if they can put further questions to Mrs McCann after studying her diary, it was reported yesterday. According to the newspaper Publico, the authorities photocopied pages of Mrs McCann's diary two months ago.The diary pages read by police included private comments about the "unruliness" of her children's behaviour, according to the newspaper.
