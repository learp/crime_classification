Former home secretary David Blunkett will tackle juvenile crime in a new series for Channel Five.In what is billed by Five as a "bold social experiment", Banged Up will see Blunkett head up the "parole board" of a "prison" that mixes reformed offenders with young people on the cusp of a life of crime.The series, which will be made by independent producer Shine North, aims to tackle "the sensitive issue of juvenile behaviour and rehabilitation", working in conjunction with pupil referral units, charities, youth groups, community projects and parents. Each contributor will be filmed as they attempt to rehabilitate themselves, with the series also featuring first-hand accounts and testimonies from former criminals. "With ever increasing prison numbers, with longer sentences and with a continuing disquiet about the revolving door of re-offending, anything that can add to a range of measures for educating, and in creating a grasp of reality, is worth the experiment now being undertaken by Shine North in conjunction with Five," Blunkett said.Steve Gowans, Five's head of factual entertainment and multichannel commissioner, added: "We're delighted to have David Blunkett's involvement and support. His experience and understanding in this area will be invaluable to a fascinating social experiment tackling an issue that couldn't be more relevant."The series, due to air later in the year, will be executive produced for Shine North by Robin Ashbrook and produced by Andrew Nicholson. · To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
