A unique treatment clinic for child sex offenders will close this month, after the government announced today that it had failed to find an alternative home for the centre.Donald Findlater, manager of the Wolvercote clinic, condemned the decision as a tragedy which would endanger the safety of children throughout the UK. "The Home Office says it remains committed to residential work with sex offenders but I can't get a definitive answer about when a new clinic will exist or a new site will be identified," he said."I can't even tell you whether we will be any further forward in a year's time, and the longer it's left the more difficult it will be to resuscitate the programme. Every day we're closed more children will suffer."The clinic, hailed by ministers as the most effective in Britain, has to leave Horton hospital in Epsom, Surrey, because the land it stands on belonged to the Department of Health, which earmarked it for sale to a developer seven years ago.The 25-bed unit, set up in 1995 by child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, is the only one of its kind in Europe. The treatment regime involves offenders acknowledging their sexual responses to children and taking control of their behaviour.More than 280 men have passed through Wolvercote since it opened and only 14% are known to have re-offended after undergoing intensive and secure treatment under 24-hour supervision, as an alternative to a custodial sentence.Ray Wyre, a founder member of the foundation and expert on the treatment of sex offenders, said the decision was a disaster for child protection in the UK."This means that sex offenders all over the country will still be living next door to you, they will exist in the community, and now there is nowhere to send those who it is possible to change, thereby reducing the number of children who will become victims of abuse."The 11 men currently receiving treatment in the clinic will have to complete their rehabilitation programmes in the community, but the treatment will not be of the same quality and level of intervention as it would have been at Wolvercote, said Mr Wyre.Mark Leech, chief executive of Unlock, the national association of ex-offenders, said a permanent closure would be a "grievous loss". He said: "Closing it for good will put people at more risk rather than reducing the risk of re-offending."A government plan to relocate the clinic to the Silverlands Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey was strongly opposed by Runnymede council and by local people. Home office minister Hilary Benn confirmed today that the government was no longer pursuing the Silverlands site for relocation and said he had commissioned the National Probation Service to undertake a national review of the provision of residential treatment for sex offenders.Tink Palmer, principle policy and practice officer on child sexual exploitation at children's charity Barnado's, and an expert on the subject, said the closure was of great concern for all professionals working in the field.
