A teenager has been found stabbed to death after a householder confronted three youths who had broken into his home, police have revealed. Detectives were last night focusing on the possibility that the 17-year-old victim and two other youths were disturbed by the homeowner, a man in his early 20s, as they attempted to ransack the house on Friday afternoon - echoing the case of Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who shot dead a young burglar as he fled his home.Two men in their 20s including the householder, along with two male youths, have been arrested and were being questioned by detectives last night in an effort to unravel the events leading up to the stabbing. Police were called to a house on Heathfield Road on Nottingham's Heathfield Estate and found a youth with stab wounds lying on the floor. He had suffered serious blood loss and was later declared dead at the Queen's Medical Centre hospital.The 23-year-old householder, who is being held in custody, told detectives he found the youths in his home as he walked into one of the rooms. "We are exploring whether this was a burglary which went wrong, resulting in the resident confronting one of the alleged burglars and during the ensuing altercation a sharp implement being produced which caused fatal wounds to one of the youths," said a police source. "As we would with any serious incident of this nature we are following all lines of inquiry to see if the scenario presented to us is consistent with any other evidence at the property or from any witness accounts. At present this is still being pursued as a murder investigation."Neighbour Fazal Khan, 33, a computer technician, said: "We had been burgled as well last month, so that's two burglaries in three or four weeks. They are good people who live in that house. When somebody broke into our house the lady called the police because we were not at home."
