Police are investigating an incident captured on CCTV which appears to show officers repeatedly punching a restrained man who had been stabbed in the head.Darren Grace, 31, was found with head injuries and stumbling around Stanley Park in Liverpool on 1 August.Merseyside police said Grace, a joiner from Anfield, resisted three officers' attempts to treat his wounds and became violent towards them.The footage, which was captured on council CCTV, showed one officer landing eight punches onto Grace's injured head while a female officer puts her hand on his arm.Five minutes later, just before 8am, both she and the other officer appeared to punch Grace in the head and back as he lay face down on the ground.The 31-year-old was later charged with two counts of assaulting a police officer â€“ charges which were eventually dropped when Crown Prosecution Service lawyers saw the video.After receiving basic treatment, Grace was held in a cell for 11 hours.Merseyside police yesterday accused him of being violent towards the officers and said "CCTV images can never show the whole story".After being shown the tape by the Liverpool Echo, the force voluntarily referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which decided not to pursue an investigation.The IPCC said: "Having assessed all the available evidence, including statements from officers, we are content at this stage for the matter to be investigated by Merseyside police's professional standards department without further IPCC involvement."Superintendent Mike Shaw, from the professional standards department, said the force expected "the highest standards from our officers" and would take disciplinary action against those found have breached them. He said: "At about 7.45am on Sunday, 1 August officers were called to a disturbance in Butterfield Street in Anfield in which it was reported that a male had been stabbed."Inquiries led officers to Stanley Park. Upon arrival they found Mr Grace with head injuries in need of medical assistance. During the course of administering medical assistance to Mr Grace he became violent towards the officers."In this case, I understand that members of the public will be concerned when watching this footage. However, I would like to stress that CCTV images can never show the whole story." Shaw said the force had been in contact with Grace and his solicitor and had been advised there would not be a complaint lodged at this point.He added: "Mr Grace does not want to take part in any misconduct investigation. Nevertheless, in order to understand the full circumstances of the incident the professional standards department has launched an investigation." This will include looking at the circumstances that initially led police to Mr Grace, the circumstances around his arrest and the circumstances, which led to the discontinuation by the CPS."It is important not to prejudge the outcome of the investigation. It would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time."
