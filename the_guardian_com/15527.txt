A 20-year-old woman was run over and killed shortly after being abducted when she got in a car believing it was a taxi, police said yesterday.Stephanie Hammill, a travel agent, and her fiance, James Garland, 22, flagged down a car early on Saturday in the centre of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, to take them home after a night out. Ms Hammill got into the back seat of the dark-coloured saloon and left a door open for Mr Garland, but before he could get in the vehicle sped away with the door still open. Minutes later, Mr Garland flagged down a police van and shortly afterwards a report came over the police radio of an accident. Ms Hammill's body was found a mile-and-a-half away on the Wakefield to Batley Road near Wrenthorpe. A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said it appeared she had been hit by a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction to the route taken by her kidnapper. Officers she may have been hit by another vehicle after trying to escape, but it is possible that only the saloon was involved. Detective Superintendent Howard Crowther said: "There are lots of possibilities at the moment and we don't want to speculate." Tests confirmed Ms Hammill had multiple injuries consistent with being hit by a car. Mr Garland was not allowed near the accident scene.
