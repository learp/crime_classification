Armed police in Watford have arrested a man carrying a bomb who had threatened staff during a three-hour siege at a bank in the Hertfordshire town's centre.Military and armed police surrounded the Co-operative bank in Market Street, Watford. A police spokeswoman said: "An explosive device of some kind – as yet we don't know what this is – has been removed from this individual."A cordon was put in place around the branch of the bank and people nearby were urged to stay inside and co-operate with police for their own safety.The man was forced to his knees outside the bank as he was arrested by armed police, a picture published by the Watford Observer showed.The black-haired suspect was wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and black trousers as he was held.Sources said the incident was not thought related to terrorism.Hertfordshire police said in a statement: "Safety of members of the public was paramount and a cordon was put in place and people were evacuated from nearby premises."There will be police activity in the town centre for a while to come. Understandably this caused concern within the community and we would like to thank members of the public for their co-operation in this matter."During the siege police would not comment on suggestions that the man was carrying a bomb but adopted the hash tag #watfordbomb to post updates on Twitter.As speculation mounted, a message appeared in the official Hertfordshire police Twitter feed reading: "We are using the hashtag #watfordbomb as it was created by users and we want to make sure our messages are seen and to keep you updated."Twitter users were quick to point out the irony of a police force using such a phrase to appeal for calm.A witness to the siege claimed hostages had been taken and then set free, after which three marksmen continued to aim their weapons at the bank.The owner of local business G Tailoring, who gave his name only as John, said during the drama: "There are three of them and they are about 30 feet away from the bank on the opposite side of the road. They are really the only ones we can see from here."There's a lot of police around, pulling people back from the bank, and a few helicopters flying overhead."People are saying that the man in the bank has got a bomb strapped to himself and, as far as we know, all the hostages have been set free."He first noticed something was happening at about 10.30am. "A lady came out of the bank this morning and she was very distressed," he said. "I don't know if she was a staff member, I think she might have been a customer."
