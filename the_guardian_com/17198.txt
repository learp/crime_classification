Following the reimprisonment of Jon Venables, is it not time for all media groups, including broadsheets such as the Guardian, to question their continuing use of the police photograph of the distressed 10-year-old?Every time during the last 17 years when, for whatever reason, this tragic story resurfaces, we see the same photograph (After drug and affray arrests, child porn charges send Bulger killer back to jail, 24 July). The image serves no useful purpose and has not done so for many years, if ever.The possibility of an adverse psychological effect on someone like Venables, a deeply disturbed person, caused by seeing this photograph of himself as a child over many years in the media and how it might impact on his ability to cope as an adult is surely an issue which all media groups should be aware of and take some responsibility for.So long as it is taken for granted that we, the public, have some kind of unquestionable right to look at and be fascinated by this image of Venables without even considering that its publication or transmission may be causing him further distress, we should not be so shocked at the revelation of Venables' own fascination with images of children in distress. Venables has expressed a willingness to learn lessons; perhaps the media could too.Name and address supplied
