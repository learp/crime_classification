The 15-year minimum prison sentence for knife murders is to be reviewed following the Ben Kinsella case, the justice Â­secretary, Jack Straw said today.The move follows criticism by Kinsella's parents of the sentences handed down last week to the killers of their son, aged 16, who died after he was trying to get away from a fight in Islington in north London in June 2008.His parents, George and Deborah Kinsella, asked the government to review sentencing guidelines for judges. "If you murder someone with a gun, the starting tariff is 30 years. But if you do it with a knife, it's 15 years. What's the difference?" said Mr Kinsella.Straw told MPs he had ordered the review as he recognised there were "considerable concerns" about the gap in minimum terms. "I intend to review the provisions of schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 with a view to deciding whether to amend it as I can by order," he said. "I will, of course, be consulting the senior judiciary and the sentencing guidelines council and would be very happy to receive wider representations."Michael Alleyne, 18, Juress Kika, 19 and Jade Braithwaite, 20, were all given life sentences with a minimum 19-year prison term last Friday.
