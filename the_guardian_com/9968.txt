Two men today appeared in court charged with the murder of the schoolgirl Danielle Beccan, who was shot as she made her way home from a funfair in Nottingham earlier this month.Junior Andrews, 23, and Mark Ontonio Kelly, 20, were accused of killing the 14-year-old in the drive-by shooting. The two men, flanked by six security guards, appeared in the dock at Nottingham crown court.Wearing prison issue yellow and green overalls, they spoke only to confirm their names during the hearing, which lasted less than a minute. Danielle was on her way back from the city's annual Goose Fair with friends when she was shot in the stomach by a gunman in a passing car in the early hours of October 9. She had been only yards from her home, in the St Ann's area of the Midlands city when she was killed at around 12.30am. Mr Andrews, of no fixed address, and Mr Kelly, of Wilford Grove, in the Meadows area of Nottingham, were remanded back into custody following the hearing. No application for bail was made, and no pleas were entered to the joint charge of murder. The case was adjourned for a plea and directions hearing on January 12 next year. Meanwhile, thousands of Nottingham residents were today expected to join a city centre demonstration against gun crime, at which a minute's silence will be held for Danielle. Nottingham has experienced a wave of firearms violence in recent years, with much of it blamed on drugs gangs.
