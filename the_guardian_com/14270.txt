A rape victim broke down in tears as she confronted the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, over plans to halve sentences for rapists who plead guilty at the first opportunity.The woman, who said she was put through almost two years of trauma before her attacker pleaded guilty, branded Clarke's plans "a disaster".Confronting the justice secretary after calling BBC Radio 5 Live, she said she had fought the criminal justice system for 688 days, only for the rapist to have his sentence reduced for pleading guilty â€“ and then go on to commit another offence.She attacked plans to increase the discount given for an early guilty plea from one third to a half, saying: "It happened to me. It's a disaster, especially with sex offenders."Talking through her tears, she told Clarke: "I wouldn't wish what I went through, fighting the criminal justice system for 688 days, on my worst enemy."I'd gone through the trauma of it, for the 688 days and then on that 688th day he pleads guilty and gets out early."She added that the attack had a knock-on effect on her career and her family.But Clarke, who was appearing on Victoria Derbyshire's call-in show on Wednesday, defended his plans, saying an extra discount for an early guilty plea could avoid her being dragged through the further ordeal of a trial."People who save you the 600 days of going to the police station, preparing to give evidence ... We're saying a 50% discount saves trauma," he said."The reason for giving a discount for pleading guilty is so the victim doesn't have to be put through the ordeal again."Rape is actually the strongest example, in my opinion, of why you [increase discounts for those who plead guilty early]."We'll give you credit if you put your hands up, stop messing about and don't make it worse for the victim."He added: "If it was the case that I was saying rapists should be out in a year, I would vote for somebody else myself."Clarke said no one convicted of a "serious rape" would be released as quickly as those guilty of some date rapes.Quizzed on why rape sentences were on average only five years, he said: "That includes date rape, 17-year-olds having intercourse with 15-year-olds."A serious rape, with violence and an unwilling woman, the tariff is much longer than that. I don't think many judges give five years for a forcible rape frankly."Asked if he thought date rape did not count as a "serious" offence, he said: "Date rape can be as serious as the worst rapes but date rapes, in my very old experience of being in trials, vary extraordinarily one from another and in the end the judge has to decide on the circumstances."Asked whether David Cameron regarded date rape as "serious", the prime minister's spokesman replied: "Yes."He added: "The position is that there is a consultation. That is continuing."We are looking at this issue of plea bargaining, not just on the issue of rape."The spokesman said some other systems, such as the US, used plea bargaining without being regarded as "soft".He said: "Where we are at the moment is that we have inherited a system where conviction rates are far too low and we need to get those rates up."
