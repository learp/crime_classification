Scotland Yard yesterday unveiled its plastic bullet firing baton guns, saying that the weapons would help save lives.From September 1six baton guns will be available for the Metropolitan police's SO19 armed response officers. The L104A1 baton gun fires 9cm by 3cm circular plastic rounds that can knock down a person from 25 metres when aimed at the stomach region. They can kill if used as a conventional weapon and are aimed at the head and upper body. Officers are trained to aim for the belt buckle and may use them against suspects thought to be carrying knives. The guns are intended as the "less lethal" option to conventional firearms which will still be deployed against people suspected of carrying guns. Bullets leave the gun at 160mph. "We deliberately use the term less lethal," said Commander Andy Baker, chairman of the Met's less lethal options working group, which will be reviewing the weapon's use and performance in six months. "It's a firearm but used with proper assessment it is a safe weapon, said Mr Baker. "It causes trauma, it is an impact weapon. It will cause injury but that has got to be levelled against the possibility of someone being shot dead." The Â£1,082 baton guns are being introduced after research by officers into several other options. Tests are still being carried out on tazers, stun guns with a high voltage electrical charge, that have been deployed in the US and Canada. Other weapons that could be added to the Met's armoury include water cannons, backpack water lasers and noise sound beams that "make people react in peculiar ways," Mr Baker said.
