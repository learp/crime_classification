The widespread disdain which greeted Tony Blair's proposal for imposing on-the-spot fines for yobbery when he announced it two years ago still lingers this week as a modified version comes into effect under four police forces.Thinktanks, usually so keen to take any intellectual credit going, did not rush to claim paternity. "Don't blame us - it wasn't us," said one official at the institute for public policy research, who acknowledged that the idea had survived the initial ridicule. That might be because, according to insiders, the idea came from the famously bright young things within the Downing Street policy unit - now the policy directorate - and was enthusiastically embraced by the prime minister. It might even have been his idea, officials admitted. As a lawyer, he was aware of the time and paper-chasing effort involved in bringing minor miscreants to account. Mr Blair's choice of venue, a religious conference in south Germany, gave the suggestion an improbable start in early 2000. "A thug might think twice about kicking in your gate, throwing traffic cones around your street or hurling abuse into the night sky if he thought he might get picked up by the police, taken to a cashpoint and asked to pay an on-the-spot fine," he said. Though drunken louts might not be thinking much at midnight on a Friday it was the cashpoint detail that prompted most ridicule. Two days later, the Home Office minister Charles Clarke said Mr Blair had been "using a metaphor". Three days later Euan Blair, then 16, was found unmetaphorically drunk in Leicester Square. Months of refinement produced a policy plausible enough to survive more attacks from MPs and peers and to end up in the 2001 Criminal Justice and Police Act, subject to it being tested in pilot areas.
