The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, yesterday admitted that there was "still some scepticism" about extending detention without charge beyond its current 28 days among those who had responded to the government's consultation.She strongly denied to MPs yesterday that the proposal amounted to internment and said that there had been no specific case which had warranted more than 28 days since the limit was introduced 12 months ago. Ms Smith was giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee as Human Rights Watch warned a further extension would violate the basic right to liberty and be counter-productive in winning the trust of the Muslim community.But the international human rights group welcomed recent statements by ministers disowning Tony Blair's claim that the "rules of the game have changed", meaning that human rights have to be set aside when tackling terrorism.A Human Rights Watch briefing paper says there is now a greater emphasis on preventing radicalisation and recruitment as the core element of the counter- terrorism strategy.Ms Smith said she was convinced of the need to go beyond 28 days because of the seriousness of the threat and the increasing complexity of the terror plots facing Britain. She said it was far better to legislate as a precaution in the current calm atmosphere than in the immediate aftermath of another terrorist attack.But she declined to put a figure on a new limit, saying it was up to parliament.Ms Smith insisted that detention without charge did not amount to internment as claimed by Liberty and other human rights groups, saying that involved widespread detention to prevent an attack.She said the use of detention now was to bring individuals to justice by charging them with a specific offence."The debate is not helped by calling it something it isn't," she said.Ms Smith said that 36% of the 1,228 people held under the anti-terror laws since 9/11 had been charged, which compared with the 38% charging rate of those arrested for all other types of crime in 2004-05.She made clear that when the detailed legislation is published in an anti-terror bill before Christmas, it will include new safeguards with powers for Lord Carlile, the anti-terror law watchdog, to look at specific cases and a quarterly report to parliament on the use of the new law.
