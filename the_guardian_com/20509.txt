A woman who was hacked to death on the orders of her husband was left dying in the street with her hand severed, the Old Bailey was told today.Geeta Aulakh was killed as she went to collect her two young sons from a childminder because she had begun divorce proceedings, said Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting.Jafferjee said her husband, Harpreet Aulakh, offered Â£5,000 to a room full of Punjabi men in exchange for her death in an act of "breathtaking indifference".Aulakh, a receptionist at Sunrise Radio, was found dying in Greenford, west London, last November.Harpreet Aulakh, 32, of Greenford, Sher Singh, 19, of Southall, Harpreet Singh, 20, of Slough, and Jaswant Dhillon, 30, of Ilford, east London, deny murder.Jafferjee said a group of men struck when Aulakh was yards away from the childminder's."They knew exactly where to wait and when to be there," he said. "There were three of them, albeit only one would hack her to death."So savage and determined was the mission to kill her that, when she sought to protect her head, her right hand was completely severed from her arm."The man who organised this murder was none other than her own husband. He planned it. The other three defendants executed it."Jafferjee said the motive for murder was straightforward. "Geeta Aulakh was in the process of divorcing him, and that would not be tolerated," he told the court."No one else in the world could possibly have wished this utterly innocent and hardworking woman and mother any harm."He said Harpreet Aulakh knew, because of the "history of their relationship", that the finger would be pointed at him and alleged that he had gone into a pub with CCTV at the time of the murder to ensure he had an alibi.Aulakh's husband had claimed that, while there were problems in his marriage, he and his wife had been working things out.The trial continues.
