A government policy to fine drunken troublemakers up to £2,500 under a new system of "alcohol asbos" introduced today has been rubbished by magistrates whose job it is to impose them.The Home Office has announced that courts can now ban anyone aged 16 and over from drinking in certain pubs and bars and particular public areas and entering off-licences if they are regularly antisocial or commit crime while drunk. Offenders breaching the new "drinking banning orders", which last between two months and two years, will be fined. Anyone who is subject to an order will be referred to a "positive behaviour intervention course" to address their alcohol misuse, which will cost offenders up to £250 each.But the Magistrates' Association, which represents 28,000 volunteer magistrates, said the orders duplicate existing legislation and are unlikely to help solve problems caused by drunkenness on Britain's streets."We are not convinced that DBOs will do very much more than the provisions magistrates already have at their disposal and we do not believe they answer our demands for more alcohol treatment courses," a spokeswoman for the Magistrates' Association said."In our view it is unlikely that those who could benefit from such an order would be sufficiently motivated and willing to pay for a DBO course."Alan Campbell, a Home Office minister, insisted the orders "will stop those people who are well known to the authorities, licensees and often the communities where they live, from ruining lives and will make them face up to their destructive behaviour".But civil liberties campaigners said that the new orders were a "gimmick" which simply recycles the existing powers under antisocial behaviour orders which were created 11 years ago.Police sources warned the initiative duplicates existing powers and would achieve little in the fight against alcohol-related crime, which the Home Office estimates costs between £8bn and £13bn in England and Wales."How many times can you spin a new crackdown without tackling the causes of offending behaviour?" said Isabella Sankey, director of policy for Liberty, the civil liberties campaign group. "It will be jelly bean asbos for sugared-up kids next."The "alcohol asbos" come amid growing public concern at drink-related crime. According to the 2007/08 British Crime Survey, a quarter of people think drunk and rowdy behaviour is a problem in their area – up from 19% in 2003/4 – while a fifth of all violent crime occurred in or around a pub or club.Licensing reforms in Scotland, which come into force tomorrow, will include a ban on irresponsible promotions, as well as entitling customers in pubs and clubs to free tap water.The move also represents a revival of asbos which have been in decline, with the number issued falling 44% from 2005 to 2007, according to the latest available figures. "Alcohol asbos" are being backed by the drinks industry and alcohol awareness groups as well as the Association of Chief Police Officers.Jeremy Beadles, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said the new rules would encourage irresponsible drinkers to accept support."Tough enforcement against offenders is critical if we are to change the culture around problem drinking," he said."Used as part of a package of measures to reduce alcohol's harms, these initiatives can make a real difference to safety on our streets," said Don Shenker, the chief executive of Alcohol Concern."Policing of alcohol-related crime must go hand in hand with more robust measures to curb irresponsible and illegal sales and improved treatment pathways for dependent drinkers.""The ability to take further action against those who, through vulnerability or lack of personal responsibility, regularly misbehave under the influence of alcohol will assist the police in dealing with the complexities of alcohol misuse and misbehaviour," said Simon O'Brien, ACPO's lead officer on alcohol licensing. "The minority of mostly young people whom these powers are aimed at are usually well known in particular areas or local hotspots."But a senior officer from a police force covering an urban area told the Guardian that unless the orders included mandatory daily testing for alcohol, they would have little impact. He said he and other colleagues in the leadership of British policing were becoming increasingly fed up with government initiatives: "There's a neverending series of announcements, and not one thing has changed," he said.
