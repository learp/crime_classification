Two women found murdered in a nursing home were named by police yesterday. The bodies of Rashni Badiani, 56, and Radhaben Chauhan, 72, were discovered by staff in the room they shared at Hayes Park residential home in Leicester on Wednesday in the early hours. Police believe the killer got in through a ground-floor window.Mrs Badiani had been at the home since December 2004, while Mrs Chauhan, described by her family as a "beautiful, bright, warm person", had lived there since August. A statement from Mrs Badiani's family said: "We cannot believe what has happened. We are still trying to come to terms with the fact that we will never get to see her beloved smile again."A man of 19 was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of the murders. He remains in custody. Initial postmortem results found that Mrs Badiani had suffered serious head injuries but detectives were awaiting further tests last night.Detective Superintendent Chris Thomas said: "Our minds are still open as to the motive for this crime. We continue to work closely with the directors and staff at the home, who continue to cooperate fully with the police investigation in difficult circumstances. Our thoughts are with the families of Mrs Badiani and Mrs Chauhan at this time."Yesterday the home's directors defended security at the home, which has 49 residents.
