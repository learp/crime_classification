Judges may dress up in 18th-century wigs and wear knee breeches and tights on ceremonial occasions, but they are fully in touch with ordinary people's lives, the lord chief justice said last night."We do not live on rundown estates, but we do travel on buses and tubes and bicycles, we push trolleys around supermarkets, we have normal family concerns and commitments and neither are judges immune from the impact of crime," said Lord Phillips. "And day by day our work gives us an insight into what is happening in all sectors of society, which is shared by very few," added the head of the judiciary in England and Wales.Speaking at the lord mayor's annual dinner for judges at Mansion House in London, Lord Phillips condemned recent media criticism of judges' sentencing decisions as "intemperate, offensive and unfair". Lord Falconer, the lord chancellor, who also spoke, said journalistic attacks on the recorder of Cardiff, John Griffith Williams, who sentenced paedophile Craig Sweeney last month, had been delivered with "venom". He praised the judge, who imposed a life sentence with a five-year minimum jail term before Sweeney could apply for parole.The lord chancellor said it was "obvious" that judges needed more discretion in sentencing. The concession was an about-turn for Labour, whose sentencing laws have increasingly removed judges' discretion to suit the sentence to circumstances. Among those who attacked the judge last month was Vera Baird, a junior minister in Lord Falconer's department, who was forced to apologise after saying that the judge had got it wrong. John Reid, the home secretary, announced that he would ask the attorney general to refer the sentence to the appeal court, but Lord Goldsmith said it was correct within existing guidelines.
