The quashing of Stephen Downing's murder conviction after 28 years ends one of the longest running miscarriages of justice, second only to the overturning of Derek Bentley's conviction which took 45 years. It is one of many:· Derek Bentley's murder conviction was overturned by the court of appeal in July 1998. Bentley was sent to the gallows on January 28 1953 after his companion Christopher Craig, 16, shot PC Sidney Miles. · The Guildford Four, Carole Richardson, Gerard Conlon, Patrick Armstrong and Paul Hill, were cleared of the Guildford and Woolwich bombings after 14 years in prison in 1989. · Convictions against the Maguire Seven, Annie Maguire, husband Patrick, son also Patrick, Sean Smyth, Vincent Maguire, Patrick "Guiseppe" Conlon and family friend Patrick O'Neill, were ruled unsafe in 1990. The seven were convicted of running an IRA bomb factory in north London. · The Birmingham Six were convicted in 1975 for the murder of 22 people in two pubs in Birmingham the previous year. The men, Paddy Hill, Richard McIlkenny, Hugh Callaghan, Gerard Hunter, William Power and John Walker, were freed in March 1991 after the court of appeal quashed all the convictions. · Judith Ward was wrongly convicted of the 1974 M62 coach bombing in which 12 people died. At the time it was the worst IRA outrage on the British mainland. She served 17 years. · Four men, Jimmy Robinson, Vincent Hickey, Michael Hickey and Pat Molloy, were convicted of killing Carl Bridgwater, a 13-year-old newspaper boy, in September 1978. One died in prison in 1981 and the three surviving members were released in 1997, after serving 17 years. · Stefan Kiszko was found guilty of the murder of an 11-year-old schoolgirl, Lesley Molseed, in 1976. He served 16 years before being freed by the court of appeal in February 1992.
