Downing Street has rejected Boris Johnson's call for the government to abandon plans for substantial police cuts after four nights of rioting across England.In a statement, No 10 said the cuts were "manageable".The statement came after Johnson urged the government to scrap plans for cutting police budgets – not just in London but across the country – in what may become one of the most significant policy differences between the Conservative London mayor and his party leader, David Cameron.Labour also called for the government to rethink police cuts, and criticised Johnson for opposing the cuts now given his willingness to cut police numbers in London.Johnson spoke out in an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, in which he also said the initial police response to the riots should have been more robust. By allowing the disturbances to escalate, the authorities had scored a "massive own goal", he said.He said he had always been sceptical about the case for police cuts, and recent events had made them even harder to defend."If you ask me whether I think there is a case for cutting police budgets in the light of these events, then my answer to that would be no. I think that case was always pretty frail, and it has been substantially weakened," he said."This is not a time to think about making substantial cuts in police numbers ... I'm looking at the country as a whole."Johnson welcomed the news that the police operation in London on Tuesday night had kept trouble to a minimum, but added: "When you look at what happened on Saturday night, and when you look at all the succeeding events, you have got to ask yourself: could the police have gone in harder? Could there have been a more significant display of intolerance by us, by society, by the police, of what was going on?"However, on another issue the mayor offered support for Cameron. He acknowledged that in the past he had been sceptical about the claims Cameron made in opposition about Britain being "broken".But the riots suggested this analysis was at least in part correct, Johnson said, adding: "This is a massive wake-up call for everyone. There are aspects of our society that have patently gone off the rails."There was an "absence of boundaries" and an "absence of respect", he said, adding: "We need to think about ways of imposing discipline on [young people]." He suggested that a national citizen service – which is being piloted by the government – could be one solution.After Johnson's interview, Downing Street said Cameron rejected the mayor's argument about police cuts."The urgent need to take action to address our budget deficit is clear from the events around the world now," a spokesman said."The reductions in the police budget for the spending review period are manageable. There is no question that the police will still have the resources they need to do their important work."In a response to Johnson, the home secretary, Theresa May, said police efficiency savings would allow more resources to be focused on the frontline."By the end of the spending review, it will still be possible, with the numbers of police there will be, to be able to be using the sort of resources that we have seen used in the last few days," she said on Radio 4's The World at One.According to a House of Commons analysis released at the end of last year, police forces in England and Wales face a funding cut of more than 15% in real terms over the next two years. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said she agreed with Johnson that the riots had highlighted the danger of cutting police budgets."The 16,000 police on the streets of London made a big difference last night in restoring calm," she added. "This is further evidence that the Tory-led government needs to urgently rethink its cuts to police officers and budgets."But she refused to give Johnson credit for his stance, saying: "It is shameful that it has taken these appalling events to force Boris Johnson to realise that people are concerned about police cuts ... he has already cut 900 police officers from the Met."Johnson also came under attack from Ken Livingstone, Labour's mayoral candidate. Livingstone accused Johnson of "hypocrisy" and said in a statement on his website: "Boris Johnson may want to look like a critic of the government for police cuts but this is fake and hypocrisy as he has been ramming through overall police cuts in London and undermining neighbourhood policing himself."On Wednesday morning Ed Miliband demanded government help for the individuals and communities affected by the violence.While backing the need for a strong police response, the Labour leader started to focus attention on the work that will need to be done to repair the damage to shops and homes."We are calling for a rapid response from the government to help those communities hit hardest by these riots to get back on their feet as quickly as possible," Miliband said."As well as ensuring public safety, we need immediate help for those people who have lost homes and businesses. As we see in natural disasters like floods, we need focused support so that these victims of the violence get the support they need."Until Tuesday night, Labour had been largely supportive of the government's approach to the riots. Although Livingstone suggested budget cuts were partly responsible for the violence, Miliband and other Labour frontbenchers insisted – as government ministers have done – that there was no excuse for the disorder.But the cross-party consensus started to break down when Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, became involved in an acrimonious exchange with the education secretary, Michael Gove, on Newsnight about the causes of the rioting.Although she said there was no justification for violence, Harman also suggested government policies such as the trebling of tuition fees and the abolition of the education maintenance allowance (EMA) were relevant.But Gove said it was "fatuous" to suggest that arson attacks had anything to do with the changes to EMA.
