Police continued to play a psychological cat and mouse game with Raoul Moat as they tried to establish a rapport with the fugitive – who has evaded them for almost a week –and avoided saying anything that would upset him.In two letters purportedly written by Moat — one a rambling 49-page note addressed to the police; the other an eight-page missive directed towards his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart — he expressed his frustration that he was not being taken seriously.However, no one can doubt the seriousness with which the police are taking Moat and his new threat to extend his vendetta against police to the public at large.Police forces from across the UK have provided marksmen, specially trained search officers, dog teams and specialist vehicles to assist the county force as they comb the national parkland. Mountain rescue teams are also involved.Scotland Yard has sent a team of 40 armed officers from its CO19 unit, including snipers armed with high-velocity rifles and telescopic sights.Police have, however, refused to confirm reports that SAS officers have joined the search for Moat, although they have confirmed the military has been approached for advice – as has the Serious and Organised Crime Agency.But understanding how Moat's mind works could ultimately prove as important as scouring large areas of Northumberland's undulating countryside.Yesterday detectives intensified their efforts to establish a psychological rapport with Moat by flattering his ego in their public statements. Forensic psychologists said police appeared to be trying to forge a bond of trust with him so he could imagine handing himself in rather than dying in the gunfight he had said he wanted.They have lavished Moat with positive statements, praising his outdoor skills and describing him as a measured individual. The message seemed clear: "We are taking you seriously."And crucially, today, they did not directly appeal to the alleged killer to hand himself in, unlike on previous days when Detective Chief Superintendent Neil Adamson made personal appeals to Moat, emphasising there was still time.It is thought that Moat, who is believed to be armed with two shotguns and a large amount of ammunition, may have been able to monitor the coverage of events with outside help.Two men who attempted to cross the exclusion zone in the village of Rothbury, north of Newcastle, yesterday teatime were stopped and arrested by police on suspicion of assisting an offender, while two other men, arrested on conspiracy to commit murder, appeared in court yesterday in Newcastle.Today, as the focus shifted from the threat to police to a non-specific threat to the general public, the residents of Rothbury reacted with stoicism."I don't think people should worry necessarily as long as there are police around," said Roz Tinlin, who runs a guesthouse in the town."But I think there have been fewer officers here today than before so with what has been said I am not sure people feel that safe."County councillor Steven Bridgett said the atmosphere had definitely changed since the police revealed members of the public were now potential targets."Obviously this has made people a lot more nervous because before this all the anger and threats had been directed at the police," he said. "People are definitely a lot more tense but they are determined to get on with their day to day business."When police found the second letter at Moat's temporary campsite earlier this week it showed that he still thought the man he shot dead early on Saturday, 29-year-old Chris Brown, was a Northumbria police officer.He was, in fact, a karate instructor who had recently moved to the north-east from Slough, Berkshire.Detective Chief Superintendent Adamson warned those who may be helping Moat evade police that anyone "assisting, harbouring or helping" him would be arrested and prosecuted.Once again, the officer expressed the force's desire "to resolve this situation safely", adding that "the force is making every effort to do so".Adamson also said officers had received a hoax call from someone pretending to be Moat, and said the last thing that he wanted to do was deal with such calls.Speaking of his frustration at the failure to findMoat, he admitted he was disappointed and added that he was sure "all the public hold that view".He also appealed to someone who phoned police at 10.30pm on Wednesday and gave information about a vehicle linked to the inquiry to call back.Details of the vehicle were not released "for investigative reasons".He said that when he had spoken about the net closing in on Tuesday, he had been referring to the wider investigation. "We believe the likelihood is that he is in that area [Rothbury] but we are not putting all our eggs in one basket."
