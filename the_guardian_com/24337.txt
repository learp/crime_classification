Detectives were yesterday investigating claims that the scientist Stephen Hawking had been the victim of a series of attacks for the second time in four years.Police and Cambridge University, where the scientist is a professor of mathematics, confirmed that officers were investigating complaints that a 62-year-old man, in hospital with an unrelated illness, had been assaulted. They refused to name the man concerned but sources said it was Professor Hawking. But Prof Hawking's second wife, Elaine, 53, said she knew nothing about the police inquiry. "He's safe and well in hospital where he's suffering from pneumonia." A spokesman for Cambridge University said: "We can confirm that Cambridge police are investigating an allegation of assault on a 62-year-old man who is currently in hospital undergoing treatment for an unrelated condition." Jane Hawking, 57, Prof Hawking's ex-wife, said she and their children, Robert, Lucy and Tim, were very concerned.
