A man arrested on suspicion of murdering a mother and her seven-month-old baby is being assessed by mental health experts. West Midlands police said the 28-year-old suspect had been deemed unfit to be interviewed about the deaths of the victims, who were named locally as Yvonne Walsh, 25, and her son Harry.The pair were found dead at a terrace house in Billesley, Birmingham, at about 10.30am on Sunday after concerns were raised for their welfare. Police arrested the man seven hours later in the Sandwell area of the West Midlands.A police spokesman said: "The victims have yet to be formally identified but are believed to be Yvonne Walsh and her son Harrison Walsh, known as Harry."A man arrested on suspicion of both murders is currently in a secure facility following an assessment by mental health professionals. He is currently deemed unfit to be interviewed by officers at this stage, but this is being constantly reviewed."The person in custody is known to the victims and officers are keen to stress that they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the killings."Postmortem examinations were due to take place later on Monday.Meanwhile, forensic investigations were continuing at the house, which remained was cordoned off.The police spokesman added: "A serious case review and a domestic homicide review are expected to take place in due course, as is routine practice when a child dies in these circumstances."Due to previous contact between police and the person in custody, West Midlands police has informed the Independent Police Complaints Commission who will look into any police involvement."One resident said on Monday that police had initially informed people that a serious incident had taken place in the street.The neighbour, who declined to give her name, told reporters: "We saw her [Walsh] around with her little baby but she kept herself to herself to be honest."It was really surprising when I heard what had happened because I have not heard or seen anything happening at the house before."It was yesterday morning we saw the police arrive at about 10 o'clock â€“ they told us there had been a serious incident and we found out on the news what had happened."Another resident, 62-year-old Susan Butler, paid tribute to Walsh."You just don't envisage something happening like that," she said. "She was a pretty quiet girl and I saw her last week holding the baby. It's really, really shocking and all the neighbours are probably feeling the same."
