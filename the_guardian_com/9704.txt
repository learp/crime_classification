On its own, the case of Kirk Reid is about as troubling as it can get for the police: a serial rapist left free to attack women by police blunders described today as shameful by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It means there are many victims who need not have suffered, if the police had done their job.But put in context, the case is even more troubling. Reid is only the latest case to have come to light where police bungled the chance to stop a serial attacker of women.In the case of John Worboys, the Met police missed chances to stop the man who was known as the "black-cab rapist". Worboys drugged, raped and sexually assaulted at least 85 victims despite numerous women reporting attacks over many years. He was arrested and released after a woman came forward in July 2007 and officers chose to believe his account, not hers. The victim said she had been "lied to and laughed at" by officers when she gave them her account of the attack. Worboys was given an indeterminate sentence in April 2009 for drugging and sexually assaulting women.This month, the IPCC again castigated the Met after errors left Robert Napper free to murder two women and a four-year-old girl, and commit a series of sexual attacks. Napper killed Rachel Nickell in 1992, and in 1993 murdered Samantha Bisset and her daughter, Jazmine. In 1989, Napper's mother rang police to say he had told her he had raped someone. No action was taken.In those cases, the IPCC investigated, but no officer faced any sanction. In the Reid case, three will face a hearing. But the problems go much deeper. The Met had been breaking its own guidelines, and failing to record reports of rape as a crime. Instead they were classed as "crime-related incidents". Senior officers say that failing has been put right, but accept that victims were denied a proper investigation.
