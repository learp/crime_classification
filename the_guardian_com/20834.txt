A husband and wife jailed for killing a three-year-old boy they were planning to adopt with a salt overdose had their conviction quashed yesterday, but will face a retrial.Following the judgment Ian and Angela Gay, who are accused of poisoning Christian Blewitt four years ago, protested their innocence again and said they hoped that "one day soon true justice will finally be done". The court of appeal ruled that the jury which convicted the couple of manslaughter might have reached a different conclusion had they heard additional medical evidence. The couple were immediately freed on bail but the three judges ruled that they would face a retrial.The couple's lawyers put forward fresh evidence from a retired consultant in chemical pathology that Christian could have died of natural causes as a result of a type of "salt diabetes".Ian Gay, 39, and his 40-year-old wife, from Halesowen, West Midlands, were each jailed for five years in January last year for manslaughter following a seven-week trial at Worcester crown court.Christian died in hospital four days after being found unconscious in his room on December 8 2002 at the couple's house in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.Mr Gay, an electrical engineer, and his wife, an insurance actuary, were released on bail pending the retrial, which is expected to take place at the end of this year at the earliest.After the couple emerged from the court cells Mrs Gay read out a statement saying: "The convictions against us have been quashed. However, we must now face the fresh agony of a retrial. We now know for certain what we knew all along - that Christian died of natural causes."Angela Gay later told ITV Central News that she had been devastated by Christian's death. "I was taken to hospital because the shock of what happened was just too much to cope with," she said."The grieving process when you lose a child ... you can't describe unless you go through it yourself. It's just the most intense pain."She added that although both she and her husband had hoped "it would all be over today", they were still delighted to see each other for the first time in more than 14 months."[Being apart] was very difficult because you can't really express how you are feeling in letters all of the time," she said.Defence lawyers argued that the jurors were presented with just two options: either the couple murdered Christian by blunt force to the head or were guilty of manslaughter through feeding him salt as a punishment for naughtiness.According to the new witness, Glyn Walters, the boy could have been suffering from a rare condition which allowed sodium levels to build up. The condition is rare in adults and no case involving a child has been reported. But Dr Walters believed it could explain why Christian had so much sodium in his system.Lord Justice Richards, sitting in London with Mr Justice Penry-Davey and Judge Ann Goddard, said they had not lost sight of the fact that the medical evidence, although important, formed only part of the evidence in the case.The couple, having recently taken on the "immense burden" of looking after three children with a view to adoption, were "in a position of considerable stress". Difficulties they had experienced with Christian had added to that stress.Christian had been taken into care at the age of one and later placed with the Gays along with his two younger siblings.The other evidence served to underline "why we put it no higher than a possibility that the jury might have reached different verdicts if the evidence of Dr Walters had been placed before them," said Lord Justice Richards."The conflict in expert advice would have been a proper matter for the jury to evaluate in the context of the evidence of the case as a whole."
