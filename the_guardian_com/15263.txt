A high court judge yesterday indicated he would allow a challenge by eight police officers and overturn an inquest jury's verdict of unlawful killing after the death of a mentally ill black man in police custody.Lawyers for the officers argued that the inquest on Roger Sylvester, 30, from Tottenham, north London, was wrongly allowed to be turned into a surrogate criminal trial in which the officers stood convicted of manslaughter. They contended there was no evidence to support the decision that Mr Sylvester had been killed unlawfully. Mr Justice Collins reserved his judgment, but indicated that he was going to quash the verdict because the coroner's summing up was defective and some of the reasons given by the 11-strong jury for their verdict were inconsistent. On the third day of the judicial review hearing counsel for Mr Sylvester's family said evidence had been sufficient to merit the verdict. Patrick O'Connor QC, dismissed the officers' claim that the coroner for Inner London North, Andrew Reid, had failed to properly direct the jury. Mr Sylvester died nearly six years ago after being handcuffed and restrained for around 20 minutes by up to eight officers who had detained him under the Mental Health Act. The jury returned the unanimous verdict of unlawful killing in October last year and found Mr Sylvester had died from brain damage and cardiac arrest related to his restraint. The officers argue that the jury should not have been allowed to consider the verdict. The judge's full verdict is expected within a few weeks.
