But this magnificent memorial will ensure we never forget.”He continued: “On 1 September 2014, Lee Rigby was honoured by the nation at a ceremony in Staffordshire where his name was added to the Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum but today it is his hometown, his family, his friends, his fellow fusiliers, at the site of this memorial can reflect upon the tragic loss of a son, a father, a friend and, above all, a fusilier.“We will remember.”An additional memorial wall has also been built at the gardens that in time will commemorate other local soldiers.Councillor June West, chair of Middleton Township, said: “The Middleton community and the township were very clear in their support for a permanent memorial here in his hometown – a lasting legacy where Lee and other soldiers can be remembered not only by their families and friends but by so many others who owe them such a debt.“I would like to thank our local residents and those who have worked hard to make this happen.“I would also like to thank Lee’s family for their support and I know they too are pleased that calls for this local memorial were answered.”Speaking ahead of the service, Rigby’s mother said it was “a lovely tribute” to her son “who put his life on the line every day to serve his country”.
