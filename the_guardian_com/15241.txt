 The coalition government has allowed more than 10,000 perpetrators of domestic violence to get away with an apology and slap on the wrist, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, will say on Monday.Cooper will draw attention to the problem in a speech highlighting the choice for voters between a Labour government pledging to tackle domestic abuse and the Conservatives "downgrading action on violence against women".Labour also confirmed it would look at introducing a specific offence of domestic violence in an effort to increase the falling prosection rate in such cases, though it would be careful not to set the parameters too wide and risk criminalising arguments between couples.Cooper's speech in Birmingham will also highlight the drop in prosecutions and convictions for rape, child sex offences and domestic violence even though reported offences are going up. She will also criticise the loss of 9,000 frontline, visible police officers and the government's refusal to introduce compulsory sex education to teach zero-tolerance of violence against women.Labour has promised to bring in a violence against women and girls bill that would end the use of community resolutions in cases of domestic violence. These orders for a perpetrator to agree a penalty with the victim, such as an apology or compensation, allow those who commit minor crimes to avoid a criminal record.The Association of Chief Police Officers has said these are only appropriate for crimes such as low level criminal damage, low value theft, minor assaults without injury and anti-social behaviour, but Cooper released figures showing that forces across the country are regularly employing them to deal with domestic violence.The data, obtained by freedom of information requests, show the number being used doubled to 3,305 last year, compared with 1,337 in 2009. She said the government had ignored warnings in a joint inspection report from the inspectorates of the constabulary, probation service, prisons and prosecutors that community resolutions are being abused."These figures are deeply worrying," she said. "Domestic violence is an incredibly serious crime. Two women a week are killed by their partner or an ex and 750,000 children will grow up witnessing domestic violence. For the police to simply take a violent abuser home to apologise risks making domestic violence worse, and makes it even harder for victims to escape a cycle of abuse."Labour has called on the government previously to prevent the use of community resolutions for serious crimes, including domestic violence. Today's figures reveal that nothing has been done."David Cameron said on Friday the government would look into creating a separate offence of domestic violence, while stressing that the "main thing" was making sure police have the "training and understanding" to take it seriously as a crime. The prime minister said the UK needs to "get to grips" with the issue of domestic violence when he was asked on BBC Gloucestershire about the case of Hollie Gazzard, who was stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend in February. She had previously contacted police about her partner's violent and threatening behaviour. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is reviewing the force's handling of her complaint.The government created the offence of stalking in 2012, but some charities have been pushing for a specific crime of domestic violence that would allow sentences to reflect whether domestic abuse, physical and psychological, was part of a pattern of behaviour. In February, a cross-party group of MPs tried to get a domestic violence bill through the Commons that would have criminalised abusive forms of behaviour that are not currently offences, including coercive control.Elfyn Llwyd, the Plaid Cymru MP who brought forward the bill, and successfully ran a campaign for a new anti-stalking law, has now written to the prime minister asking him for a meeting to discuss the possibility of a new offence."What that bill does is bring into line current legal practice with the definition of domestic violence now accepted by the government," he said."The definition now includes coercive control, bullying, keeping a person short of money, that sort of thing. That kind of behaviour can be just as bad as physical abuse if someone is living in a hellish situation day-in, day-out."I can understand the argument against extending it too wide, in other words if a husband does something on a one-off like tearing up a credit card, that shouldn't give rise to any charges. But if it's serious and prolonged, that is a different issue."The Conservatives are under pressure over the issue because of the case of David Ruffley, the Tory MP who received a police caution for common assault on his ex-girlfriend in March. The MP is to face a disciplinary investigation conducted by the party's chief whip, Michael Gove, after a complaint was sent to the party by the Very Rev Frances Ward, the dean of St Edmundsbury Cathedral, who said he should step down.A Home Office spokesman said the government has already ordered the police to stop using out-of-court settlements for serious criminality and produce "action plans" on domestic violence."No government has done more to tackle the abhorrent crime of domestic abuse than this government," she said. "Our groundbreaking Claire's Law will help protect women from abusive relationships, while domestic violence protection orders are cracking down on the destructive cycle of repeated abuse."
