Bright winter sunshine marked the funeral yesterday of the murdered traffic policeman Ian Broadhurst, to the relief of family and friends who had resolved to turn tragedy into celebration.Colleagues of the man known as the life and soul of Killingbeck police station in Leeds queued up to pay tribute to his good nature and commitment. Their memories of WB-38 - PC Broadhurst's callsign on the police radio net - were matched by warm tributes from accident victims and even minor criminals who had crossed his path before he was shot dead on Boxing Day while trying to arrest the driver of a stolen BMW. "I too, like Ian, have a passion for cars - that's why I keep getting caught driving whilst disqualified," said one of more than 1,000 letters received at the station. "Not dangerously, I might add, but Ian and Neil [PC Neil Roper who was shot and wounded in the tragedy] were always fair with me." West Yorkshire's chief constable, Colin Cramphorn, followed it with a tribute from a woman who had been trapped after a crash."He stayed in the car until I was free and his words of encouragement were a great comfort." PC Broadhurst's widow, Eilisa, watched as his coffin, draped in the blue flag of West Yorkshire police, was carried into the Leeds parish church past more than 200 police officers and the force band. Inside were 800 mourners; 500 were outside watching the ceremony on a big screen. PC Roper and a third traffic officer, PC James Banks, who was also shot on Boxing Day but escaped injury when the bullet hit his belt buckle, were in the guard of honour.
