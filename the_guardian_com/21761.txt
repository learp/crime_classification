Lawyers for Michael Stone, convicted of killing Lin Russell and her six-year-old daughter, Megan, yesterday launched a high court battle to prevent the media from reporting intimate medical details about him. Stone is trying to block the publication of the full report of an inquiry into his supervision and treatment by Kent mental health, probation and social workers before he killed in 1996.Josie Russell, Megan's sister, who was badly injured in the attack, and her father, Shaun, are pushing for the report to be published in the hope that mental health professionals will learn lessons from it and prevent similar crimes in the future. The report, by an independent barrister, has been kept secret for six years.In court yesterday, Richard Clayton QC, for Stone, said Stone had cooperated with the inquiry and disclosed sensitive medical information about his care and treatment to the investigating team. But he objected to the report, which contained "highly personal medical information", being published in its entirety to the "world at large, because of the treatment it will receive by the tabloid press".Mr Clayton argued that a full version of the report should be shared confidentially among health professionals and other officials, who could consider what lessons could be gleaned from it. Another version, shorn of sensitive medical details, should be published to the general public.Stone has had a long history of mental illness. His sister has claimed that he would not be serving three life sentences if he had been looked after properly.
