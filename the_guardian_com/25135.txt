West Midlands police have arrested three more men, including a juvenile, over the triple hit-and-run deaths in Birmingham in the early hours of Wednesday. The detentions took place about the time a 32-year-old man, arrested earlier on suspicion of murdering the three Asian men in Winson Green, was bailed pending further inquiries.The arrests occurred hours after the cousin of the brothers killed in the collision expressed doubts that the police would bring the culprits to justice.Abdul Nassir was speaking during a visit to the site where Haroon Jahan, 21, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, had died."We just want justice," he told the Guardian. "I don't care if the police do it, the army do it or whoever does it – there has to be justice."Asked if the police could obtain justice for his cousins and his wider family, Nassir said: "No, no, no … I am not satisfied with the police at all. Because they don't do anything, they stand there and sit there in their cars. That is what they are good for."Meanwhile locals living in the Winson Green area said on Thursday that just 15 to 20 minutes before the deaths of two brothers and their friend at the Jet garage on Dudley Road there had been an incident a few hundred yards away involving the theft of a digger from a construction site.The residents alleged that if this had been responded to, along with reports that up to 30 mainly youths had gathered nearby, some of whom they claim were wearing balaclavas, an earlier police presence might have deterred those behind the fatal crash.Local businessman Ahmed Zulkar claimed that if there had been prior warnings that serious trouble was about to ignite in the area late on Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday morning the tragedy may have been prevented."About 20 minutes before that car crashed into the lads we saw gangs of black youths arriving at the end of Dudley Road towards the city centre. Some of them were wearing balaclavas and had arrived in vans ready to loot. They broke into a construction place near the old police station and stole a digger and drove it around," he said."Where the police when they were doing that? And if the police had bothered to come to the scene then maybe their presence would have stopped the person behind the wheel of that driving it into the lad standing around here and who died at this very place."
