Social services chiefs called last night for a special levy on nightclubs and town centre discos to fund schemes that could lessen the risks of alcohol-fuelled crime. The Association of Directors of Social Services said the government was in danger of paying too much attention to the problem of illegal drugs at the expense of effective action on alcohol abuse that causes trouble for many more people. It said nightclub owners and the organisers of discos which stay open into the early hours should be prepared to pay a levy to fund transport home for their customers. There should be more use of closed circuit television, higher visibility policing, more transport links at closing time, and better designed town centres to create a less hostile environment, the association said in response to a government consultation on alcohol and drug abuse. John Dixon, director of social services for West Sussex, said: "There are huge concerns about the crime implications of alcohol, particularly in city centres. Manchester, for example, has become dominated by alcohol-related crime." The association has not yet costed the proposed levy, but Mr Dixon said he thought club owners would pay a reasonable sum to reduce the risk of crime and disorder. The association said alcohol misuse produced "significantly more social harm even than drug misuse", but the national effort was unbalanced towards action against drugs. It called on the alcohol industry to assume a far greater sense of social responsibility in the way it advertises and markets alcohol, particularly drinks aimed at the younger market.
