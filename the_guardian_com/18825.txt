A man arrested in connection with the murder and kidnap of businesswoman Carole Waugh has been charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit fraud.Nicholas David Kutner, 47, of no fixed abode, is accused of pretending to be Chris Waugh, Ms Waugh's brother, in a bid to sell her London home.He also faces two charges relating to renting her property at Tressard Court in south-west London and a fourth of unlawfully withdrawing funds from the 50-year-old's bank account.Miss Waugh, originally from Durham but living in London, had not been seen by her family for more than three months.Her body was discovered with a single stab wound inside a car at a garage in south-west London on Thursday.The Metropolitan police said Kutner was bailed to return to a police station on 25 August relating to his arrest on suspicion of murder and kidnap last Wednesday.He has not been freed because he is being held in custody on the fraud charges ahead of an appearance by video link at Camberwell Green magistrates court on Monday.Waugh, who had worked in the oil industry in Libya, had not been seen since mid-April when she spent the weekend with her family in Durham. She last contacted them on her arrival home in London.Detectives from the homicide and serious crime command took over the missing persons investigation two weeks ago, after Waugh's bank accounts became the target of significant fraudulent activity.Her body was later discovered in a VW Golf at a garage in Lime Court, New Malden.Detective Chief Inspector John McFarlane, who is leading the investigation, said: "The vehicle is a blue VW Golf, registration number W466 NHL. We need to hear from anyone with information on the car, particularly since April this year. Anyone who can assist us on where it has been since then, or can advise on anyone with a connection to it, should come forward."The lock-up is in a row of garages behind two detached 1930s houses in a quiet street. They have been cordoned off while forensic teams investigate the scene.McFarlane said: "We now believe Carole has not been seen alive since 16 April. Since that time significant plundering of her estate has taken place to the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds."Personal items, including Cartier jewellery, had gone missing from her flat. Police have released images of a Cartier ring, a white gold bracelet, a yellow gold bracelet and a yellow gold necklace."Carole wore the jewellery regularly," McFarlane said. "I appeal to anyone who may have been offered such jewellery or has any knowledge of its whereabouts to contact us with information."One line of police inquiry has been into suspicions that Waugh led a double life. While her family believed she was a successful businesswoman, officers were investigating evidence that she worked as an escort in London.Ten people have been arrested concerning Waugh's disappearance, which became a murder hunt this week.
