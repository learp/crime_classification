Papers outlining the case against the parents of Madeleine McCann are expected to be passed to the public prosecutor today, according to Portuguese police.Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa, the detective who has been leading the inquiry into the disappearance of the four-year-old, said the case file on Gerry and Kate McCann would be handed over for the prosecutor to decide whether any charges should be brought.Last week, Mr and Mrs McCann were named as formal suspects in the disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine, who they insist was abducted from their holiday apartment in the Algarve more than four months ago.The development came after police reinterviewed the McCanns. Part of the interrogation was believed to have centred on the results of forensic analysis of their apartment and hire car.The local prosecutor, Joao Cunha de Magalhaes, will decide whether any charges should be brought against the couple, who returned to their home in Leicestershire yesterday.Further test results due from the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham may also influence how the investigation unfolds."At the moment, the inquiry is being prepared to be handed to the prosecutor in charge of the case," Mr Sousa said. "He will analyse it and, after this, he will make his decision."Asked when the papers would be handed over, he replied: "Probably during today."Brian Kennedy, Mrs McCann's uncle, gave a brief statement to the dozens of journalists near the couple's home in Rothley.He said Mr and Mrs McCann were continuing to receive messages of support, adding: "They are OK. They had a decent night's sleep, and the twins slept soundly. They are holding up extremely well."Faced with more questions about the McCanns' next steps, he said he believed they would "try to live as normal lives as possible".The couple left their family home for a holiday in Portugal at the end of April. Yesterday, more than four months later, they flew back to the UK with their two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie, but without their eldest child.Police and social services representatives in Leicestershire were holding talks today about how they should now respond to the Madeleine's disappearance and the naming of her parents as formal suspects.John Coughlan, the joint president of Association of Directors of Children's Services, said local authorities had to take seriously any formal charges brought by an overseas police force. Under the Children's Act 1989, they would have to evaluate available evidence and any implications concerning the welfare of siblings. He said welfare agencies normally attempted to support children within their own family, possibly with the help of family members.Earlier, Philomena McCann, Madeleine's aunt, accused the Portuguese police of "clutching at straws" in their investigation into the missing child.She said the family continued to believe that Madeleine was alive, urging police to "turn the investigation" around to hunt for her instead of concentrating energies on her possible death."It is unbelievable they [the McCanns] have been named as suspects - no one believes the Portuguese police," Ms McCann told GMTV. "Two more loving parents you could not hope to meet."All I can suggest is the Portuguese police are clutching at straws, they want to get this case cleared up. Kate and Gerry have been a thorn in their sides for a long time. What better than to cast them as the villains?"Following a request for privacy, some news organisations were broadcasting from the town's war memorial, which had acted as a focus for wellwishers' cards and flowers in the days after Madeleine vanished.After touching down at East Midlands airport just after midday, Mr McCann, his voice breaking, insisted he and his wife had played no part in their daughter's disappearance."Whilst it is heartbreaking to return to the UK without Madeleine, it does not mean we are giving up our search," he said. "As parents, we cannot give up on our daughter until we know what has happened."The couple do not know if or when police will call them back to Portugal, although they will obey even if they fear they could be arrested, a family friend said."They are not running away. It is a change of place but they are very happy to help the police," the friend added. "If they need to come back for interviews, they will come back for interviews."During the police interview, detectives suggested to Mrs McCann that traces of Madeleine's blood had been found in the family's hire car, a silver Renault Scenic.She is understood to have told them angrily there was "no way" this could be the case because they did not lease the vehicle until 25 days after their daughter disappeared.Portuguese police have given no indication about the strength of the forensic material from the hire car or the family's holiday apartment.Carlos Pinto de Abreu, the McCanns' lawyer in Portugal, told the Guardian claims by relatives that police had offered Mrs McCann a plea bargain if she admitted to accidentally killing her child were wrong.The claims were the result of "a misunderstanding" while she was being questioned.Mr and Mrs McCann were receiving further legal advice from the London law firm Kingsley Napley, the family said in a statement last night. One of their advisers is Michael Caplan QC, who defended the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.The couple said they would not use money raised to help the search for Madeleine to pay their legal bills, the BBC reported.
