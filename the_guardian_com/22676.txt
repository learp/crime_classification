The mother of a woman murdered 30 years ago called today for her killer to examine his conscience and come forward. Mary Sedotti, 77, and her husband, Michael, 79, made the appeal as detectives try to find the murderer of Teresa De Simone, who was raped and strangled outside a Southampton pub in 1979.Police have reopened the case after Sean Hodgson was cleared of the murder in March.Hodgson, 57, spent 27 years in jail but after DNA evidence was re-examined, it was discovered he could not have been the culprit.He had confessed to the killing of the 22-year-old gas board clerk and part-time barmaid, but pleaded not guilty at his 1982 trial. A jury at Winchester crown court found him guilty.Mrs Sedotti, from Southampton, told the Southern Daily Echo she remained doubtful her daughter's killer would be found despite the reopening of the case by Hampshire police."Someone out there knows who murdered my daughter," she said."If they have any conscience they need to come forward and say whatever they saw or heard or know."This person has lived his life. For 30 years he has got away with it. All we have are memories – we don't ever forget those – they are the only thing left."Sedotti said she had no feelings for Hodgson, who is now free and pursuing a compensation claim for the years spent in jail.She said she watched the news break on television when he was freed by the court of appeal and said: "All this time I thought my daughter's killer was in prison. Just knowing that whoever did this is still out there somewhere, that he has never been caught, is terrible."De Simone's partially clothed body was found in the back seat of her Ford Escort in the car park beneath the Tom Tackle, the pub where she worked.During Hodgson's trial, prosecutors relied on the confession and a match of a blood type with samples found at the scene.His defence team argued Hodgson, from County Durham, was a pathological liar and that his confessions were false. He was found guilty on 5 February 1982.
