The government is proposing to shake up the way rape trials are conducted in a bid to boost the number of convictions.The solicitor general, Mike O'Brien, said that, while the number of complaints of rape had risen sharply, convictions had only increased slightly.Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, he said: "An awful lot of people who are committing rapes are getting away with it."The proposed changes are contained in a consultation document aimed at increasing the conviction rate. Last year, 14,000 rapes were reported but only one in 20 resulted in a conviction.The home office minister Fiona McTaggart said: "There is clear evidence that the mismatch between convictions and reports suggests there are people who have raped who don't get convicted."One of the proposed changes is to make video interviews with rape victims automatically admissible in all cases - currently they are only allowed when the victim is under 18. These recordings, which are often made within hours of the alleged offence, might give juries "a more detailed and accurate account" of victims' experiences, the consultation document said."I am trying to give juries the best possible evidence available. If that evidence is the interview given to the police shortly after reporting the rape, then the jury should be able to see that," said Mr O'Brien.Another proposal is to allow experts to give evidence about an alleged rape victim's general behaviour after the attack. This would bring the UK more in line with the way rape trials are conducted in the US, Canada and Australia.The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, said last year he was in favour of introducing expert witnesses to the courtroom to "challenge the myths" about victims' behaviour.For example, jurors often find it difficult to understand why battered wives return to their abusers and fail to grasp why a victim might not report a rape for many weeks or months. Such apparently puzzling behaviour is often used by the defence as a basis for questioning, in order to make victims appear unreliable or untruthful.The government would also like to redefine the law on when a person consents to sex, particularly if drugs or alcohol have been consumed."What we need to do is make sure that where alcohol has been consumed and it affected the capacity of the victim, then that matter should be put before the jury," said Mr O'Brien.He pointed to a number of cases where judges had decided that a rape case should not be put before a jury because the alleged victim had been intoxicated and her evidence was "hazy" - that is, she could not say "with absolute certainty" that she did not consent.
