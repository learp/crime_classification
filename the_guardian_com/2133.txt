Janette Mercer, the mother of Sean Mercer, who shot dead the schoolboy Rhys Jones, has admitted lying to police during the murder inquiry.The 49-year-old pleaded guilty at Liverpool crown court today to perverting the course of justice. She changed her plea after initially denying she had lied about what happened to her son's mountain bike after the shooting of Rhys, 11, in August 2007.Rhys was killed as he walked home from football practice through a pub car park in Croxteth Park. He was hit by a bullet fired by Mercer at someone else.Sean Mercer, 18, a member of the Crocky Crew gang, was convicted in December of killing the schoolboy and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison.Janette Mercer, who is from Croxteth, wept in court today as she admitted the charge and had to repeat her guilty plea for the court to hear her.The judge, Henry Globe, said he would extend Mercer's bail but that she faced jail. "She is completely guilty of a serious offence. I have agreed to a pre-sentencing report being prepared but I cannot envisage passing anything other than an immediate custodial sentence."The case is adjourned until 1 April.Last month, James Yates, 20, Nathan Quinn, 18, and Dean Kelly, 17, were jailed for aiding Mercer after the murder.Gary Kays, 26, and Melvin Coy, 25, were jailed for helping Mercer dispose of the revolver and clothes from the shooting. Boy M, to whose house Mercer rode his bike after the murder, was given a two-year superÂ­vision order and a curfew.
