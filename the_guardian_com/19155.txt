The Home Office yesterday cut by 22,000 its projection for the prison population in England and Wales from 109,000 by 2009 to 87,000.Ministers attribute the lower estimate to efforts to persuade the courts to use prison more sparingly and on the introduction of tougher community penalties. But penal reformers found little comfort in the official confirmation that the current prison population of 73,700 is still expected to rise to between 76,000 and 87,000 within five years. It was also announced that new community penalties - a flexible community order and a suspended sentence called "custody minus" to include community work - will come into force on April 4. Longer terms for more serious offenders, including the new "indeterminate" sentence for sexual and violent offenders, will come into effect on the same date. This new sentence will mean that some repeat serious offenders considered by the Parole Board to be a continuing threat to the public may never be released. The prisons and probation minister, Paul Goggins, said: "I know that robust properly supervised community punishments can make a major impact on reducing reoffending and tackling the causes of crime and I welcome their increased use, particularly for some non-violent, low-level offenders." Mr Goggins said it was still hoped to "hold" numbers at 80,000 but that the prison building programme would mean there would be enough places if they went higher. Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust urged the government to be more robust in its efforts to drive down prison numbers.
