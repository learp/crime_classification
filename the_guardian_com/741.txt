Sweeping new legal powers to enable headteachers to search pupils suspected of carrying knives and other weapons will be unveiled by the government today amid growing concern about violence in schools.The violent crime reduction bill, to be published today, will increase the legal age for buying knives from 16 to 18, as well as giving more powers to police and schools to tackle knife crime among young people. That will bring knife ownership into line with the age limits for the purchase of alcohol and fireworks. The proposals will be set out by the home secretary, Charles Clarke, who as education secretary pledged to stamp out the knife culture which has spread from the streets into schools. At present headteachers can search pupils only with their consent, and are limited to simply being able to ask a pupil to give up suspect weapons. The changes will mean that for the first time headteachers can conduct body searches with or without consent if they suspect a pupil is carrying a weapon. Although headteachers broadly welcome the proposals, they are concerned about their vulnerability in a potentially dangerous situation without police presence. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: "It is a useful power but many headteachers will be asking serious questions about what will happen if a pupil objects to the search. If they are indeed carrying a weapon, a teacher could be on the receiving end of a potentially very dangerous assault or attack." Steve Sinnott, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: "The bringing of weapons into school is a growing menace, though it is impossible to quantify at present. Giving the power of forcible search to headteachers will help protect other pupils and staff from the dangers weapons pose."
