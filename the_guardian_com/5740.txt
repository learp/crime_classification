The jail sentences of four members of a drug gang who fought gun battles in Manchester were increased yesterday after the government's leading law officer argued they were unduly lenient.The court of appeal sentenced four senior members of the Pitt Bull Crew to up to 12 years in prison after hearing that they were responsible for a spree of drug and firearms offences. The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith QC, appeared before the court to argue that sentences passed last year at Preston crown court were too low. The gang "were busy selling drugs 24 hours a day, seven days a week", Lord Goldsmith told the court, flooding Manchester's Longsight area with heroin and cocaine. Gang leader Thomas Pitt was last year jailed for life for murder. His drug empire used machine guns to protect its business and attack rivals, the court heard. Innocent members of the public were caught in the crossfire, which displayed the "worst excesses of gangsterism", Lord Goldsmith said. He said tougher sentences were needed to stop spiralling gun crime, which was especially attractive to the young. The Pitt Bull Crew was one of four Manchester gangs using guns, which had left the city with the highest level of recorded firearms offences outside London. The 1988 Criminal Justice Act gives the attorney general the power to ask the court of appeal to increase sentences regarded as unduly lenient. Pitt's half brother, Michael Gordon, 21, had his sentence increased from nine to 12 years, the same period in jail that the court handed to Douglas Thorne, 25, who originally was sentenced to eight years. The sentence of Moses Boakye, now 22, was increased from eight to 10 years and that of Mark Simons, 23, was increased from seven and a half to 12 years. The sentences of five other junior gang members were left unchanged.
