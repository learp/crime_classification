On 2 April, PC Steven Denniss stopped a white Porsche Cayenne in West Bridgford, Nottingham. England cricketer Graeme Swann emerged from the car clutching a set of screwdrivers and with the smell of "intoxicating drink" on his breath.He told a court in Nottingham on Monday that the reason he had chosen to risk driving under the influence of alcohol was to rescue his cat, trapped beneath the floorboards.The cricketer's explanation for his drink driving was certainly surprising. Have you ever been in a similarly unusual situation? What excuses, sincere or otherwise, have you had to provide to account for your actions?
