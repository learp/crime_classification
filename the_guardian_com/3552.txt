Rapists are not being convicted because doctors are making errors when examining victims, according to medical experts specialising in sexual assaults.Vital clues are being lost because of the large number of doctors conducting forensic examinations who are not up to the job, it is claimed.Dr George Fernie, chairman of the British Medical Association's forensic medicine committee, told the Guardian: "Rape victims are being let down. If you don't have a doctor that knows what he or she is doing, and doesn't conduct an effective examination, then they are being let down by that."The inexperience and lack of expertise of such doctors is leading to cases in which a defendant escapes conviction, said Fernie. He is concerned that a shortage of forensic medicine experts, known as sexual offence examiners, means that "there are some cases that don't have doctors that are properly trained and skilled in this area of practice and therefore that they are contributing to a reduction in the rape conviction rate because they haven't conducted the crucial initial examination properly".Doctors will debate the issue at the British Medical Association's annual conference next week. A motion from the BMA's Yorkshire regional council laments "the patchy provision of fully trained sexual offence examiners across the UK and believes that this contributes to a reduction in rape conviction rates". It has been submitted by Dr Rachael Pickering, a sexual offence examiner in South Yorkshire and member of the BMA's forensic medicine committee."I'm concerned about the variation in the quality of care delivered to victims of sexual offence crime", said Pickering."Gold-standard sexual offence examiners combine compassion and professionalism, have rigorous training and develop significant experience, which is often needed in court. Being examined by less ideal doctors can be traumatic in itself for an already traumatised victim, and more likely to lead to unnecessary problems in court."Forensic physicians, who used to be called police surgeons, examine detainees in custody, cases of sudden death and victims of violent and sexual crimes. Their evidence-gathering, especially with victims of rape and child sexual abuse, can prove crucial in court cases.But there are "many too few" with the right skills and experience to cover such cases because training in this work is no longer given at medical schools, some private firms employed by more than half the 43 police forces in England and Wales employ doctors who are not suited to the task, and recruitment into the specialism – especially of women – is difficult because of the antisocial hours involved.Although 58% of rape cases that reach court result in a conviction, there is great concern that these represent just 6% of the total number of rapes reported to police. Many cases never get as far as court because victims decide not to pursue their complaint or prosecuting authorities decide the chances of a conviction are too low.Women Against Rape said the doctors' worries tallied with "some major concerns" it has about how forensic medical examiners work. "I'm sure that rapists are going free because of this problem. I'm not sure if the quality of forensic medicine examiner is what it should be," said the group's Lisa Longstaff."We have issues with no evidence being gathered at all, and with the quality of evidence being gathered in some cases, and [with] how this evidence is presented in court by doctors who are called as witnesses."The poor quality of evidence gathered in some rape cases could be down to certain doctors bowing to pressure from police not to record an incident as a rape, rather than a lack of training, she said."If the forensics aren't good quality and not independent, what does that tell you about the importance of rape investigations? It seems to be not a priority for the police or the medical authorities," added Longstaff.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said the funding and commissioning of forensic medical services should be transferred from the police, who currently employ individual doctors or private contractors to do the work, to the NHS, as proposed in Lady Stern's recent review of how public authorities respond to rape complaints."It is important to stress that this is not a criticism of current doctors, but a recognition that high levels of training should be provided to professionals in this field," said Dave Whatton, Acpo's lead for rape and serious sexual offences. "Equally, the importance of having female medical staff who are able to carry out very sensitive examinations with survivors, who are often highly traumatised, is accepted."The Fawcett Society, which campaigns on women's equality issues, urged every police force to set up sexual assault referral centres where victims of such crimes should have access to a fully trained forensic medical examiner. London, for example, already has some."This gold-standard service plays a vital role in providing high-quality medical and emotional support to victims of rape and sexual assault," said the charity's Daisy Sands."However, we are extremely concerned that due to a postcode lottery of provision, around two-thirds of rape victims who report their crimes to the police will not currently have access to this level of provision. It is simply unacceptable that a progressive society such as ours is failing to provide victims of one of the most heinous crimes with the level of service and care that they deserve."
