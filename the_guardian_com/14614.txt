Three children, thought to be aged between four and eight, tricked their way into a pensioner's home and stole her purse, police in Devon said yesterday.The children claimed they were collecting for charity and the 79-year-old woman allowed them into her home in Barnstaple, north Devon. The suspects are said to be two boys aged seven or eight and a girl of around four. After a short conversation, the pensioner let the children into her kitchen between 3pm and 4pm last Monday, where they played with her dog before making their excuses and running off. She later found her purse had been stolen.The victim, who does not want to be identified, said: "I gave them 50p, just to give them the benefit of the doubt, and off they went. It wasn't until later that I noticed my purse was gone." She said she had not planned to report it to the police initially, "but then I thought it might happen to someone else". She added: "I can't trust anyone now - I'm very unnerved. I thought they were so young, there isn't much they can do."PC Tom Hutton, of Devon and Cornwall police, said the theft was "truly shocking" and had left the victim "extremely distressed".Police are investigating the possibility that the children were collecting for a charity but saw a chance to steal once inside. An alternative theory is that they were targeting the house to steal or that the children were being used by adults to ingratiate their way into the pensioner's house. Once they had stolen the purse, they would hand it over to the adults.
