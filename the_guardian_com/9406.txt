A 12-year-old girl has become the first person under 16 in Britain to be electronically tagged, it emerged yesterday. The device, fitted to her right leg, is active 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Tom Stacey, director of the Offenders Tag Association, said the girl was at the lowest age at which anyone could be tagged in Britain and was the first person of her age to be tagged. "She is the first girl and it is a brave move," he said. "It has been used in the US for a while now and if it is properly managed then it works. We call it 'caring monitoring'. "Although it may appear draconian it can rescue someone from a life of crime and that has got to be worth it." The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was ordered to be tagged by magistrates in Walsall, West Midlands, after she broke an order not to enter the town centre. If she were to stray from her home a pager message would be sent automatically to a bail officer who would contact a private security firm to arrest her. Magistrates ordered her to stay out of the town centre after she was accused of mugging another 12-year-old for her mobile phone and Â£5 cash. The tag was fitted when she broke the bail conditions. The tagging of young offenders was introduced last year for children between the ages of 12 and 16 as part of the 2001 Criminal Justice Act. The girl's solicitor, David Grice, said: "I welcome this as preferable to the alternatives, which would have included locking her up."Press Association
