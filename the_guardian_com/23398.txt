A postman who used Facebook and Bebo to groom hundreds of children for sex was jailed for eight and a half years today.After creating at least eight fake online profiles, Michael Williams, 28, targeted children he met on his post round, on school runs as a taxi driver, and in his role as secretary of a football club.At an earlier hearing at Truro county court, Williams admitted 27 charges of inciting sexual activity, grooming and distributing indecent images. He also pleaded guilty to voyeurism and possessing indecent images.Devon and Cornwall police have identified about 500 victims he groomed or abused but believe there could be up to 1,000 children in total because hundreds were too scared to come forward.Williams, of Tresooth Lane, Penryn, near Falmouth, worked as a postman in his home town, where he was regarded as cheerful and helpful.He befriended many people on his rounds, including children. But he would also pursue the children using social networking sites â€“ sometimes using false names and posing as a teenager.Many victims were tricked into performing sex acts on a webcam, but he convinced others to meet him in parks, on beaches and at his home, where he abused them.Police found thousands of indecent images on his computer. It is believed he would secretly film children as they undressed on nearby beaches.Royal Mail, Williams's former employer, said it suspended him as soon as the police informed it of the investigation. He was dismissed after his arrest in February. He was also former secretary of Falmouth Town football club.
