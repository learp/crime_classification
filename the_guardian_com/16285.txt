A man pleaded guilty today to posting racist messages on a website commemorating the murdered black teenager Anthony Walker.Neil Martin, 29, posted the offensive remarks last August, just days after 18-year-old Walker was killed with an ice axe in Huyton, Merseyside.Martin, of Maghull, Merseyside, pleaded guilty at Liverpool crown court to publishing material intended or likely to stir up racial hatred.At an earlier hearing before South Sefton magistrates, he was convicted of 33 counts of taking indecent photographs of a child.Martin will be sentenced on October 6 following psychiatric reports.Heather Lloyd, defending, asked for time for Martin to see a psychiatrist to assess whether he may have the adult form of attention deficit disorder.She said: "He knows the racing certainty is that he can expect a custodial sentence, regardless of the psychiatric report."He has asked me to publicly apologise to Anthony Walker's family and friends. He has written a letter apologising for his disgraceful conduct and that letter has been passed to the mother of Anthony Walker today."Mr Justice Openshaw granted Martin conditional bail but warned him to expect a custodial sentence.The judge said: "He faces, it seems to me, the certainty of a substantial sentence in relation to each of these two matters."Martin spoke only to enter his pleas and indicate that he understood his bail conditions.Speaking outside the court, Gee Walker, Anthony's mother, said: "I'm pleased he pleaded guilty because it's an acceptance of what he did."It's best to nip these things in the bud before they get out of hand. This sends a message that this sort of thing will not be tolerated. I haven't read his letter yet so I can't comment on that."
