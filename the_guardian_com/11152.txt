Police were last night hunting for a man who hacked another man to death with a machete in front of shoppers in a south London mall, in what may have been a random attack.The victim was on a mountain bike beside McDonald's, just inside the entrance to a shopping precinct at Denmark Hill, in Camberwell, when he was attacked around 5.15pm on Monday. The 39-year-old married man has been formally identified but his name has not yet been made public as not all his next of kin have been informed. He appears to have been stabbed in the arm and stomach with a machete-type weapon, up to 45cm (18in) long. He was taken to King's College hospital but confirmed dead shortly after arrival. A postmortem examination was carried out yesterday. Detective Inspector David Morgan, who is leading the murder hunt, said: "This appears to have happened without any altercation and at this stage we don't know if the victim and culprit knew each other. One line of inquiry we are following is that it is a random attack. "We can't say the culprit won't strike again but we have no indication he will." Officers are scouring nearby undergrowth and grates for the weapon - a machete-type blade with a wooden handle - which DI Morgan said would be heavily bloodstained. "This was rush hour in an extremely busy area and we would appeal for any witnesses to come forward," he said. Police described the suspect, seen running away, as black, around 1.88 metres tall (6ft 2in) and of slim build. He wore a yellow T-shirt, a grey baseball cap and dark blue dirty jeans. He ran down Butterfly Walk across the Somerfield supermarket car park and turned right into Daneville Road. He then went up an alleyway and was last seen turning left into Kerfield Place. Anyone with any information about the murder is asked to call the incident room at Lewisham police station on 020-8721 4868 or, to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
