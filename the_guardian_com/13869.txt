A soldier critically injured in a street attack hours after returning from a tour of Afghanistan probably knew his attackers, say police.David Grout, 22, a married father-of-one who serves with the Royal Signals Regiment, had been celebrating his homecoming with relatives before the unprovoked attack near the Eston Institute in Eston, Teesside, at around 6.40pm on Tuesday.He is in a critical condition at the James Cook University hospital, Middlesbrough, with his family at his bedside, including his wife, Kerry, and 20-month-old son Harley.Detectives said he had left the social club to go outside for a cigarette when he was confronted by two men, one of whom punched him to the floor, causing serious head injuries.It is thought Grout's attackers had stayed with him for some time as he lay unconscious, before fleeing."From witnesses who have told us about David's body language it appears that he knew his attackers," said Detective Sergeant Colin Helyer. "I do not think this incident is in any way connected to David's service in the army."This attack was not planned and they have waited with David as he lay unconscious for some period of time before leaving. I believe the person who has done this knows David and knows his family. I would ask this person to come forward."Helyer said there would have been a large number of witnesses to the attack and he urged them to come forward.The signaller, who joined the army straight after leaving school, had recently returned from Helmand province, his grandfather Bryan Grout, 74, said, and had been socialising with his mother Maureen and her new husband, Ian Harrison, in the hours before the attack.Pam Gardner, who works at the Eston Institute, said that Grout's family had been drinking in the club on Tuesday afternoon. "The first I knew anything had happened was at 12.15am when the police came banging on the door," she said. "To think he's come back from fighting in Afghanistan to this is just shameful."Detectives want to speak to two white men seen running from the area. They were in their early 20s and one wore a white tracksuit while the other had a grey hoodie and white tracksuit bottoms.Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Sergeant Paul Husband on 01642 302 626.ends
