Violence towards a child provokes strong emotions, often accompanied by a general disbelief that a mother would ever want to kill her infant. In the past week, following the acquittal of Trupti Patel accused of murdering her three babies, there has been anger against the authorities for bringing such a case to court. She has gone through unimaginable suffering, having lost three babies to cot death. She has not been home for nearly a year, and has only been able to see her surviving eight-year-old child under close supervision.But amid concerns about the role of expert witnesses in such trials, we should not lose sight of the overriding principle that the child's interests must always come first. We are in danger of making it impossible for pathologists or paediatricians to scrutinise cot deaths because of our concern for the parents. As we report today, experts in the field are calling for investigations into cot-death cases to be removed from the adversarial nature of a courtroom and examined, instead, by a panel of experts who can look at all the evidence - social and medical - before a decision is taken to prosecute. Such a move would serve the interests of children and innocent parents. It should also enable the highly disturbed women who do suffocate their children to get the psychiatric treatment they desperately need, rather than a prison sentence.
