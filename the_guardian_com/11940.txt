A teenager found stabbed to death on a recreation ground may have met her killer in an internet chat room, detectives revealed yesterday.Police investigating the murder of Jeshma Raithatha, who was 18 last week, said they were examining the A-level student's use of websites and instant computer messaging. Officers said the "bubbly" girl, who was missing from her home for almost a week in London before her death, was an avid user of new technology, but said they had no evidence she formed any specific relationship in a chatroom. The aspiring singer, who had listed herself for voice-over work on a professional website, vanished after being seen at her north London school on Monday May 16. Forensic tests have shown she died six days later and had been stabbed three times in the heart. Police said the disappearance was "totally out of character" and are attempting to discover where she spent the six nights before her death, when she failed to contact her family or friends. Detective Superintendent Sue Hill, leading the murder inquiry, said Jeshma may have been held against her will and confirmed detectives were combing buildings and garages across the local area. The inquiry team will also investigate if the young student was staying with a friend or boyfriend not known to her family. Ms Hill said a post mortem had revealed no "obvious" signs of a sexual assault. "It is crucial to the inquiry that we find out where Jeshma was from when she was last seen until the time her body was found on Tuesday morning," she said. "She was a 17-year-old with everything to look forward to, who has been brutally killed. Her friends and family are traumatised. This is a devastating, harrowing killing of a beautiful young girl."
