The flytipping of rubbish on England’s roadsides, alleyways and footpaths rose for the second year running, official figures published on Tuesday show.There were nearly 900,000 incidents recorded across the country, up from 852,000 the year before, when incidents jumped 20% for the first time in several years.Cuts to local authority budgets have been blamed for the rise in incidents, which come despite government promises last year to take action on the problem. As well as a health hazard and an eyesore, flytipping costs local authorities serious amounts of money, with clean-up costs at nearly £50m in 2014-15. The number of enforcement actions by councils was up 3.1%.The Woodland Trust said that the increasing amount of flytipping meant it spent £27,982 in the last nine months to clean up rubbish on its land, compared to £22,850 over the same period in 2013.Norman Starks, the charity’s operations director, said: “Flytipping is an illegal activity that currently costs us tens of thousands of pounds each year to clear up. “This means that a collection of mindless individuals are preventing us from caring for and improving our native woods for the benefit of local communities and wildlife.”A spokesman for the environment department said: “We want everyone to enjoy a cleaner, healthier country. New powers will be granted to local authorities to fine fly-tippers and will be another tool in the battle against illegal dumping.”Flytipping statistics
