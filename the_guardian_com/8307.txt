A jail where 11 prisoners died in just over two and a half years did not implement safety recommendations made after the deaths, according to a report published today.The report, by the chief inspector of prisons, also criticises staff at Norwich jail for muting cell alarm bells and finds that inmate calls to the Samaritans were cut off after seven minutes.It says the prison has failed to act on key recommendations made following a spate of apparently self-inflicted deaths, and that staff training in suicide prevention was poor, support plans for prisoners at risk were inadequate, and dangerous ligature points had not been removed.Norwich, a local prison with the capacity to house more than 800 inmates, is described as "a collection of prisons with different tasks," none of which are performed effectively.The jail's healthcare unit comes in for particular criticism. The inspectors also said that black prisoners were more likely to be subjected to use of force and segregation than other inmates.Norwich has one of the highest death rates in the Prison Service: 17 inmates have died since 2000, including three in the last three months. In 2004 there were 359 reported incidents of self-harm at the jail.Phil Wheatley, director general of the Prison Service, said the jail was working hard to reduce the likelihood of self-harm incidents and all the safety recommendations had now been implemented.
