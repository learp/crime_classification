Despite our sneaking fondness for the Kemp brothers’ portrayal of Ronnieandreggie in the Peter-Medak-directed The Krays, it was somehow inevitable that another, higher-powered version of the activities of Britain’s most famous organised-crime bosses would emerge.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The Krays’ carefully-cultivated double-image appearance is also a natural for gimmick casting, and so has proved irresistible again: here it’s Tom Hardy incarnating both men, bespectacled Ron and dapper Reg – who, as history records, were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1969 for two murders.The just-released trailer shows us we are in full Gangster No 1 mode, with loving attention to period 60s detail and Roy Orbison’s Running Scared on the soundtrack. Brian Helgeland, imported from Hollywood to direct, has the script for LA Confidential on his CV, which is a good omen. We’re not too sure about the title, though, which is almost like calling it Geezer, or Muppet, or Top Boy. However, it’s certainly being viewed as a quality product, with a September 11 release date that indicates it’s being positioned for an awards run. Tom better do the business, in that case.
