Mercy killing could be reclassified and no longer treated as murder under the first major shakeup of murder laws for 50 years.Under the fundamental review, it could be classed as a lesser offence. But the terms of reference for the review, announced yesterday, make it clear that ministers are determined to retain the mandatory life sentence for any crime which remains classified as murder.That decision is a snub to senior judges, including the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, who would like to see mandatory sentences scrapped, leaving it to judges to fit the punishment to the circumstances.Judges have complained that current rules force them to treat all people convicted of murder in the same way, regardless of whether they are serial killers or have helped a terminally ill loved one to die.The review, to be carried out by a team led by the Home Office with the help of the Law Commission, is due to take up to two years.It is expected to lead to a new homicide act to replace the current act, which was passed in 1957.The Law Commission's chairman, Sir Roger Toulson, said: "Certainly, it is open to people to pose the question if the mandatory sentence is to stay for murder. Having that fact in mind, how should murder be defined and what should the defences be?"The review is expected to look at the intent required for the crime of murder. It will also look at the "partial defences" to a murder charge - provocation and diminished responsibility - which reduce murder to manslaughter.The Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart said: "The law needs to be clear, wide-ranging and fair so that people have confidence in the criminal justice system."Last August the Law Commission condemned the law on murder as "a mess".
