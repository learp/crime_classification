A 17-year-old youth was jailed for life today for stabbing to death a student and attacking his friend in a completely unprovoked 40-second attack described by prosecutors as "brutal and senseless".Michael Lynch will serve a minimum of 15 years for the murder of student Daniel Pollen in Romford, Essex, in July last year, London's Woolwich Crown Court heard.He was 16 at the time of the crime, and on bail for burglary. Before Lynch was sentenced judge Shirley Anwyl QC lifted restrictions protecting his identity, as is the usual practice for juvenile offenders.The court heard how Mr Pollen, who had been at a Romford nightclub celebrating the 20th birthday of his friend, Andrew Griffiths, had his jaw shattered by a punch before Lynch knifed him in the chest, most likely killing him within seconds.Mr Griffiths was also attacked and stabbed, although his wounds were less serious.Lynch pleaded guilty earlier this year to murdering Mr Pollen, 20, a second-year medical student at Southampton University, and wounding Mr Griffiths.Timmy Sullivan, 19 and 25-year-old Michael Onokah - who were cleared of murder at a trial last month - were convicted of wounding Mr Griffiths with intent and causing grievous bodily harm to the dead student.Sullivan and Onokah were given indeterminate sentences and told they would have to serve at least five years before being considered for parole.Before the sentences were passed, prosecutor Christopher Kinch told the court that even after the trial "we are no nearer any clear explanation for the unleashing of that gratuitous violence on two entirely innocent young men"."The murder of Daniel Pollen and the related attack on his best friend Andrew Griffiths formed a sustained and coordinated piece of violence that was as brutal as it appears to have been senseless", he said.Mr Kinch explained that the two victims had spent the evening at the Time and Envy nightclub in Romford with other friends. The three defendants were there at the same time but there was no evidence of any confrontation, he added.CCTV footage captured the attackers waiting outside the club at around 2am and appearing to notice the two men as they went to a car park to await a lift from Mr Pollen's sister.The "clear and chilling footage" shows a seemingly unplanned and unprovoked attack just seconds later as they walked down a passageway to the car park, beginning when Sullivan punched Mr Griffiths in the jaw, breaking it.Mr Pollen was then punched by Onokah before Lynch could be seen reaching into his pocket, seemingly for a knife, then stabbing the student in the chest.Mr Griffiths was also stabbed before the attackers fled in a car, the whole incident taking no more than 40 seconds.It was the CCTV footage that led police to Lynch, who had a string of previous convictions going back to when he was just 14. In the first of these he shot an Asian man in the leg with a ball bearing gun and racially abused him.
