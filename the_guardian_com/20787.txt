In the latest trial involving the mother of Baby P and her boyfriend, the victim became the youngest child to give evidence at the Old Bailey.In a video interview with police last year, when she was three, she said the man had hurt her.The 30-minute tape was shown to the jury as her evidence before she was cross-examined by defence lawyers.In the tape, the bubbly youngster giggled as she wriggled on and off a blue armchair in a special police interview suite.In a lively voice, she answered questions put to her by a specially-trained female police officer.After watching the interview on a screen in a side room at the court, the girl appeared before the court on a videolink screen.She played with two teddy bears and a toy hedgehog as she said she knew what lies were, and the difference between fibs and the truth. Although older and changed in her appearance, the girl retained the same sunny smile.But it soon fell away when she was questioned. She fell silent and refused to answer questions about why she initially told police the man had not touched her.Asked if she had been fibbing, the girl appeared traumatised and at one point rubbed her eyes.After an overnight break, she was back to her old self and told Sally O'Neill QC, prosecuting, that what she said in the taped interview was the truth.Defence barristers argued that the girl's evidence was not reliable and the allegation could have been suggested to her by another child.Medical evidence was inconclusive but a test showed a finding that "could be supportive" of the allegation.The rape claim was made to an adult a few months after it was alleged to have happened, the court heard.The girl was seen by a police officer the following month but shook her head when asked if the man had molested her.The allegation re-emerged last year when the girl was seen by a psychiatrist. She repeated the claim to another doctor.O'Neill told the jury that the girl made "spontaneous" statements not influenced by leading questions.She said: "It is unusual for a child of this age to give evidence in a criminal trial, but her age is only one feature, albeit an important one, in this case."By using a doll and a toy bear, the girl demonstrated the attack on her to the psychiatrist, said O'Neill.O'Neill said the girl demonstrated the man's position to police, adding it was "like penguins do".Neither defendant gave evidence but they denied the charges.
