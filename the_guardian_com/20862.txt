Police are trying to establish the identity of a murder victim after two limbs believed to be from the same body were found dumped a week apart in rural Hertfordshire.A body part, believed to be a forearm, was found by two walkers in Drovers lane, Wheathampstead, yesterday afternoon. It was left unclothed and uncovered on a grass verge with no apparent attempt made to conceal it. A week earlier a leg was discovered 24 miles away in Cottered, off the A507. Analysis suggests the leg came from an adult white or Asian man between 5ft 6ins and 5ft 10ins tall.The two body parts are currently the subject of separate murder investigations but Detective Chief Inspector Mick Hanlon said he "fully anticipated" to merge them into a single inquiry tomorrow after the results of a DNA comparison between the arm and leg had been released."It [the forearm] is highly likely to be linked to the leg discovered in Cottered last Sunday but we will not have definitive confirmation until more tests have been carried out," said Hanlon."This is a very unusual incident and we are working meticulously to establish who the body parts belong to and how they came to be in Cottered and Wheathampstead."A postmortem on the arm was due to be conducted today .The leg was found in a green holdall by a local resident. A full DNA profile obtained from it did not show up a match on the national database, indicating that the man did not have a criminal record.He had a skin condition that caused discolouration in the pigmentation of the skin around the ankle, police said. There was a further skin condition on the lower leg causing the skin to scale.Police believe that the holdall was dumped at the scene on either 21 March or early on the day it was discovered.Hanlon said officers were following a number of lines of inquiry but trawling through tens of thousands of records of missing people was a time-consuming process. He appealed for anyone who had a friend, relative or acquaintance missing who might match the description issued to come forward.Police want to hear from anyone who used Drovers Lane from 10pm on Friday – or who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the surrounding area – and anyone who was in the area where the leg was discovered on the weekend of 21 and 22 March.
