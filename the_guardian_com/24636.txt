Stephen Lee, the disgraced snooker player, has been fined for the fraudulent sale of his cue. The Trowbridge-based former player agreed on Facebook to sell his John Parris Ultimate for £1,600 to Marco Fai Pak Shek, a fan in Hong Kong.But despite Shek paying the money into the bank account of Lee’s wife, the cue never arrived – and the 39-year-old Lee continued to use it.Lee said he had always meant to send the cue but was distracted after becoming “embroiled in a number of difficulties” relating to his professional life, Swindon magistrates court heard.This month Lee was ordered to pay £125,000 in costs after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-year ban from snooker for match-fixing. The five-time ranking tournament winner and former world No5 was handed the ban after a 2013 tribunal found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008-09.Magistrates ordered Lee to pay £1,815 after he entered a guilty plea to the charge of fraud by false representation between 1 July 2013 and 21 January this year.John Fryer, chairman of the bench, told Lee the fine would be deducted from the £133 he receives in benefits each fortnight. “In arriving at our sentence at this matter we have taken into account a number of things – your previous good character, you have not appeared before the courts before, and we have given you credit for your early guilty plea,” Fryer said. “We also note that you are on benefits and your income is significantly lower.”Lee was fined £110 for the offence and told to pay Shek £1,600 in compensation, along with £85 prosecution costs and a £20 victim surcharge.When asked if he could pay the £1,815 fine immediately, Lee replied: “I can’t pay that today, no.”Fryer made a collection order for the amount, telling Lee: “If the payments stop, someone will be knocking on your door.”
