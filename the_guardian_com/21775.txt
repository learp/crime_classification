Mr Sheehan, of Belmont Street, Camden, had close-cropped dark hair and wore white jogging bottoms with a white tracksuit top for the brief court appearance. He spoke in a soft high-pitched voice only to confirm his identity, age and address. No application for bail was made and Mr Sheehan was remanded in custody to reappear before the Old Bailey on March 23. Mr Messitt, who lived in Haverstock Hill, north London, died of severe head injuries sustained during the attack. In a statement yesterday his family described him as a "peaceful and polite pensioner" who enjoyed long walks, reading and football.
