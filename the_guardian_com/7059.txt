A father found dead alongside two children yesterday is believed to have smothered them before killing himself.The man, named as David Cass, 32, was looking after his two young daughters for the weekend for the first time since he had separated from their mother, a friend said today.The bodies were found at Paynes Road Car Sales in Southampton just before 7pm yesterday.The owner of the garage, John Mayhew, said police had told him Cass smothered the children in a caravan on the site, where he sometimes lived, and then hanged himself in the the garage.Hampshire police have not yet named the victims and said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the three deaths.Cass worked at the garage for four years but quit on Friday, according to his direct boss, John Martin. He had been living in a caravan at the garage.Martin said Cass had seemed depressed recently because of relationship problems with his girlfriend."He said to me he was going away and he had a plan. I said: 'Don't do anything stupid'," said Martin.A friend of Cass, Paul Timberlake, described him as a "nice bloke. He'd do anything for anyone and was very helpful and he absolutely loved his children."I've spoken to my daughter who is friends with the mother and she told me that this was the first weekend he'd been allowed to have them [the children] since the split. Everyone is stunned and no one can believe it."Mayhew said he believed Cass phoned his estranged girlfriend and other family members in the minutes before the deaths.According to reports, the girls' mother dialled 999 after receiving the call and a police search was launched.Postmortem examinations are scheduled for today.
