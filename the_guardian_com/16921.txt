BBC Radio 4 presenter Nigel Wrench was today cleared of raping a man he met at a new year party.Wrench, 47, a presenter on the PM programme, was accused of forcing the younger man to perform a sex act on him in January last year. An Old Bailey jury took two and a half hours to clear the presenter, who bowed his head and sighed as the verdict was delivered. Wrench admitted snorting cocaine with the man at a party in Kennington, south London, before inviting him home and showing him his art collection. The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the jury he blacked out after taking a gulp of champagne Wrench had given him. He claimed he woke later that day to find himself being punched about the head and forced to perform a sex act. But Wrench said the pair had engaged in "boisterous horseplay" and consensual sex, which the other man seemed to enjoy. Sarah Forshaw, defending Wrench, told jurors they may have found some of what they heard "thoroughly unpleasant" and "deeply unattractive" but urged them to put aside any feelings of "repugnance" about the case.Wrench, of north London, was formally cleared earlier in the trial of two other charges of sexual assault and of administering temazepam with the intention of "stupefying or overpowering" the man in order to have sex with him.Judge Michael Shorrock ruled there was insufficient evidence for convictions.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
