Two cousins were jailed for life yesterday for the murder of a 21-year-old Muslim bride who was stabbed to death in a wedding day honour killing.Rafaqat Hussain and Tafarak Hussain, who were angry that their cousin, Sahjda Bibi, was marrying a divorcee and non-blood relative, showed no emotion as they were led away from the dock at Birmingham crown court. Addressing Rafaqat, who stabbed the bride 22 times with a kitchen knife, Mr Justice Wakerley said: "You took the life of your young cousin on the threshold of her marriage." Turning to Tafarak, the judge added: "You, as the jury has found, gave assistance, knowing of the plan that she must be prevented from marrying her own choice." Rafaqat pleaded guilty to the dressmaker's murder, and Tafarak was convicted by a jury of the same offence last week. Tafarak, 26, of Bordesley Green, Birmingham, and Rafaqat, 38, finalised the details of their plan on the day of the wedding. Miss Bibi was attacked by Rafaqat minutes before the ceremony was due to start. He told police after the killing that it had been accidental, but officers believe he was incensed that she intended to marry a divorcee. Rafaqat, a factory worker, from Camberley, Surrey, was driven away from the murder scene in Alum Rock, Birmingham, by Tafarak. The younger man was convicted of murder by a 10-2 majority last Wednesday. Prior to sentence Stephen Linehan QC, defending Rafaqat, told the court that each defendant bore equal responsibility for the killing.
