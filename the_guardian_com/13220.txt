A two-year-old girl who suffered a suspected heart attack may have died as a result of drinking methadone, police have said.Detectives are investigating whether Sophie Jones died after ingesting the powerful heroin substitute at her home in Blackpool.A 29-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man are in policy custody after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, child neglect and attempting to pervert the course of justice.Police confirmed that toxicology tests would be carried out on the toddler's drinking bottle cup as detective superintendent Paul Withers, of Lancashire Constabulary's major investigation team, said he was extremely concerned that a substance he believed to be methadone had been removed from the house.He said: "As a result of our enquiries I believe that a substance was removed from the address on Jameson Street either shortly before paramedics arrived or after, and I believe that substance to be methadone."I believe it is either being held by someone locally or has been hidden somewhere in the vicinity of Jameson Street. If anybody has any information relating to where it is then I would urge them to come forward."Methadone is green in colour and in this instance may not necessarily be in a clearly identified medicine bottle. If this substance fell into the wrong hands it could have incredibly serious consequences. I would like to reassure people that any information which is passed to us will be treated in confidence."Police officers were called shortly before midnight on Tuesday after reports that a toddler had suffered a heart attack.Sophie was taken by ambulance to Blackpool's Victoria hospital, but paramedics were unable to save her.Flowers, teddy bears and cushions piled up outside the toddler's home on Friday as a postmortem examination and toxicology tests were carried out.Detectives were granted a further 36 hours to question the two people arrested, meaning they must be either charged or released by 2am on Saturday.A 65-year-old woman and a 60-year-old man, who were arrested with the two people currently in custody, have been released with no further action.Last February, a couple were jailed after their two-year-old son died after drinking his mother's methadone.Sally Dent was sentenced to seven and half years and her partner, Shaun Pinfield, to four years after being convicted over the death of Riley Pettipierre.During the trial, the court heard how Dent kept her methadone in a green and yellow child's beaker on a chest of draws in her bedroom so that she could easily reach it during the night.On 13 March 2012 Dent awoke to find Riley's lifeless body next to her in bed, having ingested 10ml-20ml of the drug. Traces of cocaine were also found in his hair.
