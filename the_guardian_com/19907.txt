The attorney general is to reconsider the sentences given to two brothers last week for beating and torturing another pair of boys, her office said today.Lady Scotland will look at the terms given to the brothers, aged 11 and 12, to see whether they were "unduly lenient".The boys, who have not been named, were given indefinite sentences last week with a minimum tariff of five years over the attack in Edlington, near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, last April.If Lady Scotland decides the sentences were too soft, she will refer them to the court of appeal and ask the judges to re-examine the case and consider increasing the terms.The attorney general is required to look at cases if a member of the public asks him or her to do so.A spokesman for the attorney general's office said: "We have called for the papers in the case following a request that the attorney general calls it in."The attackers were given indeterminate sentences for public protection, known as IPP sentences. Although the minimum they will serve is five years, they cannot be released until the authorities say they no longer pose a threat to society.During sentencing at Sheffield crown court last week, details emerged of how the brothers targeted their victims, apparently at random, as they rode their BMX bikes in Edlington on a Saturday morning.They led the victims, then nine and 11, to waste ground and subjected them to a 90-minute ordeal during which they were robbed, beaten, stamped on, struck with bricks and other objects, choked and burned. They also endured a series of humiliations, many of them sexual. The older boy almost died from his injuries.Sheffield crown court heard the brothers had been placed with foster parents in Edlington less than three weeks before the attacks.They had grown up in Doncaster with a violent, chaotic family life described by one defence barrister as "toxic".The judge acknowledged the impact of such an upbringing but told the boys they appeared obsessed with controlling others "by domination, degradation and inflicting pain for the purpose of [your] own emotional pleasure". They also showed a "chilling detachment" and lack of remorse, he said.
