Britain's most senior police officer yesterday told a memorial ceremony for murdered police officer Yvonne Fletcher that he had good reason to know who shot her outside the Libyan embassy 20 years ago.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens, said detectives who travelled to Libya last week were 'pretty optimistic' about bringing her killer to justice.The memorial was attended by Baroness Thatcher, who was Prime Minister when the shooting happened during a demonstration outside the Libyan embassy in St James's Square in central London Fletcher's death led to diplomatic ties being severed with Libya. The shots were fired from inside the Libyan embassy, but her killer was never brought to justice. It is believed he was smuggled out of Britain under the cover of diplomatic immunity. Stevens said: 'We are getting full co-operation from the Libyan authorities. We have good reason to know who pulled the trigger, as perhaps they do.'
