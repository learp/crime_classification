The judge in the Stephen Lawrence murder trial has referred the Spectator magazine to the attorney general for possible breach of the rules on contempt of court.Mr Justice Treacy said on Thursday afternoon the press could report that he had referred for the attorney general's consideration an article written by Rod Liddle in the current issue of the Spectator.The judge has ordered the jury not to read the magazine.Earlier on Thursday Treacy told the jury: "Two matters have arisen at the start I have had to deal with and I need now to speak to you about these."The first matter I want to raise with you is to ask whether any of you has read this week's Spectator magazine."The jurors all shook their heads. The judge continued: "I'm going to ask you not to do so and I'm afraid it's not just ask, it's tell you not to do so."I told you a couple of days ago about the internet. Well, the same principle applies. There is published in this week's Spectator something which I direct you not to read."So please do not. Please follow the instructions that I give you."I need to make things absolutely certain for myself. If any of you happens to be a subscriber to the Spectator, again, you will not, please, read this week's edition."Two defendants, Gary Dobson, 36, and David Norris 35, deny murder.The trial continues.
