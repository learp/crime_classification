When police officers use force in line with their duties, they have no more legal protection than members of the public. The crucial piece of law is section three of the Criminal Law Act 1967, which reads: "A person may use such force as is reasonable in the prevention of crime."The balance is between the amount of force used and the seriousness of the crime it is supposed to stop. Thus current thinking is that it is lawful for police to shoot dead without warning a man they believe to be a suicide bomber, because the extreme action is justified by the immense harm it is designed to prevent.Another relevant piece of legislation is section 117 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which empowers officers to use reasonable force, if necessary, when exercising their legal powers. According to Crown Prosecution Service guidelines "a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances for the purposes of self-defence; or defence of another; or defence of property; or prevention of crime; or lawful arrest".Training differs for each force, but Met officers receive one day's training and then 12 hours of refresher courses every year in officer safety. They are taught restraint tactics, use of batons, handcuffs and CS spray. They are also taught that any type of punch can be struck to any part of the body as long as an officer can provide a justification. Officers are even allowed a "pre-emptive strike" if they believe it necessary to protect themselves or another person, prevent a crime or make an arrest.
