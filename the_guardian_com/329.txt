Royal protection officers sat on the Queen's throne in comical poses, traded in hardcore pornography and handled firearms when drunk, a court heard yesterday.They also smuggled uninvited and unvetted guests into royal garden parties, arranged cover for each other to sleep while on duty and rested in private areas of Buckingham Palace, Southwark crown court in London was told.The allegations were made by John Cooper, defence counsel for a former royal protection officer, Paul Page, who is accused of defrauding colleagues and friends to fund a life of luxury.The allegations were made during a lengthy cross-examination of Page's former colleague Sergeant Adam McGregor, who claims he was conned out of thousands of pounds."Would you consider it serious if a police officer serving in royalty protection got access to the thrones of the Queen and Prince Philip, sat on them with their feet up, put their thumbs up in a comical pose and had their photographs taken?" Cooper asked."It would be unacceptable, yes, certainly," McGregor replied.Pressed to expand on his answer, he continued: "I may have sat on one of the thrones, but I do not recall doing any comical poses."In other exchanges, Cooper claimed there had been a procedure among armed officers at the palace whereby one officer on duty could sleep while others kept watch.At times, the defence counsel said, officers arrived for duty and were handed firearms when they were drunk."It is our case that there was a culture, Mr McGregor, certainly at the time when Mr Page was working in royalty and you were working in royalty, that police officers would sell steroids," Cooper said."During the time that Paul Page was working in royal protection along with yourself, officers would be selling, at times, hardcore pornography."McGregor said: "Of these things you are saying now I knew nothing at all."The allegations were made on the fourth day of the trial of Page, who joined the royal protection command in 1998, taking unpaid leave in 2004 before leaving the police in January last year.The court has heard that officers protecting the royals lost more than £250,000 to a spread betting venture called the currency club, one of a number of apparently successful sidelines Page allegedly set up to clear mounting debts.The prosecution has claimed much of it was promptly laundered by Page's wife before being gambled away.Page, 37, of Chafford Hundred,Essex, denies five counts – two of fraudulent trading, one of intimidation, one of threatening to take revenge and one of making a threat to kill – against him between 1 January 1 2003 and 30 March 2007.His wife, Laura, 42, denies "being concerned in an arrangement facilitating dealings with criminal property", intimidation and threatening to kill.The trial continues.
