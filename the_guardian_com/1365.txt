Thousands of ex-offenders are to be targeted in a national drive to add their profiles to the police DNA database in an attempt to solve hundreds of crimes.The campaign will focus on 11,993 criminals convicted of serious offences such as murder, manslaughter and rape in the past 40 years, the Association of Chief Police officers said on Thursday.A linked operation in Greater Manchester began last week with police aiming to test 2,000 people convicted of serious offences before 1995.Forces are using powers under the Crime and Security Act 2010, which became law last year. The aim is to gather DNA profiles from criminals who were convicted before the database – which now contains 6.5m profiles – was set up in 1995. Meanwhile, the profiles of 1.1 million individuals who have been arrested but never convicted remain on the database.Codenamed Operation Nutmeg, the sweep aims to ensure all those convicted of serious offences are added to the database. Their profiles will then be checked against unsolved crimes to see if there are any matches. Many of those targeted over the next year will now be in their 70s.Each of the 43 forces in England and Wales has appointed an officer dedicated to the DNA sampling. Acpo said it would carry out an assessment of individuals who had committed serious crimes in the past but were not on the database. It would only take mouth swabs of ex-offenders after a risk assessment was made in each case.In a sample operation in Hampshire, 471 individuals were examined but it was discovered that many had died or were already on the database because they had reoffended since 1995. Of the 167 individuals whose DNA profiles were taken there were no hits against unsolved crimes.The aim, senior officers said, was to ensure police could maximise opportunities to prevent and detect crime as a result of the Crime and Security Act 2010.Acpo's lead on the DNA database, Amanda Cooper, who is director of information and strategy at Thames Valley Police, said: "DNA evidence has proven to be a vital tool for the police which has helped convict thousands of violent and dangerous criminals and exonerated many innocent people."We are seeking to assure the public that police have done all in their duty to ensure that no opportunities have been missed to secure justice for victims of crime."In Greater Manchester officers have been visiting the homes of convicted criminals and inviting them to provide a DNA sample on the spot or visit a police station at a later date. If individuals refuse, officers have the power to make them provide a mouth swab under the 2010 act.The move comes as the profiles of hundreds of thousands of innocent people who have been arrested but not convicted of any crimes remain on the DNA database.Powers to remove the profiles of the innocent are contained in the Protection of Freedoms Act which came onto the statute book in May. But the powers have not yet come into force which means that the police can continue taking DNA samples from all individuals they arrest, including for minor offences.Nick Pickles, director of the civil liberties and privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: "Members of the public will expect the police to be pursing active investigations and in the overwhelming majority of these cases the people having their sample taken will not be suspected of any new crime."Diverting resources away from following up current leads to track down people based on convictions that may be decades old is a questionable strategy at a time when the police are already overstretched."I hope forces will be giving equal focus to addressing the many innocent people on the DNA database who are now entitled to have their profile deleted, as was decided by parliament in May."Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: "It strikes me as bizarre that at a time when the police are facing the most severe budget cuts and job losses in a generation, this is how they choose to spend what little money they have left."Is the public better served by the police going out on the beat and keeping our neighbourhoods safe – or going on a wild goose chase after thousands of people, who may have served their time decades ago, just so an officer can give each of them a DNA swab?"
