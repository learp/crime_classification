A magistrate has been jailed for four and a half years after being convicted of killing his partner's two-year-old daughter.Rashpal Chana, who has served as a JP for almost 20 years, and his ex-girlfriend, Eva Logina, were both convicted of the manslaughter of Kristiana Logina by a jury at Nottingham crown court. The toddler died of septic shock after suffering severe burns in a scalding hot shower at her Birmingham home. Logina was jailed for six years.A month-long trial heard that Chana and Logina failed to summon medical assistance for Kristiana, who died around 12 days after being scalded. Mrs Justice Dobbs said Kristiana's mother had then acted selfishly because she feared her daughter might be taken away if she sought medical help.
