Senior staff at Soham Village College were delighted by Ian Huntley's "level-headedness" when he applied for the job as site manager in autumn 2001.Margaret Bryden, the school's vice-principal, explained that all the candidates had been asked to say what they would do if a pupil became attracted to them, since the previous caretaker had been sacked for an "inappropriate relationship" with a girl aged 13. Mr Huntley, who applied for the post under the name Ian Nixon, said he would report it to the principal or vice-principal, and that while he realised children were involved in the job, he believed his duties lay elsewhere. "I took that to mean 'children are going to be around, but they're not my business'," said Mrs Bryden. "I was delighted. Here we had a very sensible approach, someone who was going to marry, whose fiancee was there... a very level-headed person." He was offered the job pending police checks for child safety purposes, and began work in late November. Under cross-examination, she stated that a pupil had developed a crush on Mr Huntley in July 2002, a month before Holly and Jessica vanished, and that Mr Huntley reported it. But Mrs Bryden also said she had to upbraid Mr Huntley over his messiness and difficulty managing junior caretakers. "Rather than manage, he tried to befriend them at times. He would often get upset, even have tears in his eyes." He would return to discuss issues, often with Maxine Carr, who would wait by the office "as if to make sure he had resolved it".
