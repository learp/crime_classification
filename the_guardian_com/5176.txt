The girlfriend of the Hells Angel shot dead on the M40 last weekend said yesterday that his murder had left "a hole that can never be filled" in the lives of those who knew him. Her statement came as detectives investigating the killing of Gerard Tobin called on motorcyclists to come forward with information that might lead them to the killer.Rebecca Smith, 25, from Mottingham, south London, issued a statement yesterday as speculation mounted over the motive for the shooting."I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and love to all that have supported me and our club at this awful time," said Ms Smith, who worked with Tobin at a Harley-Davidson dealership close to the home they shared. "Thank you to all for your kind words, respects, sentiments and tributes. A hole that can never be filled has been left in the lives and hearts of so many. Gerry was my life."Tobin, 35, was shot in the back of the head on the way home from the Bulldog Bash motorcycle festival last Sunday. He was riding his Harley-Davidson FX STB 1500 Night Train when a green Rover 620 drew alongside and someone fired two shots from a handgun.Detective superintendent Ken Lawrence, who is leading the inquiry, said yesterday that his officers would be going wherever bikers gathered in a bid to find evidence. "Motorcycle enthusiasts from all over the country attend the Bulldog Bash and we want to target as many potential witnesses as possible," he said. Detectives visited a gathering of motorcyclists at the Waterman pub at Hatton, near Warwick, on Wednesday night.Friends of the dead man say there was no trouble at the Bulldog Bash.
