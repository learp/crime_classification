A record number of police officers will be on duty for next weekend's Notting Hill carnival, police sources confirm.Double the number of officers that policed the royal wedding will be on duty at the west London event, with the Metropolitan police planning 20,000 shifts split over the two days – the highest number of police in the event's 47-year history.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's April wedding day saw 5,000 Metropolitan police officers on duty in London. Carnival organisers said about 500 stewards will be on duty, about 100 more than last year, to ensure there is no repeat of the violence seen during the London riots.With tensions high following the disturbances a fortnight ago, more than a third of those bailed on riot-related charges have been given the condition that they avoid the festival. A 33-year-old father from Clapham, accused of stealing a £19.99 pair of trousers from JD Sports during the chaos, was told by Judge Alan Baldwin that he could face a heavy penalty if he is found in Notting Hill next week.The festivities in Notting Hill are to end early this year – at 7pm each night – but revellers tend to stay out on the streets late into the night after the carnival.Courts have not only been handing out heavy "deterrent" sentences, but rarely giving bail to those awaiting trial, citing a high risk of re-offending. It seems likely that Notting Hill carnival is the date being pinpointed.Claire Dudley, a 26-year-old carnival-goer, said: "I am worried about what's going to happen this year. If all the police are in Notting Hill, then what happens to Brixton, where I live, or other parts of London? Carnival's always incredible, but plenty of people might see it as the perfect opportunity to start some trouble."
