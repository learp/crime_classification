A 17-year-old has been jailed for life after hacking another teenager to death with a Zombie Killer machete.Blaise Lewinson stabbed Stefan Appleton, also 17, in the leg and chest using the 25in (63cm) serrated blade in a north London park last year.Lewinson can be named after the judge, Richard Hone QC, lifted reporting restrictions, saying he should be identified as a deterrent to others and because of the public interest.A jury deliberated for 14 and a half hours to convict Lewinson of manslaughter. He was cleared of murder.Sentencing Lewinson, who appeared at the Old Bailey in London in a white shirt and tie, Hone said he regarded the killing as “very close to murder”.He told him: “You were in the middle of your GCSE examinations, but you preferred to commit serious knife crime in a busy London park filled with young families.”The judge called him a dangerous offender who was fascinated with illegal knives and said he had shown no true remorse.He said: “The use of this utterly ferocious weapon, even with the reduced intent, caused the loss of Stefan Appleton’s young life. He plainly was unarmed and you stabbed him on the ground while he was defending himself.”  Stefan Appleton was killed with a Zombie Killer knife in Islington, north London, last year.

He died in hospital.The court heard that as he rode off, Lewinson shouted “RP”, standing for Red Pitch, a rival to another gang in the area.He fled to Bristol and tried to book a flight to Spain before returning to London to hide. He was arrested a few days later.Teenage victims of knife crime in London this year – their stories About six months before the killing, Lewinson had been caught with a lock knife at a McDonald’s restaurant, which he claimed to have bought at an antiques shop despite having completed a knife crime prevention programme.The court heard Lewinson instigated the moped robbery and, after the killing, arranged for a friend to burn it while he destroyed clothing, got rid of the knife and persuaded a 15-year-old girl to conceal a crash helmet.Hone said he had shown “cunning and careful planning”, lying to police and even making phone calls from prison to associates to make sure the helmet would not be found and get the teenage girl to lie in evidence.Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending, stressed Lewinson had only been 16 at the time. She said he had trouble “verbalising his feelings” and had no significant history of violence, even winning an award while in custody for his commitment to education.But the court heard that while on remand Lewinson fought with other inmates, threw liquid at prison staff and was caught carrying makeshift weapons and a mobile phone.Hone told him: “You have been assessed, correctly in my judgment, as posing a high risk of violent and psychological harm to your peers and a high risk of reoffending.”
