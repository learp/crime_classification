A girl of 14 died on the operating table early yesterday after being hit by shots from a passing car yards from her home.The mother of Danielle Beccan heard gunfire and ran from the house to find her daughter slumped on the ground. Danielle was returning from the annual Goose Fair in Nottingham with a group of friends just after midnight when she was hit by up to six bullets. It was not clear last night whether the shooting had been random or whether the gunmen had been targeting others in the group. Nottingham has been plagued by a spate of gun crime in recent years. A teenage friend of the victim told The Observer: 'One of her friends saw a gun pointing out and shouted for everyone to get down, but she was too slow. She was dropping to the floor when she was hit in the chest and stomach.' A 17-year-old, who did not want to be named, said she was in a nearby street when she heard the gunfire and ran to see what had happened. 'I saw the car, a gold CitroÃ«n with blacked-out windows,' she said. 'I reckoned it was a case of mistaken identity because they were with a group of boys.' Nottinghamshire's assistant chief constable, Sue Fish, said: 'This is a truly wicked and callous crime. We will do everything in our power to find the people responsible.' Although Danielle was not in any kind of gang, tensions between rival groups of youths traditionally run high at this time of year. Superintendent David Colbeck, in charge of policing the area, appealed for anyone with information to come forward. 'She's 14. She's just a child,' he said. 'She's just going home with her friends from a good night out at Goose Fair. 'She's not part of a gang who's been shot and killed. She's innocent, for God's sake. It could have been your daughter, your son. These people are evil and they need to go to prison.'
