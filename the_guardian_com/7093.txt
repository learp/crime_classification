A second jury has failed to return a verdict in the trial of two British National party supporters accused of stockpiling chemical weapons and bomb making equipment to use in what they believed was an imminent civil war.Former BNP local election candidate Robert Cottage, 49, and dentist David Jackson, 62, were accused of buying chemicals over the internet which could have created a powerful bomb. The prosecution said that Cottage also had a digital copy of the Anarchist Cookbook, a bomb-making manual, as well as crossbows and air rifles at his home in Colne, Lancashire.Cottage and Mr Jackson, of Nelson, Lancashire, denied conspiring to cause explosions intended to endanger life. Yesterday the jurors at Manchester crown court said they were unable to reach a verdict on the charge after deliberating for more than a day and a half. Prosecutors indicated that they would not seek a further retrial.Cottage admitted a separate charge of possessing explosives that could "reasonably" be suspected to be for an unlawful purpose before the trial started. He will be sentenced on July 31. Mr Jackson denied the possession charge. Cottage told the jury he planned to use the chemicals to clean his false teeth, unblock his drains, and protect himself against bird flu. Mr Jackson, who was not a BNP member, claimed he asked Cottage to buy him chemicals online because he wanted to pursue chemistry as a hobby and was too computer-illiterate to order them himself.
