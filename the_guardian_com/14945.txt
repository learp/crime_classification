A Downing Street political adviser overrode the "forcible" concerns of the NHS's chief statistician, who refused to sanction the publication of controversial figures on knife crime and hospital admissions, MPs were told today.Sir Michael Scholar, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, disclosed today that the "premature, irregular and selective" publication of the knife crime figures went ahead in December on the authority of a No 10 political adviser despite strongly expressed concerns by NHS and Home Office statisticians backed up by Department of Health officials.The head of Whitehall's statistics watchdog indicated that there had been clear political interference in the publication of official statistics in this case, which already has had a considerable impact across Whitehall."If you are going to have trust in official statistics you cannot have statisticians being 'leaned on' by politicians, by ministers, by special advisers or by policy civil servants working for them. They have to be allowed to produce the numbers in an impartial way," Scholar told the Commons public administration select committee today.As head of the statistics watchdog, Scholar has been invited by the cabinet secretary to address a special meeting of all of Whitehall's most senior civil servants – the permanent secretaries – next Wednesday to underline the need to produce official statistics free from political interference.Scholar and the official statistician, Karen Dunnell, confirmed to MPs that the publication of the figures went ahead despite direct representations from a special adviser at the Department of Health, and that the Downing Street political adviser took the decision without consulting any ministers.Tony Wright, the Labour chairman of the committee, commented that it seemed "rather incredible" to "an innocent like me that this could happen".The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, had to apologise to the Commons about the publication of the Home Office knife-crime "fact sheet" after Scholar and Dunnell protested to Downing Street that they did not conform to the code of practice on the production of official statistics that came into force in 2000 and specifically bans political influence.The controversial figures were based on NHS management information and showed there had been a 27% drop in hospital admissions from those with knife wounds in nine police force areas targeted to tackle knife crime."The hospital admissions element had been published against the advice of the chief statistician of the NHS information centre in Leeds. He had expressed forcibly his concerns about these figures but his concerns were overriden by No 10 Downing Street. I have seen evidence that was the case. That was a clear breach of the code of practice," Scholar told the MPs.A letter from the cabinet secretary, Gus O'Donnell, published by the public administration committee also says that "although the head of statistics profession from the NHS information centre, supported by Department of Health officials, refused to sanction the publication of hospital admissions figures, the Home Office used the figure in the fact sheet following consultation with a special advisor in No 10 in the belief that the concerns of NHS statisticians had been addressed."The cabinet secretary added that by the time Dunnell had intervened to protest, the knife-crime fact sheet had already been released.Kevin Brennan, the junior Cabinet Office minister, told the MPs that he did not know the name of the Downing Street political adviser involved in the episode but promised to write to the committee.Dunnell said that the Office of National Statistics was drawing up guidelines on the publication of management information as official statistics.
