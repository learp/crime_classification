A 15-year-old boy was today arrested and charged in connection with the murder of schoolgirl Jodi Jones.Jodi, 14, was found dead off a secluded pathway near her home in Dalkeith, in East Lothian, Scotland, on June 30 last year, the day she went missing.The 15-year-old boy is expected to appear at Edinburgh sheriff court tomorrow, charged with her murder. The boy's mother has also been detained, a spokesman for Lothian and Borders police said.Forensic teams today examined a house in Dalkeith. A uniformed officer stood at the entrance to the detached property, which had all its curtains closed, while a team of forensic officers worked there throughout the morning.Paying tribute to Jodi, her family described her as a "typical teenager" who liked grunge music and enjoyed bands such as Nirvana and Metallica.Her aunt, Agnes Petkevicius, said after Jodi's death: "She was a typical teenager - into clothes and music of her liking. Jodi always considered herself and others as individuals, and did not like being labelled."It's also typical in the fact that she borrowed her sister's clothes, was untidy and, at times, liked to tease her brother, sister and other members of the family."Mourners laid flowers near the place where Jodi - who was nicknamed "Toad" - was found, and at the gates of her school, St David's Roman Catholic secondary. Her funeral was held at Gorebridge parish church in September last year, when hundreds paid their respects to a teenager described as being "sunshine to a lot of people".Her mother Judy, older brother Joseph and sister Janine, and two detectives who attended the service, all wore a tiny sunflower emblem as a mark of respect. It was Jodi's favourite flower.A death notice in the local paper asked friends not to send flowers, but to plant a sunflower in her memory.She was buried at Gorebridge cemetery alongside her father, Jimmy, who was 39 when he died five years before his daughter.
