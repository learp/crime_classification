Economic crimes such as fraud and corruption are costing British business £40bn a year and the problem is getting worse, according to a report out today. The amount, equivalent to about 4% of Britain's gross domestic product, could be just the tip of the iceberg, according to consultancy RSM Robson Rhodes, which carried out a survey of 100 companies in conjunction with the Home Office and Fraud Advisory Panel.The study shows embezzlement, fraud, money laundering and corruption cost companies £32bn last year, as they spent a combined £8bn trying to tackle the problem.FTSE 100 companies, a quarter of which were interviewed for the survey, suffered losses of about £500m and all listed companies lost £3bn.In spite of their efforts, 60% of firms expect the problem to get worse over the next three years.Bill Cleghorn, forensic partner at RSM Robson Rhodes, said: "The £40bn cost to business is staggering and could be just the tip of the iceberg. Economic crime is not just a concern for businesses - ultimately it costs us all."The survey shows that, although 93% of businesses agree that the board has ultimate responsibility, only 57% of UK directors believe they have an understanding of the financial cost of economic crime.However, four-fifths of companies are waking up to the potential impact of the problem on their share price and brand image."Businesses need to take the risks posed more seriously," said Mr Cleghorn. "Whilst there is no set time for how long boards should spend tackling the issue, they need to research the level of economic crime in their industry sector. They then need to put in place effective systems and controls to prevent it, identify material losses and take action to recover those losses." Kroll, the global risk consulting company bought in July by Marsh & McLennan, has appointed a Briton, Simon Freakley, as chief executive officer and president.
