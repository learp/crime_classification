A man may be barred from his own home next week because of the noisy rows neighbours claim he has with his wife.Manchester city council will apply to magistrates on Tuesday for an interim antisocial behaviour order to ban Mike McNulty, 38, from the house he shares in Moston, Manchester, with five of his six children and his wife Mandi. The council, which has secured more than 400 Asbos in four years, says Mr McNulty, who is unemployed, and his wife had noisy arguments on 10 days between April and July. Neighbours say the rows have spilled into the street."The problems were between ourselves and did not affect other people," Mr McNulty said. "They were rows between man and wife. Because someone has complained, I am going to get an Asbo. It's just stupid." The couple have been together seven years and married last October. "The rows involved me swearing at him and telling him where to go," said Mrs McNulty, 36, who is also unemployed. "We've had a few problems, but I don't think we've had a row since we got married." The council's executive member for housing, Eddy Newman, said: "Manchester city council will continue to vigorously oppose antisocial behaviour in our city."
