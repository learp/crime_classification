Relatives of six men murdered by loyalists in Northern Ireland in 1994 have dismissed a report rejecting security force collusion in the killings.Northern Ireland's police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, said there was insufficient evidence of collusion between the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the police in the Loughinisland pub shootings.At an emotional press conference in Belfast, family members of the dead and injured disputed the report's findings."We feel that anyone who looks at the overwhelming evidence in this case with an open heart could come to no other conclusion than that there was collusion in the murder of our loved ones," said Moira Casement, whose 87-year-old uncle Barney Greene was killed in the attack at Height's Bar in rural Co Down.It was packed with customers watching the Republic of Ireland play Italy in a World Cup match when two members of the UVF walked in and fired indiscriminately, killing six Catholics and wounding five others.Adrian Rogan, 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Daniel McCreanor, 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39, were also shot dead.Relatives of the victims believe the police investigation was impeded by a desire to protect informants . They made a formal complaint to the Police Ombudsman in 2006.The report said there was no evidence of collusion between police and the UVF gang in two areas of his investigation. There was also insufficient evidence of collusion surrounding the getaway car. But the ombudsman criticised other elements of the investigation, saying it lacked diligence, focus and leadership.Casement added: "Britain's most senior policeman, Sir John Stevens, defined collusion as the wilful failure of police or army to keep records. He said collusion also included the absence of accountability as well as the withholding of intelligence and evidence."Mr Hutchinson found clear evidence of the wilful failure to keep records and found overwhelming evidence of the absence of accountability. We even have the senior investigating officer refusing to even speak to ombudsman investigators."Since 1994 16 people have been arrested in connection with the attack but no one has been convicted.
