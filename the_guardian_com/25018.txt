Two British girls have been jailed for a year by a Ghanaian court for smuggling drugs but could be freed in April.Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya, both 16 and from north London, were found guilty at a hearing in a closed juvenile court last month and sentenced today.They were arrested in July at Accra's Kotoka airport carrying six kilograms (13lb) of cocaine in two laptop computer bags.They had faced the possibility of three years' jail. Under Ghanaian law individuals sentenced to a year can be freed after nine months.Taking into time already served, the girls, who have been in custody since July, could be released in early April, lawyers said.Francis Opoku-Amoah, spokesman for the Ghana narcotics board, said: "The girls get a second chance not to repeat what they did. The message is clear to everybody. Once you do it and get caught you will pay for it."He said they would serve their time at a juvenile detention centre in the capital, Accra.There is no transfer agreement between Ghana and the UK and a British high commission spokesman said the girls would not serve their time in England. "The crime was committed here, the trial was held here and that's it," said Gary Nicholls.The pair said they did not know that £300,000 worth of cocaine was hidden in their luggage.Ghana's Narcotics Control Board said they were offered £3,000 each to carry the bags to Britain, and their accommodation, food and plane tickets were paid for.West Africa is a major transit point for drugs heading to Europe. Cocaine, mostly from Colombia, is taken on small planes and dropped on to islands off the little-policed Atlantic coast, then distributed to couriers.British and Ghanaian officials began collaborating last year after a surge in drug-related arrests at London airports linked to west African flights.
