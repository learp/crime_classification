Six men have been sent to prison for a total of nearly 48 years for their part in an elaborate carousel fraud that robbed the taxpayer of £85m.The sentencing at Liverpool crown court came after one of the biggest ever investigations by Revenue & Customs into a VAT fraud that involved nearly 100 mobile phone traders.Raymond Cox from Staffordshire; Brett Issitt and Michael McNeill from Lancashire; Paul Sweeney, who lived in Amsterdam; Peter Glover of Warwickshire, and Colin Jones from Cheshire were jailed for between five and 12 and a half years."This was a conspiracy which overall cost the taxpayer a colossal sum of money," said Judge Swift as he handed down the sentences. "There was nothing genuinely commercial about any of it. It was fraud on a vast scale."The men were directors of companies that imported mobile phones free of VAT, sold them on and disappeared without paying the VAT. The fraud went on for several years, with phones repeatedly imported and exported and the VAT stolen each time.Revenue & Customs investigators began tracking the trades across Britain, Germany, Ireland, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands in 2000. The court heard how the number of trades expanded so rapidly that those involved had trouble following what they were doing.Carousel fraud has cost EU governments billions of pounds, but it subsided in the UK as Revenue & Customs took on more investigators and after the Dutch closed a bank in Curaçao last year that many of the fraudsters were using to launder their stolen money."The sentence sends out a clear message to others who may contemplate such criminal activity," said Euan Stewart, Revenue & Customs' director of operations, criminal investigations.Revenue & Customs has begun confiscation proceedings to recover some of the stolen monies from the guilty men.
