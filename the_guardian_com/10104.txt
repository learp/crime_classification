A teenager has admitted stabbing a Saudi student and a man to death in attacks that sparked fears that a killer was preying randomly on people in Colchester.The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stabbed James Attfield, 33, more than 100 times inMarch 2014 before attacking Nahid Almanea, 31, three months later in the Essex town.He pleaded guilty during a hearing at the Old Bailey to two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, but denies two counts of murder.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is now considering the pleas and whether or not it intends to pursue murder charges.The teenager, from Colchester, was arrested after allegedly being found with a knife on 26 May last year in the same area that Almanea was killed.The University of Essex student, who was living in the town, was wearing a dark navy-blue abaya, or full-length robe, when she was attacked on the morning of 17 June 2014. She was stabbed 16 times as she walked along a path towards the university.Attfield, who had a brain injury after being hit by a car four years previously, was found fighting for his life in the town’s Castle park three months before the attack on Almanea. The Colchester man, also known as Jim, died later in hospital.Following the stabbings, Essex police said there were striking similarities between the killings but nothing to link the victims. At the height of their investigation, more than 100 detectives, uniformed officers, community support officers and civilian staff were involved. A number of people were also arrested.DCI Morgan Cronin of the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate said after the hearing: “We hope that today’s guilty plea will provide the families of James Attfield and Nahid Almanea with some comfort by finally establishing who carried out their atrocious killings.“The brutal manner in which they both died sent shockwaves through the community in Colchester and far beyond.“Detectives worked tirelessly to piece together the evidence of how they died and to establish whether there was any connection between their deaths. Sadly we now know that one person, a 17-year-old boy, was indeed responsible.”At Friday’s hearing, a tearful couple believed to be the teenager’s parents sat in the well of the court and blew him a kiss as he sat flanked by officers in the dock.Wearing a grey suit, leather jacket and black rimmed spectacles, he spoke only to enter his pleas and confirm his name. He was remanded in custody.A murder trial has already been fixed to start on 11 April, at a venue to be decided.
