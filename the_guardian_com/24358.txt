Police in North Yorkshire have been granted more time to question the husband of a village postmistress who was bludgeoned to death during an apparent armed raid.Robin Garbutt, 44, was arrested early on Wednesday morning by detectives investigating the murder of his wife Diana Garbutt, 40, over apparent inconsistencies in his account. Three weeks ago a tearful Garbutt told detectives that a masked gunman had burst into the couple's store and post office in Melsonby, near Richmond, in North Yorkshire, shouting: "We've got your wife."The robber apparently escaped with a large amount of cash in a holdall, but Robin Garbutt was uninjured.Garbutt told police he was forced to hand over "a substantial amount" of money before running upstairs to find his wife, Diana, dead in their living quarters on 23 March. A postmortem revealed she had suffered multiple head injuries.Earlier this month, Garbutt said: "Di was my life and I am lost without her."There is a 36-hour time limit on the length of time before officers must release a suspect on bail, charge them or apply to magistrates for more time. Yesterday, detectives were successful in their application for more time to question him.The murder of Diana Garbutt left close-knit Melsonby in shock. Neighbours and friends told how the couple arrived seven years ago, soon after their wedding, to run the store.Earlier Detective Superintendent Lewis Raw, the senior investigating officer, said: "The tragic death of Diana Garbutt three weeks ago has had a significant impact on people living in Melsonby and Richmondshire as a whole. It has also captured the concern and sympathy of the wider community due to the high level of media coverage of this case. I would again like to offer my sincere gratitude for the overwhelming support and understanding local people have given the police throughout this very complex investigation."
