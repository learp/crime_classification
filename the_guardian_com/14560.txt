The murders of a pregnant woman and her toddler son by her mentally ill former partner could not have been reasonably predicted, a serious case review has found, despite criticism from an inquest jury and the woman's boyfriend over the "failures" of authorities.Rachael Slack, 38, and her 23-month-old son, Auden, were found with multiple stab wounds at their home in the village of Holbrook, Derbyshire, on 2 June 2010.

He was also found dead at the house, having turned the knife on himself.A jury at an inquest into their deaths last year was critical of police for their failing to impress upon Slack – after she contacted officers regarding Cairns' increasingly worrying behaviour – that she was at high risk.Slack's new partner, Robert Barlow, said she could have been alive today had police intervened. But a serious case review by Derby Safeguarding Children Board (DSCB) found that the tragedy could not have been foreseen with information known at the time.In the months leading up to the deaths, Cairns, who had a history of mental illness dating back to a 1999 suicide attempt, had become increasingly depressed and his behaviour more concerning for family. Slack had continued to check on him even after their relationship broke down in late 2008.The DSCB report considered a number of factors, including threats made by Cairns to kill Slack on 27 May 2010, after she told him she was in a new relationship and expecting a baby.Cairns, a former golf tutor, made the threats hours after being detained by police under the Mental Health Act when Slack had driven him to the police station, as he had refused to get out of her car and she became worried about his behaviour.He was assessed by mental health workers and released after he was found to have no major mental illness.On 27 May he was again arrested after making the threats to kill Slack but released on police bail the next day after denying the accusations.The serious case review report said that, "taken at face value", the threats Cairns made were believed to have been carried out on 2 June.It said: "The question is therefore whether the mother's report, in the context of other information available to professionals, provided a basis on which the eventual outcome could have been reasonably predicted. There are a number of factors which suggest that this would not be the case."The report said Derbyshire constabulary received about 150-160 reports of threats to kill each year; their analysis identified this case as the "only one of those reports over at least [three years] which [was] followed by enactment of the threat".Officers had no contact with Slack or Cairns about his mental health issues which "would have effectively discriminated this case from any of the other 'threats to kill' reports".The police were also not made aware of Cairns' behaviour after his release from custody, including the fact that he had been hanging around outside Slack's house after his release.In addition, the report found mental health professionals did not know about the events of 27 May or those afterwards. "Only an extremely small number of individuals who share the characteristics of depressive mental illness and involvement with mental health professionals go on to commit such acts," the report said.The report said: "On this basis the review concluded that no individual or agency could have reasonably predicted that [Cairns] would kill [Auden] and [Ms Slack], thereafter taking his own life, as is believed to have occurred on the morning of 2 June 2010."Although the killings were not predictable, the report said, the risk assessment carried out after Slack contacted police indicated that Cairns posed a serious risk to her, and although she was advised by officers not to have any contact with him, she was not convinced of the risk.But the report said authorities could have employed better practice. In a series of recommendations, it called for better sharing of information on mental health clients, more importance given to children in such cases, and a review of referrals and intervention thresholds in cases of domestic violence.Sandra Horley, CEO of the domestic violence charity Refuge, said the serious case review flew in the face of the inquest's findings last year.She said: "I am concerned the review describes incidents of murder/suicide involving a family with a child as incredibly rare."The truth is that domestic homicide is alarmingly common: every week two women are killed by current or former partners in England and Wales."Analysis of serious case reviews has also found that domestic violence was a factor in the lives of 63% children who were seriously harmed or killed between 2009-2011."All too often victims of domestic violence do not get the support and protection they deserve."In a statement Christine Cassell, chair of the DSCB, said though the report found that incidents of murder or suicide involving a family and child were incredibly rare "they equate to less than one incident every 15 years in a county like Derbyshire – but that is one too many".The DSCB had reviewed policies for domestic violence cases involving children and had created a new multi-agency system for referrals and interventions.Cassell said: "We will continue to monitor how recommendations from serious case reviews are put in place to make sure they are really making a difference to professional practice."Following last year's inquest, the Derby and South Derbyshire district coroner, Robert Hunter, wrote to the chief constable outlining concerns he had about sharing and recording information.In a statement Karl Smethem, an assistant chief constable, welcomed the findings of the serious case review and said that Derbyshire police systems had been changed in 2011. Referrals from social care were no longer made by fax but by electronically, and domestic abuse, stalking and harassment risk assessment forms, known as Dash forms, now had extra questions relating to children. All officers were now trained on Dash forms to remind them of their obligations.He said: "Domestic violence is a top priority for the force and our response to it is constantly evolving. One in every 10 crimes reported to Derbyshire constabulary is linked to domestic violence. Each [such] victim is given an information pack. If they are believed to be at a high risk they are given a plan and asked to sign a form to show they understand the dangers they may face."Derbyshire NHS stated that the serious case review had concluded that no individual or agency could have reasonably predicted the tragic events concerning the Slack case, but it did "identify better practice that could have been applied by agencies and professionals".The NHS added: "The report highlights the importance of all agencies maintaining a focus on the child when providing care to an adult who has regular contact with children."The publication of this serious case review follows the inquest, which concluded that no health issue contributed to the death of Auden."Nevertheless, we would like to assure all of our patients that since this tragic and rare incident occurred we have fully embraced the lessons learned and taken action based on the recommendations that were made in the review."
