An 11-year-old boy who stabbed his baby nephew because the child's screaming was distracting him from a computer game was sentenced to six months' detention yesterday.The schoolboy from North Lincolnshire, who cannot be named for legal reasons, grabbed a serrated kitchen knife in a fury and plunged it into the seven-month-old's stomach, almost killing him.He told Hull crown court that he had felt "like a volcano" after his character on the Disney game The Incredibles kept dying while the baby was constantly yelling. He was also being bullied at school at the time of the attack last December and had problems at home.The boy hid the knife, which he had used earlier to try to mend a toy. His nephew was taken to hospital in Grimsby with life-threatening injuries but made a full recovery after emergency surgery.The 11-year-old told police that he had felt frustrated but had never intended to harm his nephew and did not know what would happen when he stuck the blade half an inch into the child's stomach.He said: "I stabbed him and [the knife] sort of broke - the blade came out of the wooden bit." When the baby's eyes went "dead wide like an owl," he realised he was hurting it and pulled out the blade after about three seconds.Passing sentence, Mr Justice Silber told the court that the boy's family and school life had been "in a state of chaos". He described the stabbing as "totally and utterly out of character" and told the boy: "Until this instance, you were totally devoted [to the baby] and had always treated him with a great deal of commendable kindness."But stabbing was a very serious offence in any circumstances, and all the more so when the victim was a defenceless baby, the court heard.The boy had earlier been laughing with his family during legal proceedings but looked stunned when the custodial sentence was given. His mother ran out of court during sentencing. Defence lawyers had argued that detention was likely to do further psychological damage.The boy will serve three months in secure accommodation and then be released, with the second half of the sentence suspended. He was cleared of attempted murder at a previous hearing but convicted of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
