The wife of serial killer Harold Shipman may have been present when one of his patients died, the public inquiry into his crimes was told yesterday.Primrose Shipman, 52, has now been interviewed for the first time by lawyers acting for the inquiry, but she has refused to cooperate. Yesterday, Caroline Swift QC described how Mrs Shipman was present at the death of Irene Chapman, 74, at her home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in March 1998. Mrs Chapman's neighbour Ethel Hampshire saw Shipman arrive and leave a short time afterwards. "She says that Shipman returned an hour or more later with a woman whom she did not then recognise, but now knows to be his wife," said Ms Swift. Shipman phoned Mrs Chapman's niece, Celia Saxton, and told her he had found her collapsed on the settee. "He had been present when she had taken her last gasps," said Ms Swift. "Shipman confirmed that Mrs Chapman was now dead." Mrs Saxton's husband was greeted at the house by Mrs Shipman who said Mrs Chapman had died of a heart attack. She said Shipman had had to make another house call, but that she had remained because he was not allowed to leave a body alone, said Ms Swift. Mrs Shipman, who has never been interviewed by police, has refused to answer questions about the pensioner's death.
