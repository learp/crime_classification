A 34-year-old man was arrested after a man and a woman were stabbed to death in a house in south London today. The man was arrested after police were called to a disturbance in Croydon, just before 12.20am. The bodies of the couple, believed to be aged in their 50s or 60s, were discovered after police and ambulance personnel were called to the maisonette. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said they had launched a double murder inquiry. A postmortem is due to be carried out and next-of-kin informed.
