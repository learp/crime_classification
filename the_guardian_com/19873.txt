An Old Bailey bomber and former IRA hunger striker has pleaded guilty to providing a mobile phone to republican dissidents behind the murder of two soldiers in 2009.Marian Price-McGlinchey admitted providing property to aid terrorism at Belfast crown court on Thursday.The charge relates to the double murder outside the Massereene army barracks in Antrim Town in March 2009. Army sappers Mark Quinsey and Patrick Azimkar were shot dead as they waited to collect pizzas at the gates of the base.Price-McGlinchey was accused of buying a mobile phone that was used in several calls claiming responsibility for the Real IRA attack. She was also accused of aiding and abetting the addressing of a meeting to encourage support for terrorism during a separate incident at a dissident republican Easter Rising rally in Derry.The 56-year-old became a prominent Irish republican figure after she and her sister Dolours were arrested at Heathrow hours after they were involved in placing bombs outside the Old Bailey in 1973. Both sisters went on hunger strike in their battle to be transferred from an English prison to one in Northern Ireland, and they were subjected to force-feeding.In the 1990s Price-McGlinchey became a bitter critic of former comrades in Sinn Féin, including her fellow IRA Old Bailey bomber Gerry Kelly. She claimed that Sinn Féin's peace strategy was a sellout of traditional republican goals. She and her sister became opponents of Sinn Féin and in particular its president, Gerry Adams.In an interview before her death this year, Dolours Price revealed that she had driven one of the Disappeared – Jean McConville – over the border to her death and secret burial. Price claimed that the IRA commander who ordered her to do so was Adams, a charge he has always denied.
