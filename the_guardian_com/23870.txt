As another week in late modernity's troubled, deregulated global market begins anew, there will be many who will be hoping that governments here and in the US will continue to prop up this market, and an even greater number who will be wondering how all of this affects them. So too, there will no doubt be policy advisors – as was revealed most recently by a leaked Home Office document – trying to work out how this will affect law and order, as if to imply that rising crime inextricably follows an economic downturn.Some criminologists – most recently Richard Garside – have tried to explain how difficult it is to link the underlying economic situation with crime statistics, and have rightly described how inequality – the widening gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" – is probably the best indicator of how criminogenic a society will be. However, there has been hardly anyone at all who has pointed out the most obvious criminological reality – namely, that we should see the crime explosion of the 1990s and beyond as the direct result of the neoliberal political economy and that the crime that we are currently experiencing stems from deregulation in the service of the needs of business. In short, it is not a question of how crime might rise in these circumstances, but rather how these circumstances have already created the crimes that blight our towns and cities.If ever proof were needed of the impact of the move from traditional forms of capital, community and politics to a globalised economy built on unstable labour markets and consumerism then Steve Hall, Simon Winlow and Craig Ancrum's extraordinary new book – Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture – provides more than enough evidence. The book's basis is a long-term, ethnographic study of a range of contacts in the north-east of England.Taking as their starting point the idea that "smart liberals" have not controlled capitalism's "nasty side", they show how an expansion of consumption through credit has created a culture obsessed with material goods, and where competitive individualism – the "me project" – has emptied old, solid, working-class communities of value and meaning so that these have become places to escape from, rather than fight for and improve as a collective. In such communities they argue that "crime is an instrument for achieving fantasised positions of social distinction and 'respect' in consumer culture", and where as a result most of their respondents wanted to become "stars" of a criminal underworld as a means of gaining access to the material possessions that conferred status and meaning on their lives.What they have produced is essentially a bleak and sobering picture, but all the better for the honesty and theoretical inventiveness that they bring to their material. So too they offer a corrective for all the current and planned interventions that are propping up a market based on the fictitious world of finance capital, and which has created a "post-needs, desire-driven" society that has obliterated economic and social significance for vast swaths of our population, and left in its wake more crime than we have probably ever experienced in our history.
