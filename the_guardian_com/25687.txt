The police crime map for England and Wales went live at the start of this week. As data journalists we headed straight for the data section of the website. What could this data tell us about crime that we didn't know already?You can see that there are two types of data for each of the regions covered by the crime map: street data and neighbourhood data. The street data is the most usable of the two. Each line of the street data files show a recorded crime with detail of the street on which the crime took place and the type of crime. If we take all the street data from all the regions and sort it by crime committed we get street level detail for each offence. As each line corresponds to an incidence of crime then the number of lines of data for each crime type correspond to the number of incidents of these crimes. As the crime map only publishes data for December 2010, the results for this period are:Violent crime: 57,207 incidentsRobbery: 7,679 incidentsBurglary:37,825 incidentsVehicle crime: 29,283 incidentsAnti-social behaviour: 201,520 incidentsOther crime: 14,4542 incidentsFor just one month that seems like an awful lot of crime. This already provides an answer to the question of what this map shows us that is new: we get street level crime information updated monthly. That will do for a start. The neighbourhood data is more complex and gives some insights into the mamoth task of making the map. The only geographic information available in the neighbourhood data is the crime "neighbourhoods". These neighbourhoods are made up of a range of classification systems. One system used is the Office for National Statistics ward codes another is the police neighbourhood codes, there are others that are yet to be identified. Without a way to turn these codes into something useful geographically the data set is rather limited. Without decoding the police neightbourhoods it is impossible to compare the performance of police in different regions. In summary there are some ups and downs to the data behind the crime map but overall we gain monthly data at street level in a useable format. Tell us what you think and what you would like to see.
