Relatives of the 7 July suicide bombers applied for legal aid for representation at their inquests, officials said today. Ministers rejected the two applications after ruling that they did not meet the criteria for public funding.The government has already agreed that legal aid will be offered to the families of the four bombers' 52 victims and to survivors of the 2005 tube and bus attacks.The inquests are expected to be held in the Royal Courts of Justice in London in October. At a three-day hearing next week the coroner, Lady Justice Hallett, will decide their format, including whether the bombers' inquests should take place with those of their victims.The bombers' families cannot appeal against the decision to refuse them legal aid, the Ministry of Justice said.Relatives of two bombers were represented at a pre-inquest hearing in February, although it is understood there had been no legal aid application at that stage. Lawyer Imran Khan appeared on behalf of Hasina Patel, the widow of the plot mastermind, Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, and the parents of Hasib Hussain, 18. He told the hearing that he recognised the anxiety of victims' relatives about the inquests and said he had "no application to be made for funding".Khan added: "Whatever involvement my clients have in these proceedings, we will try our utmost to ensure that it is done with sensitivity and with deference to the wishes of the bereaved families."Suicide bombers Khan, Hussain, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, and Germaine Lindsay, 19, met at Luton station on the morning of 7 July 2005.They took a train to King's Cross in London, then hugged and separated to carry out their deadly missions.Within three minutes of 8.50am, Tanweer detonated his bomb at Aldgate, Khan set his device off at Edgware Road and Lindsay blew himself up between King's Cross and Russell Square.Hussain detonated his device on a number 30 bus at Tavistock Square at 9.47am. As well as killing themselves and 52 others, the bombers injured more than 700 people.During the inquests there will be an annexe where the public and the media can watch the hearings via videolink. There will be two private rooms with videolinks in separate locations near the court, one for victims' families and the other for relatives of the bombers.
