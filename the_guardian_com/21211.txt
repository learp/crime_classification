The supervision of thousands of low-risk offenders sentenced to unpaid community work should be contracted out to private security companies or not-for-profit agencies, the chief inspector of probation suggested yesterday.In his annual report, Professor Rod Morgan said the rising caseload facing probation officers was now on a par with prison overcrowding and it was time the service shed tasks that did not merit its attention. He blamed "sentencing drift" for an increase in the severity of punishments handed out by the courts, with those who received a fine 10 years ago now being given community penalties and those who received community penalties now getting short prison sentences. As a result, he said, the probation service was "silting up" with low-risk offenders. He said the use of the fine should be revived as a priority, but also suggested other measures, including: · Contracting out the supervision of community punishment or of low-risk offenders; · Greater use of stand-alone electronic tagging orders; · The extension of the use of restorative justice initiatives. Prof Morgan said: "It is clear that if the probation service is to be enabled once again to target its resources on higher risk offenders and, in particular, supervise persistent offenders more intensively then it will almost certainly have to shed tasks which do not merit its attention." He suggested that many of those supervised by private security firms could be motoring offenders who failed to pay fines and were ordered to undertake community work. In his report the chief inspector also criticised the failure of policymakers to fight back against media claims that any sanction falling short of prison meant offenders were "getting away with it". The Home Office minister Paul Goggins said last night that the government did not see community penalties as a soft option and was commited to getting the message across.
