Police chiefs yesterday warned all officers that they would be sacked if they belonged to the British National party.The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) outlawed joining the BNP for police and staff in England and Wales. The president, Chris Fox, said he was "extremely pleased" by the move."Under this policy no member of the police service, whether police officer or police staff, may be a member of an organisation whose constitution, aims, objectives or pronouncements contradict the general duty to promote race equality. "This specifically includes the BNP and we anticipate that non-compliance will result in dismissal." Acpo introduced the policy through a change to regulations. It was unanimously backed at a meeting of chief constables earlier this month. BNP press officer Phil Edwards claimed it would lead to a witch-hunt and was the result of Home Office pressure. "I know a lot of coppers who support the BNP and quite a few who are in it," he said. "This is the sort of thing they used to do in the Soviet Union, removing people's democratic right to join a legal political party."
