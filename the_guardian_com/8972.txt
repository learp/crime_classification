The Metropolitan police last night confirmed that it has launched an investigation into reports that millions of pounds in police expenses have gone missing.Two detectives have been arrested and the Met's professional standards watchdog is to review spending on American Express cards issued to staff.The news will cause further embarrassment for Met commissioner Sir Ian Blair, who has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks over the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in July 2005.Yesterday it emerged that anti-corruption officers will check the records of hundreds of detectives, amid claims that the cash may have been spent on luxury watches, flatscreen televisions and holidays. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The director of professional standards is currently conducting a review around the issue and usage of the Met's American Express cards. Any alleged criminality that is uncovered will be dealt with robustly. We have a comprehensive plan to recover any money that is outstanding."Concerns over financial controls on the cards were first raised by internal auditors at the Metropolitan Police Authority. However, there is understood to be widespread anger within the authority that the Met's top brass, including Blair, reacted slowly to initial warnings.Yesterday an MPA spokesman said its chairman, Len Duvall, had told Blair to deliver a full update on the credit card situation by Friday.It is understood that internal auditors first began looking into the problem in late 2004, and alerted the Met that systems were in a "complete mess" early in 2005. A source at the MPA said that £2m of unaccounted for spending was initially identified, and has now been largely accounted for. However, at least a further £2m is still unexplained.The "sheer scale" of the issue and the pressure of expenses claims from continuing police operations meant the backlog had not been dealt with as quickly as members had hoped.The news follows an Independent Police Complaints Commission report into the shooting of De Menezes which criticised Blair personally for holding up its investigation.Yesterday it emerged that the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Nick Clegg, had written to Gordon Brown repeating the party's call for Blair to go. Brown has defended the commissioner. Yesterday London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, said that both the government and other senior police officers were "determined" that Blair would stay.
