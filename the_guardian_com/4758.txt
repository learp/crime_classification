The Malaysian student who was mugged in Barking, east London, by young men who appeared to be going to his aid said on Wednesday that he had been attacked at knifepoint and left with a broken jaw.Ashraf Haziq, 20, told one of his friends who visited him in the Royal London hospital in east London: "They threatened to stab me."His friend recorded their conversation in hospital and posted it on YouTube. Channel 4 News has translated the footage. Haziq said: "Some of them were quite young, maybe still in primary school. They had their hoods on and demanded my bicycle."Haziq, from Kuala Lumpur, was filmed crouching on the floor after being punched in the face, with the footage broadcast on YouTube and used widely in news bulletins and online.Several people were seen helping him to his feet and looked like they were comforting him before going through the contents of his backpack and stealing some items.Haziq, who arrived in Britain a month ago, had been fasting for Ramadan, and was on his way to visit a friend and break his fast, when he was set upon by a gang.He was due to undergo surgery for a broken jaw on Wednesday.David Cameron said the attack had left him "disgusted".
