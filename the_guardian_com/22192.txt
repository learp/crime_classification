Two men were today given five-year prison sentences after being found guilty of attempting to blackmail a member of the royal family over gay sex allegations.Ian Strachan, 31, of Fulham, south-west London, and 41-year-old Sean McGuigan, of Battersea, also in south-west London, were convicted following a trial at the Old Bailey.The court had heard how the pair recorded tapes of a royal employee, known as witness D, in which D claimed the royal had performed a sex act on him. After failing to sell the story to several national newspapers, the pair then tried to extort Â£50,000 from the royal, known only as witness A.Strachan and McGuigan were arrested in an undercover police sting at a London hotel in September.Today, Mr Justice Cooke told them the offence was so serious that they had to go to jail. "The corrosive evil of blackmail means that any sentence must have a deterrent effect," he said.The judge said he was sure the men had acted together to target A, a victim he said was "particularly susceptible". They had encouraged D to make "scurrilous accusations" and had collected "scurrilous and salacious" material against A, his family and his business, the court heard.Following the verdict, a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Although they [the defendants] claimed to be acting in the interests of the victim, the jury rejected this story and agreed with the prosecution that they were simply interested in the money. "Prosecutions for blackmail are rare, but it is a serious offence which can involve the victims making themselves vulnerable in order that the case come to trial."
