Wayne Smith, one of the UK's nine most wanted fugitives, is due to return to Britain on Thursday night with his partner, Julie Anne Skelding.The couple have spent the last six years hiding in northern Cyprus after jumping bail, but gave themselves up after Smith admitted their time on the run had become a "living nightmare".Smith and Skelding were expected to land at Birmingham airport to be remanded in custody. "We are 95% certain they will be up in court in Birmingham [on Friday] to face charges of failing to appear in court to answer to bail but it depends on when the court has the time available to hear their case," a spokesman for West Midlands police said. "It will be up to the court to decide whether to bail the couple, but given their history of skipping the country, it's unlikely any request [for bail] will be granted."Smith, 38, was involved in a car crash on the evening of 5 June 2005 that caused the death of Mohammed Idrees, aged 22. Idrees was hit by one car as he crossed a suburban road in Birmingham before a second car, driven by Smith, crashed into him and dragged him about 350 metres.Smith, from Billesley, West Midlands, was arrested after the crash, charged and released on conditional bail. He fled to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, which has no extradition treaty with the UK, before his trial had finished. In 2006 was convicted in his absence of causing death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.Skelding, 40, joined him afterwards when a jury found her guilty of perverting the course of justice by giving Smith a false alibi. The couple were named last month on the latest most-wanted list released by Crimestoppers and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.Before he and Skelding handed themselves in, Smith said: "I want to go back and face justice. It's about closure for me and closure for the family of the man who died."
