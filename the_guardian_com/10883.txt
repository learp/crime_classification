Men caught kerb-crawling face American-style lessons on the suffering of women forced into prostitution under plans for a radical crackdown on trafficking into the sex industry.The move reflects the popularity of 'john schools' in the US, where men who use prostitutes are sent on courses detailing the abuse and coercion involved in the sex trade.The plight of trafficked prostitutes was highlighted by last week's raid on a brothel in Birmingham, which found 19 women from countries as far apart as Poland and Hong Kong whom police said had been held against their will.Paul Goggins, the Home Office minister, will this week visit Lithuania - emerging as a centre for people-smuggling - for talks on disrupting trade ahead of an EU anti-trafficking plan later this year. But he told The Observer it was crucial to tackle demand as well as supply.'We need to do more to educate the public, particularly those who use the services of prostitutes, to understand a bit more graphically the nature of the exploitation and abuse taking place,' he said.The lessons would not need to be as formal as those in 'john schools' - named after US slang for prostitutes' clients and offering blunt lectures from former sex workers and doctors - but police could arrange for men caught in red-light areas to be confronted with home truths.The number of men who pay for sex has doubled in the past 10 years, according to the British Sexual Attitudes Survey, and campaigners say myths about 'happy hookers' persist. In fact, around 80 per cent of prostitutes in London brothels are from overseas, and at least 1,400 women a year are trafficked into the UK sex industry.Victims are commonly told they have been recruited for bar work: on arrival their passports are confiscated and they are forced to sell sex. Rape is a common method of 'breaking in' the unwilling. Although about a fifth of trafficked women are thought to know they will be heading for sex work, even they are often unaware that they will be captives unable to leave.The Home Office is to publish an action plan, expected to expand places of refuge for fleeing prostitutes - there is only one such refuge now, London's Poppy Project - and publicise the long jail terms traffickers now face.But Britain will not agree to demands to allow trafficking victims an automatic right to stay in Britain rather than being deported as illegal immigrants, despite warnings that they are often simply retrafficked or ostracised because they have sold sex.Goggins said more help could be offered with the 'rehabilitation' of prostitutes sent home, but granting an automatic right to stay in Britain could even encourage them into the arms of the gangs.West Midlands police have described the Birmingham women as 'victims', not criminals, but six are being dealt with by the Immigration Service. Some appear to be from new EU countries and would be entitled to stay: otherwise, there are discretionary powers to grant leave to remain to victims of trafficking who testify against their captors.However, campaigners want Britain to ratify a UN convention guaranteeing victims a 30-day reflection period and stronger rights to asylum. 'If there's a risk of them being retrafficked or otherwise abused, then they should be granted leave to remain,' said a spokesman for Amnesty International.Â· A woman aged 50 from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, a 52-year-old man from Stourbridge, and a man aged 22 from Wolverhampton were charged yesterday with being concerned in the management of a brothel as a result of the Birmingham raid and with a firearms offence. The elder man has also been charged with possessing an offensive weapon.
