Women-friendly train carriages with guards on duty after 9pm would be introduced across London's underground network as part of a range of transport measures to be unveiled today.Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrats' mayoral candidate, says every tube running at night should have a clearly marked carriage with a uniformed guard in direct contact with the police. At the launch of his transport manifesto at Vauxhall bus station, Paddick will also reveal proposals to put teams of police guards on the late-night buses which have the worst record for violence and antisocial behaviour."Some people are put off travelling by public transport at night because they don't feel safe," said Paddick. "Many women have told me they would feel reassured if there was a uniformed presence on tubes and buses after the evening rush hour."Paddick is trailing third in the race to become mayor on May 1 but hopes the continued "bickering between Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone" will work to his advantage.The former Metropolitan police commander says he aims to run a dignified and intelligent campaign focusing on the issues. But he accepts he faces "a long, hard road" as number three in what most commentators predict will be a two-horse race. "The danger for me is that dignity and intelligence do not make good headlines," he said.Under today's proposals the designated tube carriages would focus on offering a safe environment for women."Talking to many women, they have told me that they do not feel safe on public transport at night but can't afford taxis, so are being forced to stay at home."A spokeswoman for the Liberal Democrats said the two schemes would cost around £10m and would be paid for by cancelling the right of Transport for London workers to get free travel for a designated partner or friend.Paddick will announce plans to scrap the low emission zone for Greater London which was introduced this month by Livingstone to charge the worst polluting lorries £200 every time they enter the city.Instead he would replace the programme with a £10 charge for all non-Londoners who drive into the capital - except commercial vehicles."What we want to do is encourage visitors to London to use public transport," his spokeswoman said. "With this scheme we can both encourage people out of their cars and help improve trains and buses." She said the scheme would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and cover the whole of Greater London.
