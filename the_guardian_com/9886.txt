Two men accused of killing two British soldiers in a gun attack which marked an upsurge in dissident republican violence in 2009 will stand trial for murder next month.The decision to send the pair to trial was taken at Coleraine magistrates court today.Colin Duffy, 43, from Lurgan, and Brian Shivers, 45, from Magherafelt, will stand trial for the murders of Sappers Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey outside Massereene barracks in Antrim town.Duffy and Shivers will also face six counts of attempted murder.The March 2009 attack, in which the soldiers were murdered as they took delivery of a pizza, was claimed by dissident republican group the Real IRA.Today's hearing was the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry to decide if there was sufficient evidence to allow the case to proceed to trial.The case against the men centres on DNA evidence found inside the car used in the attack.Judge George Connor rejected the defence lawyers' arguement that the standard of that evidence was not high enough to commit the men for trial.Delivering his decision Connor said it would be inappropriate for him to consider the weight of the evidence. That, he said, was a matter for trial.He added that "clearly the car was connected to the crime" and there was evidence to indicate the defendants were connected to the car.
