Detectives investigating the £53m Tonbridge robbery yesterday found millions of pounds at a London industrial estate. Kent police said it was not clear how much had been found at a car repair shop in Graves Yard in Welling, where a 43-year-old man was arrested, as it was still being counted and has to undergo forensic tests, but some sources put it at £7m."Bags containing the cash are being examined by police. Until this thorough examination is completed we will not know exactly how much money has been seized but we do know it amounts to several million pounds," a spokesman said.The money was recovered during a planned raid by Kent and Scotland Yard officers at an ENR Cars vehicle repair shop.A witness, Ian Jackaman, said plain clothes officers appeared at 3pm on Thursday, followed an hour later by about 40 uniformed officers, some of them armed.Nigel Reeves, who owns the premises and is currently in Spain, said he had sublet one of three units a few months ago.He said: "I was very shocked when I heard what had happened."But I have been in constant contact with Kent police about it. I have told the police if they wish I will return and cooperate fully with their inquiries."Kent police confirmed that money had been found at Elderden Farm, Staplehurst, Kent, which has been at the centre of a huge search all week, but described the amount as "not significant".Earlier yesterday, two men faced Maidstone magistrates, charged with conspiracy to commit the Tonbridge robbery. Lea Rusha, 33, a roofer and kick boxing expert from Tunbridge Wells, and Jetmir Bucpapa, a 24-year-old unemployed man, of Tonbridge, appeared at separate hearings. Each spoke only to confirm his name, age and address. Neither applied for bail and both were remanded in custody to appear at Maidstone crown court on March 13.Also in the dock will be John Fowler, 60, a car dealer of Elderden Farm, Staplehurst, accused of conspiracy to commit robbery, handling stolen goods and kidnapping Securitas depot manager Colin Dixon, his wife, Lynn, and son, Craig; Stuart Royle, 47, a car dealer, of Maidstone, charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, and his girlfriend, Kim Shackleton, 39, accused of handling stolen goods.
