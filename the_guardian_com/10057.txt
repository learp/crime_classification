Offenders as young as 14 are to be drug tested under new plans to be announced by ministers today.A new programme is being launched in 10 pilot areas, and testing could begin within days. The government has published the results of a three-year trial of a similar programme testing adult suspects.Under the pilot scheme for adults, people suspected of property crime such as theft and burglary are tested for heroin, cocaine and crack cocaine when police charged them. Children aged 14 and over will now be tested for the same drugs when they are charged with property theft.In May, 48% of those tested were found to have taken drugs, and a quarter of those were persistent offenders. When an offender tests positive, they are offered voluntary treatment. A Home Office spokeswoman said "Evaluation results show that drug testing, while it does not reduce the number of people taking class A drugs, does highlight those who are and enables them to get treatment."The programme for young offenders is being launched in Manchester, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Nottingham, Calderdale, Bradford, Hull and three London boroughs.
