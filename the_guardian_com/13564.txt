Police arrested an 18-year-old on suspicion of attempted murder last night after a fire extinguisher was thrown at officers during the Millbank riot. Scotland Yard said the man was detained in Southampton yesterday. He was being taken to London to be questioned by Metropolitan police officers. On Friday, a 23-year-old student at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge was arrested then released on bail on suspicion of violent disorder. A Met spokesman said: "This arrest follows an investigation into public disorder where a fire extinguisher was thrown from the roof of Millbank Tower."
