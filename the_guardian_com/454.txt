One of the Queen's horse riders has been jailed after attacking an ex-jockey in a jealous rage.Jonathan Nolan, 32, who is a work rider for royal trainer Sir Michael Stoute, battered former-jockey-turned-PR-director John Maxse after confronting him in Newmarket.When police arrived, Nolan was so covered in Maxse's blood that police thought he had himself been the victim of a serious assault.On Thursday, Judge Rupert Overbury jailed him for four years at Ipswich crown court, after he admitted grievous bodily harm with intent.He said: "You carried out a vicious, sustained and unprovoked attack."Simply by using your hands and feet you left Mr Maxse looking like the victim of a road traffic accident."The court heard that Nolan had objected to Maxse's friendship with his ex-girlfriend, Genevieve Hippisley.Hippisley, the mother of Nolan's three-year-old daughter, watched helplessly as the five-minute attack took place at her home in July.One police officer said Maxse's injuries were the most shocking he had seen.Prosecutor Richard Kelly told the court that Nolan and Hippisley, 26, had broken up after a long relationship.Since the break-up they had seen each other on and off and Nolan had made it clear he was unhappy that she was friends with Maxse. Earlier on the day of the attack, she sent him a text message saying: "I have tried not to hurt you but you and me are over now."The prosecutor described how Nolan arrived at his ex-girlfriend's home that night and found Maxse sitting on the sofa. "He strode past Miss Hippisley and said something like 'how could you or how dare you' before repeatedly punching Mr Maxse," Kelly said."He continued to punch him in the face with Mr Maxse putting up an arm to protect himself."Kelly said that 5ft 6in Maxse stood little chance against Nolan, who is 6ft 1in and athletically built.Nolan kicked Maxse several times as he lay on the floor then chased him on to the pavement outside where he continued the attack. The victim was left with a broken nose, fractured eye socket and fractured cheekbone.Hippisley raised the alarm and police arrived to arrest Nolan at the scene.Charles Myatt, mitigating, presented character references to the court, including one from Stoute's head trainer, Tony Crombie.He said: "Extreme emotions turned this otherwise placid, kind and non-violent man into somebody governed by a blind emotional rage."There is genuine and deep remorse borne out of a genuine feeling that Mr Maxse did not deserve in any shape or form to be victim of this attack."Nolan, of Skeaping Close, Newmarket, looked composed as sentence was passed.As she left court in tears, Hippisley declined to comment.Maxse, former PR director at the Jockey Club and the British Horseracing Authority, was photographed with a black eye and cuts and bruises to his face following the incident. The 45-year-old former jockey, who works as a communications consultant for Qatar Racing and is a work rider for Michael Bell, said on Twitter that he was left looking like film character Rocky Balboa.On Thursday Maxse, who was not in court, posted a picture of himself in his hospital bed on Twitter, saying: "Today the person who did this to me is due in court for sentencing."In a series of tweets, he said he had continued to suffer since the ordeal.He added: "Anyway, it's now up to the judge at Ipswich crown court to decide on an appropriate penalty. #nothingmoretosay."Nolan, who worked at Stoute's Freemason Lodge stables, used to ride the Queen's horse Carlton House when it was trained there.A work rider's normal duties include mucking out, exercising, grooming and feeding the horses.
