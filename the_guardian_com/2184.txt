Scientific evidence shows that blood may have flown off the knife used to stab Stephen Lawrence and on to the collar of one of the two men accused of murdering him, a jury has heard.A microscopic amount of blood was found by scientists on the jacket collar of Gary Dobson 14 years after the murder, the Old Bailey was told.Dobson and fellow defendant David Norris deny involvement in the 1993 murder, when a gang stabbed Lawrence twice after shouting racist abuse at him.Scientist Edward Jarman told the court that a cold case review of clothing taken from the suspects and the victim had made a series of breakthroughs and produced new evidence. The defence claims that the possibility of contamination makes the evidence unreliable.The scientific evidence is at the heart of the crown's case, with the judge, Mr Justice Treacy, telling the jury that Jarman's appearance would be "significant".Jarman is an expert in blood and DNA and was part of a team of scientists at a private forensics company, LGC, which carried out the cold case review of the Lawrence case, beginning in 2007.Jarman said his team discovered a tiny bloodstain on a jacket collar found in Dobson's home in 1993. The stain measured half a millimetre by a quarter of a millimetre and the most likely explanation was that the jacket's wearer was at the murder scene, the jury heard. There was just a one in a billion chance that it did not come from Lawrence, the court was told.Mark Ellison QC, prosecuting, asked the scientist how Lawrence's blood came to be on the collar of Dobson's jacket.Jarman said: "There was potential that blood could be transferred. It could be transferred by the weapon itself when removed from the victim or the actual blood from the injury itself."The blood would have dried quickly, in as little as a couple of minutes, indicating the jacket wearer was "directly involved" in the attack, the jury heard.Jarman said: "The transfer would have had to have occurred very shortly after the incident given the sort of quantities of blood that are likely to have been available during the assault."Jarman said it was "implausible" that the jacket had not been at the murder scene and remained in a wardrobe, in a bedroom where police found Dobson when they raided his parents' house in May 1993, a fortnight after the murder: "If the jacket remained in the wardrobe I can not envisage a plausible explanation for the presence of that stain on the collar."Jarman said capillary action had led to the microscopic blood spot being absorbed into the weave of the collar. He told the jury that meant the blood got there when "wet" and "airborne". Tests he carried out showed it was highly unlikely the blood stain got into the collar because of other tests carried out on it.Jarman also said that three blood fragments were found in the evidence bag containing Dobson's jacket. DNA tests found there was a one in a billion chance this blood did not come from Lawrence. Encased in the blood fragments were three fibres, with one bent in a 'U' shape.Jarman said that initial tests for blood on Dobson's jacket were negative, but it was then subjected to a thorough examination by a microscope, a step not usually taken on clothing exhibits.Lawrence, 18, was stabbed to death as he waited for a bus in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993. Dobson, 36, and Norris, 35, both deny murder.The trial continues.
