The home secretary, David Blunkett, yesterday ordered an inquiry after a convicted sex offender raped a woman only weeks after being released from prison on licence.Malcolm Rourke, 37, was given two life sentences at Leicester crown court on Tuesday after he was convicted of raping and robbing a 51-year-old woman in the city. Rourke was staying in a probation hostel when he raped the woman in July. He carried out the attack three weeks after he was released from prison, two-thirds of the way through a 10-year sentence for rape. Rourke had caused concern at the hostel by behaving inappropriately towards a female member of staff, who was subsequently transferred. Colin Pinfold, assistant chief probation officer for Leicestershire and Rutland, said Rourke had expressed a "fondness" for the staff member but had not breached the terms of his licence. But, when sentencing Rourke, the trial judge, Michael Stokes QC, said: "Why wasn't his licence revoked? This poor woman was raped and robbed on the streets of Leicester by a man who should have been back in prison." Mr Blunkett has asked Stephen Shaw, the prisons and probation ombudsman, to launch an investigation into the way prison and probation officers handled the case. A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We want to make sure the systems are adequate and, if there are any lessons to be learnt, that we learn them." Mr Pinfold said a very close eye had been kept on Rourke and he believed his case had not been mishandled. He added: "[Rourke] expressed a fondness for one female member of staff but there was never any physical expression of this. If he had threatened her or if there was any physical demonstration of affection towards her then we would have sent him back [to prison] immediately." Under current legislation in England and Wales offenders sentenced to four years or more in prison are automatically released after serving two-thirds of their sentence, so Rourke was automatically released from custody.
