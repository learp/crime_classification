It is not just uninsured, underage tearaway drivers who put the public at risk. So do the police cars which pursue them. The drunken tearaways raise their speed in an effort to get away; the police, whose authority has already been flouted by the refusal of the pursued to stop, are even more determined to catch them. In too many cases, it all ends up in a crash, killing or injuring the pursued as well as innocent observers. An important report from the police complaints authority yesterday was unequivocal: the police are continuing to engage in too many pursuits that endanger public safety. The report, Fatal Pursuit, is based on an examination of 85 cases of road traffic collisions involving police pursuits between 1998-2001, which resulted in 91 deaths.This is not a new problem. A 1997 Home Office study examined the same problem and new steps were put in place to curb dangerous pursuits. Yet the number of deaths involving police pursuits referred to the PCA, have more than tripled in the last four years. The Americans have taken such unnecessary deaths far more seriously than the UK. In Florida's Miami-Dade county, all pursuits except against drivers suspected of a violent felony were stopped. The Californian highway patrol were even more restrictive, not least because of the TV news channel helicopters monitoring every chase. The PCA report suggests police control-room managers should have greater control of such chases. But this may be difficult for managers some distance away. Certainly they are right to want stricter criteria, a clearer strategy and more monitoring. But if we are not going to be as radical as California, then why not try the Kansas City option: restricting pursuits to women police drivers? Over 90% of the PCA's cases involved male officers. In Kansas City, women officers proved better drivers, caused fewer accidents and were better at handling the conflict that an arrest raises.
