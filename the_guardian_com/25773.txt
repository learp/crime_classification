Sugababes' Amelle Berrabah was arrested in her hometown of Aldershot yesterday, after allegedly causing criminal damage to a woman's car.Berrabah, who joined the all-girl trio in 2005 to replace Mutya Buena, was arrested at 10.45am and then questioned by police for four hours. It's claimed the offence occured while the Sugababe was at her sister Laila's home when a conflict with a neighbour blew up into a heated row.A source told the Mirror: "There's been a needle between the two families and on Thursday it hit boiling point. There was shouting and a girl called the police, who got there about 10.45am. Amelle was shaking as officers carted her off."This is not the first time Berrabah has pushed the buttons of the law. She was arrested last April for allegedly assaulting a woman in a Surrey nightclub. No charges followed however.On Christmas Eve, Berrabah's boyfriend, Freddie Fuller, was attacked with a machete outside the Queen Victoria pub in Aldershot and spent Christmas Day in intensive care. Fuller was also cleared of allegations that he raped Barrabah's sister, Samiya, last February.So far Berrabah's place in the chart-conquering band has not been under threat, though that may yet change following the latest allegations.Last October the group reached the No 1 spot on both the UK album and single charts with Change and About You Now respectively.Berrabah has been bailed to appear at Aldershot police station on February 21.
