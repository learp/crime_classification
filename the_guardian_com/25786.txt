Supporters of four men who claim they are the victims of serious miscarriages of justice will gather at Trafalgar Square in London this Sunday (October 16) at noon and will then march to Downing Street to deliver petitions on behalf of the men.The four cases highlighted are those of Kevin Lane, serving life for the 1994 murder of Robert Magill; Ray Gilbert, serving life for the 1981 murder of John Suffield; John Twomey, jailed for the Â£1.75 million Heathrow robbery in 2004 and not allowed a trial by jury; and Sam Hallam, jailed for life for the 2204 murder of Essayas Kassahun. Hallam's case has now been referred to the court of appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.The march was originally planned for August but was cancelled because of the riots in London.
