Achilleas Kallakis, a conman who received a seven-year jail sentence in January, will spend a further four years behind bars after a British government lawyer called on senior judges for a tougher sentence.Kallakis, 44, duped banks out of more than £740m by posing as a property tycoon based in the elite London district of Mayfair.Oliver Heald, the solicitor general, referred the case of Kallakis and that of his old university friend turned forger, Alexander Williams, to the court of appeal after both men were found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to defraud."We are pleased that the court agreed that consecutive sentences were required to reflect the fact that two separate banks fell victim to the offenders," Heald said in a statement.Williams, who produced forged documents to back up Kallakis's loan applications, was initially handed a five-year jail term. He will now serve eight.Between 2005 and 2008, the men created an elaborate and fraudulent network of business arrangements through which they borrowed huge amounts of money to buy a commercial property empire and fund lavish lifestyles. Kallakis kept a fleet of chauffeur driven Bentleys, a private jet, a helicopter, a luxury yacht in Monaco and art.The bulk of the loans were secured from Allied Irish Banks, although HBOS lost £5m after agreeing to a loan that the men said was to convert a passenger ferry into a luxury yacht.The banks' lax risk controls and background checks during a property binge was also criticised during earlier court proceedings.
