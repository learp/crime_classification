Harold Shipman was sacked from a West Yorkshire practice in the 1970s for falsifying more than 70 prescriptions to feed his drug addiction.Shipman, who had joined a practice at Todmorden health centre, West Yorkshire, injected the pain-killing drug pethidine, which is normally used to help women in labour, into his arms and legs. He said he took to using the drug while suffering from depression caused by opposition to his ideas for improving the practice. His habit came to light after it became obvious that some patients were being prescribed large amounts of the drug. Shipman was admitted to hospital. It was realised that the doctor, who had been injecting himself for six months, had a serious medical problem. He saw a psychiatrist and spent time in a treatment centre. Shipman appeared before Halifax magistrates in February 1976, admitting eight charges of obtaining a drug by deception, and asking for 67 similar offences, and seven of forgery, to be taken into consideration. He was fined a total of Â£600 and ordered to pay compensation to the NHS. Magistrate Dr Maurice Goldin told Shipman, then aged 30: "It is indeed a very sad case - that almost at the beginning of your career you should find yourself in this position." Shipman told detectives who questioned him after the discrepancies were discovered that he was in the habit of taking 600 to 700 milligrams of pethidine a day, and was taking more and more as he became increasingly depressed. He would give parts of some prescriptions to the patient and keep some for his own use. On some occasions none of the drug went to the patient for whom it was apparently intended. The court was told that drug squad officers were satisfied that he had not deprived any patients of drugs they needed, and had not illegally supplied drugs to anyone else. Shipman's partnership in the clinic was terminated and he obtained a job in Durham in which where there was no need for him to have access to drugs.
