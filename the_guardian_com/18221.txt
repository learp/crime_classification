Motoring offenders and petty criminals are threatening to swamp the prison system because of an increase in custodial sentences, the head of the Prison Service said yesterday.Referring to a four-fold increase in prison sentences for motorists over the last 10 years, Martin Narey said too many drivers were being jailed. "The Prison Service is being overrun with very many short-term prisoners. Lots of people who are in prison now who would not have been in prison 10 years ago," he said on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost. Mr Narey, who is due to become the head of the merged prison and probation services, said he wanted to work with the courts to reduce the numbers of motorists receiving prison terms. "The new service which I'll head will work very closely with the judiciary to try to inform them about the greater effectiveness of community penalties for that sort of offender," he said. His comments were seized on by the Association of British Drivers which claimed motorists were victimised for minor breaches of the law. "Prison is intended as a method by which we remove dangerous people from society: murderers, rapists, people who damage others," said a spokesman. "It is an improper use of the tool to send people to jail for a minor motoring offence." He said prosecutions for serious motoring offences had dropped over the last decade while the number of speeding offences had increased. "When you have a situation like this, respect for the law starts to break down." But the AA said most jailed motorists had committed serious offences such as driving while disqualified or without insurance, and causing death by dangerous driving. Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety, said there was growing public support for custodial sentencing in such cases.
