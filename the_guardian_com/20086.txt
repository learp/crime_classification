A teenager has been killed and another man left injured by two men wearing bandanas who shot them on a London street.Terrified witnesses described how three gunshots were fired on Hindrey Road in Clapton, east London, at 8.20pm on Saturday.A 19-year-old man was rushed to hospital where he later died, and a 22-year-old man was understood to be in a stable condition, Scotland Yard said.The pair had been sitting in a car at the time of the shooting, witnesses said.Zach Carpenter, 18, saw two men wearing bandanas across their faces enter Hindrey Road before he heard three loud bangs.One of the men was black with a red-and-white chequered bandana, while the other man was white and wearing a black bandana, he said.Carpenter said: "I was walking home from the shop when I saw a black man and a white man walking down the main road and turn into Hindrey Road. After about 30 seconds I heard three loud bangs."It's unnerved me a bit because my family live nearby."The Aberystwyth University student, whose family has lived in the area since he was 10 months old, said there were known feuds between gangs on rival estates."It's not so much a war, more of a feud between the Pembury and Nightingale estates and another one," he said.Detectives from Operation Trident, which investigates gang-related crime, are searching for the two suspects, who were seen running from the scene towards the nearby Pembury estate.One is black and the other light-skinned, possibly of Asian or Turkish appearance, police said, adding that there was as yet no clear motive for the shootings, and no one had been arrested."At this very early stage we must retain an open mind regarding the circumstances of the incident and any motive," a Scotland Yard spokesman said."Detectives from Trident are leading the inquiry and an incident room will open in the morning." A postmortem will also be carried out.Hindrey Road remained cordoned off on Sunday as police officers patrolled the area.A 70-year-old resident, who did not wish to be named, said she heard three gunshots."I heard the shots â€“ one, two, three. I was on the phone to my son and he told me not to dare look out the house. It's been a lot better around here recently. There hasn't been anything like this for many years."Another resident, who has lived in the area for more than 20 years, said: "With this happening now, I don't think people will feel safe. There have been shootings here before but this is the first murder."Witnesses or anyone with information about the incident are asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
