The home secretary, Charles Clarke, will today announce plans to toughen laws on deporting foreign prisoners.Mr Clarke is likely to face calls for his resignation when he appears before the Commons to make a statement on the deportation scandal today.Under the new rules being proposed, there will be a presumption that any foreign national convicted of an imprisonable offence should automatically be deported.The proposals come amid a growing clamour for the home secretary's resignation.The pressure on him increased further after yesterday's revelation that a suspect in the killing of the Bradford policewoman Sharon Beshenivsky was a Somalian national who had been considered for deportation several months before her murder in November.Friends and relatives of PC Beshenivsky and her fellow officer Teresa Milburn, who was also shot and wounded in a robbery in the Yorkshire city, have called for Mr Clarke to stand down.PC Beshenivsky, 38, was shot on her daughter's birthday when she was called out to a raid at a travel agency.In March, five men were charged over the killing, but Mustaf Jamma - a 25-year-old who was considered for deportation after being imprisoned over a string of robberies - remains at large.Police believe he fled the country after the murder, and reports suggested he had served a three-year sentence for armed robbery and been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2000.The defence secretary, John Reid, today told GMTV Mr Jamma's deportation had been rejected because it would have been impossible to return him to Somalia, which is in a state of civil chaos."There was a threat that if [he] took a plane into the capital, Mogadishu, not only would he have been blown out of the air but the pilot of the plane would have been," he said. "So it was decided, on balance, they should not deport him in this case."Ms Beshenivsky's best friend, Sally Barandiaran, told the Daily Mail Mr Clarke should resign. "It is sickening to know that Sharon could be alive today if this man had been dealt with properly," she said."If Charles Clarke knew about this and was keeping quiet, he should hang his head in shame, do the decent thing and go."Ms Milburn's husband, Christopher Milburn, told the Yorkshire Post the home secretary's position was "untenable"."Charles Clarke has mucked this situation up," he said. "I would want to see tighter controls on immigration, and anyone that has been allowed to stay in this country should be sent back if they are going to cause crime."Mr Clarke will deliver a statement on the 1,023 foreign criminals who should have been considered for deportation after being released from prison.They were released between 1999 and this March, with 288 freed after the Home Office became aware of the problem last summer.The prime minister's spokesman said Somalia was one of three countries - along with Chad and Ivory Coast - to which the Foreign Office advised against all travel. He confirmed Mr Clarke would deal with the wider issue of deporting foreign criminals when he makes his statement to MPs this afternoon. The spokesman said: "There is an issue about the criteria by which people can be considered for deportation. That's one of the matters Charles Clarke will discuss in his statement. "There are issues surrounding a very small number of countries where the question may not be whether to deport, but can you deport? "Somalia is one of those countries where we, along with other European countries, have found it physically impossible to deport people to because of the security risk involved - not so much to those being deported but those who have to carry out such forced deportations, and that's a very real issue. "That's why in 2004 when we did try and deport people we found it impossible to do so. "If you can't physically land at an airport because of the reception you would receive, then you have a very real problem."
