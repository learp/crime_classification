The family of a 16-year-old schoolboy stabbed to death in London, last night pleaded that his death should not be avenged. Clutching a photograph of the dead boy, the mother of Kodjo Yenga said: 'I don't like violence. My son was a very nice, very beautiful boy.' Ladjua Lesele spoke of 'justice' but dismissed revenge, adding: 'I don't like that.'Her comments came shortly after four teenagers appeared in court charged with the murder of her teenage son. The four youths, two aged 13, one aged 15 and a 16-year-old, were all remanded in custody to appear before a youth court this Wednesday. Five other youths have been given bail by police in connection with the death.Kodjo's uncle Lubi described the family's loss as 'awful beyond words'.
