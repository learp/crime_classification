A detective who carried out a flawed inquiry into the crimes of serial killer Harold Shipman admitted yesterday he was at a loss as to how he should investigate the claims.Detective Inspector David Smith, of Greater Manchester police, told the Shipman public inquiry that he had never been involved in such a case and he had struggled to find information to support the allegations. The discreet police investigation which began in March 1998, lasted only four weeks, before Mr Smith concluded the family doctor had done nothing improper and the case was dropped. Shipman then went on to murder three more elderly patients - Winifred Mellor and Joan Melia, both 73, and Kathleen Grundy, 81 - before he was arrested. He is serving life at Frankland jail, Durham, after he was convicted of the murder of 15 elderly patients. Shipman is suspected of killing hundreds of other patients in Hyde, Greater Manchester. Mr Smith said he had not formulated a plan after the South Manchester coroner John Pollard had told police of the concerns expressed by Linda Reynolds, from the nearby Brook surgery. He said the coroner had concerns that Shipman was killing his patients. "I didn't know where to go with it. At that stage, it was more a fact finding inquiry - there was no evidence." He said it was different to the normal police inquiries where death had occurred, in that there was no body and no hard evidence. He kept scant notes and failed to check if Shipman had a criminal record. He did not carry out the check because he either forgot or was going to do it. Mr Smith had single handedly carried out the investigation as he said the allegations were so incredible that if people became aware of them, they were likely to mention them to others. He said he needed to trace medical records, death certificates and to obtain more information for the inquiry. "I didn't really know where to go for this information," he said.
