Specially trained prison officers were called in to break up a protest at Winchester jail yesterday.Twenty-two inmates refused to return to cells at noon and were contained in a yard. A Prison Service spokeswoman said the 22 spent the afternoon shouting in the yard and making demands, though she would not say what these were. After negotiation failed, teams moved into the year and the protest was ended at 6.30pm with no injuries. The Victorian building houses about 600 inmates. Winchester, a category B prison, was among those highlighted last month in a report by the Prison Reform Trust on drugs in jails. The trust said smuggling was an organised racket, alleging that dealers used cleaners and auxiliary staff to sneak drugs inside. Other tricks include throwing tennis balls stuffed full of heroin or crack over prison walls, the trust said. The jail has a recorded drug use of 28.5% (measured in terms of percent of random mandatory tests that were positive), third behind Kirkham in Lancashire, 35%, and Armley in Leeds, 30.5.
