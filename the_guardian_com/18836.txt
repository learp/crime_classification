Two boys aged 11 and 12 have been arrested in connection with the attempted abduction of a young girl from a Liverpool supermarket as police appealedon Wednesday for the child's mother to contact them.The girl, thought to be between three and five, was shopping with her mother at the large Asda in Smithdown Road, south of the city centre when the boys allegedly tried to snatch her.The mother reported the attempted kidnap, which happened on 6 November, to an in-store security guard â€“ but he failed to log it with store managers until he came back on shift the following day.It was reported to police on 9 November and the boys were arrested on Friday. They have since been released on police bail. Merseyside police are trying to trace the woman, who they say did not leave details with the supermarket.It is not known at this stage if the alleged abductors had any physical contact with the girl. But a spokesman for the supermarket confirmed the incident took place within the public aisles.Detectives said the mother did not leave any details. But they are keen to speak to her to determine what happened. CCTV footage released on Wednesday shows a woman carrying a girl while guiding a trolley round the store.Detective Inspector Colin Rennison said: "This is a very disturbing incident and I'm sure it would have caused a great deal of distress for this woman and her child."We are treating this report very seriously and are very keen for this woman to come forward so we can piece together the full circumstances of this incident."Thankfully incidents such as this are rare and while we are not sure of the intentions of the two youths I would urge members of the public to always reports any incident of this nature to police immediately by calling 999."Officers urge the woman captured on the CCTV, witnesses or anyone who can assist with the inquiry, to contact Admiral Street CID on 0151-777 5394, or the anonymous Crimestoppers hotline on 0800 555 111.
