A 35-year-old Yorkshireman who ran off to London with a 14-year-old girl has admitted child abduction and sex with a minor.John Bush, from Doncaster, sparked a nationwide hunt when he disappeared in June with the teenager, also from Doncaster, who cannot be named for legal reasons. The pair were found by police four days later at Euston station in London.Bush appeared at Sheffield crown court on Monday where he pleaded guilty to child abduction and sexual activity with a child between 1 January and 11 June, as well as a charge of making off without paying Â£120 for two hotel rooms in Melton Mowbray, in Leicestershire.He will be sentenced on 4 November, and the judge, Paul Watson QC, told Bush he faced jail. "Custody would appear to be the only outcome," he said.Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said the crown would need a week to decide whether Bush's basis of plea was acceptable. Nicholas de la Poer, defending, said Bush did not want to prevaricate and hoped to be sentenced as soon as possible.Detective Chief Inspector Craig Robinson, of South Yorkshire police, who led the investigation to locate the pair, said: "The disappearance of the girl led to a nationwide hunt involving many police forces and other agencies. Bush was guilty not only of abducting a child but he went on the run across the country in a deliberate attempt to evade arrest."Thanks to the professionalism, dedication and hard work of the investigation team, and with the support of our colleagues up and down the country, we built an unassailable case against Bush which helped secure his guilty pleas today, so sparing the child and witnesses the upset of having to give evidence at a trial and saving the public the expense of a trial. I'd like to thank everyone involved in helping to bring this man to justice."
