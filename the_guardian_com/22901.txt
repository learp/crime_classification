Your article (Will fresh criticism of police blamed for Soham failure force chief out? February 11) jumps the gun. The independent inquiry being conducted by Michael Bichard will examine the issue of whether or not Humberside police was ever asked to carry out a vetting check on Ian Huntley. In any event, the task of searching the police national computer fell to Cambridgeshire constabulary.Your assertion it was this force's "blunders" that allowed Huntley to obtain a job as a school caretaker may be seen as pre-empting Bichard's findings. We don't regard this as helpful. We have made submissions to the inquiry which deal in detail with the issue of what information was held by us on Huntley and what answer we would have given had we been asked to carry out a police check on him. It is also unhelpful of you to suggest that chief constable David Westwood is being investigated by the inquiry. The terms of reference to the Bichard inquiry do not include any reference to him personally. It is looking into the processes and policies of both the Humberside and Cambridgeshire forces. Had you waited for the publication of our submissions to the inquiry, you would know that your assertion that there were "nine sex attacks" to which Huntley was linked while in our area is incorrect. Your article purports to link the issues that arose from the inspection of our Scunthorpe division by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in 2003 with the issues around Huntley. In fact, he was only resident within the Scunthorpe division area at the time of one allegation with which he was linked. The report to which you refer was published in December 2003 and considerable progress has been made in addressing the criticisms contained in that report since then.John CrosseAssistant chief constable, Humberside Police
