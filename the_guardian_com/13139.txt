Hundreds of schoolchildren had their lessons disrupted yesterday as police hunted for three men, one of whom had threatened an officer with a handgun. Two schools – Blatchington Mill and Hove Park – in Hove, East Sussex, were placed under lockdown and parents were unable to collect their children until the threat level receded. Earlier in the day a policeman encountered three men at a subway in Aldrington train station. One was brandishing a machete and another pulled out a gun and threatened him. The gang fled as the officer took cover. The search for the men was continuing on Thursday night.
