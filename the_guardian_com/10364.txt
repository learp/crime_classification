Dave Lee Travis has appeared at the Old Bailey to face 11 counts of indecent assault and one of sexual assault against nine alleged female victims, aged between 15 and 29.The 68-year-old, who is charged under his real name, David Patrick Griffin, is expected to face trial on 4 March.He has indicated he will plead not guilty to the charges, said to have taken place between 1977 and 2007.At a preliminary hearing the judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, was told the trial was expected to last up to five weeks.Griffin, a former BBC Radio One DJ and Top of the Pops presenter, has denied any wrong-doing ever since he was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in November last year.Wearing a grey suit, white shirt and patterned tie, he stood in the dock to confirm his name. The case was adjourned until 21 October for a plea and case management hearing.He was remanded on bail on condition he lives at his home in Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, and does not contact his alleged victims.Griffin was charged on 15 August as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation prompted by the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, though the accusations made against him have no connection to the disgraced television presenter.
