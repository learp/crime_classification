The veteran BBC broadcaster Stuart Hall assaulted a string of young girls using a series of pretexts to gain access to them, a court has heard.Hall, now 83, attacked one of his victims within moments of her being sick, on her 13th birthday; three were molested while he gave them "elocution lessons"; another after he invited her to sing at a supposed recording session at a BBC studio in Manchester, and another girl attacked after being given a steak dinner and champagne.Hall was in Preston crown court on Monday to be sentenced over 14 historic cases of child sex abuse involving 13 victims.Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court that the broadcaster had carried the 13-year-old to a bathroom, where the mother of another partygoer undressed her. Left alone with his victim, Hall had touched her breasts and then penetrated her with at least one finger.Wright said: "She felt shocked, stunned and paralysed by the events, incapable by reason of her condition and her stressed state to do anything."During the assault, Hall had told her she was "beautiful and gorgeous". He carried on the "frenzied mauling" even after lifting her out of the bath.Hall had asked the girl he assaulted after the steak and champagne dinner "to cuddle him like one of her teddies".When questioned about the assaults at his initial police interview, Hall denied any sexual interest in children, describing his sexuality as "just normal".Asked whether all the girls were lying, he replied: "Well yes. Yes. Dreams and the light imaginings of men."The officer asked Hall whether that was his considered view on the matter. Hall replied: "It is my truthful, considered view of everything. There is a vendetta going on against people in the public eye, and people can come out of the woodwork and say what they want."Asked why he had asked some of the girls to shower prior to elocution lessons in order to "correct their posture", to be measured and to wear very loose upper clothing, he replied: "It's a programme I have devised."The prosecutor said: "The publicity surrounding his arrest led to other complainants having the courage to come forward to disclose what had occurred to them and also in support for those who had already come forward and reported allegations."The motives expressed by these complainants was to demonstrate that the allegations that had been made were neither isolated nor unfounded."
