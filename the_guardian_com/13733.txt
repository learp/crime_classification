A pedestrian group today called for prison sentences for dangerous cycling, after a cyclist who killed a teenager escaped with a fine.Jason Howard, 36, was fined £2,200 yesterday after he was found guilty of dangerous cycling. He hit 17-year-old Rhiannon Bennett, who struck her head on the pavement as she fell and died of her injuries.Her father, Mick Bennett, said the fine was laughable and that Howard should have been tried for manslaughter.Living Streets, a charity that campaigns for pedestrians, said such sentences did not fit the crime. Its chief executive, Tony Armstrong, said: "This punishment is completely disproportionate, it sends out all the wrong signals for cyclists to behave well on our streets."He added: "If people are cycling dangerously I don't understand why they should be treated differently from dangerous driving, if their behaviour results in the same outcome."He pointed out people convicted of dangerous driving can be imprisoned but dangerous cycling only carries a maximum fine of £2,500. "The disincentives to behave well on the road are inadequate," Armstrong said.Living Streets supports government plans to boost cycling, but it says that streets should be made safer for both cyclists and pedestrians.  "Cycling has massively increased, and rightly so, but the level of safety on streets has not. Something has to give.Speaking outside the court yesterday Bennett told the BBC that Howard should have faced manslaughter charges and been jailed for several years.He said: "It's laughable - when we first heard about this we thought it would be manslaughter, or perhaps even murder, but this is Britain."Her mother Maureen told the broadcaster "words cannot express" how upset the family was.Howard, of Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, hit Rhiannon as she walked with friends in Buckingham in April last year. He shouted at the youngsters to "move, because I'm not stopping" but rode into Rhiannon, Aylesbury Magistrates Court heard.The court heard that he could have swerved to avoid the girl but told police he thought a shout would be enough to avoid the collision.Howard was cycling on the road when he approached the group but the court heard conflicting evidence about whether he mounted the kerb at any point during the incident.Sgt Dominic Mahon of Thames Valley Police told the BBC Howard could have been travelling at about 17mph when he struck Rhiannon.He said: "We think Rhiannon was probably a few inches, or a foot, in to the road and then she moved towards the pavement." Commenting to the family's reaction, he said: "It would be almost impossible for them to see this as a proper outcome, considering the loss they've suffered, so I certainly understand how they feel."That's the law as it stands and I think many people would say perhaps that law needs looking at."
