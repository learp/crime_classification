A charity worker who was thrown from the bonnet of his car when he tried to stop a thief has died.Scotland Yard last night launched a murder inquiry into the death of father-of-three Khuynhty Hong, who suffered serious head injuries after being hurled from the car as it sped away.Forensic scientists are examining the grey Honda Civic, which was found not far from where Hong was injured in Streatham, south London.The 38-year-old had left his car engine running outside his house in Abercairn Road, Streatham, last Wednesday morning. When he returned to his car he found a man in the driving seat. Hong leapt on to the bonnet, but the man drove off with him still clinging on. Hong suffered critical injuries after finally being thrown off and died yesterday afternoon in a south London hospital.His wife, Lan, also 38, described him last Friday as a person who always wanted 'to do the right thing'. She added: 'But look where it has got him. It isn't right.'Police renewed their appeal for information to help identify the driver. The suspect is described as black, about 25 years old and is thought to have been wearing a grey cap.
