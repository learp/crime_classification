Jack Straw warned prison officers against further strikes today as he insisted that he would not be "taking a chequebook" to Monday's pay talks.The government is set to meet the Prison Officers' Association following the surprise walkout by around 20,000 workers last month.The justice secretary reaffirmed the stance of Gordon Brown, who told the TUC congress on Monday that there would be "no loss of discipline" in relation to public sector pay awards. Speaking at HMP Preston, on his first visit to a prison since the strike, Mr Straw said that an independent pay review body would determine prison staff salaries and that the government should not give in to pressure to boost wages. "Prison officers cannot just go on strike," he said. "They are officers of the law working to keep people locked up and breaking the law will very seriously undermine their authority." Staff staged a walk out in August in a row over pay despite a legal obligation on the POA not to undertake any industrial action that would disrupt the prison service. The government obtained a high court injunction against the POA but the union refused to call off the action until the Ministry of Justice offered fresh talks. Mr Straw said that the difficulty with the prison service was that many staff stayed in their jobs for a long time and had reached the top end of the salary scale. "I know that many people in the public services feel their pay should be pushed up more but if you look back in the last 20 years their pay has done well," he said. "If we want to lose the great economic success we have had in the last 10 years we give in to these pressures and that does nobody any good." The TUC congress in Brighton yesterday said that full trade union rights should be given to prison staff, including the right to take industrial action.
