The family of a renowned geologist who was arrested on suspicion of his wife's murder said today the couple had intended to kill themselves together.William and Angela Stanton, 79 and 74, had planned to die in a suicide pact because he was severely ill and she could no longer look after him, according to the family. Rather than being separated, they planned to take their own lives together.Angela Stanton was found suffocated at the couple's home in the Somerset village of Westbury-sub-Mendip. William Stanton, who has bone cancer, was arrested on suspicion of murder. He has been released on bail.Today the couple's daughters, Susan, 44, and Jennifer, 48, said in a statement that the strain on their mother of caring for her husband had become "excessive"."They had enjoyed 52 years of very happy marriage together and did not want to live separate, lonely existences, so decided to commit suicide together."Both are atheists. Unfortunately the attempt was only partly successful and her husband lives on, cared for by his daughters."William Stanton is a leading expert on the Mendip Hills, its caves and underground water systems.
