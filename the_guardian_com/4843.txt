The prosecution's case against Sion Jenkins on a charge of murdering his teenage foster daughter Billie-Jo was "not merely inherently improbable but wrong", three appeal judges were told today.Jenkins's counsel, Clare Montgomery QC, said fresh evidence gathered since her client was convicted in 1998 would prove he "not only suffered the tragic loss of a child through murder but has also been wrongly convicted of that murder".She said that two of his natural daughters, Lottie and Annie, who were with him when he discovered the body, had given accounts to the police that effectively precluded his being the murderer. "Indeed their accounts strongly suggested that the murder had been committed by an intruder who had gained access to their home by the back gate," the judges heard.Lottie and Annie were not called as witnesses at the trial because defence lawyers believed they had become hostile to their father but Ms Montgomery claimed fresh evidence confirmed their original accounts "and establishes that their apparent hostility was the product of their mother giving inaccurate information to the police".Jenkins, 46, was jailed for life at Lewis crown court for bludgeoning Billie-Jo, 13, to death with a metal tent spike as she painted a patio door at their home in Hastings, East Sussex, in February 1997.Ms Montgomery told Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Curtis and Mr Justice Wakerley the prosecution secured a conviction partly on the basis of evidence from forensic scientists who said that 150 microscopic spots of blood found on Jenkins's clothes could only have been produced during a frenzied attack on Billie-Jo.But new evidence would show that the blood spots were more likely to have been caused by blood exhaled from the girl's airways as he leant across her stricken body.Lottie, now 18, has travelled to Britain from her new home in Tasmania to give evidence in the court of appeal, and her sister Annie, 20, has made a statement in a video recording seen by the judges. Their mother, Lois, who divorced Jenkins soon after his conviction and moved to Australia with a new partner, is to give evidence opposing the appeal.During the three-week appeal hearing, the judges will also examine evidence that a mentally ill man, referred to as Mr X, who was known to have been in the vicinity when Billie-Jo was killed, had shown signs of having a fixation with pushing pieces of plastic bag up his nose.Billie-Jo had part of a black bin-liner stuffed deeply into one of her nostrils.Jenkins sat in the dock of the court of appeal today to hear Ms Montgomery recall what she described as the "improbable" prosecution case.It was alleged that, during a three-minute visit to the family home on the afternoon of February 15 1997, Jenkins flew into a rage with Billie-Jo, walked past her on the patio - ignoring several potential weapons, including a hammer, on the patio table - and took the tent peg from a fuel bunker near the side gate.Then, it was claimed, he battered her more than 10 times, bending the peg, and pushed part of a plastic bag into her nose before leaving with Lottie and Annie on a shopping trip with no sign of blood or paint on him.There was no evidence of any incident that could have triggered such a "murderous rage", said Ms Montgomery.The far more likely explanation was that Billie-Jo was killed by an intruder who entered through the side gate near where the tent peg was stored.Mr X was eliminated as a suspect when his clothes tested negative for Billie-Jo's blood but the criminal cases review commission, which referred the case back to the court of appeal after detailed re-investigation of the evidence concluded that Mr X did not have a complete alibi for the afternoon of the murder. It was also not clear whether police seized all the clothing he was wearing that day.Ms Montgomery said none of the scientists who said the blood on Jenkins showed he must have been the murderer had "sufficient training, skill or knowledge" to state that conclusion with anything like certainty. She claimed this critical issue was determined "in almost complete ignorance" of the necessary scientific material.The hearing is set to last up to three weeks.
