Those driving licences could have ended up in the hands of people who weren’t qualified, or safe, to drive. And more generally, fake and fraudulently obtained documents help criminals to avoid law enforcement detection and carry on in their criminality.”Cheema, from Pakistan, pleaded guilty to possessing false identity documents with improper intention. It is thought the counterfeit documents were intended for use in Italy, Belgium, Spain, Portugal and Pakistan.
