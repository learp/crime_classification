The family of a couple who were battered to death in their home paid tribute to "the sweetest, kindest people" as they appealed for the public's help to find the killers.In an emotional press conference, the children of Avtar Kolar, 62, and his wife, Carole, 58, said the light had been switched off in their lives with the murder of the couple.The Kolars were found on Wednesday morning by one of their sons, Jason, a detective serving in the West Midlands gang and organised crime unit.Sixty detectives are investigating the double murder. It is understood they are taking seriously suggestions that the killing could be linked to the police officer's work, but at this stage there is no direct evidence of a connection.Tributes were left outside the couple's home in Handsworth Wood on Thursday as officers worked behind a police tent covering the entrance to the detached house.Two of the couple's four children – Michelle Kirwan and another son, also called Avtar – said the light had been "switched out" in their lives.Kirwan, 39, said: "My mum and dad were the sweetest, kindest people that I have ever met and would do anything for anyone."They were the beautiful parents of myself, Jason, Taz and Marie, and the precious nana and grandad of eight grandchildren, who adored them with all their hearts."She struggled with her emotions as she told how the family would meet at "Nanny's" every Friday night, where her mother played bingo and card games with the children."It was noisy and chaotic but we would never miss a week," she said.Her mother worked at her grandchildren's school at a before- and after-school club where she was known as Nanny Cal."She was like the Pied Piper with the children and they adored her," said Kirwan."They would follow her around everywhere and Thursdays was Nanny's special day, where she would bring in sweets for all the children as a reward for being her stars."The couple, who had been married for 40 years, had eight grandchildren.Avtar Kolar – whose own son was born just a week ago – said the whole family was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy."Not only has whoever did this taken two lives, but they have taken away a mother, father, grandad, grandma, brother and sister," he said."The hardest thing anyone could ever do is to tell their children that they will never see Nanny and Grandad again. My baby is one week old and I just don't know where to start."He begged for help in finding his parents' killers, adding: "We are now reaching out to anybody out there who could please, please help."No matter how little or however much they can."Somebody out there knows who did this, so please I beg of you help us catch the person or people who has taken these two most special people away from us."West Midlands police have vowed to work around the clock to find the couple's killers.Detective Superintendent Richard Baker, who is leading the inquiry, said the incident had had a devastating effect on the family.He said forensic examinations of the scene were continuing.Baker said detectives were following a number of lines of inquiry after receiving numerous phone calls in connection with the double murder."We are still investigating the circumstances surrounding this attack; however, this is a very complex investigation and we are continuing to keep an open mind."The results of a postmortem are due on Friday which police said would reveal the nature of the husband and wife's death and what weapon, if any, was used.The couple last spoke to their daughters on the phone at 7.15pm on Tuesday, when they had a conversation about babysitting. The family became worried when they could not reach their parents on Wednesday morning and Jason called around at 8am using his own key and discovered his parents' bodies.At the couple's home on Thursday florists delivered flowers all day. One card on a bouquet of red roses read: "Nanny and grandad, we love you to the moon and back, our life will never be complete again, we adore you, love you forever. Your grandchildren."Another bunch of flowers at the scene came from friends expressing their disbelief and outrage at the killings.The card read: "To Carole and Tari, how could anyone do such a thing to such a lovely and wonderful couple. We are heartbroken, love you loads and miss you loads. Why?"
