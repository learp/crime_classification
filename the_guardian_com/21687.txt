Barry George will not give evidence during his trial for the murder of the television presenter Jill Dando, jurors were told today.Lawyers for George, 48, opened the defence at the Old Bailey by calling a forensic scientist who cast doubt on evidence allegedly linking George to a fibre found on Dando's coat.George denies murdering Dando, who was shot on her doorstep in April 1999.He sat in the dock alongside clinical psychologist Dr Susan Young as his barrister, William Clegg QC, began his case."The defendant Barry George will not be giving evidence but the first witness to be called on his behalf is Roger Robson," Clegg told jurors.Robson, a former Home Office forensic scientist, was asked about his review of tests on a pale blue polyester fibre found on Dando's raincoat.He said he did not agree with another scientist's claim that the fibre provided "weak support" for the prosecution case.Tests comparing it with material from a pair of C&A trousers found at George's address were not able to establish whether or not they matched, he told the court.Robson said even if he did believe there was a match, it would be necessary to rule out other potential sources of the fibre, which could have come from Dando's fiance, Alan Farthing, or anybody else who had been in contact with the raincoat."The fibre could have come from sources other than Mr George's trousers - if the fibre was, in fact, a match," he said."It could come from other suits or trousers within Miss Dando's wardrobe or indeed within Mr Farthing's wardrobe. We simply don't know."Other people could have come into contact with the raincoat in the six to nine hours it lay on the path outside Dando's address following her death, he said.The court was told that the judge was due to sum up in the case next week.The trial continues.
