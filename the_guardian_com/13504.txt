A woman today recalled her "shock and embarrassment" at being flashed on a crowded train by a man she later identified as a senior judge.As she glanced down at the bottom of her newspaper she noticed the "very kind looking" gentleman had exposed himself.The woman spotted the man on four separate occasions on the rush-hour trip from Raynes Park, south-west London, to Waterloo, and later identified him by video as Lord Justice Richards, one of Britain's most senior judges.Sir Stephen Richards, a 56-year-old father of three who sits in the court of appeal, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of exposure.The woman told London's City of Westminster magistrates court that the man who had exposed himself had "boxed" her into a corner, against the glass panels in the first carriage, so that no other passenger could see.She described him as a well-dressed, grey-haired man, aged 55 to 60 years, who was "presentable and looked like a very kind man, which is why initially I thought this was an accident".Recalling the incident on October 16, she told the court: "Because I was embarrassed and nothing like this had happened to me before, I assumed this was an accident. I did not want to draw attention to the situation, to me or to the gentleman, so I carried on reading my paper."Sometimes the gentleman would adjust himself slightly, sometimes his genitals would be exposed and sometimes not as much."The exposure lasted about 15 minutes as the train travelled to Waterloo, the woman claimed. She said the man was wearing a three-quarter-length beige raincoat.Sir Stephen, from Wimbledon, south-west London, is charged with two counts of "intentionally exposing his genitals intending that someone would see them and would be caused alarm or distressed".The woman said she spotted the same man on the same journey a week later, on October 24, moving into a similar position in front of her, but this time the carriage was not as crowded and she became alarmed."My gut instinct then led me to believe this was not an accident. It was the same position as the first incident," she told the court. "He was standing boxing me in at right angles, but not as close."Under her newspaper she looked at his groin area and saw his flies were undone, the court heard.To unnerve him, and to try to take a picture to record what was going on, the woman pulled out her mobile phone and pretended to read a text message.On seeing this, the man moved away to the centre of the carriage.Seeking reassurance that what she had seen was intentional, she called her boyfriend and asked what to do.He told her to report it, which she did the next day, but only after taking two photos on her mobile of the man as he left Waterloo station.In January the woman returned to the same train route, this time accompanied by a police officer. After five minutes she spotted a man who she said had flashed her.Sir Stephen was very cooperative in his police interview, answering questions but stressing that this must be mistaken identity.On being shown a photograph of the raincoat he said: "Yes, but I would not have put it at that colour. I think it is darker than that. It is a mistaken identity. I have committed no such offence."I confess to being a little surprised that three months [later] someone is saying I did it."Sir Stephen had described the allegations against him as "very extraordinary", the arresting officer, Constable Adrian Watts, told the court."It would be a very extraordinary thing to do, to have walked on to a crowded commuter rail service with one's penis hanging out," Sir Stephen told him, he recalled."If that had happened I would have expected somebody to point it out, I would. I simply have to say that what she is alleging, if she is alleging it, is untrue." Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said Sir Stephen exposed himself "for what must be unfathomable reasons".Sir Stephen has overseen a number of high-profile hearings and in January ruled in a high court case brought by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian shot dead by armed police who mistook him for a suicide bomber.He married his wife, Lucy, in January 1976 and has two sons and a daughter.
