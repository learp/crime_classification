Detectives investigating the deliberate contamination of medication at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport have arrested a 46-year-old nurse.The man was arrested under section 23 of the Offences Against the Person Act for allegedly unlawfully or maliciously administering, or causing to be taken by another person, a poison or destructive or noxious thing so as to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm.The arrest came after staff at the hospital reported on 3 January that medical forms had been altered overnight. As a result, it is believed a patient was given additional medication.Police say the man was being questioned in relation to this only.Greater Manchester police said that, at this time, the arrested man was being questioned in relation to these matters only.After an inquiry into the contamination of saline products with insulin last year, it is now believed 20 people were deliberately poisoned, leading to incidents of hypoglycaemia in patients on two wards. Of those poisoned, four people have died. They are Tracey Arden, Arnold Lancaster and Derek Weaver were named, while the identity of the fourth patient, an 82-year-old man who died on New Year's Eve, has not been disclosed.Investigations to establish any link to the poisoning are continuing.Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney said: "This is, and always has been, a search for the truth."It is due to the diligence of staff at the hospital that we were made aware about the potential tampering of medical records, and everyone should be reassured that – like the hospital – we initiated a swift response and have consequently arrested a member of staff in relation to this matter."I must stress that, at this time, he is only being spoken to in relation to these matters and we cannot rule out making further arrests." I cannot stress enough just how complex an investigation this is, and one that we continue to commit significant resources to."Sweeney said relatives of the victims and the public continued to seek answers, "and we are working as quickly as we can to provide them without jeopardising the quality or integrity of the investigation".He added that he could not go into detail about the ongoing work, but thanked hospital staff for their continued support and
