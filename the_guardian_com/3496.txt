A frail elderly woman and her adopted daughter were murdered soon after making a 999 call begging for urgent help at their remote country home.Tapes of the emergency telephone call, in which a distressed woman's voice is heard before the link is cut, were being examined by detectives yesterday as they hunted the killers of Iris Jones, 78, and Mandy Joseph, 34.Their bodies were discovered by police who arrived at Mrs Jones's home, Icliff, in Hockliffe, near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, minutes after the call came through on Sunday night.Police said the women had been subjected to "extreme violence", but refused to confirm that they had been shot at point-blank range.Partially blind and suffering from heart problems and diabetes, Mrs Jones was a widow who rarely went out and relied on Ms Joseph to look after her, according to neighbours.As a cordon was thrown around the house and adjoining land yesterday, the double murder resonated around Hockliffe, a village of 700.Police said the news of the double killing had been broken to family members, including Mrs Jones's son, Brian, who lives in the nearby village of Stanbridge.Married with children, he was a regular visitor to his mother's house and ran a classic car workshop from an outbuilding linked to the property. As well as the house and workshop, he and his mother also owned an adjoining petrol station, which was set up by his late father 30 years ago.Neighbours said Mrs Jones had fostered several children and had adopted Ms Joseph when she was four.Graham Adamson, 56, who leased the petrol station from Mr Jones and his mother, said Ms Joseph spent a great deal of her time looking after her mother.She also worked at a residential home in Leagrave near Luton.He said: "Mandy ... would not do any harm to a fly. She always made sure her mother was fine and needed nothing."She had not really had a life because she had been caring for her mother all the time," he said.Ms Joseph was last seen at around 3.30pm on Sunday when she went into the petrol station shop to buy cigarettes, lighter fuel and kindling for the fire.Denise Krzywopulski, 30, who was the cashier on duty, said she remembered Ms Joseph coming to buy her mother's distinctive cigarettes. "The old lady always smoked Raffle Lites. We were laughing and joking when she was in the shop. She only stayed a few minutes, bought the items and then went."She just said, 'I'll see you later', and she got back in her car on the forecourt and went up to the house."CCTV footage from the station forecourt was being examined by police yesterday as detectives appealed for anyone who had noticed anything out of character in the village at around 7pm on Sunday to contact them.At 7.44pm, one of the women made the 999 call. She reached the BT operator who heard a woman's distressed voice and put the call through to the police operator immediately."When the police operator picked up the call it had been cut off," said a police spokeswoman, who confirmed the call had been made from Icliff.Minutes later police arrived at the house, which is set back from the road down a gravel track, behind the petrol station and Mr Jones's car workshop.After entering the property they called for armed support.Paramedics were told to remain on standby for half an hour while officers checked whether it was safe to enter. An ambulance spokesman said: "A paramedic went into the house with them but it was obvious that there was nothing that could be done to save the two women."The results of a postmortem examination were expected today.Two men and a woman were being questioned in connection with the murders last night after being arrested by a separate police force.
