Lord Woolf, Britain's most senior judge, is expected to warn David Blunkett next week of the long-term impact on prison numbers of his plans to increase jail terms for murderers.The lord chief justice is also to criticise the home secretary's plans to introduce "life means life" sentences for terrorists and child killers during the House of Lords second reading debate on Monday of his criminal justice bill . Lord Woolf is expected to voice unease at the plan to disclose defendants' previous convictions to juries, arguing that it is important courts try the facts of a case. But the judge, who had a "friendly meeting" with the home secretary yesterday, is expected to support plans to abolish the "double jeopardy" rule for murder and other serious crimes, and to back many of Mr Blunkett's reforms.
