A man who was left a mental wreck after an overdose of drugs prescribed by the serial killer Harold Shipman yesterday received Â£225,000 compensation.Lawyers for the Medical Defence Union, representing Shipman who was jailed for life last month for the murder of 15 women patients, admitted he had been negligent in prescribing Derek Webb 2 times the amount of Epilim he needed to control his epilepsy. Mr Justice Penry-Davy, sitting at the high court in Manchester, heard that Mr Webb, 58, who had epilepsy from infancy and a psychotic illness, could have died after taking the equivalent of 76 tablets in 7 days. Michael Redfern QC said Mr Webb had lived in a semi-independent state with his partner, who was also mentally handicapped, in Hyde, Greater Manchester. He had been a patient of Shipman's and was on a repeat prescription of 200mg of Epilim. In November 1989 Shipman increased this to 500mg. Four weeks later Mr Webb's sister, Jean Wood, who cared for him, arrived back from holiday to find him in a "disastrous condition", Mr Redfern said. Mr Webb was covered in excreta, had pressure sores and broken skin on his abdomen, was unable to walk, and was having seizures. On admission to hospital, he was found to be dehydrated and malnourished and had paranoid delusions. Mr Webb was left with additional brain damage and increased cognitive impairment. He was placed in a nursing home but when an investigation was launched into the death of Shipman's patients, Mrs Wood reported the matter to the police. Mr Redfern said: There was no evidence other than that this was a one-off act of negligence."
