Burglars who steal items of ­sentimental value or target vulnerable people may receive tougher sentences after the lord chief justice called yesterday for ­punishments to reflect the anguish caused to victims of break-ins. Lord Igor Judge urged courts to mete out stiffer punishments and reassert the principle "our homes should be our castles"."Something precious is violated by ­burglary of a home and those who perpetrate this crime should be sentenced and punished accordingly," he said. "The principle which must be grasped is that when we speak of dwelling house burglary we are considering not only an offence against property, which it is, but also, and often more alarmingly and distressingly, an offence against the person."Although 280,000 domestic burglaries were recorded last year in England and Wales, offences have fallen from a peak in the mid-1990s.Judge's comments came during a court of appeal hearing of six sentences brought by burglars convicted of separate offences. All six appeals were rejected by a panel of three senior judges, paving the way for Judge's comments.In one of the cases, a heroin addict, Rebecca Saw, broke into the home of a young couple and their baby in Boston, Lincolnshire, and stole the couple's car and also a scan photograph of the baby in the womb. The mother suffered panic attacks after the burglary and moved to her mother's home, fearing for her child's safety.Another of the sentences upheld by the court yesterday was a five-year term imposed on defendant Colin McPhee at Teesside crown court for burgling the home of a disabled and housebound 89-year-old man in Middlesbrough in the middle of the night.Judge acknowledged that the sentence was severe, but it was not "manifestly excessive" because of the considerable impact on the victim."Whether or not the burglar has any specific intention to cause harm, he runs the risk that the victim or victims may suffer serious adverse consequences," he said. "Where this happens, sentences should be reflective even of unintended consequences. Where goods of slight economic but significant sentimental value are taken or damaged, the impact on the victim is likely to be high, not least because these objects are irreplaceable. "A photograph is worth nothing, except to the person who owns it. But it may be the only image left of grandparents or now deceased parents."The judgment aims to create a consistent approach to burglary offences across the country.
