I am grateful for the opportunity to raise awareness of the charity Pace of which I have recently become a patron, in Society (August 4). As is clear from that article, I am justifiably proud to be a member of the Metropolitan police service and pleased to hold such an important position within the organisation, a rank that I never thought I would achieve (Paddick: I've been promoted into a non-job, August 4). My current role is both challenging and important and I have made clear I am happy to continue in this post, which significantly contributes to the effectiveness of the MPS. I want to state for the record that I am committed to continuing with my police career.Brian PaddickDeputy assistant commissioner, Metropolitan police
