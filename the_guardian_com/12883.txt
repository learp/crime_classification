A Canadian software technician was convicted yesterday of participating in an Islamist terrorist plot to bomb a string of targets in Britain, including the Ministry of Sound nightclub and the Bluewater shopping centre. Momin Khawaja was the first person to be charged under Canada's anti-terror laws introduced after the September 11 attacks. He was found guilty in Toronto of five charges of financing and facilitating terrorism and two criminal offences which involved building a remote-controlled detonator that investigators said would be used in bomb attacks in Britain.The Pakistani-born Canadian was accused of collaborating with a group of British Muslims led by Omar Khyam, from Crawley, West Sussex. Khyam and four others were jailed for life in Britain last year for plotting attacks on the London club, Bluewater and gas pipelines, using 600kg of ammonium nitrate fertiliser. The prosecution's star witness, Mohammed Babar, a former al-Qaida operative turned police informant, testified that Khawaja attended a training camp in Pakistan in 2003. He also claimed Khawaja acted as a courier to deliver money and supplies and discussed potential targets.Khawaja was arrested in 2004 after a raid coordinated with Britain's biggest counter-terrorist operation for decades. When Royal Canadian mounted police raided his family's home in the Ottawa suburb of Orleans, they found a half-built detonator lying around, and firearms and a bayonet under his bed.Eighteen other people were arrested the next day in raids across south-east England, though not all were prosecuted. Khawaja travelled to Britain to meet those involved in the fertiliser bomb plot.He was watched by police and the security services as he flew into Heathrow, drove with the gang to an internet cafe and showed them an image of the device that was needed to trigger the bomb.One intercepted message from Khyam to Khawaja referred to the detonator.He told Khawaja in Canada: "k bro don't worry we'll be there to pick u up, about the device its better we leave it wil explain later we will discuss it and maybe show pics at most, see ya soon nigga we'll talk about the chicks when you get here nigga."Although Khawaja was found guilty of criminal offences related to the building of the remote-controlled detonator, Justice Douglas Rutherford acquitted him of terrorist offences relating to it. He said there was insufficient proof that Khawaja knew that it was to be used in a British fertiliser bomb attack.
