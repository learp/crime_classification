 Two prisoners ran an international cocaine ring from their jail cells in England and Panama, a court heard today.George Moon, who led the operation from behind bars in a Doncaster jail, was jailed for 18 years after admitting importing cocaine from South America in packages delivered by Royal Mail, DHL and TNT.The 62-year-old, who had already been jailed three times for drugs offences, used a mobile phone in HMP Lindholme to contact Leo Morgan, from Birmingham, who was in Panama's El Renacer prison last year, Liverpool crown court heard.The pair orchestrated between two and three kilos' worth of cocaine with a street value of about £300,000 to be smuggled into England and Ireland.Jailing Moon, of Liverpool, the judge, Bryn Holloway, said: "There are a number of most unusual features about this case."The first was that from this end the operation was being run by you, George Moon, while actively serving a 14-year sentence imposed in 2003 for being involved in earlier importations of cocaine."You had already served five and six-year sentences, this is your fourth sentence. You were able, while a prisoner, to access mobile phones."With the support of assistants outside you were able to run this importation by being in regular contact with them and with people in South America and Ireland while looking after this conspiracy to achieve its objectives."An even more extraordinary fact was the South America end of this conspiracy was being run by an Englishman who was, at the time, a prisoner in Panama serving a sentence or awaiting trial."It "beggared belief" said the judge, adding: "The fact you were able to do that in an English prison raises questions over the levels of supervision and control over you."Morgan received phone calls on a smuggled mobile and then used contacts in Latin America to arrange the consignments.They were posted to addresses in Cork, Ireland, and then brought into the UK by gang members.The packages were made up to look as though they contained "engineering" parts, the court heard. The packages bound for England were sent to addresses linked to Moon's gang but addressed to people who did not live there.The Irish parcels were addressed to one of three bogus companies – Ryan Pat Engineering, Angel Toys and FDFC Foods. Using a false name, Moon pretended he wanted to rent storage space from a landlord in Ireland, whom he convinced to accept deliveries for him.These were then collected by criminal associates.Moon's plot began to unravel in May last year when Lee Standeven, 24, of Widnes, Cheshire, posted him a parcel of heroin and mobile sim cards.Prison guards were suspicious that the A4 envelope had a Ministry of Justice emblem stamped on it – but that it was sent from Cheshire with three stamps rather than being franked. A sniffer dog indicated it contained drugs.When Moon's cell was raided his notebook containing phone numbers and gang members' details helped police crack the case.Standeven was jailed for five years after admitting supplying Moon heroin and contraband sim cards.Anthony Parry, 39, of Woolton, Liverpool, was Moon's righthand man. He admitted conspiring to import cocaine and was jailed for eight years.Bilaal Khan, 27, of Bradford, who admitted the same charge, was also jailed for eight years.Harminder Singh, 25, of West Yorkshire, admitted the same charge and was jailed for five years.Abid Latif Hussain, 22, of Bradford, was also jailed for five years after admitting importing drugs.
