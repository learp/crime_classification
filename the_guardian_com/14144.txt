A man has been arrested for shining a laser pen at a Metropolitan police helicopter in south-east London.The 46-year-old was arrested in Orpington early on Tuesday morning after the helicopter crew used video equipment to trace the source of the beam.Police officers on the ground were directed to an address in St Paul's Cray, where the man was arrested. A laser pen was recovered from the home.The man was taken to a south London police station, where he admitted the offence and was given a police caution for endangering the safety of an aircraft.The incident came amid speculation that Friday night's helicopter disaster in Glasgow could have been caused by a similar incident. Investigators examining the crash, which killed nine people, have not ruled out the possibility that the pilot was distracted by a laser pen shone from the ground. A spokesman for Police Scotland said investigators will "retain an open mind'".Charles Newport, a consultant for Aviation Network Associates, said a laser attack could have caused the crash. Speaking to the Scotsman he said: "The aircraft could have been flying too low and the pilot could have become disorientated. He could have been blinded by a laser. To me, it seems to be a catastrophe of some sort, unless the pilot had a heart attack.The Civil Aviation Authority is running a campaign against what it calls "laser louts" after finding a significant rise in the number of pilots being distracted in flight.Bob Jones, head of flight operations at the CAA, said: "We strongly urge anyone who sees a laser being used against aircraft in their local area to contact the police immediately. These things are not toys, they pose a serious risk to all flight safety."In 2010 a law was introduced to make the shining of a laser at an aircraft in flight a criminal offence. Those caught can also be charged with the more serious offence of recklessly endangering an aircraft, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
