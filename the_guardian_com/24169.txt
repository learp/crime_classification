A Cornish seaside resort popular with public school "snob yobs" has introduced a ban on outdoor drinking because of vandalism and all-night noisy parties.North Cornwall district council yesterday said the bylaw had been passed to prevent people drinking in public in Rock. Anyone who continues drinking after being warned by police could be fined up to Â£500.The area is popular for surfing and is especially crowded in the weeks leading up to publication of GCSE and A-level results. Tyrrell Sandry, a district councillor who lives in Rock, said it was a situation that could not be allowed to continue. "The big problem is when 30 or 40 of them congregate across the road. These children are aged from about 13 and they are having drink they are not accustomed to, so they tend to behave differently."They are nice enough kids when you met them on their own, but people are different in groups." Paul Tyler, Liberal Democrat MP for North Cornwall, who had highlighted problems caused by vandalism and all-night noisy parties, said he supported the bylaw. But he added: "It is only part of a larger package. The snob yobs have spread all along this bit of the coast right along to Daymer Bay and Polzeath. It is impossible to police an alcohol ban all along these beaches. "It is quite unacceptable that people, simply because they go to a posh school, think they can destroy people's boats and fences for a beach bonfire. We have to get through to the parents they have to take more responsibility."Dropping 11- and 12-year-olds off at the beach with a stash of alcohol for all-night parties is totally unacceptable. They would complain bitterly if people from another social stratum started doing it elsewhere." Press Association
