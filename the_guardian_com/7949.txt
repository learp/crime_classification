Witnesses to the killing of a schizophrenic man shot by police marksmen have been asked to help officers investigating his death.Police Complaints Authority member Molly Meacher, who is supervising the investigation into the death of Andrew Kernan, met his family yesterday to discuss the inquiry. She said that the investigation team wanted to talk to a number of people who saw Mr Kernan being shot twice in the chest while brandishing a samurai sword in Wavertree, Liverpool, on Thursday night. "His mum was extraordinarily resilient. She's very, very angry," said Ms Meacher. "But we had a very friendly and important meeting. The family were able to talk about exactly what their concerns are." The family have criticised the actions of the police and yesterday asked for a second pathologist to examine the details of his autopsy. Police were called to the flat Mr Kernan, 37, shared with his mother after she and psychiatric workers became concerned about his behaviour. Six officers arrived but Mr Kernan escaped in his pyjamas with the sword and tried to force his way into the nearby Wellington pub. Home secretary David Blunkett was "horrified" by the shooting and has brought forward plans to arm police with tranquilliser guns, it was reported yesterday.
