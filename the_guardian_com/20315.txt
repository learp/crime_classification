A man who smothered and strangled his mother has been jailed for 13 years, police said today.Robert Archbold, 49, said he got into a row with retired vet Jane Archbold, 77, at their home in Ambleside, Cumbria, and put his hand over her mouth "to shut her up".He admitted her unlawful killing on the grounds of diminished responsibility but had denied murder in a trial at Preston crown court.Archbold, known to family and friends as Adam, was arrested in nearby woodland about three hours after the killing at Old Farm Cottage in Outgate on 22 August last year.He told a police officer: "I have a done a terrible thing, I have killed my mother." He went on to say to detectives: "My mother made me do it. She kept on saying 'Kill, kill', so I did."A postmortem examination showed that Mrs Archbold had 15 abrasions to her head and face, which were consistent with being smothered.Following Archbold's sentencing for manslaughter after he was cleared of murder, Detective Chief Inspector Bob Qazi said: "Archbold admitted from the beginning that he had killed his mother."It appeared that he had a lot of personal issues and he assaulted her, which resulted in her death from asphyxiation."This has been a tragic case for all those involved and our thoughts are with the family of Mrs Archbold."
