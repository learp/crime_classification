The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs is right to be concerned about the seriousness of drug-facilitated sexual assault (New evidence on date rape prompts call for drugs ban, April 3). However, by focusing on the behaviour of the victim when giving suggestions on how risk can be reduced, for example in advising women not to go out alone, we risk missing the bigger picture. The focus of prevention work must be on changing the behaviour of perpetrators of sexual assault, not its victims. Women should be safe to go to clubs, pubs or parties without being at risk of sexual assault - anything else will be an admission of failure.Jon CollinsSenior policy officer, Fawcett Society
