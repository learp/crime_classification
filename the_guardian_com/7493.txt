The criminal age of responsibility should be lifted from 10 to 12, according to the head of one of the UK's most influential children's charities.In comments that will cause a furious debate about the age at which children should be held legally accountable for their actions, Martin Narey, chief executive of Barnardo's and a former director general of the Prison Service, said the justice system failed to acknowledge that the vast majority of early criminality was attributable to bad parenting.Narey said the criminal age of responsibility should be lifted for all crimes with the exception of murder, rape and aggravated sexual assault. Children under 12 convicted of all other crimes, he suggested, must be subjected – along with their parents and possibly their siblings – to family intervention projects, intensive supervision programmes that are designed to force them to face up to their behaviour and take responsibility for their actions.Raising the minimum-age level for criminal actions would bring the UK into line with other countries, including Ireland, but is likely to bring a fierce response from victims' rights groups.There was an outcry in 2006 when David Cameron appeared to take a softer line in what was dubbed by critics as his "hug a hoodie" speech. Cameron declared: "We can punish young offenders all we like, but if we don't tackle the causes of crime we'll never have a safer society."In a report to be published tomorrow – From Playground to Prison: The Case for Reviewing the Age of Criminal Responsibility – Narey attacks the current system for creating a "conveyor belt of crime" and claims that the time is right for the justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, to heed growing calls for a change.Studies show that 68% of young children given a community sentence order go on to reoffend. According to Barnardo's, a third of children under 15 who are in custody were 10 or 11 when they were first convicted."We are calling for a change not because we think children who commit these offences are angels, but because there are much more effective ways of dealing with early criminality," Narey said. "Taking a little boy and putting him in court and punishing him rather than addressing issues around the family is transparently ludicrous."Narey said independent evaluations of family intervention projects showed they worked well. He highlighted figures suggesting that they result in a 64% reduction in antisocial behaviour, a 58% reduction in truancy and a 45% reduction in substance misuse.Lifting the minimum age of criminal responsibility would have significant consequences for thousands of children and their families. In 2008, the most recent year for which figures are available, 5,671 children aged 10 and 11 received some form of youth justice disposal – a custodial or community sentence, pre-court reprimand or final warning. Only three children under the age of 12 were placed in custody, while 661 were convicted in the courts for crimes not considered serious enough to warrant custody.
