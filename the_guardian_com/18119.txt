Two men arrested under anti-terror laws in Blackburn after they reportedly received deliveries of propane gas are now being questioned on suspicion of operating a cannabis factory, police said today.Officers raided a unit at an industrial estate yesterday after receiving tip-offs that the two men had taken a delivery of gas, prompting fears they could be linked to the recent attempted car bombings in London and Glasgow, which involved gas canisters.Lancashire police said today that the pair were now not being held under the Terrorism Act, but on suspicion of growing cannabis.A spokesman said the use of terror laws to make the arrests had been seen as "necessary under the circumstances".The raid was launched after a member of the public became concerned about the activities of the two men at the Furthergate industrial estate. Witnesses reported seeing a delivery driver arrive at a unit with gas canisters shortly before the men arrived. Police arrived and arrested the men under anti-terror laws. Immediately afterwards, another consignment of gas arrived.After a search of the unit, "police can now confirm that the premises would appear to have been used to cultivate cannabis", the police spokesman said."The two men in custody are now being held on suspicion of offences under the Drugs Act, and are not being dealt with under terrorism legislation." The spokesman said the police recognised this was "a very sensitive, and often difficult time for all communities", and asked people to stay vigilant.
