Four members of the gang that stole a "king's ransom" in Britain's biggest cash robbery were today sentenced to a minimum of 15 years.The trial judge, Mr Justice Penry-Davey, told the gang they had taken part in "organised banditry for uniquely high stakes".Police are still trying to trace more than half the £53m that was stolen in a raid on a Securitas depot in Tonbridge, Kent, almost two years ago.The gang kidnapped the manager, Colin Dixon, his wife, Lynn, and their young child, using them to gain entry to the depot.They also used information provided by an inside man, Emir Hysenaj, to plan the raid on the Bank of England cash store. Hysenaj filmed inside the building using a hi-tech miniature video camera, no bigger than a 50p coin, fixed to his belt.Lea Rusha, a 35-year-old former roofer of Southborough, Kent, car salesman Stuart Royle, 49, of Maidstone, Kent; unemployed Jetmir Bucpapa, 26, of Tonbridge and 30-year-old garage owner Roger Coutts, of Welling, south-east London, were all given indeterminate sentences and told they should serve a minimum of 15 years.Hysenaj, a 28-year-old Post Office worker of Crowborough, East Sussex, was given a determinate sentence of 20 years, meaning he may be eligible for parole after 10.The judge recommended that Bucpapa and Hysenaj, both Albanians, be deported on release from prison.All the men were convicted yesterday on charges of conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to rob and conspiracy to possess firearms.At least one, and possibly two, further trials connected to the case will follow this year, although one defendant is resisting attempts to extradite him from overseas.Police are also continuing efforts to find an unrecovered £32m, much of it believed to be in north Africa and northern Cyprus."This is not the end of the matter for these criminals," Nigel Pilkington, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said after yesterday's convictions. "We intend to seize their ill-gotten gains, wherever they may be."The judge said the Securitas raid had been "meticulously prepared" and "ruthlessly executed"."From an early stage, the plot included the kidnapping and holding hostage of Colin Dixon, his wife and young child," he added."Once you were inside, heavily disguised and heavily armed, all those inside, going about their lawful business, were violently threatened and trussed up before being locked into cages and abandoned."On the night of the hold-up, the robbers tied up 14 terrified employees with cable ties, threatening to kill them if they disobeyed orders.CCTV pictures seen by Old Bailey jurors showed the gang loading cages, black holdalls and bundles of £20 notes into the back of a 7.5-ton Renault lorry during the 66-minute raid, which happened on an early morning in February 2006.The robbers had to leave £153m behind because they could not fit any more cash into the vehicle. Police have since recovered £21m from a series of locations around Kent and south-east London.Rusha was at the heart of the conspiracy, being one of the robbers and also one of the two-man kidnap team that seized the Dixons.A jury of seven women and three men found him guilty of conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to rob and conspiracy to possess firearms.Sir John Nutting QC, prosecuting, told jurors the men were inspired by the lure of "luxury, ease and idleness" and were prepared to target the "innocent and vulnerable" to achieve it.Michelle Hogg, a hairdresser who disguised some of the robbers using theatrical prosthetic make-up, proved to be their undoing in court.The 33-year-old, who began the trial in the dock alongside the other defendants, was cleared after agreeing to give evidence against them. Now under the witness protection scheme, she told the court she was living in fear.The Securitas raid was, by some distance, Britain's biggest cash robbery, easily surpassing the £26.5m stolen from Belfast's Northern Bank in November 2004.Investigators first thought the haul was no more than £1m but, as the true picture began to emerge, were stunned by "sheer scale and audacity" of it.
