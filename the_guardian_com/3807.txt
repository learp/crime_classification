Children as young as13 are behaving with extreme physical and verbal violence towards their parents, according to new statistics from the national helpline, Parentline Plus.Almost 1,200 calls were made to the charity in the past year by parents suffering abuse from their children. Most of the violence was perpetrated by children aged 13-15. Daughters were more likely to be aggressors than sons.Jeremy Todd, chief executive of the charity and the survey's author, said: "It happens – we know that – but we didn't know how common it was because no one talks about it."One mother told the helpline that she was afraid to be alone in the house with her 15-year-old son after he attacked her when his laptop and phone were confiscated.Another parent said that she "lives in fear" of her 14-year-old daughter. "One minute we can be sitting down watching television, the next she flies out of her seat, switches off the telly and launches into a torrent of abuse."Todd said that there was not always an obvious reason for the violence: mental health problems were identified in 23% of cases and parental divorce was an issue in 20% of cases. Drugs and bullying of the child by others were issues in about 10% of phone calls.
