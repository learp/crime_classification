A jury will hear the case of a retired army captain who is suing a police force he claims made him stand by while his 16th-century house went up in flames, a judge ruled today.Captain Edmund Carlisle and his wife, Rosemary, have taken out civil proceedings against Dyfed-Powys police following a blaze at their home in mid-Wales on November 14 2002, at the height of the firefighters' strike.The property in Llanigon, near Hay-on-Wye, was so badly damaged that the couple still live in a nearby bungalow while renovation work is being completed.Capt Carlisle, 84, claims that on the night of the fire officers assaulted him, arrested him and then detained him in the back of a police van as he tried to rescue valuables before the fire, which started in the boiler room, spread to the main building.The force applied to have the case struck out, but this move was rejected by a judge at the high court in Cardiff today.Judge Crispin Masterman decided that the allegations of wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and negligent prevention of the rescue of house contents should be heard before a jury.The judge did, however, strike out Capt Carlisle's accusations that Dyfed-Powys police trespassed on his property, failed to notify the Hay fire service about the blaze immediately and victimised him on previous occasions.The judge also ruled that Dyfed-Powys police and Capt Carlisle should pay their own costs for this stage of the proceedings.Capt Carlisle's barrister, Michael Arnheim, has until August 4 to appeal against the judge's decision.The jury trial is expected to be at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court at a date yet to be fixed.After today's hearing, a spokeswoman for Dyfed-Powys police said: "The result of the hearing is only one stage of the process of dealing with the civil claim instituted by the claimants. The chief constable continues to defend these proceedings and the allegations made against the officers in this case."
