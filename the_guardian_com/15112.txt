The home secretary, Charles Clarke, yesterday announced new plans to reduce the number of police forces in England and Wales from 43 to 24.His latest proposals will create regional "superforces" in the east Midlands and East Anglia and merge forces around London and in the south of England. They also show that Mr Clarke has rejected a warning from Downing Street that the mergers would be a "costly distraction".The proposals published yesterday will mean that separate forces will disappear in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. They will merge to form a new East Midlands force with 9,438 officers, the third largest in the country.The forces in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk will amalgamate to form an East Anglian "superforce".Bedfordshire will join Hertfordshire and Essex police in a new regional force. Surrey and Sussex police will also merge. Only Kent, Hampshire and the Thames Valley forces have won a reprieve.Earlier this month the home secretary announced his plans to create a single police force in Wales, and published his proposals for forces in the north-east, north-west and the west Midlands. He will make a third announcement on the future of policing in Yorkshire, the Humber and the south-west shortly.The decision to press ahead with police mergers follows a report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary which concluded that small forces were not up to the job of tackling terrorism and serious crime.The proposed mergers have proved highly controversial in the run-up to the May local elections with the Association of Police Authorities claiming Mr Clarke had "bribed" forces to get police chiefs to back the plans.The home secretary revealed in the Commons yesterday that he pressed ahead with the scheme despite a warning in a joint Home Office-Downing Street strategy unit report that mergers would prove costly and disruptive."I'm sure you will be surprised to hear that I regard the considered view of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary on policing with greater weight than the prime minister's delivery unit, however expert it may be," Mr Clarke said, adding that the Downing Street unit would not claim to be able to do as rigorous an assessment as the inspectorate.Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives protested strongly at the plans.Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said local communities would be expected to pay the extra costs of the mergers while having less say in how their forces were run.The Tory police spokesman, Nick Herbert, said the unpublished Downing Street report reinforced their view that improving and extending cooperation between forces would be a more effective way to fight crime and terrorism than unwanted mergers.The Downing Street report, completed a year ago, warned that mergers "could be a costly, protracted exercise which does not always deliver expected benefits and inevitably causes distraction for management and staff".
