The parents of missing Madeleine McCann could return home in a few weeks because they fear increasingly aggressive attention from the Portuguese paparazzi is upsetting their twins.According to friends of the family, Kate, below, and Gerry McCann have been left feeling 'isolated and bruised' by a series of false allegations in the local media that they were involved in the disappearance of their four-year-old daughter 108 days ago.They are also concerned that intrusive attempts by the media to cover the story are interrupting the daily family routine that they believe is the key to creating stability and calm for their two-year-old twins, Amelie and Sean.Friends told how, at one point, the attention became so intrusive that the twins had to be withdrawn from their creche to avoid a media siege.
