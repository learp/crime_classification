A man was jailed for life today for a series of rapes and sexual attacks against girls and young women, many of which could have been prevented but for a DNA blunder by police.Mark Campbell, a 38-year-old welder from Chichester, West Sussex, was convicted of four counts of indecent assault, two counts of false imprisonment, three counts of rape, one count of attempted indecent assault, one count of sexual assault and two counts of burglary.Six of the offences took place after Sussex police failed to take action on a DNA sample taken from Campbell.Chichester crown court heard that Campbell gave a DNA sample to police in 2002, after he was arrested on suspicion of a peeping Tom offence. The sample was not sent off for analysis but left in a freezer in Bognor police station. This meant he was not linked to a series of sex attacks in the West Sussex area given the police codename Operation Bobcat.Instead Campbell, labelled the Thursday Night Rapist because that was when he usually struck, was released without charge and went on to commit a further six offences including two rapes on teenage girls.Following today's ruling Sussex police apologised for the mistake and said two members of staff had been disciplined. Campbell's DNA sample was eventually found in September 2006 during an internal crime review by Sussex police and a match was made to the Bobcat offences.He was arrested and charged the following month.Sussex police assistant chief constable Jeremy Paine said an internal investigation had been carried out and a senior police officer and a member of police staff had received "formal words of advice".He added: "There are no excuses. Having taken this particular sample, we didn't send it off for processing. That had consequences in that Campbell was at large for four years longer than he should have been."It should not have happened and we are very sorry that it did."He said that, within 48 hours of the DNA match being established, Campbell was rearrested, initially charged with three offences and has remained in custody since.The four-week trial heard that Campbell preyed on vulnerable girls and young women either in their homes or isolated outdoor spots.He first struck in February 1998 when he indecently assaulted a 27-year-old woman in Bognor Regis after breaking into her home while her three young children slept upstairs.Campbell's other offences included the rape of a 21-year-old hotel worker at her workplace and an attempted indecent assault on a Czech au pair.Finally, in August 2004, with his pattern of offending increasing in severity and frequency, he raped a 15-year-old girl whom he had befriended.Judge William Wood QC said Campbell would have to serve at least 10 years before he became eligible for parole."It is difficult to exaggerate the degree of harm done. In each case the victim has been profoundly affected by the trauma," he said.The judge added that some victims would be "looking over their shoulders for the rest of their lives".
