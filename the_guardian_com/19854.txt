Scotland Yard has arrested one of its own royal protection officers after ammunition was discovered in police lockers in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.The officer, who is believed to be authorised to carry firearms, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and unlawful possession of ammunition.Embarrassed police chiefs told palace officials of the news, which follows a series of concerns about Metropolitan police protection squads, which are due to be reformed.The arrest came after ammunition was found in a building used by officers guarding the royal family. Police said: “the ammunition found was believed to be from the Met’s own supplies.”The investigation began four weeks ago after royal protection officers reported finding ammunition in lockers they were using in the police building, and in their belongings. Armed police officers are expected to account for all ammunition they are issued with.Police did not say if the ammunition was individual bullets or clips which would usually be loaded with multiple rounds.The incident is being investigated by the Met’s directorate of professional standards. While the discovery counts as a breach of protocol if not security, there is no suggestion of any link to terrorism.The Met said the officer did not guard a specific member of the royal family but would not say if he had done so in the past.The officer – from SO14, responsible for protecting the royal household – was in custody on Thursday night and facing questions under criminal caution. The Met said he had been suspended from duty pending the investigation. His home and the police building have been searched.The Met said: “The officer arrested is from the unit responsible for protecting the royal household (SO14) and normally works in a protection role, although he is not assigned to guard any individual member of the royal family.“Established security procedures are unaffected by the investigation, which does not affect the daily work of the officers providing personal protection to the royal family. These units include some of the most highly trained and professional officers in the Met. They recognise the great responsibility their roles carry, and the privilege that goes with these positions.”Last week the Met announced reforms of the protection units that guard the royal family as well as Downing Street and top politicians.Met Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said unacceptable “pockets of behaviour” had built up among officers who had spent too long in their posts and would be broken.Rowley, head of specialist operations, said having people stay in the same role for years on end could lead to a “separate culture developing”. He said only a minority of protection officers had misbehaved.Previously Scotland Yard has been embarrassed by allegations that officers at Buckingham Palace stole items confiscated from the visiting public. This is currently under investigation.The Met said the officer arrested was not connected to the diplomatic protection group, the unit that came into disrepute over the“Plebgate” affair. That saga led to the sacking of four officers for leaking details of then cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell’s clash with a police guard at the gates of No 10 Downing Street.Police said they had informed their watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, of the arrest.
