Detectives were today questioning six teenagers after a father was killed after tackling vandals outside his home.Police have launched a murder inquiry following the fatal attack on Garry Newlove, 47, in Warrington, Cheshire, on Friday night. Six youths, aged 15 to 19, are in custody.The father of three is understood to have gone outside his home, in Station Road North, to tackle up to eight youths, who may have been vandalising his car.He was rushed to Warrington general hospital following the incident, which happened at around 10.45pm, but died at 2pm yesterday with his family at his bedside."Additional patrols are now working in the community and officers are keen to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the incident," a police spokeswoman said. "Investigating officers say the assault does not form any part of a pattern."Local residents said the street, in the Fernhead area of Warrington, had been plagued by anti-social behaviour for years.It is unclear what sparked the fatal confrontation, but some neighbours said the youths had been damaging Mr Newlove's car, adding that there was broken glass in the road outside his property.Another said the youths had tampered with a small mechanical digger the victim had been using while working on his driveway."I was on my laptop and I heard some shouting in the street," neighbour Andrew Brocklehurst, 20, said. "I looked out of the window to see him on the floor with people around him nursing him. By the time I got downstairs and outside police and an ambulance were already here."I heard reports someone had kicked his car and he had gone out and tried to move them on and as far as I know that's when they attacked him."It's a shock, it really is - it's not such a bad area, and this is just a guy trying to defend his own property and he's been killed."You don't expect this on your own doorstep. They are animals; they are just scum really. I can't understand how anyone could do anything like that."
