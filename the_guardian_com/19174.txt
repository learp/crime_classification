A woman was jailed todayfor at least 33 years for stabbing to death her two daughters â€“ murders that their father said were an "act of calculated viciousness" that had inflicted an "incalculable loss".Rekha Kumari-Baker, 41, killed Davina, 16, and Jasmine, 13, as they slept at her home in Stretham, Cambridgeshire, early on 13 June 2007.Today Kumari-Baker was given two life sentences and told she would have to serve a minimum of 33 years in prison.The teenagers' father, David Baker, Kumari-Baker's ex-husband, said not a day had passed when he did not think of his two daughters.On Monday a jury at Cambridge Crown Court took 35 minutes to conclude that Kamari-Baker had not been suffering from an "abnormality of mind" and was therefore guilty of murder rather than manslaughter.Yesterday the court heard extracts of a victim impact statement from Baker."Having them taken away from me in such a brutal way and by the woman who was their mother ... has had an incalculable effect," he said in a statement read out at Cambridge crown court: "I am haunted by the horror of the events of that night and probably will remain so for a very long time."Baker said he had been incapable of working since the deaths and had attended counselling. "Rekha Kumari always believed that her children were an extension of herself, existing to further her own life ambitions," he said. "For me, my love for them was different. I loved them as they were and watched them growing into two beautiful girls with a rich, full life ahead of them."Kumari-Baker argued that she had been suffering from a mental disorder and mounted a "diminished responsibility defence". But on Monday a jury found that she had not been suffering from an "abnormality of mind" and was guilty of murder rather than manslaughter.Sentencing her today, Mr Justice Bean said: "Most people will find it inexplicable that a mother could kill her own children and you have given no explanation for it."Baker said he had suffered from feelings of guilty and helplessness since the attack."She tore them from us all and life can't be the same for those who remain ... Each birthday since has been almost unbearable as I think of what they might have been doing."He said the deaths of his daughters had devastated family and friends: "The ripple effect of their killings stretch out far indeed. [Kumari-Baker] robbed us all of the girls in the present but she also took their futures away from them."Prosecutors said she was trying to "wreak havoc" on her ex-husband.Mr Justice Bean will today impose a mandatory life sentence for murder and recommend the minimum term Kumari-Baker must serve before being considered for parole.Mr Baker's statement told how he suffered from feelings of guilty and helplessness."I suffered from strong feelings of guilt that I didn't see it coming, and helplessness that I have not been able to do anything about it," he said."She tore them from us all and life can't be the same for those who remain."He added: "Each birthday since has been almost unbearable as I think of what they might have been doing."Mr Baker said he had been incapable of working since and had attended counselling, but found it of little help."Nothing will ever bring my girls back or undo this monstrous act," he said."I will never see them again in this life, though they live in my heart."
