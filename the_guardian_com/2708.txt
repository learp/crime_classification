Date rape and rape within marriage are as serious as attacks carried out by strangers and judges should continue to punish them accordingly, the Sentencing Guidelines Council said today.The council has proposed new guidelines that set out detailed instructions for judges on how to sentence more than 50 different types of sex crime. The guidelines are designed to reflect the harm caused to victims by sex offenders. In the proposal, the council backed existing case law that said judges should treat "acquaintance rape" and "relationship rape" no less seriously than attacks by strangers.It also recommended a minimum of five years' imprisonment for rapists whose victim was aged over 18.A council spokeswoman said none of the recommendations in the guidelines should lead to reductions in average sentences.The sex crimes detailed in the proposals would not be eligible for the 15% reduction available for other types of offences, she said.The proposed guidelines - which are out for consultation until the end of July - suggested a victim's age should be taken into account when deciding the level of punishment, with extreme youth or age being an aggravating factor.They also recommended higher minimum sentences in cases involving victims aged under 13, or victims with any form of mental disorder.Other proposals included a 12-month custodial sentence in cases where sexual activity was recorded and put on the internet, and six years for the production of indecent photographs of children.The council's deputy chairman, Sir Igor Judge, said: "These guidelines emphasise the seriousness with which sexual offences should be treated by sentencing judges."Sentencers are particularly aware of the psychological as well as the physical impact of these offences on victims."Although the purpose of these guidelines is to achieve a consistent level of sentencing for the same type of offence, they cannot deal with the specific impact of each individual offence, which has to be taken into account by the sentencing judge."The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who is also a member of the council, said the guidelines would help judges choose appropriate sentences for the new offences created by the 2003 Criminal Justice Act."In addition, the 'dangerous offender' provisions in the ... act apply to most of these offences, so any offender who is found to present a 'significant risk of serious harm' to other people will receive lengthy sentences under those provisions designed to protect the public."Under the proposed guidelines, the starting point for imprisonment for a single case of rape would be five years if the victim was aged over 16, eight years if the victim was over 13 but under 16, and 10 years if the victim was under 13. Aggravating factors such as abduction, gang rape or sustained attacks would raise the sentence starting points to eight years, 10 years and 13 years for the respective age brackets.Currently 98% of those convicted of rape are sentenced to jail. The current average length of sentence for rape is seven and a half years.The 130-page document also suggested flashers should be given a community sentence or fine for a first offence and people caught having sex in a public lavatory should not be jailed.A Home Office spokeswoman said sexual offences were "terrible crimes that can destroy lives"."The government believes offenders convicted of serious sexual and violent offences should receive lengthy prison sentences. Indeed, those convicted of rape can receive a life sentence."She added: "The Government is committed to rebalancing the whole criminal justice system in favour of victims. Sentences which reflect the seriousness of crimes committed by offenders play a key role in this work."The average sentence for rape is currently over seven years, and we see no reason why this should change."
