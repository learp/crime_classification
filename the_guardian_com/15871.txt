Four people arrested over a hotel fire in Cornwall that killed three guests will not face charges, police said today.The Penhallow hotel, in the centre of Newquay, a seaside town, was gutted by the blaze last August.One victim, Peter Hughes, a teacher from Cheslyn Hay, in Staffordshire, died after jumping from the third floor of the property after trying in vain to save his elderly mother.He was heard to shout "I can't move my mum" and "I can't breathe, I can't breathe." Monica Hughes and holidaymaker Joan Harper also perished in the fire, which ripped through the 54-bedroom hotel in the early hours of the morning.Harper, of Stoke-on-Trent, was trapped but her twin sister, Marjorie Brys, was one of more than 90 people who escaped.Today, Detective Chief Inspector Darren Lockley, of Devon and Cornwall police, said the inquiry had been "extremely complex", with investigators collating 3,500 documents and 1,000 statements."Today, especially, our thoughts are with the families of Peter and Monica Hughes and Joan Harper," he said."They are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones, but this will always be difficult without knowing exactly why this tragedy happened."This inquiry is still open and we remain committed to investigate any information that comes to our notice."Lockley said police felt they had "been thorough and meticulous in our approach to this investigation".Police launched the murder inquiry after experts found evidence that the blaze had been started deliberately.On August 18, the first anniversary of the tragedy - which firefighters said was the worst in Britain for 30 years - Lockley appealed for the person responsible to "be brave" and come forward. He told a news conference he did not believe the person intended to kill the victims.
