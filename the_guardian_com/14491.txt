The mother of a white 15-year-old boy who was left with brain damage after a hammer attack by a gang of British Asian pupils blamed his school today after a report found it failed to recognise a series of racist incidents prior to the assault.Henry Webster was repeatedly punched, kicked and hit with the sharp end of a claw hammer in an assault by the gang on the tennis courts at Ridgeway school in Wroughton, near Swindon, Wiltshire, in January 2007.His mother, Liz, said the serious case review (SCR) showed the school was responsible. "This review has confirmed our belief that the Ridgeway school was responsible for the horrific, devastating assault on our son which has left him with permanent injuries," she said.Mrs Webster claimed the local authority had got off lightly in the report. "The criticism of the local authority is tantamount to a whitewash as it is so minimal and limited."The review doesn't mention what needs to be done to improve race relations in Swindon, which is an urgent concern considering the considerable increase in the vote for the BNP."She accused the school and the local authority of being "excessively defensive" and claimed there had been an attempt to "deflect blame from the school and the local authority".Her son had agreed to fight a boy "one on one" to end the harassment that he felt he and his friends were experiencing.The ensuing attack happened when four boys pointed him out to three Asian men who had arrived in cars. It took about one minute. Henry Webster suffered six blows from a hammer produced by one of the intruders and was left with a depressed skull fracture.Henry, who is now 18, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time education but still has short-term memory loss.The attack led to the conviction in 2008 of seven young men for wounding Henry with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, with a further five men being convicted of conspiracy. Another admitted violent disorder.They were given custodial sentences ranging from eight years to eight months, with others receiving suspended sentences of up to 18 months. Four were pupils at the school.Mrs Webster said the school's race relations policy "was not worth the paper it was written on", adding: "There was no cohesive approach to dealing with matters of race."Whilst Henry has been the primary victim, we are and always have been of the firm belief that this school also let down the young Asian pupils who were eventually prosecuted for this attack."They have been criminalised and demonised. Had their integration been properly handled we are certain this attack would not have happened."Mrs Webster said she and her family were "very concerned" that the report had failed to address many of the failings surrounding their treatment, saying: "Our faith in the justice system and the establishment has been severely damaged. We feel badly let down."Last year, Henry, of Wroughton, and his family launched a high court challenge claiming that the school had been negligent, failed to maintain proper discipline and failed to deal with racial tension. The school denied liability.In February this year Mr Justice Nicol rejected their claims and said the school did not breach its duty to take reasonable care to keep Henry reasonably safe while on its premises.Following the high court ruling, the Swindon Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) commissioned a serious case review to examine the facts and allow professional agencies to learn lessons.The executive summary, published today, says the school, despite knowing in advance, did not prepare for the arrival of a significant number of British Asian students in 2005.Some incidents between white and British Asian pupils were not recognised as racist by the school and by dealing with these incidents itself, it missed the opportunity to gain a better understanding of what was actually going on through external intervention, the review says.Other agencies did not challenge robustly the school's approach or its procedures, the report says.Mike Howard, independent chair of the Swindon LSCB, said: "I am sorry that what was already an extremely distressing experience was made worse by the lack of co-ordinated support they received from some agencies."The attack took place over three and a half years ago and, despite the regrettable delay in concluding the SCR process, many of the measures made in the recommendations have already been identified and acted upon by individual agencies."Swindon has made significant progress in many areas of safeguarding. Most importantly I hope that Henry will be able to move on from this tragic and protracted incident and be able to achieve his ambitions in life."Steve Allsopp, the president of the Swindon Race Equality Council, said that the saga had not increased racial tension in the area. He also refuted Mrs Webster's claim that the attack had resulted in an increase in votes or support for the BNP.The school said it could not have "forseen or prevented" the attack.In a statement it added: "We are sorry that the family feel that they were not supported adequately following the attack. We have noted the recommendations contained within the report."
