A £70,000 car owned by Premier League footballer Jermain Defoe was "likely to cause danger" because the windows were so heavily tinted, a court heard today.Windows on the 26-year-old Tottenham Hotspur and England striker's Range Rover allowed in less than 15% of available daylight, magistrates in Southend, Essex, heard.A policeman told the court the tinting was so heavy that the inside of the car was dark. PC Rob Brettell said that to be legal, tinted windows had to let in 70% of available light."Visibility would be terrible with the windows that dark," he said. "This is the worst degree. The inside part of the vehicle would have been dark."Defoe's cousin, non-league footballer Ryan Edgar, was fined £150 and had three points added to his licence after being convicted of driving a car likely to cause danger because the windows were heavily tinted.He was also convicted of driving without L-plates and supervision on a provisional licence and admitted driving without insurance.Edgar, 23, of Plaistow, east London, had been stopped while driving Defoe's car in Canvey Island, Essex, in April last year, the court heard. Edgar said he did not realise that heavily tinted windows were illegal, thought that he held a full licence and thought that Defoe's agent had "sorted" the insurance.
