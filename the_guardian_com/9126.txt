A married couple killed a young boy they planned to adopt by forcing him to eat a "significant" amount of salt, a court was told today.Ian Gay, 39, and 40-year-old Angela Gay, of Hayley Green, Halesowen, Birmingham, appeared at Nottingham crown court charged with one count of manslaughter and one of cruelty in connection with the death of three-year-old Christian Blewitt. Christian was taken to hospital after collapsing at the Gays' home on December 8 2002. He died at Birmingham Children's Hospital four days later. Opening the prosecution case, William Davis QC said tests revealed abnormal levels of sodium in the boy's bloodstream, and showed he had suffered a brain haemorrhage. "Our case in a nutshell is that the two of them [Mr and Mrs Gay] forced Christian to consume salt, probably as some kind of punishment," he said. "Also, that they manhandled him in a wholly inappropriate way for a three-year-old child. They shook him or banged his head against a mattress or something like that." Mr Davis said that although the prosecution did not believe the Gays intended to kill or seriously harm the three-year-old, any reasonable person would have realised their actions would harm him. Earlier, the trial judge, Mr Justice Pitchford, told the jury this was the second time Mr and Mrs Gay had been tried in relation to Christian's death. "At the first trial, the jury found Mr and Mrs Gay not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter," he said. "Mr and Mrs Gay appealed against their convictions on the grounds of fresh evidence. "The court of appeal allowed their appeal and ordered a retrial on the charges of manslaughter and cruelty, which is how we come to be here today." The judge reminded the jury that this is a fresh trial, and told them they should not research the case themselves.
