The Information Commissioner's Office has ordered four police forces to delete decades-old criminal records because they are "no longer relevant", it was announced today.One record held by Humberside police related to the theft of a packet of meat worth 99p in 1984, when the offender was 16.People whose data was stored in criminal records complained to the commissioner, Richard Thomas, after their history showed up in Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks when they applied for jobs.Mr Thomas has issued enforcement notices requiring Humberside, Northumbria, Staffordshire and West Midlands forces to delete records from the police national computer after deciding that keeping the files breached data protection rules.One of the applicants, John Webb, 45, from Hull, runs a successful business and was in the army for 20 years.When he applied for clearance to work with children, a minor conviction surfaced from West Midlands police records for 1978, when he was 16.He admitted attempted theft and minor criminal damage of a fairground slot machine, relating to the use of metal discs cut to the size of 1p and 10p pieces. He was fined Â£25." I felt surprise, shock, horror and disgust at my being portrayed as convicted of attempted theft and criminal damage," Mr Webb said. "Although I accept what happened in the incident was wrong, I consider that by today's standards what I did would be considered more of a juvenile prank."I think it is unfair that this information is retained and also that there is no relevance in keeping it."The commissioner said he was sending "a very clear signal" to the police that conviction data that is excessive and no longer required for policing purposes should be deleted."The onus is now on all police forces to consider whether they are holding on to old conviction data that is no longer required for policing purposes," Mr Thomas said.The forces are taking each case to the Information Tribunal, which will decide whether the files should be deleted.The assistant commissioner, Mick Gorrill, a former detective superintendent, said the cases related to individuals who had been convicted or cautioned on one occasion and have not been convicted of any other offences."Some of the incidents date back nearly 30 years," he said. "The offences were non-custodial and we believe there is no justification in terms of policing purposes for retaining the information. We are not satisfied that in these particular cases this information will be of any use for policing purposes."The disputed records also include a case held by Staffordshire police in which a 13-year-old was cautioned for a minor assault.She was originally told the information would be deleted when she turned 18, but was later informed police would retain it until her 100th birthday.The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said the ruling exposed the lack of proper guidance for police on when and how they retain crime data."If serious crimes have been committed, it is appropriate for information to be retained by the police. But in more trivial circumstances, a greater degree of proportionality is required," he said.A Home Office spokesman said: "The police national computer is a critical tool in enabling the police service to prevent and investigate crime."A statutory code of practice was introduced in January 2005, which all chief officers must have regard to and which establishes core principles of timeliness and data quality."Responsibility for the creation and maintenance of police records lies with chief officers and use of this data by the police must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998."
