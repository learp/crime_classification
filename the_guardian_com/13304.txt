The key technology exploited by police to find the bodies of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol is known as ground-penetrating radar. A radar handset with a transmitter sends short pulses of high-frequency radio waves into the ground and a receiver picks up the returning pulses. When these pulses hit an object below the surface, the reflected waves are disturbed. This variation is detected by the receiver, revealing the location of an object. The effectiveness varies according to the type of soil. Dry, sandy soils or dry materials such as granite, limestone or concrete are best. Depths of up to 50ft can be achieved in these conditions. In moist, clay-laden soils, however, penetration is sometimes only a few inches.Although a relatively new technology, ground-penetrating radar has proved to be a vital tool in a number of professions. Engineers use it to detect cracks or holes in buried structures, while archaeologists use it to reveal ancient remains. Police have also had success in recent years, as have military experts who use it to search for mines. Ground-penetrating radar is not the only technology that will be used to aid the search at 50 Irvine Drive. So much soil and foundation work has now been removed that police are preparing to bring in heavy jacks to prop walls, while specialists hunt for human remains there.
