Security has been stepped up at a university after a woman was raped in a hall of residence.The woman, aged 18, was raped at a hall of residence attached to the University of Glamorgan in Treforest, near Pontypridd.Police were first called to the Glamorgan Court halls in the early hours of Saturday 26 September. An 18-year-old woman who did not live there told officers she had been raped between 2.30am and 4.50am in a friend's room.The suspect is described as about 6ft tall, of solid appearance, and was wearing gloves and a dark-coloured hooded top.Police patrols were stepped up. On Monday a 20-year-old approached officers on patrol and said that she too had been raped in a bedroom at the halls of residence on the same night, but police said today this complaint had now been withdrawn.A force spokeswoman said: "In relation to the alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman at the University of Glamorgan, South Wales Police can confirm that following inquiries we are no longer looking for suspects and the complaint has been withdrawn."Police are no longer investigating this incident.

Before the second allegation had been withdrawn, superintendent Tony Smith, of South Wales police, said: "Since the initial incident was reported to us on Saturday 26 September there has been a 24-hour police presence at the university's campus, which will continue, as well as the campus' own security staff."I would like to reassure the students and the local community that we have a dedicated team of officers fully committed to these investigations. Officers are visible on the campus and I would urge anyone who has information or concerns to speak with them."The vice-chancellor of the University of Glamorgan, Professor David Halton, said: "The safety and welfare of our staff and students is our priority and we have increased our campus security presence and have a dedicated counselling service available."I would urge any member of our community who has any information to come forward to assist South Wales police with their inquiries. Staff and students should also follow personal safety advice and guidance provided by the university and the students' union."The university has been working to improve security around windows and doors and has set up a helpline for worried students and parents.
