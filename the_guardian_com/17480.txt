Prosecutors will be allowed to make written deals for the first time offering criminals lighter sentences for "grassing" on their associates, under controversial measures which come into force next month.Offenders will be guaranteed in writing that if they plead guilty and turn Queen's evidence, the sentencing judge will be told of their cooperation and they can expect a lower sentence.The government hopes the US-style agreements will help to crack organised crime gangs by giving criminals more certainty than the informal deals offered in the past. Ministers hope the formal bargains, to be offered by prosecutors working with the new Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca), coupled with stronger witness protection measures, will encourage more criminals to cooperate with the crown.The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, said: "We want to make it worth criminals' while to turn in their accomplices, their bosses."At present, only about 1% of drug trafficking cases in Britain involves turning Queen's evidence, while in the US criminals assist the prosecution in 26% of cases.Currently police can informally indicate to a criminal that if he cooperates the judge will be told of his help and he can hope for a lighter sentence.The measures are part of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which comes into force on April 3. Under the act, Soca, dubbed Britain's answer to the FBI, will take over the responsibilities of the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad, together with organised crime investigations previously handled by the immigration service and Revenue and Customs.Prosecutors will work alongside police detectives and specialist civilian investigators such as accountants, financial analysts and computer experts on crimes such as drug trafficking, people smuggling, terrorist fundraising and fraud.Judges passing discounted sentences as a reward for help will be allowed to disregard minimum or mandatory sentences laid down by other legislation.If criminals fail to live up to their part of the deal after receiving the lighter sentence, they can be brought back to court and a heavier sentence imposed."A written agreement will guarantee that the prosecutor will ask the court to give credit, give a discount, reduce the sentence because of the cooperation," said Lord Goldsmith. "For the first time that will be enforceable in this sense: that if the person promises to cooperate and the court sentences on that basis and they don't cooperate, you can go back to court and get the sentence reviewed."Criminals who decide to cooperate after receiving the normal sentence can also be brought back before a judge to ask for a lesser sentence to be substituted.The act will also allow prosecutors to serve a written notice on a criminal either giving immunity from prosecution altogether, if the criminal complies with certain conditions, or undertaking not to use particular evidence against the criminal.Lawyers fear the new provisions could lead to more miscarriages of justice, with criminals trimming their evidence to get a better deal. Those offered deals would have an incentive to please the prosecution by trying to ensure the "Mr Bigs" are convicted. "They will be offloading some of the blame that they should be properly shouldering themselves," said a criminal defence barrister, Owen Davies QC. "I think it will skew the truth."Some notorious wrongful convictions have resulted from deals with criminals who were promised a lenient sentence in return for testifying against others.Vera Baird QC, a Labour MP and criminal defence barrister, said: "It is hugely risky, I think, and it needs to be done with a great deal of care. But it is in my opinion worth a try, especially if you couple it with very powerful witness protection measures which we've now got available. You do stand a reasonable chance of getting some relative sprat to catch a mackerel for you."She added: "Juries are very suspicious of these things. What's got to be very clear is that Soca understand that they will still need evidence to buttress these people's testimony. They will have to go out and look for that."The police officer or other investigator would probably ask at an early stage whether the suspect wanted to cooperate and it would go to the prosecutor for approval, Lord Goldsmith said. "The key to this is that if you want to get at the top criminals you have got to have effective ways of getting their accomplices, the people underneath them, to give evidence and to give help. Because they protect themselves, they keep their own hands away from getting dirty at the crimes, you need to turn people against them."
