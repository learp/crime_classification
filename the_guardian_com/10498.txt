Doctors treating the Russian former spy Alexander Litvinenko said today there had been a "dramatic deterioration" in his condition overnight but dismissed as "misleading" reports that x-rays had revealed unusual objects in his digestive system.A friend said Mr Litvinenko had suffered a cardiac arrest last night and was on an artificial heart support machine.In a statement, Geoff Bellingan from University College hospital confirmed there had been a "dramatic deterioration" in Mr Litvinenko's condition overnight and he was critically ill in intensive care.He said the medical team treating the 43-year-old was still unclear about the cause of his condition, despite extensive tests. But it had ruled out thallium poisoning, and thought radiation poisoning was also unlikely.Dr Bellingan criticised a report by the BBC that three objects of "dense matter" were lodged in Mr Litvinenko's abdomen and intestines.He said: "We have been concerned about speculation in the media by people who are not directly involved in his care."Suggestions that an x-ray identified three objects in his body are misleading. We are now convinced that shadowing on the x-ray was caused, as might be expected, by Prussian Blue - a non-toxic therapeutic agent which was administered as part of his treatment."Mr Litvinenko's friend, Alex Goldfarb, said earlier: "He went into cardiac arrest and they put him on a ventilator but he is now stable. He is under sedation and they are not planning to wake him up as yet."He added that the heart attack happened during the night and Mr Litvinenko's wife was with him at the time.The latest deterioration had decreased Mr Litvinenko's chances of survival and made it less likely he would receive a bone marrow transplant in the near future, Mr Goldfarb told Sky News.Friends of the ex-KGB officer believe he was poisoned by Russian security services because of his fierce criticism of President Vladimir Putin's government - a claim the Kremlin denies.Police are investigating how he became ill and have previously said that they suspected "deliberate poisoning".Mr Litvinenko, a defector to Britain who was granted asylum and citizenship, is thought to have been poisoned on November 1. He had been investigating the murder of the Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism unit is heading the police investigation into the alleged poisoning.
