The impact of Ed Miliband's speech on education at this year's Labour conference remains to be seen, but people in Westminster are still talking about last year's argument for responsible capitalism. The financial crisis in 2008 exposed some basic weaknesses in our capitalist system, but it was Miliband's speech that gave the first and most explicit recognition of the need for a more responsible form of capitalism, not only as an end in itself but as a means to achieving a more successful economy.But was the Labour leader picking up a thread already out there?In the Companies Act 2006, the previous government introduced a provision whereby a director must act in the way he considers would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members.The director must have regard to various factors, including the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment. However, these provisions did not change the basic legal position of individual companies or of their directors. They are duties owed to the company itself, so are for the company (generally controlled by the directors) to enforce. So this duty of responsibility is not "outward-facing" and does not trigger direct enforcement by the public authorities.So how does Labour take this forward?It should be remembered that the main purpose of establishing a limited company with its own separate corporate identity is to limit the liability of the individuals involved, whether as shareholders, directors or otherwise.The system rests on the assumption that, even if those involved in the ownership and management of companies act for their own selfish ends, the net result will, nonetheless, be for the benefit of the community as a whole.Clearly the way forward cannot be to return to the pre-industrial era, when those involved in business remained personally responsible throughout. The right approach must surely be to develop mechanisms (if necessary through legislation, or at least non-statutory codes of guidance) which will prevent the harmful consequences of unrestrained business activity, while allowing such activity to continue to benefit the community through the production and distribution of goods, services, jobs etc.So how might the law frame this?Consider first the powers and responsibilities of shareholders. It may seem tempting to increase the powers of shareholders, to enable shareholders to control the composition and remuneration of the board of directors more effectively.However, by itself, conferring greater control is unlikely to be sufficient, since shareholders are likely to be motivated primarily by the profitability of their own investment, and will not necessarily promote the long term success of the company, let alone the benefit of the community generally.Consideration should therefore be given to imposing a minimum period between the acquisition and disposal of shares, though research is needed to evaluate what the effect of such a measure is likely to be.Turning to the responsibilities of directors, a code of conduct like the Corporate Governance Code could be developed.Miliband suggested that those in business, particularly in banking, ought to be bound by similar rules to those who work in teaching, medicine and the law. It now seems to be widely accepted that there should be greater involvement in executive pay by the company's owners/shareholders and by its employees, not least because they have an obvious financial stake in the way which the company's available resources are applied.Steps to ensure greater transparency in relation to remuneration arrangements are already in hand. However, the time has surely come for society to take a more active role in relation to systems of payment. As the Labour leader has also pointed out, even the European Parliament is proposing that if your bonus is doubling your annual salary, that should be enough.With regards to tax policy, incentives for particular kinds of economic or investment decisions are an obvious example. Some form of tax credit for child-care would be likely to have a positive impact on the diversity of the work force. More widely, it has been suggested that all tax proposals should be subject to a "sustainability audit".Finally, a clear area for government action arises in relation to procurement decisions. For example, Labour has said that it would make it a condition that firms winning large government contracts should offer apprenticeships.David Coats, associate director of the Work Foundation, in an article for Fabian Review, observes that another attractive step would be to ratify the International Labour Organisation's convention on labour clauses in public contracts, which requires the government only to do business with those who observe either the wages and conditions negotiated with trade unions or the prevailing wage in a sector.No one would suggest that issues relating to the conduct of business should be subject to frequent direct legal or judicial intervention, but there are nonetheless legal improvements which can be made, both on the criminal and on the civil side.By way of example, there seems to be scope for the creation of additional criminal offences, not necessarily involving proof of deliberate dishonesty. Thus the former Serious Fraud Office director Richard Alderman has recommended the creation of an offence of recklessly managing a company. The need for a tighter approach to prosecution in relation to financial crime has now been emphasised by the Treasury select committee in its initial report on Libor.On the civil side, the biggest problem remains the funding of litigation, and there is considerable concern that reforms introduced by the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, by diminishing the profitability of the conditional fee agreement, will make it much harder for claimants to pursue civil claims, especially in group litigation.What mechanisms might be available to guarantee that business activity in general works for the benefit of the community, and not to its disadvantage?There is no doubt that greater transparency is a first step in this respect, and measures such as those requiring the directors' report to provide environmental information are to be applauded. However, what is lacking is any co-ordinated monitoring (let alone regulation) of the extent to which this kind of disclosure is made, or as to the longer term results.It is increasingly clear that a "standing commission on responsible capitalism", which could carry forward such proposals, and build on the work of the various temporary inquiries referred to above, is what we now urgently need. As Keynes observed, a system which works for the collective benefit also tends to maximise individual profit, whereas, and this we have all observed, a system which fails to work for the collective benefit risks destroying individual profitability, and thereby destroying the system itself.
