The new home secretary, John Reid, tonight moved two of his ministers in an emergency mini-reshuffle aimed at reasserting control over his beleaguered department after a series of crises.Liam Byrne, the policing minister, is to move sideways to take over the troubled immigration and asylum brief, just two weeks after he was first appointed.And the current immigration minister, Tony McNulty - who last week admitted it might take a decade to remove all illegal immigrants from the UK - will move to the policing job.Tonight a Home Office source said that the reshuffle was made effectively on the orders of Mr Reid, who had "sat down" with the two men in the wake of a series of rows, affairs and debacles damaging the department.The announcement of the switch was timed to coincide with a speech from Dr Reid to the probation service, floating the idea of giving victims of crime a say in whether offenders are released on parole.Dr Reid will be grilled by MPs on the home affairs select committee tomorrow over row about the deportation of foreign prisoners which saw off his predecessor, Charles Clarke.With the Home Office at the centre of a week of damaging headlines for the government, he will also answer questions over the deportation of illegal immigrants.Mr Byrne, a former health minister only moved to the Home Office in Tony Blair's big post-local elections reshuffle earlier this month, is seen as a capable Blairite high-flyer, having only entered parliament in a byelection two years ago.Mr McNulty, by contrast, may be paying the price of his handling of both the foreign prisoners deportation affair, and his comments on illegal immigrants.However, the police minister role is still a political hot potato, charged as it is with the government's plans for amalgamating several police forces - despite opposition from the police. Reports at the weekend suggested that scheme may now be on the back-burner.It was the comments to the committee last week from David Roberts, head of removals at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, that he hadn't "the faintest idea" how many illegal immigrants were in the UK that engulfed the home office in a new row, following controversy of the failure to deport several hundred foreign prisoners.At the centre of a political firestorm, the Home Office is still answering allegations that it used illegal immigrants to clean its HQ building, allegations that a case worker demanded sex from an asylum seeker, and the absconding of several hundred prisoners from an open prison.In a series of conciliatory moves since taking office, Dr Reid was well received at the police federation annual conference last week, and is tonight also meeting some relatives of victims of the July 7 bombings - as well as offering them more compensation.His comments in a speech tonight to the probation service, saying that probation in the public eye appeared to sometime favour the criminal over the victim.Mr Reid said in a speech to the parole board in central London: "I am looking again at whether current parole board directions are fit for purpose: at how to improve public protection representation at oral hearings through 'public protection advocates'; who will represent victims' and society's views, and at the whole process of release and supervision, to ensure it is sufficiently joined up."The move follows the furore over the case of Anthony Rice - mentioned by Dr Reid in his speech - the convicted rapist who went on to murder Naomi Bryant after being released on parole.Meanwhile, the Home Office faced fresh pressure tonight over its handling of prisoners tonight after it emerged hundreds are walking out of open prisons across the UK every year.Prison Service chief executive Phil Wheatley said that Leyhill prison - from where more than one offender a week absconded last year - was about average.He conceded that although the vast majority of those involved - who include murderers and rapists - were recaptured quickly, some would have reoffended while loose.
