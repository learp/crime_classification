A mother accused of starving and murdering her four-year-old son has told a court she was prevented from feeding him by his stepfather.Magdelena Luczak claimed Mariusz Krezolek "hated" Daniel Pelka and had meted out physical punishments, including squats, almost every day.Luczak, 27, and Krezolek, 34, are alleged to have murdered Daniel during an "incomprehensible" and escalating campaign of cruelty at their Coventry home.The pair, both originally from Poland, deny charges of murder and causing or allowing Daniel's death.Giving evidence in both English and Polish with the assistance of an interpreter, Luczak claimed Krezolek did not permit her to feed her son in the evening after he took sandwiches from classmates at school.Answering questions from defence QC Stephen Linehan, Luczak conceded that she had not cared for Daniel, as was her duty, between September 2011 and 10 February 2012, three weeks before he died of a head injury.She told jurors at Birmingham crown court: "He [Krezolek] had no feelings towards Daniel, he hated him."Asked how much food Daniel was receiving during February last year, Luczak said: "In the morning before he left for school, I was giving him breakfast and I was packing his packed lunch."On the way to school I would buy him something sweet and after school Daniel wouldn't eat any more."The court has heard that Daniel took sandwiches from classmates and "scavenged" for food at his school in the months before he died on 3 March last year, weighing just 10.7kg.Luczak said Krezolek did not allow her to feed Daniel, telling the court: "Mariusz would check his belly and he would say that there's a slight bump on his belly."He would ask Daniel if he was taking any sandwiches [from his school]. Daniel was so scared that he would always confess and say yes, he had."Mariusz didn't allow me to give him food and he said he was well fed at school."Luczak alleged that Krezolek made Daniel run and kneel in the corner of a room, adding: "He was shouting at him, he was smacking him on the bottom and he was giving him punishments."The trial continues.
