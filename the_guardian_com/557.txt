Your report (25 August) of measures being considered by the government to tackle illegal peer-to-peer filesharing suggested the change in thinking was brought about by a meeting with David Geffen while I was on holiday, in addition to separate meetings with Lucian Grainge of Universal Music. As David Geffen and I have both made very clear, the subject of internet piracy was not discussed during our meeting. Work on this started long before my holiday in August, with officials submitting advice to DCMS ministers and myself on 3 July. This set out a possible change in thinking and was not the result of any single conversation but followed engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, including Lucian Grainge. Further work was conducted throughout July and on the basis of this I wrote jointly, with Ben Bradshaw, to the relevant cabinet committee on 11 August to provide an update on developments.Peter Mandelson Secretary of state for business, innovation and skills
