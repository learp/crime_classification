A man who killed a family of four out of a "desire for revenge" after losing a prolonged court battle against them could spend the rest of his life in jail.Anxiang Du, who murdered his former business partners and their two school-age children, was sentenced this lunchtime to life with a minimum term of 40 years.Sentencing Du, who is 54, at Northampton crown court, Mr Justice Flaux told him that he had "borne in mind" the fact that a tariff of 30 years or more would "mean that you will grow old, if not die, in prison".However, he said that the brutality of the case was such that the sentence was justified."What is clear from the evidence and the verdicts is that these were cold-blooded murders which in my view were pre-meditated."He said the attack, on 29 April 2011, had "wiped out an entire family", targeting not just Jeff and Helen Ding, with whom he had set up a Chinese medicine business, but also their daughters Nancy, who was 18 and hoped to become a doctor, and her sister Alice, who was 12.He said the jury, who delivered their verdict on Wednesday, had rejected Du's defence that he should be sentenced to manslaughter on the grounds of loss of control or diminished responsibility, adding: "I'm quite satisfied that it was hatred, anger and your desire for revenge that motivated you to act as you did on the 29 April, not the moderate depression you suffered."He said Du, a practitioner of Chinese medicine, had launched a "frenzied attack" on Jeff Ding, killing him with a "savage butchery"."You did not lose your self control on killing Jeff Ding. In effect you executed the man you hated," he told Du.He said he had shown a similar callousness when he killed Ding's wife, Helen, and their two daughters, before fleeing England to escape justice.In mitigation, Rebecca Trowler QC had argued that Du had been depressed at the time of the attack, and had suffered from a "long period of stress as a result of the civil litigation" between him and the Dings, which had dragged on for 10 years.She also said that Du – who sat in court in a blue shirt and grey suit, his head bowed as it had been through the trial – had expressed remorse for what he had done."Mr Du has asked to express his remorse through me this afternoon," she said.However, Flaux said he was unconvinced of Du's remorse for what he had done. He said the lives of the family had been "senselessly cut short".Speaking of the loss to the family, he said: "I have read the very moving victim impact statements. In a very real sense you have destroyed their lives as well."He said his sentence also reflected the fact that two of the victims had been "particularly vulnerable because of their age".The family of Helen Ding, who have travelled from China to be at the trial, said they were happy with the sentence. On Wednesday they said that they felt justice had been served.
