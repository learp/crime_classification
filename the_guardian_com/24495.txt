More than 600 laptops and 83 iPads belonging to the BBC and its staff have been stolen over a five-year period.The new figures come after staff complained of an increase in thefts at New Broadcasting House, the BBC’s corporate headquarters in central London.The BBC said 624 laptops were stolen between 2010 and 2014, along with 109 mobile phones, 98 cameras and 83 iPads.The most unusual theft was two fire extinguishers, taken in 2011. Over the same five-year period, 34 desktop computers were also stolen, along with seven e-readers and four kettles.The figures were obtained after a Freedom of Information request by Parliament Street, which describes itself as a “right of centre” think tank.Parliament Street director Clare George-Hilley said: “These findings show that the BBC must do more to prevent theft and losses at every level of the organisation, taxpayers should not have to pick up the bill for sloppy management of expensive equipment.“To tackle this, the organisation needs to deliver more effective policies and training to ensure staff understand the importance of looking after devices.”The BBC’s in-house magazine, Ariel, said thefts inside New Broadcasting House were becoming “increasingly common” and reported earlier this month that three private letters to economics editor Robert Peston had been stolen from his desk.It said thefts of high-value electronic items had been foiled by an in-house investigation earlier this year, with some of the items recovered.Laptop thefts peaked with 205 devices stolen in 2012, falling to 84 this year. More than 20 iPads have been stolen in each of the past three years.As well as the electronic devices contained in the FOI request, staff have reported a string of thefts of food and items of clothing at Broadcasting House.A sign telling staff not to steal toilet paper from a toilet in Broadcasting House was itself stolen.The BBC said in a statement: “With thousands of staff and people coming and going in more than 150 BBC buildings at any one time, it is regrettably inevitable personal property and other items occasionally go missing.“The BBC takes such incidents seriously and has implemented a number of crime prevention measures.”The BBC said the list of items included “all property stolen, whether BBC property or personal possessions of individuals”.The broadcaster employed an average of 20,736 people in 2014, according to the corporation’s latest annual report.• To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
