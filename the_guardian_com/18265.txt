DNA profiles of 24,000 juveniles who have never been cautioned, charged or convicted of an offence have been stored on a police database.Concerns were raised about the register earlier this month after it was revealed that the details of seven per cent of the population were expected to be held on it by 2008.But it has now emerged the profiles of thousands of youngsters aged 10 to 18 are also being kept on the database despite them lacking a police history.Grant Shapps MP, who represents Welwyn Hatfield, will launch a campaign this week to get the juveniles' details erased from records. 'This is just a question of building a database by stealth, by the back door,' he said.A Home Office spokesman said there were no rules governing the minimum age for taking a DNA sample from someone who has been arrested.In April 2004 the law was changed so that samples could be kept from people who had been acquitted of any crime, or who had been arrested for a recordable offence but never charged. Stuart Hyde, of West Midlands Police, said the law change had proved to be an 'enormous success' in catching criminals.
