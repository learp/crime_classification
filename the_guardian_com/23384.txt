A police firearms officer has said that Mark Duggan could not have thrown a gun he is alleged to have been carrying out of a cab before armed police surrounded him and shot him dead.The officer, known only as W42, was testifying at the inquest into Duggan's death where police say Duggan threatened them twice with a weapon, which was recovered 10 to 20 feet away and over a low fence.One theory the jury may consider is that Duggan – who was travelling in a cab that was stopped at gunpoint by police – tossed the weapon away before police got to him. But W42, an experienced firearms officer, said this could not have happened.Leslie Thomas, barrister for the Duggan family, asked: "Did you see anything being thrown from the cab?""No sir I didn't," W42 said.Thomas said: "If he had thrown the firearm from the minicab, [would] you get there too late to see it?"W42 said: "I disagree." He added that, for that to be the case, Duggan would have had to have thrown the gun from the cab while it was still in motion.W42 was the first officer to rush out of his car and onto the pavement to detain Duggan, whom police believed was a gangster and in possession of a gun, during the confrontation in Tottenham, north London, in August 2011.W42 said the cab's sliding door was open when he reached it, and then Duggan ran out. The jury has heard Duggan sent a message minutes before police stopped him that showed he knew he was being followed.Two firearms officers say they saw Duggan holding a gun. The officer who shot him said he could make out details of the weapon and fired in self-defence. No officer or witness has said they saw the gun flying out of Duggan's hands after he was shot and travelling over the low fence.The jury heard W42 say he shouted "show me your hands" at Duggan, who emerged from the cab with his hand in his jacket. When Duggan failed to comply, W42 said he shouted "he's reaching, he's reaching", as a warning the suspect was going for a gun.None of the officers say they heard this, claims Thomas.W42 was hit by a colleague's bullet that passed through Duggan, tearing through the officer's T-shirt and lodging in his police radio, saving him from serious injury. W42 was taken to hospital and later that evening made an initial statement where he made no mention that Duggan had failed to comply when challenged, nor his warning to colleagues that Duggan was "reaching" inside his jacket for a gun.Challenged on the omission about Duggan reaching for a gun, W42 said: "I didn't believe it had to be included in the initial note."Asked by Thomas why he did not fire when he was so close to Duggan, W42 replied: "I cannot see a gun".Duggan is then alleged to have pivoted towards officers, one of whom shot him in the arm and chest.The inquest resumes next week.
