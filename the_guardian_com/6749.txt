A British pensioner has been stabbed to death in front of her husband in Spain. Police found 74-year-old Janette Grocutt lying in a pool of blood at the couple's detached home in Paredon, a village in the hills 40 miles inland from Alicante on Friday evening.Mrs Grocutt was killed either as she tried to fight off a burglar or answered the door to someone she knew who then attacked her, detectives said yesterday.Although her husband, Douglas, heard her screams, the bedridden invalid was unable to help. 'It was a horrific attack on a defenceless old woman,' a police official said. Neighbours said that Mr Grocutt was taken to hospital suffering from shock.The Grocutts, who are well known in the area, ran a campsite and rented out homes to British holidaymakers in an area surrounded by pine forests, vineyards, olive and almond groves, and which is extremely popular with British expats.The attack took place in their log-cabin style house set in 600 square metres of land dotted with olive trees. Last night, the house was sealed off by police. A British neighbour said: 'There have been many burglaries in the area and people have been worried for some time that something terrible like this would happen.'
