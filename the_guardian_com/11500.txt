The police watchdog is to scrutinise forces' handling of domestic violence complaints after stinging criticisms over a number of high-profile cases in which women have been failed by the police.Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) will look at the performance of forces across England and Wales, identify where improvements need to be made and report back in April 2014, the home secretary, Theresa May, said on Friday.While domestic violence charities have cautiously welcomed the inquiry as a positive step, some remain disappointed that it is not a public inquiry that will also examine the role of the crown prosecution service, social services and the NHS.The review follows cases such as that of Clare Wood, 36, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford in February 2009 after meeting him on Facebook, unaware of his history of violence against women.Other cases include the death of Maria Stubbings, 50, who was murdered by Marc Chivers at her home in Chelmsford, Essex, in December 2008, a year after Chivers had been freed from a German prison where he had served 15 years for murdering his then girlfriend, Sabine Rappold.A series of reviews has found shortcomings in the amount of protection given to victims of domestic violence after they go to the police for help.Sandra Horley, the chief executive of Refuge, praised the strong leadership of the Home Office in announcing the review, but questioned the decision to keep it private and focused on the police."Refuge believes that all state agencies need to improve the way they respond to women and children who are living with fear and violence at home."A public inquiry would also be independent and transparent and would hear from other parties including victims, [and] families of women who have been killed by a current or former partner," she said.The inspection will look at the effectiveness of the police approach to domestic violence and abuse and whether victims deemed to be at risk in the future are appropriately managed.It will also consider whether the police are learning from experience and adapting their response and whether any changes need to be made to their approach.Clare Wood's death led to the creation of "Clare's law", which allows women to discover if they are at risk of domestic violence from a partner. The yearlong pilot scheme was introduced last September in Greater Manchester, Gwent, Wiltshire and Nottingham.In June, Greater Manchester police said 65 people had applied for a disclosure about a boyfriend or an individual who was in a relationship with someone they knew. A further 25 applications were submitted by agencies when they felt someone might be at risk.Police granted 53 disclosures on application, while in other cases the partner did not have a record of violent offences or there was no information that a risk was present.May's review was announced three days after official figures showed that there has been an alarming 13% fall in the number of domestic violence attacks that are considered for prosecution since 2010.The statistics – obtained by Labour through a Freedom of Information request – show that the number of domestic violence cases being referred by the police to the Crown Prosecution Service to be considered for charge and prosecution has fallen from 101,242 in 2010-11 in England and Wales to 88,110 in 2012-13.Javed Khan, the chief executive of independent charity Victim Support, said that the police approach to domestic violence must be tackled head on."Victims of domestic violence and other forms of abuse show real courage in reporting the crimes committed against them and must be reassured that they will be taken seriously when they make a complaint."We believe that identifying those at the most risk of harm is critical to protecting victims, as is early identification to stop domestic abuse before it escalates," he said.
