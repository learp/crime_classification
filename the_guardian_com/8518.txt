A violent thief obsessed with knives will be jailed for life after admitting that he stabbed a young woman with a samurai sword during a trivial argument and then crushed her to death under his car.Psychiatrists are to interview Hugh Penrose, 36, who changed his plea to guilty yesterday shortly before a jury was due to be sworn in at Newcastle upon Tyne crown court.It was then revealed that the bald, bespectacled man had come close to killing a police officer 11 years ago when he was surprised while trying to break into a car. He was sent to jail for five years in 1995 for stabbing PC Richard Green with a sharpened screwdriver. The officer was saved by his armoured vest.In May last year, Penrose threatened a bus driver with a long-bladed knife while trying to escape after the samurai attack on 21-year-old Carie Burns, which followed a quarrel at a party in Consett, County Durham. The court heard that Ms Burns had stayed the night at the terrace house where the impromptu party was held, and argued with Penrose after other guests had left.At 6.30am the quarrel flared up again, and Penrose grabbed the sword. Although slashed several times, Ms Burns managed to stagger outside but Penrose ran after her. He got into his Ford Mondeo and ran over her. Ms Burns died in hospital.Remanding Penrose in custody for sentencing in a fortnight, Judge David Hodson said he would be jailed for life.
