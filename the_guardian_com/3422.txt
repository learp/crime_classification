Gordon Brown and David Blunkett are heading for a showdown over this summer's government spending review because the chancellor is reluctant to finance the home secretary's ambitious plans for reform of the police, prison and asylum services.As other key spending ministers submit their proposals to Mr Brown on schedule, Mr Blunkett has asked for extra time to raise the quality of his bid. He has already boosted his team of officials in an attempt to make his department's arguments more robust and the likely long-term savings clearer.Mr Blunkett is fighting a wave of headlines about a nationwide crime epidemic and is seeking extra cash for his police reform package - covering pay and conditions - as well as for extra police beyond the current 130,000 target set for spring 2003.This has put him sharply at odds with the chancellor, who one well-placed official said was inclined to put more money into long-term prevention, including skills training: ideas that chime more with his own views on tackling poverty and social exclusion.Negotiations between the two may be tense because of their mutual suspicion as potential successors to Tony Blair.The second of Mr Brown's comprehensive spending reviews will run for three years from the financial year 2003-4. Health, education, transport and law and order are, more than usual, the politically sensitive departments. Mr Brown wants proof that the money will not be wasted.The negotiations this spring - ahead of a Commons statement in June or July - are intimately tied to calculations for the chancellor's April 17 budget, late this year because of his family bereavement.All big-spending ministries involved in the drive to improve public services - crucial to Mr Blair's hopes of a third term in power - report that Mr Brown and his officials are insistent that they must prove they can deliver the reforms they propose."We have to prove we're not wasting the money," one senior minister told the Guardian yesterday. "We've been told that if we get the investment we must deliver reform and improved results," said a senior official in another ministry.By that test Mr Blunkett's Home Office is more vulnerable than rival bidders for Mr Brown's funds. The current hotly contested police pay package, which rank and file officers have rejected, is estimated to cost £200m alone.Mr Blunkett also wants eight new asylum accommodation centres, a 40% increase in detention centre capacity and an increase in the size of the immigration service to tackle one of the most voter-sensitive issues of recent years. He is also planning a programme of superprisons - at a time when existing facilities are crammed with record numbers - and expensive reforms to the courts and probation system.Treasury officials are deeply sceptical over whether the Home Office can prove extra spending will produce projected outcomes. The officials say they have seen little evidence in previous audit commission reports that extra police numbers by themselves reduce crime or that the Home Office has assembled any clear means of measuring the effectiveness of different forms of punishment.Mr Blunkett's battle with the police over his pay reform package, as well as the police reform legislation, is proof that he wants new levers to improve police performance and ensure his commitments to the Treasury are met, aides say.In an attempt to focus his department, Mr Blunkett is planning to cut the number of targets by half.The previous big spending review saw £454m set aside for 9,000 police recruits, over and above forces' previous recruitment plans, as well as £109m to expand the DNA database - a vital hi-tech tool for defeating crime.Direct negotiations between ministers and Mr Brown, whose brusque style is famous, have not yet started. "We're still at the stage of subterranean calls between officials," said one.Estelle Morris, the education secretary, accepts that she will lose out to Alan Milburn, the health secretary, whose drive to improve the performance of the NHS is being closely monitored by Downing Street. However, Ms Morris fears that if her investment plans are cut, recent improvements in school standards may go into reverse.
