Crime in England and Wales has continued to fall with a 10% drop last year taking the estimated number of incidents to 8m, according to a national survey. It also shows;estimated crime has fallen to its lowest level since the survey began in 198110% drop in household crime and 9% drop in personal crimeIn the same period, the number of incidents of crime recorded by the police has fallen by 3% last year to 3.7m, according to the first figures released in the wake of controversy over the accuracy of the statistics.This is the first time that police recorded crime has lost its official status as national statistics after concerns over their reliability were raised by the UK Statistics Authority earlier this month. However, the separate Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), which does have statistical approval from the authority, found that the overall estimated number of crimes last year was down by 10% on the 8.87m in 2011-12.What’s up in the survey?Theft from the person (up 2% since 2011/12)What’s down in the survey?Bicycle theft (down by15% since 2011/12)Violence (-13%)Vandalism (-8%)Vehicle-related theft (-4%)Burglary (-3%)Sexual offencesThere has been a 17% increase in the number of sexual offences recorded by the police, up from 50,807 to 59,466. This puts it at the highest number since 60,287 in 2005-06. Although there have always been difficulties in the recording of sexual offences.As with the report on statistics out in October, the ONS states there is evidence that this is linked to a “Yewtree effect” with more people reporting abuses in the wake of the Jimmy Savile controversy.The report references figures from the Home Office data hub, which includes detailed statistics on all recorded crimes in the previous year excluding those recorded by the Metropolitan Police. They show rises of: 11% in current offences (occurring in the past twelve months), accounting for over a third (36%) of the latest increase in overall sexual offences;122% in historic offences occurring more than twenty years ago, also accounting for over a third (36%) of the increase in overall sexual offences;35% in offences occurring between 1 and 20 years ago, accounting for over a quarter (27%) of the increase in overall sexual offences.How reliable are these numbers?On 15th January this year, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority was obliged to write a letter about the accuracy of the British crime statistics to Sir Bernard Jenkin MP.The letter was a response to an admission that police officers were almost certainly fiddling the statistics. When the chief inspector of constabulary spoke in front of the home affairs select committee last month he stated that it was not a question of whether statistics were being manipulated but rather "where, how much, how severe".Since then, the Home Office minister Norman Baker has admitted that public trust in crime figures has been dented. Although concerns are not new - as far back as 2007, an audit found that police authorities and forces around the country were not recording crime in the same way.What do the police-recorded crime figures show?There has always been a difference between police recorded crime and that which is reported - that in itself is not evidence that police statistics are weak. The CSEW asks more than 40,000 people face-to-face about their experiences of, attitudes about and perceptions of a range of crimes.The wording of those questions, as well as the context in which they are asked may make people more or less inclined to mention crimes than they would be to make an official report to police about them.Though the police recorded crimes are no longer classified as national statistics, it is still worth highlighting some of the changes which they highlighted.What’s up in the police figures?Fraud (up 34% since 2011/12)Sexual offences (17%)Theft from the person (7%)Shoplifting (4%)Violence without injury (1%)What’s down in the police figures?Theft of a motor vehicle (down 17% since 2011/12)Robbery offences (-10%)Criminal damage and arson (-9%)Possession of drugs (-9%)Public order offences (-8%)
