A man has been found guilty of killing his toddler son by force-feeding him a mixture of bread and cereal.The three-year-old child “drowned in his food” after being made to lie across his father’s lap as the porridge-like was mixture poured into his mouth from a cup, the Old Bailey trial.The 32-year-old father from north-west London, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of manslaughter and cruelty to a child by majority verdicts.The prosecutor, Simon Denison QC, said during the trial that the defendant would slap his son or send him to bed on occasions when he vomited during feeding.On 27 November last year, the father called for an ambulance, and paramedics arrived to find the child lying on the floor in a nappy, showing no signs of life.Denison said: “There was a very large amount of vomit that looked like a porridge substance on his face and on his chest and not the floor.“It was very difficult to clear his airway because of the amount of porridge-like substance that was in his throat. When CPR was attempted, more of the substance came out.”He continued: “A postmortem examination revealed that virtually all sections of his lungs were stuffed with recognisable food material. He had aspirated, inhaled, breathed in, a large amount of the porridge-like mix into his lungs so that he had, in effect, drowned in his food.”The defendant was remanded in custody to be sentenced by Mr Justice Singh at the Old Bailey on Thursday.
