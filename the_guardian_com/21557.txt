Hostels are to be opened to treat the country's most dangerous sex offenders, including paedophiles, in a bid to cut the chances of them reoffending, the government announced today.Five residential treatment centres will be set up across England and Wales, each housing up to 25 high-risk sex offenders. The clinics will provide treatment and specialist supervision to each offender for up to a year.The prisons minister, Paul Goggins, said that the Home Office was already trying to identify suitable sites for the hostels and pledged there would be full public consultation.The move was announced as research for the National Probation Service said that residential clinics could cut the number of child sex offenders reconvicted within two years from 30% to 10%.An evaluation of the Wolvercote Clinic in Epsom, the UK's only residential treatment centre for sex offenders which closed in 2002, showed that it was twice as effective at reducing reconviction rates than prison-based treatment programmes.The report, An Assessment of the Need for Residential Treatment Facilities for Child Sex Abusers, recommended setting up four or five new hostels to rehabilitate offenders and protect the public.But the proposals are certain to run into fierce public opposition. The Wolvercote clinic was forced to close after plans to relocate to the Silverlands hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, were shelved following protests from local residents.Mr Goggins said: "As a government, and as a society, we have to face the fact that there are violent and sex offenders who will eventually have to be released into the community. "We can never completely eliminate the risks posed by dangerous offenders, but we can do a huge amount to minimise them and protect our communities. "Our work to identify suitable sites for residential centres to treat sex offenders is part of this public protection agenda, although we will clearly need to move forward very carefully in this process."A Home Office spokeswoman said the new hostels could be located in hospitals and were unlikely to be within prison grounds.There will be no powers to detain the offenders, who will be able to come and go from the premises - although their freedom may be partly restricted. Some will have just been released from prison and others will be on community sentences. Paul Cavadino, the chief executive of crime reduction charity Nacro, said: "This is an important step forward in increasing public safety and improving the rehabilitation of offenders. "Sex offenders will be more closely supervised, monitored and treated in these centres than in any other type of community provision. By cutting reoffending rates, the centres will reduce the number of children and adults who suffer the appalling trauma of sexual abuse. "Anyone campaigning against opening such a centre must realise that they may be increasing danger to the public and the suffering of future victims."A new national sex offender strategy, also published today, proposed a range of other measures to reduce the risk posed by sex offenders in the community.These include satellite tracking and electronic tagging, six-monthly lie detector tests and installing software on paedophiles' computers to check whether they are accessing child abuse images.
