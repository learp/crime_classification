Police investigating the disappearance of two Birmingham boys seven years ago confirmed yesterday that they had arrested a 37-year-old local man.David Spencer, 13, and Patrick Warren, 11, went missing from near their homes in Chelmsley Wood, Birmingham, on Boxing Day 1996. The police said the man, arrested on Thursday on receipt of new information, had been released on bail while they continued their inquiries. David Spencer's mother, Christine O'Toole, said the police had received a letter saying the bodies were buried in Woodgate Valley. "When the police told me they had arrested a man I just broke down and cried," she said. "I don't know how I'll cope if David is dead. "I've always clung to the thought that one day he will walk back through the door. She added: "From what they have said they seem to think this man is genuine, rather than some crackpot." The mother of Patrick Warren, Bridget Warren, 54, finds it difficult to discuss the case. Patrick's sister Tina said the news was the family's "worst nightmare come true".
