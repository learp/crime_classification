Police were called to deal with arson attacks in schools across the UK almost 3,000 times over the last two years, according to figures revealed by the Conservatives today.The Tories are currently trying to amend the government's apprenticeships, children, skills and learning bill to give headteachers in England the power to ban, search for and confiscate any item they think likely to cause violence or disruption in schools, including lighters and matches.But school leaders criticised the plans, saying teachers should not be forced to search children and act as police.Answers to a Freedom of Information Act request from 41 of 49 forces in the UK showed 2,702 incidents of arson, or the equivalent of nearly four a day. Scottish police forces recorded 1,252 incidents, compared with 1,249 in England, 126 in Wales and 75 in Northern Ireland.In England, the highest number of attacks were recorded by Metropolitan police, which covers a higher population than any other force.Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, said: "The large number of arson attacks, on top of all the other problems in schools, is deeply worrying."He said a Conservative government would give teachers the power to deal with violence and remove disruptive pupils."We would also give headteachers the power to ban any items they think may cause violence or disruption and abolish the current government guidance, which tells teachers not to search children who refuse to be searched," he said.Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: "We would have major concerns about teachers, or other education staff, being expected to search pupils."It could be dangerous for the staff concerned if a pupil has a weapon, could open staff to accusations of assault, and could damage the relationship with their pupils. Teachers are not police and should not be expected to police their schools."Bousted also pointed out that an ATL survey in 2007 found that 48% of school fires were caused by reasons other than arson.According to research by the Arson Prevention Bureau (APB), arson attacks in schools cost over £100m in 2001. There are 38 school fires each week on average, with around 17 identified as malicious and 40 per year causing more than £5m of damage.Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said schools should have a general power to search pupils who they feel may cause imminent harm to themselves or others."However, school staff need to be protected from the burden of having to prove why they lawfully confiscate items, and also from any unreasonable complaints directed at them after the event from parents and pupils," she warned.The children's minister, Delyth Morgan, said the government was working with APB to cut the number of arson attacks on schools."Current search powers, which were developed based on expert advice and in consultation with teaching unions, mean that teachers can search pupils for weapons and soon they will be able to search for alcohol, drugs and stolen property as well," she said."Any child attempting to commit arson can expect to be arrested and face the full force of the law."
