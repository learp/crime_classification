Police investigating the murder of a Pakistani politician in London said today they had recovered a knife and a brick used in the attack.Dr Imran Farooq, 50, died from stab wounds and head injuries after he was attacked outside his home in Edgware, north London.Scotland Yard said the kitchen knife, with a 14cm (5Â½in) blade, and the house brick were found in Green Lane, where the attack took place shortly before 5.30pm on Thursday 16 September.Detectives from the specialist operations counter-terrorism command, who are leading the murder hunt, are trying to trace two Asian men in connection with the killing of Farooq, who lived in exile in the UK.Police fear the killing could be politically motivated as he was a prominent member of the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement) party.Scotland Yard said officers remained open-minded about the motive for the attack. No arrests have been made.A spokesman said: "A number of witnesses have already contacted police, but officers believe there are other people who may hold vital information about the incident and they continue to urge them to come forward."They said witnesses should call the incident room on 020 8721 3784, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 if they wish to remain anonymous.Last week Farooq's widow collapsed with emotion as she appealed for help to catch his killer. Shumaila Imran, 42, said the death of the "dedicated family man" had left her and others in shock and disbelief.She said: "My husband was on his way home from work when he was set upon and attacked. I want to appeal for anyone who has any information about the attack on Imran to come forward and tell the police what they know. Someone, somewhere knows something about my husband's murder."Imran, who has two young sons, was supported by a relative as she spoke to media from Britain and Pakistan.Farooq was living in exile after fleeing his homeland 11 years ago following death threats. His murder sparked violence in Karachi, where vehicles and shops were set alight despite a call for 10 days of peaceful mourning.
