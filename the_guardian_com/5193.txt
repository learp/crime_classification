Police have questioned a mentally ill killer, awaiting trial for another murder, about the death of a fellow patient in the UK's most notorious high-security psychiatric hospital. The killer, who battered a woman to death over a decade ago and was charged with the murder of a man earlier this year, is thought to have attacked another man in Broadmoor on April 25. The victim, Richard Loudwell, 59, died on June 5. He had previously confessed to killing an 82-year-old woman. Police said a man in his 30s had been questioned about the assault, but no one had been arrested or charged. But a Broadmoor source told the Guardian the alleged assailant was undergoing assessment at the time of the attack after being admitted to the hospital two weeks before. "He had made serious threats to other patients, saying he wanted to kill them," said the source. "The victim had a very nasty head injury and lapsed into a coma." An autopsy proved inconclusive and police are waiting for further forensic test results. The latest death will create a fresh furore about security in Broadmoor, which NHS inspectors said should be redeveloped after a damning report on conditions there last year.
