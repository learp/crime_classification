Karen Matthews, the mother of nine-year-old Shannon who was allegedly abducted in Dewsbury, was charged by West Yorkshire Police today with perverting the course of justice and child neglect.Matthews, 32, will appear before magistrates in Dewsbury tomorrow, after being arrested in relation to suspicions that she had known where her daughter was while the police search was continuing.Matthews is reported to have been arrested by a family liaison officer after a conversation with two friends, which took place while they were being transported in a police car.Matthews was the fourth family member to be arrested in connection with Shannon's disappearance on February 19.A fifth person - her boyfriend, 22-year-old Craig Meehan - has been charged with possessing child pornography and remanded in custody.Michael Donovan, formerly known as Paul Drake, of Lidgate Gardens, Batley Carr, was arrested on March 14 after Shannon was found in the bed at his flat. The 39-year-old is an uncle of Meehan.Meehan, Shannon's stepfather, appeared at Dewsbury magistrates court charged with 11 counts of possessing indecent images of children.He was remanded in custody to appear again before the same court on Friday.Meehan's sister, Amanda Hyett, 25, who lives next door to Shannon's mother, and his mother, 49-year-old Alice Meehan, were both arrested on Thursday in connection with the alleged abduction.His sister was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, and his mother on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.The pair were granted bail the following day pending further inquiries.It was revealed on Sunday that Donovan slit his wrists while on remand at Leeds prison.The incident occurred on Saturday night, and he was taken to hospital before being returned to prison.Meanwhile earlier today, someone claiming to be a member of the family of Shannon Matthews asked for money from the fund set up to help find Madeleine McCann, the McCann family's spokesman said today.The person contacted fund administrators by telephone "on two or three occasions" to request cash, Clarence Mitchell told Sky News. He said there had also been an "illiterate" email request along the same lines.The requests came as police searched for nine-year-old Shannon, who was eventually discovered in the base of a bed at an address a mile from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.Mitchell said they had been "quite aggressive, along the lines of 'you've got money and we need it'". He added that the person had hinted their request was "partly a journalistic endeavour"."It just aroused our suspicions, and I advised the fund not to touch it," he said.
