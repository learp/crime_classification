The middle classes are Britain's biggest lawbreakers, according to a survey yesterday.Almost two thirds (64%) of middle-class people and high-earning professionals admit to one of a number of offences, including not paying their road tax or TV licence and damaging items before returning them for a refund. The figure compares with 55% of the general population and 43% of those on lower incomes. The research for TV Licensing accuses the middle classes of double standards. A total of 91% of the population think that those who commit an offence are spongers and should "not be allowed to get away with it". The survey questioned 2,000 adults about committing seven offences such as parking in a disabled spot, fare-dodging, paying cash in hand to avoid tax, and knowingly pocketing too much change. Suzanne Karstedt at Keele University's department of criminology said the results showed "it is the professional middle classes and high earners who commit most of these crimes and are mostly involved in morally dubious practices. "These are the people who see themselves as respectable but are part of a 'crime wave' which is costing the UK around Â£14bn in fraud and forgery every year." In total, 33% of people admitted knowingly pocketing too much change, 22% paying cash in hand to avoid tax, 14% fare-dodging, 12% parking in a disabled spot, 9% damaging items and returning them to get a refund and 5% evading their TV licence. A spokeswoman for TV Licensing said: "Whilst nine out of 10 people demand action against those committing these offences, the majority actually admit to committing one of them." Men were the bigger culprits with 61%, compared with51% of women, admitting to one of the seven dishonest acts.
