The widow of Keith Blakelock, the policeman hacked to death during the Broadwater Farm riots, will today appeal for help in catching her husband's killers on the 20th anniversary of his death.PC Blakelock, a 40-year-old father-of-three, was murdered during the riots in Tottenham, north London, on October 6 1985. His colleague PC Richard Coombes was shot and injured in the attack.Winston Silcott was convicted of the murder in 1987 but was cleared on appeal four years later because "unsafe" evidence had been used against him.PC Blakelock's widow, Elizabeth Johnson, said her family is still waiting to see justice done. "For years we have lived with uncertainty of not knowing who is responsible for what happened ... Not knowing the truth about the circumstances that led to Keith's murder just makes it all the more difficult. All the family has ever wanted is to see justice done."Mrs Johnson's appeal for new information comes almost two years after a fresh investigation into the murder was announced. To coincide with her plea, detectives have for the first time published pictures of the bloodsoaked police overalls PC Blakelock was wearing when he was killed on the Broadwater Farm estate.The photographs show his dark blue riot gear bodysuit almost totally saturated with blood. Lengths of white tape mark the holes made by the weapons with which he was killed. Police believe the differing shapes of the markings - which range from small points of entry to longer incisions - prove that he was attacked with a variety of weapons.Detective Superintendent John Sweeney, from the Specialist Crime Directorate, stressed that the inquiry was not a re-investigation of the riots. He said: "The only people who should be worried about this investigation are the people who were directly involved in the murder and attempted murder."
