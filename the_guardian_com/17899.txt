The lord chancellor yesterday signalled reforms to the legal aid system to tackle soaring spending on criminal cases, which saw one barrister receive £1.6m in payments for the years 2002 to 2004.Lord Falconer announced the appointment of the Whitehall troubleshooter Lord Carter of Coles to consider a complete shake-up in the payment system, including the possibility of introducing competitive bidding between lawyers for legal aid cases.Figures released yesterday showed that the average earnings for the 10 highest paid barristers from criminal legal aid was £724,000 in 2004-5, up from under £550,000 in 2001-2.Half of all legal aid spending in the crown courts goes on just 1% of serious cases, mainly fraud and drug trafficking, and 13 cases alone cost £48m.Lord Falconer said the rising cost of criminal legal aid had squeezed the budget for providing advice on other areas, such as debt, family problems and housing difficulties. He admitted that "advice deserts" had grown up around the country, where it was hard for poor people to find a solicitor to help them.While the cost of criminal legal aid rose by 37% in real terms in seven years, spending on civil and family legal aid fell by 24%.Lord Carter will examine how new payment methods could introduce "competitive pressure" on lawyers' fees, while making sure defendants still have a reasonable choice of lawyers."We want to reach agreement on these measures with all concerned, but over the years we've been tinkering to meet the increasing demands of the criminal legal aid cases," said Lord Falconer. "We've never faced up to the major problem, that of the huge growth in the cost of the bigger criminal cases."Agreement may not be easy to reach. These measures may be seen by some to be controversial. But I make it clear that I am determined to tackle the problem of legal aid."Lord Carter, who will report back by January next year, will also look at introducing bulk contracts for lawyers to provide services in a number of cases from a person's arrest until the case is concluded.A document setting out possible reforms, published by the Department for Constitutional Affairs, said: "Some of these reforms may have far-reaching consequences to the nature and organisation of our legal professions."It observed that solicitors in crown court cases were paid for the hours they worked, meaning that "volume of work, rather than efficiency, is rewarded financially".Any reforms introduced will create payment incentives for lawyers to keep trials within time limits, and it would become "financially unrewarding" for them to exceed the limits, because they would have to absorb the extra costs.Lord Falconer also announced a comprehensive review by the attorney general of the way fraud is tackled "in the criminal and non-criminal context", including how cases are investigated, prosecuted and tried.A further review will look at the way child care cases are dealt with in England and Wales. These are costly because of the legalistic way they are handled, with lengthy court hearings and large numbers of lawyers. The review will look at the possibility of replacing this adversarial system with a more inquisitorial system, and will consider "early low-level judicial interventions to encourage parents to resolve problems".Some criminal barristers have threatened to stop taking on new cases because of a long-running dispute over fees for cases lasting between one and 10 days. In a recent poll, 79% of criminal barristers replying said they would be prepared to take direct action if pay was not addressed. Lord Carter's review will include the disputed fees structure in these shorter cases.The shadow constitutional affairs secretary, Oliver Heald, said: "We shall judge Lord Falconer's statement on results not words, especially as this is another example of the government belatedly responding to a crisis of its own creation."The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield, said: "This announcement does nothing for the vast majority of hard-working barristers prosecuting and defending in trials lasting up to 10 days. They earn modest sums and have had their pay frozen for eight years, a cut of 23% in real terms."The Legal Aid Practitioners Group and the Law Society welcomed the attempt to redistribute funds from criminal to civil cases, but said the proposals would do nothing to stop the exodus of law firms from legal aid work.
