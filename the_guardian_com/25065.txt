A six-year-old girl abducted from her bath and left naked in a freezing street has given a partial description of her attacker to police, who are optimistic about completing the picture after a series of gentle interviews by specially trained officers.The child, who suffered a sexual assault but is now making a good recovery, has also given details of the winding, three-mile route taken by her kidnapper as she crouched shivering in his car for around a quarter of an hour.Detectives on Tyneside issued a description of the wanted man as they continued to check the whereabouts of known paedophiles and others on the sex offenders' register. The man was white and between 5ft 4in and 5ft 8in tall, in the girl's words "not skinny" and with hair on the sides of his face, which police are taking to mean sideburns. He was wearing a black hat, black coat and black gloves and was initially described as middle-aged. But detectives are keeping an open mind on how old he may be, as the girl based her assessment largely on his height.The abduction happened at around 7pm on Tuesday when the intruder slipped through an unlocked back door at the child's house in North Shields. The girl did not know her abductor but one line of inquiry being followed by Northumbria police is that he had some knowledge of arrangements at the house in a rundown street where locals have complained that traditional neighbourliness has been wrecked by drugs and street crime.The girl and her 18-month-old brother lived with their mother and her woman partner, who met through an internet chatroom. The children's father, a former soldier, lives apart but has been back to help his daughter recover from her ordeal.Detective Chief Inspector Jim Napier, leading the hunt for what he has called "a very dangerous man," said that the girl had picked out the local Rose Inn and Kwik Save supermarket as landmarks passed during her terrifying drive. He appealed to the abductor to examine his conscience and give himself up.He added: "We would also ask anyone who was in this area last Tuesday evening who noticed anything suspicious, particularly a vehicle being driven erratically or in a strange manner, with the driver possibly being distracted, to contact us."The description given by the girl matches accounts by other children of a stranger hanging around and behaving oddly earlier on the evening of the abduction. Families gave details to police after their children ran home when police cars converged on the streets in response to an emergency call from the girl's horrified mother. An eight-year-old boy who was playing with two friends near the street where the girl was dumped has given detectives a description of a red car "like the type Ali G drives - some kind of souped-up hatchback", which left the area near the girl's home shortly before the attack, with its tyres screeching.The girl was rescued by a neighbour, Geoff Brown, 43, who was watching TV with his wife when they heard screams. He found the child naked and trembling and crying about how "a nasty man" had taken her out of the bath and away from her home.The child's relatives have been told not to make a big issue of the abduction with her, but to pass on any details from her chatter to detectives.
