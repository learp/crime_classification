Brits will spend around £4bn this year kitting out their gardens with the latest in plants, pots, state-of-the art furniture and lighting.But beware - May and June are the most common months for garden robbery. One Bristol household had its entire garden stolen. Thieves uprooted trees and shrubbery, chiselled out cemented-in ornaments, and carted off a pond complete with dozens of carp and goldfish. Elsewhere, thieves steal-to-order, targeting rare plants or £1,000 lawnmowers. Even York stone or slate - sometimes costing more than £60 a sqare metre - is vulnerable. "There is a one-in-10 chance of something being stolen from your garden," says Halifax, which adds that unchained bikes are the item most frequently stolen from Britain's back yards. Most home insurance policies include cover for items lost or damaged in the garden, up to a maximum of about £2,500, at no extra cost. But the policies do not automatically cover bikes, and many have individual item limits of £1,000. Insurers will also refuse to pay out if the home is left unattended and unoccupied for more than 30 days. Fences, walls and hedges come under the buildings part of a household policy, but are not generally covered for flood or storm damage. What should households do to protect their gardens? Insurers offer a number of tips; · Lock items away overnight in a secure garage or shed. · Fit a security light to illuminate late-night theft. · Plant prickly bushes and plants around the border of the property. · Remove keys from ride-on mowers. · If you have particularly valuable items, consider fitting an alarm.
