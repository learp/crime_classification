Two British women will face court in Jamaica tomorrow after being arrested on suspicion of attempting to smuggle £170,000 of cocaine, hidden in wigs, to London.The women, aged 17 and 20 and from the Derby area, were detained when the drugs, believed to weigh around 2.3kg, were found stitched into hairpieces, a spokeswoman for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said.The women - both unemployed - told police they expected to be paid £4,000 for smuggling the drugs into the country, the spokeswoman said. The arrests were made under Operation Airbridge, a partnership between Jamaica and the UK launched in June 2002 and aimed at catching drug couriers before they board UK-bound planes in Jamaica. "The dedication of the UK and Jamaican drugs detection officers has prevented deadly class A drugs from entering the UK," said Tony Walker, the head of the operation. "The operation is delivering real results". HMRC said that the number of drug smugglers detected at UK airports arriving on flights from Jamaica fell from around 1,000 a year to five in 2007.
