The high court today ordered Essex police to rethink a crime-bashing poster campaign featuring mug-shots of convicted criminals after a burglar took legal action claiming the adverts breached his human rights.Gary Ellis has claimed a legal victory in the test case he brought against the force, which planned to use his photograph on posters in his home town of Brentwood to deter youngsters from getting into crime, in what his lawyers described as a "maverick scheme".However, the high court made it clear it was not outlawing the ads altogether, but merely seeking "more information"."The court states that there is a need for appraisal and monitoring of the scheme and a structured assessment of the risks involved, backed by more information and appropriate professional advice," said the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, sitting with Mr Justice Goldring."However, the court is not prepared to declare that following such an assessment the scheme could not be operated lawfully for a trial period," he added.Ellis, 28, who is serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for theft, claimed the planned poster campaign - which would feature his face on more than 40 sites in Brentwood - would breach his right to a private and family life under article eight of the European convention on human rights.A divorced father of a five-year-old daughter, Ellis also argued his family would be unfairly and unlawfully stigmatised as a result of the campaign.Earlier this year he gained a temporary injunction against the poster campaign.Police claimed that displaying the posters for a trial period was a justified attempt to warn off potential criminals, and to prove to members of the public that they are not letting criminals "get away with it"."All we are asking is for the right to adopt this policy subject to safeguards for the rights of individuals whom it is going to effect," said Anne Studd, appearing for the chief constable of Essex.Other police forces are also considering introducing the scheme, the brainchild of Sergeant Piers Quinnell, which proposed featuring mug-shots of six criminals accused of "core offences" such as burglary, drug-dealing and car theft on A3- and A4-sized posters at sites including railway and bus stations and garages over a one-year period.Â· To give MediaGuardian a story email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857
