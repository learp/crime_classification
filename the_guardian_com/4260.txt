A chef who stabbed his girlfriend 40 times and waited five hours before calling 999 has been told he will spend at least 22 years in prison.Steven Williams, 31, went berserk with a kitchen knife following an argument with new girlfriend Joanna Hall at her flat in Tenby, west Wales, last year.The alcoholic growled at the 35-year-old "will you just die" – before leaving her to suffer as she bled from several deep slash and stab wounds.When he eventually did call paramedics, Williams claimed a madman must have broken into the flat while he had popped out to buy alcohol.But Hall was able to describe the attack from her hospital bed. She died three weeks later from her injuries.Despite the damning evidence against him, Williams continued to stick to his story throughout his trial at Swansea crown court – where a jury eventually convicted him of murder.Sentencing Williams to life in prison, judge Justice Nicola Davies described him as "brutal", "callous" but "not sadistic".She said: "You did not take a knife to Joanna's flat and you did not go there intending to murder her."Joanna was an emotionally vulnerable woman who was physically smaller than you."This was a sustained and brutal attack using a knife on a defenceless victim."You stabbed her more than 20 times, on occasion penetrating organs within her body."You denied the Joanna the medical attention that she so urgently needed."In doing so, you were cruelly and callously indifferent to her condition."Williams was handed a mandatory life term.Williams' trial heard that after stabbing Hall on March 16 he continued smoking and drinking, watching her bleed.When he eventually did ring 999, he gave out the operators the wrong address and was heard laughing as he spoke to the operator – later claiming it was due to his "shock".When Hall was eventually airlifted to Swansea's Morriston Hospital she told paramedics, police and her devastated family at her bedside exactly what had happened to her.She later slipped into a coma and then died 19 days later as a result of loss of blood and injuries caused by Williams – which included a cut to her liver and stomach.Experts said Hall would have been likely to have survived if she had been treated more quickly.Following Williams's conviction, the prosecution had demanded Williams be subjected to a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years.However, Davies said having analysed the facts of the case and similar trials she was not satisfied Williams met the criteria of "sadistic conduct" required to impose a minimum three-decade prison term.She added while Williams had lost his temper during a 2am argument and the attack "was not a premeditated assault", that still did not excuse his actions.The judge said he left Hall to die in order to "save his own skin".The court heard how he had told his dying girlfriend: "I did not want this to happen but I will have to kill you now because I do not want to go back to prison."Hall's relatives said they would never come to terms with their cruel loss.A statement read by family friend Tony Oram said: "Williams is an evil monster who needs to be locked away so that he can't hurt anyone else in the same way as Jo."Deborah Rogers, of Crown Prosecution Service Wales, said: "It is hard to imagine what motivates an individual to commit such a vicious and callous act."Only Steven Williams could answer that, but so far he has refused to acknowledge his responsibility for this terrible incident."
