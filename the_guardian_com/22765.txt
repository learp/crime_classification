A teenager has been convicted of murdering a man during a brawl at Westfield Stratford shopping centre only weeks before the 2012 Olympic Games.Nii-Azu Kojo-Smith, 19, of Hackney, east London, was accused of stabbing Liam Woodards, 24, during a fight involving two gangs on 29 June 2012.Following a three-month retrial at the Old Bailey, he was found guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one.The jury heard there were a number of verbal exchanges and "an atmosphere of menace" began building as the two groups confronted each other inside the shopping centre.A glass and a yoghurt pot had been thrown by Woodards' group, then a third item landed on or near Kojo-Smith's group with one of the pots landing on or near Kojo-Smith.Aftab Jafferjee QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Woodards "did not throw anything. His only crime was to have been mouthy."His misfortune was to be closest to Kojo-Smith who was confronting the other man just before the item landed." Kojo-Smith pulled out a knife and, as Woodards backed away, he was stabbed.Jafferjee added: "In an utterly disproportionate and lethal reaction, Kojo-Smith lunged forward and stabbed the retreating Liam Woodards in the chest."This was as needless as it was cowardly. Mr Woodards was an easy and mouthy target."As one gang fled, some gang members, who were seeking revenge for Woodards' stabbing, chased them to Stratford underground station where one rival was stabbed in the shoulder and another was hit with a belt.The attackers fled when they spotted a police community support officer coming up a nearby escalator.The whole incident, which occurred only weeks before the 2012 Olympics, was caught by the extensive CCTV installed because of heightened fears that terrorists could target the games during the games.The jury spent 67 hours over 13 days considering its verdict.Two co-defendants were also convicted of violent disorder. Tony Caton, 22, was convicted of two counts relating to disorder inside the shopping centre and outside Stratford underground station, and Anselm Legemah, 19, was convicted of one count of violent disorder inside the shopping centre.Five others defendants were cleared of the same charge. Sentencing will take place on Monday.The previous trial last July collapsed after nearly three months because of what was described as an "irretrievable breakdown" among the jurors.On Friday Judge Richard Marks QC, commended the retrial jury. Excusing them from jury service for the next seven years, he told them: "It is very apparent to me, and no doubt to everyone else involved in this case, how assiduously you have carried out your duties, not only during the time evidence was being heard, when you on a number of occasions sent some extremely pertinent notes asking relevant questions."The judge also praised the jury for the time that it had taken over its deliberations and the thought that had been put into the verdicts.
