A man who was doused in petrol and set on fire by a gang in Northern Ireland this week has died in hospital, police said today.Thomas O'Hare, 33, and his 21-year-old girlfriend, Lisa McClatchey, were attacked by a gang of masked men at their home near the market town of Keady, Co Armagh, at around 9pm on Monday.Ms McClatchey, who ran to a neighbour's house for help while on fire, remains in a critical condition in the burns unit of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Detectives - who are treating Mr O'Hare's death as murder - are investigating whether four brothers who admitted themselves to a hospital in the Republic of Ireland with severe burns around an hour after the attack are linked to his death.The men, aged between 24 and 34, went to a hospital in Dundalk. They have since been transferred to a specialist burns unit at St James's Hospital in Dublin, where they remain seriously ill.It is believed it could be weeks before the men are well enough to be questioned by detectives. They are understood to be from the south Armagh area, and police have confirmed that officers searched an address in Clady, south Armagh.Nobody has been charged in connection with the attack. Police in Northern Ireland believe up to six people were involved, and Garda detectives are also involved in the investigation.Detectives have ruled out a sectarian or racist motive for the attack, and have said they are following a definite line of inquiry.Nationalist SDLP councillor Sharon Haughey suggested Mr O'Hare had been the target of a vigilante attack, and it was reported that he may recently have been involved in some form of confrontation.Mr O'Hare, a Roman Catholic, was understood to have separated from his wife - the mother of his two children, both aged under 12 - three years ago. Ms McClatchey is related to a former senior Orangeman.On Wednesday, the Democratic Unionist leader, the Rev Ian Paisley, urged Sinn Fein to encourage people with information to pass it on to the police.Mr Paisley said the Armagh inquiry was a "litmus test" for the party's attitude towards law and order.
