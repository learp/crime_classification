A Ferrari owned by the singer Jay Kay and reputed to be worth almost £1m had its windows shattered after it was left parked outside a hotel in the seaside town of Aldeburgh.The driver-side window and the windscreen of the black Ferrari Enzo were targeted in the attack early this morning, which allegedly followed a row. Shards of glass were sprayed across the road outside the Brudenell hotel, where the star was staying.A 21-year-old man from the Suffolk resort was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.Kay, 39, who fronts the band Jamiroquai and is famed for his love of fast cars, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Suffolk police said: "A 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and is in custody at Lowestoft police station."A local man who was at the hotel last night, and who did not want to be named, said Kay "had come to Aldeburgh to get some fish and chips".He said: "I arrived at the hotel at about 6pm and Jay Kay shouted at me to come over. He had seen me arrive in my car and wanted to talk about it. I was driving a Supra. He said it was not in the same league as his car. He said [his] had cost about £900,000. He said it was the first car of its type in the country."
