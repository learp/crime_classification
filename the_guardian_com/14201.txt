Police tonight released a 34-year-old man on bail after questioning him over the possible disposal of a car at the centre of investigations into the murder of the schoolgirl Milly Dowler.The man, arrested in Hounslow, west London, at 6.30am today, was held "for questioning about the potential disposal of a red Daewoo Nexia which police have been appealing for as part of the investigation into the murder of Milly Dowler", a Surrey police spokeswoman said.Last month, officers said Levi Bellfield, jailed for life for murdering two young women, was a suspect in the 13-year-old's disappearance, in part due to evidence about a car owned by his former partner.A repeated theme of police appeals over the case has been a call for anyone from wreckers' yards who might have information about the disposal of such a car to come forward. Milly disappeared on the afternoon of March 21 2002 at Walton-on-Thames, in Surrey. Her remains were found six months later in Yateley Heath woods, near Fleet, Hampshire. Bellfield, a 39-year-old former nightclub bouncer, was jailed for the rest of his life last month for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, a 22-year-old French student, Marsha McDonnell, a gap year student aged 19, and the attempted murder of 18-year-old Kate Sheedy. Immediately after his conviction, detectives leading the hunt for Milly's killer revealed information potentially linking Bellfield to the crime. They had not been able to discuss the information while he was being tried.The evidence centred on CCTV film showing a red Daewoo Nexia at a junction of the road on which Milly was last seen. The footage – only discovered a year after her disappearance – was taken on the day she vanished.Police learned that Emma Mills, Bellfield's partner at the time that Milly was snatched and mother of three of his children, owned such a car. Mills rented a flat nearby and reported her car stolen four days after Milly was abducted. It also emerged that, the day before Milly vanished, a man fitting Bellfield's description and driving a red Daewoo Nexia had approached another 13-year-old schoolgirl.She told police, but the information was not initially passed to the team looking for Milly's killer.
