The wife of the back-from-the-dead canoeist John Darwin "coolly" played the part of the grieving widow to save the family from bankruptcy, a court heard today.Anne Darwin, 56, of Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, convinced insurance companies, a coroner and, "more poignantly", her sons that he had died in a canoe accident, Teesside crown court heard.She denies six counts of deception and nine of money laundering, which relate to her alleged activity after Darwin's disappearance in March 2002.Andrew Robertson QC, prosecuting, told the jury: "They were at risk of being made bankrupt - the shame and embarrassment of which neither of them wished to face. The initial idea may well have been John Darwin's rather than Anne's but, in the crown's submission, it was a scheme in which Anne Darwin not only played an equal and vital role, but it was a role which she played with superb aplomb."Robertson said the facts of the case were largely not in dispute, but Mrs Darwin's defence was an unusual one of "marital coercion". The prosecutor said she had carried out much of the fraud on her own initiative and had not been forced into the plot by her husband.The court was told that the thought of an idyllic life abroad drove Mrs Darwin to keep up the pretence. The jury was shown a photograph of the couple taken at an estate agent's office in Panama in 2006, when they were looking for property to buy with the proceeds of the fraud.Debts had been mounting in the Darwin household in the months before he staged his death, and the couple's Â£245,000 mortgage, which they took out to buy around a dozen properties in the Durham area, had become too much of a burden, the jury heard."To the outside world, it might have appeared that they therefore were relatively well-heeled, but they were, of course, heavily indebted to the bank and their financial position began to worsen considerably over the next two years," Robertson said.The court heard that by the time the fraud was uncovered, the insurance money had been transferred to Panama, in South America, where Mrs Darwin was then living, and had been invested in land, property and foreign bank accounts in her name.A full air and sea search was launched after Mrs Darwin reported her husband missing in his canoe. Robertson told the jury Mrs Darwin's act was so good she even took in trained police officers appointed to counsel her.When she was asked to identify a body found off the coast months later, Mrs Darwin burst into tears and said she wanted it to be John's so he could be laid to rest, the jury heard. The court was told the Darwins' sons, Mark, 32, and Anthony, 29, were kept completely in the dark by their parents' deception. Robertson said: "Anne Darwin clearly thought nothing of lying to her sons in this way and convincing them that their own father was lost at sea and dead in order to see this fraud through to its conclusion."The trial continues.
