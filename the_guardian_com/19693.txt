On Thursday, Ruby Thomas and Joel Alexander were convicted of the manslaughter of Ian Baynham, who died after a drunken and vicious homophobic assault in Trafalgar Square in September last year. Thomas, who led the unprovoked attack, was clearly a deeply disturbed 17-year-old, and you didn't have to look too far into her background for some of the possible psychology behind her violent rage.In 2003, her father had been convicted of manslaughter in the same Old Bailey courtroom after stabbing a taxi driver 28 times. She had, as one result, a history of depression and an addictive tendency toward binge-drinking, which had been exaggerated by a recent ectopic pregnancy. At the age of 15, she had assaulted a bus driver, kicking and punching him in the back of the head and had earned another conviction for possessing a knife.The headline shorthand that all the reports of her latest, horrific crime chose to use about her, however, were "former public school girl Ruby Thomas", as if she were some sheltered and privileged St Trinian inexplicably gone bad; the rest of her biography was buried in the reports, or ignored, while we were asked to dwell on her £12,000-a-year school fees and her mother's £300,000 house.Thomas had attended Sydenham High School while her father was in prison, before she was expelled "for unspecified reasons". It wouldn't be hard to argue that some of the other experiences of her young life might have outweighed any perceived educational opportunity that she had spurned in that time, but that didn't stop the profiles emphasising her schooling as her defining characteristic. Some chose to quote from the Sydenham prospectus: "We know our girls and they know us... their school is very proud of them" or suggested the ironies of claims about a "supportive and caring" environment.There are many ways to begin to understand a crime. The narrative we still resort to, though, invariably involves loaded inferences about class, as if nothing else ever counted.
