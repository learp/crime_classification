Two teenagers were facing jail terms today after they admitted killing a promising graduate in a row over litter.Evren Anil, 23, died from serious head injuries after being threatened with a knife and punched to the ground.The argument started after one of the youths threw a chocolate bar wrapper through the victim's car window in Crystal Palace, south-east London, in August last year.A 16-year-old youth from Thornton Heath, south-east London, yesterday pleaded guilty to manslaughter and knife possession as his trial was due to begin at the Old Bailey.His plea could only be reported today after his 17-year-old co-defendant, from Tottenham, north London, also admitted the two charges today.Judge Ann Goddard told the pair, who cannot be named because of their ages: "It seems to me custody is the appropriate outcome."Sentencing will take place at a later date after the judge hears legal argument about the precise version of events, which is disputed.The 17-year-old admits throwing a wrapper through the window of Anil's car, the court heard.Jo Korner QC, prosecuting, said: "Having done so the defendant was confronted by the deceased and a verbal dispute ensued."There was some physical contact between the two involving the deceased grabbing the defendant's T-shirt. This resulted in the defendant punching the deceased."She said the 17-year-old also admitted taking out a knife to frighten Anil but claimed he did not intend to use it, then passed it to the other teenager.Korner said the 16-year-old's version of events, that "at no stage did he threaten Anil with a knife" and only used the weapon to threaten another man, was not accepted.Further details of what the younger boy admitted were not read out in court.
