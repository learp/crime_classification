The funeral of a solicitor shot dead in his driveway by Derrick Bird took place today.Kevin Joseph Commons, 60, was the second victim of Bird's rampage through west Cumbria last Wednesday.Commons was the Bird family solicitor, and a good friend of the killer's twin brother, David.A dispute over a will has been suggested as one of the reasons why Commons was murdered.He was believed to have arranged to meet Bird and his brother David on the day of the massacre.Instead, Bird waited for him to leave his home in Frizington that morning before shooting him dead.Today, at the second funeral of Bird's 12 victims, around 150 mourners attended St John the Evangelist Church in Workington for a private service open only to family, close friends and work colleagues of Commons.Commons was a senior partner at KJ Commons, the legal firm he founded, and after the hymn, Praise My Soul the King of Heaven, Tim Frost, also a partner in the firm, gave a eulogy.Canon John Kelly, a retired vicar but known to Commons's family, also gave an address to mourners.He said: "What can we say in the face of such horror and tragedy that took place nine days ago which led to the terrible killings of Kevin and 11 other people in this locality as well as those who were seriously injured?"The sheer magnitude of what happened on that fateful day defies belief."And I realise that a man or woman of the cloth faces a hiding to nothing as they stand up to offer any words of comfort or consolation in this situation."Kelly then quoted from the Old Testament when the prophet Job had lost everything: "Even though He slay me, yet will I put my trust in Him."The order of service included a photograph of a Lakeland scene with a quote by DH Lawrence: "The Dead don't die - they look on and help."The 45-minute service ended with the commendation and an old Gaelic blessing.The Prince of Wales was also in Workington today meeting bereaved families, church leaders and emergency service staff.The funeral of David Bird, the gunman's twin brother, is scheduled for Monday at St Michael's Church in Lamplugh, the small hamlet where he was shot dead.Also on Monday, Mike Pike, the 64-year-old former Sellafield worker who was killed by Bird while cycling through Seascale, will be cremated at a private service.
