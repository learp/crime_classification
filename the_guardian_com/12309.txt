A nail bomb exploded today inside a car belonging to a teacher at a leading Liverpool school, police said.The explosion, shortly before 3pm, seriously damaged the vehicle parked outside St Edward's College, a private Catholic school in West Derby. No one was injured in the blast.Speaking outside the school, Superintendent Ian Pilling from Merseyside Police said the explosion appeared to have been timed to coincide with the end of the school day.The car was about 10 metres from the school building when the device, inside the vehicle, exploded, Mr Pilling said."An explosive device had been placed inside the car," he said."At this stage we can't say exactly what device it was but it was detonated inside the vehicle."This was a despicable offence. Children were in the process of leaving. Nobody was killed or injured but that was down to good luck."There was no damage other than to the car, another officer, Inspector Michael O'Callaghan, said, describing the device as a nail bomb.Roads around the school grounds, which is a few miles outside Liverpool city centre, were cordoned off by police. The school was evacuated immediately after the device went off.
