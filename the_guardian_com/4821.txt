The decision to lift the order granting anonymity to Mohammed Ilyas Khan was made because the sex scandal went beyond his private life and touched on his public role. Mr Khan, a barrister who worked as a part-time judge in the criminal courts as well as serving at Hatton Cross, near Heathrow, as an immigration judge, was known throughout the trial as Judge I.But yesterday the Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont, agreed to the media's request to lift Mr Khan's right to anonymity."The jury did not find the allegation of blackmail, which was centred on his testimony, proved. Beyond that, 'I', in the course of his testimony in this court, in particular during the cross-examination, accepted criticisms of his private life and, to a degree, of his public life," Mr Beaumont said. "The finding of the jury in respect of the allegation of theft of his property does not in my judgment entitle the court to continue protection over his identity."Mr Khan, 60, was educated at the Duke of Gloucester school in Nairobi, Kenya, and called to the bar in 1969. He was married and has an 18-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son.He began working part-time in the asylum and immigration system in 1983, becoming a full-time adjudicator in 1992 and an immigration judge in 2005. He was appointed a recorder of the crown court in 1996.He met Judge J, the female immigration judge, through work, and the couple lived together for five years until they separated in 2000.Mr Beaumont ruled that "J" was entitled to remain anonymous as she had been a victim of blackmail.
