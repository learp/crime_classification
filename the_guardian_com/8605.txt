A man has been given an asbo banning him from carrying felt tip pens in public after writing abusive comments about women in public lavatories and buses. David Jell, 49, is also prohibited from carrying spray paint and displaying rude comments or nicknames in a public place under the terms of the three-year order. Magistrates in Sevenoaks, Kent, served Jell with the order on 22 December after hearing that he had committed criminal damage and harassment between January and September 2007. Police said he wrote abusive comments about women he took a dislike to, and also drew the attention of his victims to rude or distressing words or images he wrote on his newspaper as he travelled on the bus. There was no reason behind him choosing the women he targeted other than that he saw them on a bus he frequently used or that they lived or worked locally, a spokesman said.PC Debs Rudkin, of Kent police, praised the victims for coming forward, saying it would not have been possible to convict Jell without their evidence. Chief Inspector Russell Nyman said: "The asbo should ensure we do not see a repeat of this type of behaviour. We do take reports of this nature very seriously."
