A South African judge has accepted that any undertaking to hold the British businessman Shrien Dewani in safe and humane conditions if he were extradited from the UK and jailed could not be guaranteed indefinitely.Prosecutors want Dewani, who is accused of organising the murder of his wife, Anni, in a staged car-jacking near Cape Town last November, to be sent back to South Africa to face trial.The department of correctional services in South Africa has said Dewani, 31, would be held at one of three named prisons in a single cell while he awaited trial and if he were convicted.Judge Deon Hurter Van Zyl, who heads an independent inspectorate that monitors conditions in South African prisons, told the extradition hearing in London that Dewani would be safe and well cared for if held in any of those three institutions. But he also conceded that the commissioner who gave the undertaking could not bind his successors to respect it.Van Zyl also accepted that if circumstances altered in South Africa, including, for example, if there were a big increase in crime, the commissioner might also have to re-consider the promise.Dewani, from Bristol, strongly denies the accusation that he arranged to have his wife killed. A key argument in his resistance to extradition is that his life would be in danger, and so his human rights impinged, due to the conditions in South African prisons.The court has heard that South African prisons are rife with gang violence, sexual abuse and disease. One expert called by the defence argued that Dewani's looks, allegations about his sexuality, and the nature of his alleged crime, would make him a target for violence behind bars.Van Zyl has expressed concern in the past about "critically overcrowded" prisons, and shortly before giving evidence at the Dewani extradition hearing received a text message that told of the 276th death in a South African jail this year. He described that figure as "a bit more than it should be".Van Zyl said the pledge concerning where Dewani would be held if extradited from the UK was "surprising", but he welcomed it. He described the new prison where Dewani would be held on remand as "in a class of its own".A second centre where Dewani would be held if found guilty and sentenced to less than 25 years, had been described as "like a five-star hotel", he said. The judge also said he was satisfied Dewani would be properly looked after at the third prison, which he would go if his sentence was for more than 25 years.But under cross-examination by Dewani's barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, Van Zyl accepted that the undertaking had been given by a commissioner who would have to think again if circumstances changed.Van Zyl also accepted that he could not force his successor to fulfil his promise to monitor Dewani's treatment closely. He said that commonsense suggested that "in all probability" that the undertakings would be respected.Montgomery also asked Van Zyl about the claim made by the South African campaign group Friends Against Abuse that it was 99.9% guaranteed that a detainee would be abused or violated en route to prison. Van Zyl had called this claim "absurd" and said he had grave doubts about the figure. But Montgomery told him the group that made the claim had been founded by one of his own inspectors, Lizelle Albertse.The South African authorities have said that if Dewani goes on trial there will be a prosecution witness claiming that before his marriage to Anni, 28, Dewani allegedly revealed that he "needed to find a way out" of the relationship but would be disowned by his family if he broke off his engagement to her.The hearing continues.
