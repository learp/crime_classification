A man has admitted murdering an 82-year-old model-railway enthusiast who was found in his home with 40 knife wounds.David Hall, 47, pleaded guilty to killing Dennis Plater, in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in November last year. Plater, was discovered at his detached home on 7 November.Police arrested Hall, from Stroud, more than 100 miles away in Southsea, Hampshire, two days later. Hall had denied murder during a hearing at Bristol crown court in February, but he changed his plea at an appearance before the same court on Thursday.Judge Neil Ford QC, the recorder of Bristol, adjourned the case and remanded Hall in custody. Hall, who wore tracksuit bottoms and a red T-shirt, spoke only to confirm his name and plea during the hearing. Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, said a further hearing was required to establish whether the attack was to steal money. “We will also consider whether it was a matter involving sadistic conduct given the nature and the number and the location of the 40 fresh knife injuries he sustained,” Quinlan added.Jonathan Challinor, defending, insisted the murder had not been for financial gain. The judge said he would hear evidence about the issue during the sentencing hearing. Plater’s family paid tribute to the pensioner following his death, describing him as a “beloved husband, father, brother and grandfather”.“Dennis and his wife Mary moved to Stroud in 2004 to be closer to their daughter and her family; they had come to call it home,” they said. “Dennis enjoyed crafts, tapestry and was most happy tinkering with his model railway.“It is incomprehensible that we have lost Dennis in this way, and the family would like to ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. We thank all the Gloucestershire police force for their hard work, help and support.”
