Detectives investigating the murder of a pensioner in Northern Ireland over Christmas have arrested two people. The Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed the pair were held near the crime scene on Newry's Lower Dublin Road. A spokesman for the PSNI said that a man aged 39 and a 42-year-old woman had been taken into custody for questioning over the killing of Maire Rankin, 81, who was found dead at her home at around 10am on Christmas Day.Police were called after relatives became concerned that she was failing to answer phone calls. Yesterday the PSNI said that they were treating the death as murder following a postmortem on Friday. Detective Chief Inspector Gareth Talbot, who is leading the murder investigation, said: "This is a particularly dreadful crime, coming as it did on Christmas Day." Local councillor in Newry, Jack Patterson, said that the entire community was stunned by the death. He said: "She was a lovely lady. The family is very nice - she was a very gentle lady and did a lot of charity work. She was well liked by the whole community. I was at the house earlier and it is terrible to see the Christmas tree through the window. I know the family. Maire was married to Gerry Rankin, a well-respected member of the community, but he died 10 years ago."
