A man accused of raping and sexually assaulting a series of elderly people over a 17-year period appeared in court for the first time today.Delroy Grant, the alleged "night stalker" serial rapist, was charged with a series of sex attacks and burglaries and was remanded in police custody after a brief hearing at Greenwich magistrates court.The 52-year-old father from Brockley, south-east London, faces 22 charges including five rapes, six indecent assaults and 11 burglaries since 1992. Grant, who was shaven-headed, appeared in the dock wearing a police-issue white tracksuit, and spoke only to confirm his details.Prosecutor Denise Clewes asked for him to be remanded into police custody for three days as inquiries continue, adding that "further charges are likely".Janet Lloyd, for the defence, made no application for bail.Grant was arrested on Sunday after an extensive surveillance operation, named Operation Minstead, set up to investigate 108 crimes that police believe were carried out by one suspect, dubbed the "night stalker".Police revealed earlier this month that more than 2,000 DNA samples were taken during the 12-year operation, at a cost of more than Â£100,000, in what is believed to be the largest hunt for a serial rapist ever conducted.The attacker is alleged to have broken into the homes of his south London victims, thought to be between the ages of 68 and 93, before carrying out a series of vicious sexual assaults, burglaries and rapes. Most of the attacks took place over the summer months, according to court records.Grant is accused of five rapes: in Shirley, Croydon, in October 1992; at an unnamed location in Surrey in September 1998; Croydon in July 1999; and two offences in Orpington on 5 August 1999.He is also accused of six indecent assaults: in Beckenham in June 1999; Croydon in July 1999; Shirley in August 1999 and October 2002; an unnamed location in Surrey in September 1998; and Addiscombe in July 1999.Grant is also accused of a spate of burglaries across south-east London and Surrey, including Bromley, Shirley, Addiscombe, Orpington, West Dulwich and Beckenham, between October 1992 and May 2009.Grant was a full-time carer for his wife, Jennifer, who has multiple sclerosis and has used a wheelchair for five years.Today neighbours described the row of three-storey terraced homes where he lived as a very close community which was shocked at Grant's arrest. He had four children: older twin girls and two younger sons aged 17 and 12, they said."He was brilliant," said one neighbour, who did not want to be named. He said that Grant would come with his wife and sons for community barbecues. "He was a genuinely nice person."
