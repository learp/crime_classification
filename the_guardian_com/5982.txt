A police officer known for his work tackling drug dealers was found dead at his home from a heroin overdose.PC David Pilling, 47, was found by colleagues collapsed in the lounge of his flat in north London.They discovered traces of heroin and various items of drug paraphernalia, including a Stanley knife and a syringe, beside him. An inquiry was launched and toxicology tests revealed the officer had died from a huge overdose of heroin.Detectives found no suspicious circumstances and the case was handed to a coroner. A Metropolitan police spokesman said a verdict of death by misadventure was recorded earlier this week.The news came as a police constable and a police community support officer were charged with drugs offences in Slough. Thames Valley police said today that PC Matthew Alan Kille, 30, and PCSO Lisa Slavin, 20, had been charged with wilful misconduct in public office, possession of cocaine and possession with intent to supply cocaine.They will appear at Swindon magistrates court on 20 August following their arrest in May.Colleagues said Pilling was renowned for his work tackling drug dealers operating in busy Camden shopping streets.Camden borough's commander, Chief Superintendent Dominic Clout, said PC Pilling had been a dedicated officer who was sorely missed. "Clearly, PC Pilling displayed no signs of drug use while at Camden borough and his colleagues and supervisors were unaware of any issues relating to drugs," he said.The Met had an anti-alcohol and substance misuse policy which included random screening of serving officers, he added. "While we will always support and actively seek help for colleagues who alert us of potential problems through challenging or difficult times, we will never tolerate the use of drugs amongst officers and will deal with any reported cases severely."Pilling died on 26 March. .
