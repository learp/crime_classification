Senior police officers in London revealed yesterday that they would be publishing a quarterly breakdown of stop and search figures for the first time in response to an outcry about "racist" spot checking.Andy Hayman, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said powers to stop and search people were necessary in the fight against the terror threat, which he said remained high and enduring in London. He revealed that suspect activity reports from businesses and security firms have increased by 37% in the first four months of this year. But he acknowledged that the rise may be due to increased awareness of the threat of terrorism.Mr Hayman told a meeting of the Metropolitan police authority that police will continue to use section 44 stop and search powers under the Terrorism Act 2000, which allow officers to stop and question anyone in a designated area without having to give a reason. Figures released to the MPA yesterday show that Asian people are 30% more likely to be stopped than others in London, and within the City of London they are 80% more likely to be stopped.Mr Hayman said that, having listened to the people of London, he had decided to change the long-running policy of the Met not to publish data on stops. Peter Herbert, a member of the authority, said the move was long overdue, but added that a large proportion of the stops were unlawful and counterproductive.
