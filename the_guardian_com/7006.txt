The leader of a gang of gun dealers who have been jailed for a total of 45 years was able to direct operations from his prison cell using a secret mobile phone.Ishmael Brown was one of five members of a ring that sold more than 40 guns in London. He sought deactivated weapons from his cell in HMP Rochester and his girlfriend Caitlin Adams collected and carried them. Brown’s fellow inmate Ehsen Abdul-Razak also used an illicit mobile phone to organise sales.The gang was caught after two of its members, Aaron Murray and Uzair Patel, were found with a reactivated 9mm semi-automatic pistol by police while they were in a minicab in east London in June 2015.Officers worked out that Murray had been buying the weapons and having them reactivated at a workshop run by former Polish soldier Bart Pawlowski. His expertise as a metalworker and his military background enabled him to make ammunition.Police said that an AK47-style weapon was among the more than 40 guns sourced by the gang in the six months up to Murray and Patel’s arrests. Both Brown and Adams were pictured posing with a similar weapon.According to the Metropolitan police, eight reactivated firearms linked to the gang have been recovered, with investigations ongoing to find the rest.Brown, 26, Murray, 28, Patel, 28, and Abdul-Razak, 19, all pleaded guilty to firearms offences. Brown was jailed for 12 years and Patel and Abdul-Razak to five each. Murray’s sentencing has been adjourned until March pending psychiatric reports.Both Pawlowski, 42, and Adams, 25, were found guilty of conspiracy to transfer prohibited weapons and were jailed for 13 and 10 years respectively.DC Claire Gentles, the investigating officer, said: “The firearms and ammunition this gang converted had the potential to cause great harm on the streets of London and there is no doubt that the capital is a safer place as a result of the network being dismantled.“The sentencing of Caitlin Adams should serve as a warning to others of the grave consequences of storing and transporting guns for others.”Met police detective inspector James Hale said: “This was a complex investigation targeting criminals both inside and outside of prison as part of the Met’s fight against gang and gun crime. We successfully collaborated with our colleagues in the prison service to recover the mobile phones and I would like to pay tribute to my detectives who have worked tirelessly to make communities safer and see this case to its successful conclusion.“I would like to take this opportunity to urge anyone with knowledge of the whereabouts of any of the outstanding weapons to contact police.”
