A social worker has been stabbed to death while visiting a home on what neighbours describe as a "quiet" street in Preston.Police launched a murder investigation after they were called to a knife attack in Glebe Close, Fulwood.They arrived shortly after 11.30am and found the victim, 48, with stab wounds. He died shortly afterwards.The victim has not been formally identified but worked for Lancashire county council.Police said a man who was at the scene in an "agitated state" when they arrived had been arrested."We are not in a position to release any further details at this stage," said a spokesman for Lancashire police. "The man has been arrested and taken to Preston police station."Lancashire council confirmed the victim was from its adult and community services department.Chris Cheetham, cabinet member for the department, said: "My first thoughts are with his family and friends. It is a dreadful loss."I don't expect to get messages saying a member of my staff has been killed."Some of our social workers work with people who have the potential to do harm, mostly to themselves but also to other people."I know social workers get a lousy press, but it should remind people they do an important and sometimes dangerous job."Detectives sealed off the scene as onlookers gathered nearby.Martin Hooper, 24, a nearby resident, told local papers: "I have lived here for two years and it is very quiet."I know the house next door to me is a carer's house. My partner rang up and was worried to bring our children home."It is horrible to have this happen to a neighbour."
