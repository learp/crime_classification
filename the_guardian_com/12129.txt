A succession of crises at the Home Office has caused "immense damage" to the department, its top civil servant admitted today, in an echo of comments made by the home secretary earlier in the week.Sir David Normington told an audience of senior police officers that he deeply regretted the sacking of former home secretary Charles Clarke over the foreign prisoner scandal.In the speech at the Association of Chief Police Officers annual conference in London's Docklands, Sir David said: "These are quite difficult times to be in the Home Office, as you can imagine."I am a master of understatement, actually. I think it was Roy Jenkins, a former home secretary, who said that in the Home Office tropical storms blow up out of a clear blue sky."That certainly seems a good description of my first few months in the job," the Home Office permanent secretary added."In the last few weeks it's seemed more like a hurricane than a storm. It caused the departure from government of the former home secretary, which is a matter of great personal regret to me. "It has inflicted immense damage on the Home Office's reputation, it has undermined confidence in our ability to protect the public and secure our borders and made it impossible, for the moment, to have a rational debate about the plans that we have for future improvement."On Tuesday, John Reid made a brutally frank assessment of the department's shortcomings when he appeared in front of the home affairs select committee. The home secretary told MPs that the Home Office was "not fit for the purpose: averse to a culture of personal responsibility, technologically ill-equipped for an era of mass migration and led by officials that are incapable of producing facts or figures that remain accurate for even a short period of time"."I'm almost always defending the indefensible here. I do not think I have been given a fact or a figure in the past fortnight that has not been revised quickly in a very short space of time," Mr Reid said, adding it was "inadequate in terms of its scope, it's inadequate in terms of its information technology, leadership, management, systems and processes".Less than 24 hours after his appearance, Mr Reid was forced to write to the committee after figures he had given about progress in placing released foreign prisoners in custody turned out to be inaccurate.Mr Reid apologised to the both the Speaker, Michael Martin, and the chairman of the home affairs select committee, John Denham.A furious Mr Reid, despite having no power to sack civil servants, was nevertheless pleased that one senior civil servant responsible for overseeing the figures had been removed from his post, the first Whitehall official to face sanction for the fiasco.Mr Reid has also asked the permanent secretary to move another official earlier than planned. In his letters, Mr Reid said it was unacceptable that he had been placed in a position of having to apologise for inaccurate figures.
