A former music teacher at Chetham's school of music in Manchester who was arrested on suspicion of rape in summer has been rearrested after being accused of raping another young woman.Malcolm Layfield, 61, who taught strings at the Â£31,000-a-year private school before moving to the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM) in Manchester, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of the rape and indecent assault of a woman between 1988 and 1991 when she was aged between 18 and 21.He was originally arrested on 7 August in connection with the rape of three teenagers, aged 16, 16 and 18, between 1980 and 1991 while he was teaching at Chetham's.He has been bailed until 18 February 2014, pending further inquiries.This year, Layfield resigned as head of strings at the RNCM when it emerged that police were investigating allegations against him. In a statement in February the RNCM said: "Professor Malcolm Layfield has left his post as head of school of strings, his position at the college having become untenable."Chetham's has been at the centre of an ever-widening abuse investigation since the school's former head of music, Michael Brewer, was convicted in February of indecently assaulting a teenage pupil. His victim, Frances Andrade, killed herself after giving evidence against him at his trial. Brewer was jailed for six years in March and was stripped of his OBE by the Queen in May.Layfield is the fourth person to be arrested as part of GMP's abuse inquiry, codenamed Operation Kiso.In February Wen Zhou Li, a tutor at both Chetham's and the RNCM, was arrested on suspicion of rape. He has been bailed until 17 December 2013.In May Duncan McTier, 58, currently professor of double bass at the Royal Academy of Music in London, was arrested at his home in London. He was questioned in relation to the alleged indecent assault of a woman in 1994 when she was a pupil at the RNCM. McTier taught part-time at the RNCM from 1984 to 1996 and is now an internationally acclaimed musician.On 26 June another former teacher was arrested on suspicion of the indecent assault and attempted buggery of a 15-year-old Chetham's pupil in the late 1970s. He has been bailed until 20 November.
