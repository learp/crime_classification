A senior civil servant was jailed for 18 months today after using London Underground's "Monty Pythonesque" fare refund scheme to feed his spiralling gambling addiction.Trushar Patel, 30, who worked for the former deputy prime minister John Prescott, recruited his wife, brother and mother to fill out thousands of customer charter forms and pocket Â£22,000.Using their own names, as well as a string of aliases, they spent years pretending they had suffered an average of eight delays a day on the Jubilee line.Once the refunds had been delivered to their home in Honeypot Lane, Stanmore, Middlesex, they were used to the buy travel cards, which were then exchanged for refunds.London's Southwark crown court heard that although many of the details provided on applications were false, it was not until they had received 7,105 vouchers that the scam was uncovered."The refund policy of London Underground is operated under a customer charter scheme which enables refunds to be made to passengers if their journey is more than 15 minutes late," said Francis Sheridan, prosecuting."As a scheme there is no doubt that it was a positive idea which encouraged efficiency within London Underground in that it was an incentive to ensure tubes ran on time."It was a good idea for customers in that those genuinely delayed would be properly compensated. That was the thinking behind the scheme."But that having been said, when it comes to its implementation it is right to say it was naive in its conception, it was naive in its execution, it was naivety beyond belief."The evidence in this case suggests the administration of this scheme was a complete shambles of Monty Pythonesque proportions."The information on the forms was incomplete and still processed. The information on the forms was false and still processed."No checks were carried out on the tubes claimed for, let alone checks on whether they were late or how many of the given tubes were delayed on any given day."In the dock with Patel were his pregnant wife, Dipti, 25, and his mother, Hansaben, 53 - who both had their nine-month prison sentences suspended for two years - and his brother, Jital, 29, who was jailed for 12 months.All pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to procure the execution of a valuable security between April 2004 and September last year.The two men also admitted plotting to launder the proceeds of criminal conduct.
