A motorcyclist who posted YouTube footage of himself speeding at up to 130mph and performing dangerous stunts was jailed for 12 weeks today.Sandor Ferenci raced on the wrong side of the road around Banbury, Oxfordshire, and carried out wheelies, wheelspins and skids before putting footage on the video-sharing site. The footage has since been removed from YouTube. The 28-year-old, who is as a care worker for an elderly woman, was also disqualified from driving for two years and ordered to take an extended driving test before being allowed on the road again.He pleaded guilty to two counts of dangerous driving at Oxford crown court.Judge Terence Maher told Ferenci he had carried out "lunatic and grossly irresponsible manoeuvres at considerable speed".The court heard that Ferenci was seen performing wheelies on his Yamaha R6 bike on the A422 Banbury to Brackley road on June 10.Brian Payne, prosecuting, said a motorist took down his registration number and contacted police, who traced him to his home in Banbury.The court heard that when officers arrived, Ferenci asked them: "Is this about the YouTube video?"Police then found he had posted video clips of himself on the internet.The footage, which was played to the court, had been filmed by a friend from various vantage points including a footbridge.It showed the bike performing wheelies, undertaking other vehicles and driving at speeds which police estimated could have reached up to 130mph.Gary Bell, defending, said Ferenci had read a story about a child who died as a result of a motorcycle accident and now understood the ramifications of what he had done.He said it was an "utterly sobering experience" for a "naive young man", adding: "He is truly remorseful."Ferenci pleaded guilty to the two charges at an earlier hearing at Banbury magistrates court and asked for a further offence to be taken into consideration.Maher told him: "We have heard the description of your driving, and the video clip ... shows an appalling piece of driving which your own barrister admits is extremely dangerous."Substantial pieces of road are passed on the rear wheel, and on two occasions you undertake motorists."It may be true that you posed the main danger to yourself, but there was a danger to other road users."He told Ferenci that driving any vehicle on the road was a responsibility and people had a duty to take care."A message must go out - if you drive in this way and are caught, serious consequences will follow," he said.
