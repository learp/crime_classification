Metropolitan police officers are being randomly tested for drugs as part of a wide-ranging clampdown on possible substance abuse, it emerged yesterday.Scotland Yard confirmed that police staff, community support officers and special constables are all open to tests. Probationers are also subject to screening, as are officers in "specialist and safety critical areas". Previously, tests were carried out to screen new recruits.The policy came into force on January 25 following the amendment of police regulations. It was drawn up in consultation with the Police Federation, the trade unions and staff associations.The tests involve taking saliva or urine samples, with an initial result available within minutes. An accredited, independent testing company is to be used in cases where further tests are required, but results will still be expected within 48 hours. The regime will test for amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabis, cocaine and opiates such as morphine and heroin, as well as benzodiazepine tranquillisers and sedatives.A Met spokeswoman said any employee who voluntarily seeks help with a substance misuse problem will still be offered confidential support. She added: "The use of illegal substances ... is proven to impair the judgment and performance of an individual. The MPS has a duty of care to its officers and staff, and the people of London, to deliver a high quality service, safely and efficiently."
