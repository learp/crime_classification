A third person has been arrested in connection with an attack on a heavily pregnant woman in south London that led to the loss of her unborn baby.Malorie Bantala, 21, was 32 weeks pregnant when she was set upon on 15 June by two men wearing motorcycle helmets metres from the door of the block of flats where she lived with her mother in Peckham. Kevin Wilson, 22, who was identified by Bantala as her child’s father, and a 17-year-old boy, have already appeared at the Old Bailey charged with causing grievous bodily harm and child destruction.The 16-year-old boy arrested on Thursday is suspected of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and child destruction. He was taken to a London police station and questioned before being released on bail, Scotland Yard said.After Wilson’s arrest, Scotland Yard had offered a £20,000 reward for information leading to the second suspect involved in the attack. Passersby watched in shock as Bantala was knocked to the ground, jumped on and kicked in the stomach. The attackers fled on foot before police arrived.Following the attack, the London Ambulance Service was forced to apologise when it emerged that police were forced to take Bantala to hospital themselves after waiting more than an hour for an ambulance that never arrived. Despite the loss of her baby, Bantala recovered after spending several days in a critical condition in intensive care. After her release from hospital, she was said to be devastated by the loss of her child.Both Wilson, from Bermondsey, south-east London, and the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been remanded in custody ahead of trial provisionally set for 30 November.
