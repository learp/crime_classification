Home Office ministers last night moved to stave off a humiliating defeat tomorrow over a key criminal justice bill.They tabled amendments to restore local accountability to the probation service and gave assurances that core tasks such as writing court reports will not be moved out of the public sector without further parliamentary approval.The government is in danger of defeat over the management of offenders bill because more than 40 Labour MPs have said they will vote to protect core probation tasks from takeover by voluntary organisations and the private sector. The Tories have said they will back the move.Defeat at the third reading tomorrow would be the government's first loss on an important bill since the row over incitement to religious hatred in January 2006, and would symbolise the limits of Tony Blair's drive to modernise the public services in his final days in Downing Street.The bill would scrap local probation boards and appoint "regional offender managers" who would buy probation and prison services from public, private and voluntary organisations, breaking a 100-year public service monopoly. More business-like local probation advisory trusts, appointed by the home secretary, would replace the existing boards.Gerry Sutcliffe, the minister responsible, said the "opposition to the bill is about doing something different. It is keeping the status quo which is not working."He said the last-minute government amendments would ensure local accountability by making it a statutory duty for regional offender managers to consult local probation trusts, local government, health and other agencies.They would also ensure the public probation service would not lose the task of writing court reports without a further vote in both houses of parliament, he said. He gave an assurance that the management of offenders would not move outside the public sector for the first two to three years. Prisoner resettlement and routine community punishments such as the unpaid work programme are expected to be among the first services handed to private and voluntary groups.Martin Wargent, the chief executive of the probation boards association, said yesterday that the bill was "a hugely centralising measure" transferring accountability for probation work from local people to the home secretary. He said an extra 1,600 Home Office headquarters staff had been hired even before the bill becomes law. "The probation service in its 100th year faces being broken up tomorrow," he said.
