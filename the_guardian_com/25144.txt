The daughter of a 94-year-old woman assaulted in her own home has issued an appeal for information to bring her attacker to justice.Joyce Blencoe described her horror at seeing the severe injuries inflicted on her mother, Emma Winnall, as she appealed for someone to turn in those responsible for the vicious beating.Speaking at a news conference in Birmingham, Blencoe said: "It's broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum in hospital manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came."To see your mum viciously beaten and covered in blood is the most horrific nightmare."Detectives believe that Winnall, from Moseley, Birmingham, was assaulted in her bed between 9pm on 30 April and 9am the next morning, when she was found by her carer.In her brief statement, Blencoe thanked the police and medical staff for their support since the attack.Making a direct appeal for information, Blencoe, sitting next to her brother John Winnall, said: "Someone out there knows who did this, so please come forward before they do it to someone else."If anyone knows what happened, if they have suspicions that certain people may be involved or have information, then please come forward. Don't let it happen to anyone else."Winnall, whose injuries included a fractured skull and a partially severed finger, is in a stable condition after surgery.
