Lindy West writes “all too often [rape] cases … cannot even get the attention of our justice system, let alone secure convictions” (G2, 14 December). That may be correct in the US, but it is not true in England and Wales. Our criminal justice system can always be improved, but here, men accused of rape are prosecuted and juries do convict. As a circuit judge, in the past eight months, I have tried nine cases involving allegations of rape and serious sexual assault against women and children. Juries convicted seven defendants.Judge Nic MadgeLondon• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
