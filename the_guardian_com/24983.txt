The equality minister, Harriet Harman, has announced a review of how rape cases are handled today, to improve the way police and prosecutors deal with complaints.Crossbench peer Lady Vivien Stern is to examine the way rape complaints are managed and report in the new year.But women's groups said the government had "failed to act" on rape and instead prioritised other crimes.Lisa Longstaff, representing Women Against Rape, said individual police officers are not being held to account for failing to investigate allegations properly.She said: "The government has failed, despite having had the time and opportunity to fix these problems."We have had review after review, research project after research project, and still women are not getting the protection of the law when they are raped or suffer domestic violence."She called for less talk and more action, and added: "The government has failed to make rape a priority."Last year around 6.5% of alleged rapes led to a conviction, and the proportion of cases resulting in successful prosecution is falling, official figures show.Earlier this year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the police watchdog, launched a review into how the Met handles rape and sexual assault complaints after a string of blunders were revealed in two high-profile cases.In the case of taxi-driver rapist John Worboys, police failed to link complaints from 14 women between 2002 and 2008 who said they had been drugged and attacked by a black-cab driver.And separately, it emerged that theserial sex attacker Kirk Reid was left free to prey on women for four years even though he was identified as a suspect.Announcing the review today, Harman said: "Many more women are reporting rapes, but the Reid and Worboys cases show that, despite this, these men were getting away with it time and time again."So I am concerned that we must have a systematic examination of the way rape complaints are handled: the Stern review will help identify good practice where those failures are happening so we can take action."Chief constable Dave Whatton, spokesman on rape for the Association of Chief Police Officers, accepted that the way police investigate rape is inconsistent across forces in England and WalesHe said: "Rape is a uniquely difficult crime to investigate. In recent years we have made significant advances in the way we approach investigation of this difficult offence but, despite that, delivery remains inconsistent and there is more we need to do."
