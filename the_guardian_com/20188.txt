Anti-social behaviour orders, a key government measure to combat low level crime and disorder, are being implemented haphazardly across England and Wales, a Home Office report said yesterday. Just 466 orders have been imposed since they were introduced in April 1999, costing an average Â£5,360. The report said it took an average of 66 working days to get an order granted and nearly six out of 10 cases required three or more court hearings. There were widespread variations in the way different areas of England and Wales used the orders. For example, when analysed by police force areas, Cheshire, Essex, Wiltshire and Dyfed Powys imposed no ASBOs, Gwent, North Wales and Lincolnshire one each while Cumbria, Bedfordshire and South Wales used two. In comparison, West Midlands handed out 65 and West Mercia 47. Each tailor-made ASBO contains measures to stop an individual's anti-social behaviour or prohibit them entering a specified area. Breaching an order is a criminal offence. A Home Office spokesman said the report found they had been used successfully to stop anti-social behaviour and had also acted as a deterrent. ASBOs against individuals also led to a reduction in anti-social behaviour in a community as a whole, he added. Home Office minister John Denham said: "The best practice that exists around the country must be shared to assist those areas that are not yet using ASBOs effectively." He recognised the need to make it easier to obtain ASBOs and had acted to do so. Proposed amendments to the police reform bill going through parliament will widen the authorities which can apply for ASBOs and introduce interim orders. The shadow home secretary, Oliver Letwin, said: "In principle, ASBOs are a good idea but the fact that fewer than 500 have been issued testifies to the truth of what the police and others have been saying about them, namely, that they are excessively bureaucratic."
