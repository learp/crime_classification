The killer who became the first person in UK legal history to be charged twice with the same offence - after the 800 year old double jeopardy law was changed - was today jailed for life.A judge at the Old Bailey told William Dunlop that he would serve a minimum tariff of 17 years in prison for killing Julie Hogg, 22, in 1989.The sentencing was the climax of a 15-year fight for justice by Ms Hogg's mother, Ann Ming, 60, which was a major factor in having the double jeopardy laws changed.Outside court, Ms Ming expressed some disappointment with the sentence, saying: "I would have liked life to have meant life. Julie's murder has devastated our family and left us in turmoil."Dunlop, 43, had pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey last month.The disappearance of the pizza delivery worker, from Billingham, Teesside, in November 1989, was initially treated as a missing person inquiry. But 80 days after her disappearance, her mother discovered her partially mutilated body behind a bath panel in her daughter's home.Dunlop, a labourer who lived nearby and who had had a brief relationship with the victim, was formally cleared of her murder after two juries failed to reach verdicts.However, after he was later jailed for another assault, he confessed to Ms Hogg's murder in 1999 to a prison officer, boasting that there was nothing anyone could do about it.The following year, he was jailed for six years for perjury. Earlier this year he was charged with Ms Hogg's murder again after the double jeopardy law was changed in 2005.Ms Ming and her husband, Charlie, 81, travelled to London from the family's home in Billingham to see Dunlop jailed today.In court, before sentencing, Ms Ming sobbed as prosecutor Andrew Robertson, QC, described her daughter's injuries.Mr Robertson said: "The overwhelming inference is that the deceased rejected him and was subjected to a violent sexual assault."Dunlop had said he strangled Ms Hogg after she taunted him about a black eye, but this was not accepted by the prosecution.Mr Robertson told the court: "Now the law has changed, in large part due to the long and persistent campaign by Mr and Mrs Ming who felt they and their daughter were being denied justice."A statement from Ms Ming was read to the judge, Mr Justice Calvert-Smith. In it, she said the shock and after-effects of finding the body after police had failed to discover it during a search "verges on the indescribable"."To this day, I can still smell the putrefied smell which was our daughter," she said. "As a family, we are damaged beyond repair and will never be the same again as Julie will never return home. The love we feel for Julie means it is we who are serving the life sentence."Timothy Owen QC, defending, said Dunlop had confessed through remorse and because he wanted to make a clean breast of his crime.Mr Justice Calvert-Smith said: "It is impossible to comprehend the shock and horror felt by her mother as she pulled away the panel and discovered her remains."He said there were signs of sexual degradation to the body before it was concealed.The judge said he could not take into account violent crimes committed by Dunlop since the murder, but they would be considered by the Parole Board, which would eventually decide when he would be released.After the sentencing, Crown Prosecution Service lawyer Martin Goldman said: "William Dunlop is a dangerous killer whose sentence today reflects the premeditated and truly horrendous nature of his crime. He has tried to escape responsibility for the murder of Julie Hogg for nearly 20 years and has put her family through great suffering in the process."The change to the double jeopardy law applies in England and Wales but not in Scotland. There are currently no other 'double jeopardy' prosecutions active but lawyers involved in the prosecution of Dunlop have said they have been contacted by other lawyers interested in pursuing such cases.
