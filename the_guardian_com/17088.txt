Blood traces found in the holiday apartment where Madeleine McCann was sleeping the night she disappeared did not come from the missing girl, it was reported today.Analysis of the tiny spots of blood found smeared on the bedroom wall showed it belonged to a man, according to the Times.The test results come after a fortnight of mounting speculation that the four-year-old girl was murdered in the Praia da Luz apartment. The results showed that the blood probably came from a man from the "north-east European sub-group". This conclusion is only 72% accurate, however, due to the poor condition of the sample because of its age and cleaning of the bedroom wall. The Forensic Science Service in Birmingham is now conducting further tests on the blood traces.A male guest is known to have injured himself while staying at the flat after Madeleine disappeared. This could explain why the blood was not found when Portuguese police searched the apartment after Madeleine's disappearance.Recent reports in the Portuguese media have quoted anonymous police sources as saying that detectives believe Madeleine died in the apartment the night she went missing.A spokesman for the Policia Judiciaria said yesterday that they were now working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead. But Inspector Oleg√°rio Sousa said they had not entirely ruled out other possibilities.Kate and Gerry McCann have clung to the hope that their daughter is still alive during the 105 days since she vanished while they ate dinner with friends at a nearby restaurant. But Mrs McCann has said she would rather know if her daughter was dead than remain in limbo for the rest of her life.
