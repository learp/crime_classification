The government has defied newspaper protests, signing up yesterday to the campaign for tougher sentences for those who steal personal details such as bank and phone records.Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs minister, said that "when parliamentary time allows", potential penalties will be increased, from the existing fines to a two-year maximum jail term."People have a right to have their privacy protected from those who would deliberately misuse it," he said.The move follows a mission by Richard Thomas, the information commissioner, for increased penalties over a "booming data black market", highlighted by his recent league table of newspapers showing which journalists had used the services of a convicted private detective.In recent prosecutions brought by Mr Thomas evidence emerged that not only papers but City law firms and divorcing couples were hiring private detectives to extract from call centres personal details belonging to banks, phone and utilities firms, and Whitehall departments."I look forward to the early introduction of legislation to bring about the necessary amendment to the Data Protection Act," said Mr Thomas yesterday.One of the government's motives is to reassure privacy campaigners who are protesting at the build-up of large state databases, including the health department's plans to upload everyone's medical details on to a new national computer.Existing legal defences for journalists, when they genuinely act in the public interest, will not alter. But Lord Falconer yesterday pointed the finger at editors who had not boosted self regulation. Papers have fought plans for greater penalties, claiming tough sentences will hamper free speech. The Guardian group expressed concern that there would be no guarantee that courts would agree with reporters on what had been "necessary" or in the "public interest". But yesterday Lord Falconer said part of the plan was to "ensure information was shared to expand opportunities for the most disadvantaged".
