Police investigating the robbery in which Craig Hodson-Walker, the son of a postmaster in Worcestershire, was shot dead, arrested eight people today.A spokesman for West Mercia police said four were arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder, and four others were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.The five men and three women were arrested at six addresses across Birmingham early this morning and are being held at a number of police stations.Speaking near the scene of the shooting, Superintendent Adrian Pass said more than 100 officers from the West Mercia and West Midlands forces had taken part in making the arrests.He said: "We understand the impact this incident has had on the local community and I would like to assure them that we shall continue with our high-visibility patrols in the area. We firmly believe that everyone living or working in north Worcestershire should be able to go about their business without feeling fearful and we hope that they will feel reassured by this morning's arrests."Hodson-Walker was shot in the chest and his father was shot in the leg at about 8.20am on Friday after four masked raiders tried to rob the post office and store in Fairfield. The 29-year-old lived and worked at the village post office with his parents, Ken and Judy.Hodson-Walker and his father were confronted by three of the raiders, who wore balaclavas and carried a handgun and a sledgehammer, shortly after they opened the shop. The gang escaped in a stolen silver Volkswagen Golf which was found abandoned soon afterwards.Following the attack, villagers described the sub-post office and shop as central to the small community. The family moved to the area several years ago after selling a business in the Forest of Dean. They took over the post office five years ago.The family won an award before Christmas for running one of the three best-performing post offices in the West Midlands. The Post Office has offered a Â£50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killers.
