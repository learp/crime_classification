The murder of two police officers in Manchester was an extraordinary and shocking event – and the reaction it provoked was extraordinary too.Watching the press conference by Greater Manchester Police, I was not the only journalist to remark that it looked and sounded more like one held by police in the USA where contempt laws hold no sway in the run-up to a trial.Here, as soon as someone is arrested, no one should publish anything which might cause a substantial risk of serious prejudice or serious impediment to the proceedings that might take place.So what happened in Manchester? I hesitate to repeat some of the statements and interviews carried by TV in the immediate aftermath of this horrific crime because of the very contempt laws I've mentioned. But if a newspaper in isolation had run an article using words like "lured" and "ambush" and framed them in the way the police did, I think the editor would have been charged with contempt. The remarks appear to be a classic contempt, threatening the suspect's ability to mount a defence.There is no public interest defence in the Contempt of Court Act 1981. Journalists often make the mistake of thinking that the qualified privilege which attaches to police press conferences is a defence against contempt. It is not, privilege only defends the media from libel.The attorney general Dominic Grieve has been put in a very awkward position – issuing warnings that he is watching coverage, when the most potentially prejudicial material appears to have emanated from Greater Manchester Police and the prime minister's statement following the killings.It would make for an interesting prosecution if newspapers and broadcasters were held in contempt for reporting information from the police and prime minister.This is not offered as criticism of Greater Manchester Police, they are grieving for the loss of two officers, killed just doing their duty. It is entirely understandable that in the moments following such an event they will react in the same way anyone else would.But what this situation does show is that the Contempt of Court Act – enacted in 1981, before the internet, before rolling TV news, before social media and smartphones – is no longer fit for purpose.In a fast-moving situation like the events on Wednesday, when the public are demanding information and reassurance, it is unrealistic to expect contempt to be at the forefront of the minds of police trying to react to such a shocking crime. Nor is it realistic to expect broadcasters covering such a press conference or indeed interviewing the prime minister, to turn off their cameras for fear of prejudicing a trial which will be months away.To then turn to the print media and say they cannot publish what millions have already seen on TV would seem entirely pointless.The Law Commission has started a review of this area of law, a public consultation will begin this winter with a report due in 2014. The project acknowledges that this area of law has not kept up with technological change.The permanence and ability to search online news archives also raises the worrying prospect of the media being expected to purge their archives of prejudicial material once someone has been arrested. At the moment the guidance from previous attorney generals has been that archive material can be left untouched, but the media should not actively link to it. It would be a huge task if they had to vet archives for potentially prejudicial material.Fundamentally, contempt law has failed to keep pace with the way people access information. Current contempt laws as they are enforced come down unduly hard on UK-based print media and their websites, while leaving live TV relatively free, and the internet entirely untamed.Dominic Grieve should worry more about what potential jurors are accessing on their phones rather than what fewer and fewer of them are reading in newspapers.
