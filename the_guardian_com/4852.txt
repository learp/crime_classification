A boy of 12 is fighting for his life after a suspected street knife attack that also left a 13-year-old boy seriously injured.Police arrested a 43-year-old man following the incident at the junction of Southleigh Road and Eastleigh Road in Havant, Hampshire, about 3pm on Friday.A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: “Two local children have been hurt and are being treated for injuries believed to have been caused by a knife.“A 12-year-old-boy has been taken to Southampton general hospital where his condition is described as life threatening.“A 13-year-old-boy has been taken to Queen Alexandra hospital at Cosham where his condition is described as serious but stable.”Extra police patrols are being deployed over the weekend, but officers said the incident was being treated as “isolated”.Chief Inspector Patrick Holdaway said: “My thoughts go out to the children who have been hurt and their families. We’re providing assistance to them at the current time and both children are being treated in hospital for their injuries.“We’d like to reassure the local community that no one else is being sought in connection with this assault at this time.“Thankfully no one else was hurt in the incident and there is no further risk to members of the public.“Our inquiries indicate that a school in the local area had an inset day, so there were not large groups of parents and children in the area when the assault happened, shortly before 3pm.Police on Friday night spoke to witnesses and appealed to anyone who may have seen anything out of the ordinary in the area shortly before 3pm to come forward.A police spokesman said: “Police deployed immediately to the scene and a 43-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested.“He has been taken into custody and detectives have commenced an investigation.”Anyone with information is asked to call Hampshire Constabulary on 101, quoting Operation Narrow.
