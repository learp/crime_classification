A man who was trying to kill an MP carried out a "terrifying attack" with a samurai sword, fatally stabbing the politician's assistant, a court was told yesterday.Robert Ashman, 52, hung his father's sword underneath his overcoat and went to the weekly surgery of the Cheltenham Liberal Democrat MP, Nigel Jones, Bristol crown court was told. When Mr Jones escaped, Ashman turned on Andrew Pennington, stabbing him him through the body six times, the jury was told. Pennington, 39, a Gloucestershire county councillor, died on the floor. Ashman denies attempting to murder Mr Jones on January 28, 2000. He also denies an alternative charge of wounding Mr Jones with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. But he has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the MP's aide on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The prosecution has accepted this plea. The case was adjourned until today when Mr Jones is expected to give evidence. Press Association
