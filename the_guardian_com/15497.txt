Prison and the threat of longer jail sentences is failing to deter Britain's career criminals, according to the head of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.Bill Hughes, director general of Soca, said that the organisation had to move away from its traditional reliance on the criminal justice system if officers were to start winning the war against organised crime barons. He said that removing the accumulated assets and wealth of "career criminals" was a more effective way to tackle organised syndicates than locking up individuals.Hughes, a former director general of the National Crime Squad, said organised crime masterminds were continuing to run their networks inside prisons, and on release were reunited with their assets.An investigation was launched last Friday into three Scotland Yard officers after an inmate in Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London obtained two mobile phones.Hughes said: "The trial can take a long time, and then they go to prison, and then they come out. And so we've said 'hold on', there are lots of areas outside the criminal justice system where we can act. When we do put them away, what we don't want is simply to allow their criminal markets and assets to remain, so they can carry on again. Plus, they run their businesses from inside prison."We [should] take away their criminal markets, put them out of business, take their assets and go after them."His comments reflect concern in Whitehall that the scale of organised crime in Britain is so vast that it outstrips the capacity of the criminal justice system. Between 25,000 and 30,000 individuals in around 4,000 criminal groups have been identified as running a black economy worth up to £40bn, according to a recent Cabinet Office report.Hughes said that Soca was working closely with the Asset Recovery Agency, and also using tax assessments to investigate whether individuals were guilty of serious tax evasion – the approach used by the FBI to imprison the American gangster Al Capone for 11 years in 1931. Soca is also employing the tactics used to track and freeze the assets of terrorist groups, and has revealed that it has adopted a principle called "lifetime offender management", which meant that once someone was on the police radar, they stayed there.One of Britain's most notorious criminals, Curtis Warren, was investigated by Soca while in prison, and this week a jury in Jersey is expected to consider whether Warren was ringleader of a gang accused of plotting to smuggle £1m worth of cannabis into the island. The jury in St Helier heard how Warren, 46, is the only drug trafficker on the Sunday Times Rich List, and was once Interpol's most wanted man.According to the Association of Chief Police Officers more than a quarter of organised crime groups are linked to registered companies, and 20% of these are thought to be used as fronts for illegal activity, such as money laundering and drug dealing. The businesses that were most commonly linked to organised crime included licensed premises, car dealerships, solariums, nail bars and massage parlours.A number of properties owned by a former soldier were last month revealed in Chelmsford crown court to be used as gun factories from which he supplied weapons to street gangs.Investigators said Paul Alexander converted replica guns in an Essex village and in Bath, and sold them for as little as £1,500, with ammunition, silencers and carrying cases, in what police have described as "assassination kits".
