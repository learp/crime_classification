Tony Blair has been questioned for a third time by police investigating the cash-for-honours inquiry, it emerged today.He was interviewed as a witness rather than a suspect, the Guardian understands.As recently as Monday the former prime minister's official spokesman, Tom Kelly, insisted that Mr Blair had not been questioned again. When Mr Blair was previously interviewed - the first time a serving prime minister had been part of a police investigation - Mr Kelly was deliberately kept out of the loop until after the event.In contrast with the last time that Mr Blair was interviewed, Scotland Yard said it was not prepared to discuss - or officially confirm - the latest meeting.Asked about why Number 10 had kept secret that Mr Blair had been questioned for a third time, Downing Street's new press spokesman said: "I am not the spokesman for the previous prime minister, and I have no comment to make."Mr Blair's own spokesman, Matthew Doyle, declined to comment.Mr Blair was spending his first full day since leaving office at his home in Co Durham, beginning work on his new role as a Middle East envoy."This new revelation comes as no surprise," said the Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil, whose complaint to police triggered the Scotland Yard investigation. "However, the fact it has been kept secret until Blair left office is extremely intriguing."Nobody is above the law, and it is vital that the police are allowed to continue with their extra investigations requested by the CPS. With Blair out of office, and with no claim to the Number 10 spin machine, it will be very interesting to see what the next few weeks hold."In April, Scotland Yard passed a 216-page dossier to the Crown Prosecution Service recommending that prosecutors consider bringing charges against three central figures over allegations that honours had been offered in return for party loans or donations.Detectives believed they had collected sufficient evidence for charges to be brought against Labour's chief fundraiser Lord Levy, the former senior Downing Street aide Ruth Turner, and the biotech millionaire and donor to Labour, Sir Christopher Evans. All three deny any wrongdoing."It is now a matter for the CPS to consider the evidence [and] advise us on whether any further inquiries are necessary and whether any charges should be brought," said a spokesman at the time.The three were arrested in connection with alleged offences under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. Lord Levy and Ms Turner have also been questioned in relation to a parallel inquiry concerning a possible conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.They remain on police bail.Earlier this month, the CPS asked police to "undertake further inquiries".A CPS spokeswoman said the development was "a normal part of the review process", but refused to clarify what additional information was being sought."We often ask the police for further clarification of particular aspects of a case," she said. "But we can't go into specifics." Altogether at least 136 people, including Mr Blair - have been questioned over the allegation that peerages were handed out in return for political donations.The investigation began after it emerged that secret loans had been made to Labour before the 2005 general election, and that some lenders had subsequently been nominated for peerages. The inquiry was later widened to cover the other main parties.
