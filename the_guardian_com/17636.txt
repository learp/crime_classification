A man who claims he was wrongly convicted of murdering an elderly woman eight years ago has had his case referred to the court of appeal after new forensic evidence emerged.Simon Hall was found guilty in 2003 of murdering one of his mother's friends, 79-year-old Joan Albert, who was stabbed to death in her home in Capel St Mary, Suffolk, in December 2001.Hall, who is now 31, has always maintained his innocence and the jury in the murder trial heard that fingerprints, footprints and DNA evidence found at the murder scene did not match the defendant's.Hall's wife, Stephanie, said: "We're all thrilled – Simon, me and Simon's family – and hopeful the conviction will be overturned and the truth will come out in the end."His family and supporters have disputed many elements of the prosecution's case, especially its reliance on fibre evidence. They have pointed out that Hall was a regular visitor to his mother's house, and that she frequently visited her friend Joan Albert.However, an appeal against conviction was dismissed in 2004 and his case has been before the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for more than four years.Yesterday the commission said that although it had examined a number of issues raised by Hall and his legal team, it had decided to refer the case on the weight of new forensic evidence alone."The referral is based … exclusively on a forensic development identified and pursued by the commission and centres on fresh forensic analysis of fibre samples taken from the crime scene and other locations during the original police investigation," a CCRC spokeswoman said today."The commission has decided to refer the case to the court of appeal because it believes that new forensic evidence is capable of undermining key forensic evidence presented at the trial and therefore raises the real possibility that the court would quash the murder conviction."Tests carried out for a 2007 BBC Rough Justice programme suggested that the fibres linking Hall to the murder scene should have contained glass, as Albert's killer entered through a broken window. They did not.Keir Starmer QC, who is now the director of public prosecutions, told the programme: "Simon Hall's case is really peculiar because there is no particular reason to believe he is guilty of this offence. The one crucial link is the fibre evidence. Break this and the case disappears.".
