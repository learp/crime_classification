West Midlands magistrates gave a blind man who was caught driving a car a 12-week suspended sentence today.Traffic police arrested Omed Aziz, who lost both his eyes in a bomb attack in Iraq, after he crossed a hazard line on the wrong side of the road shortly after 11pm on April 23.The 31-year-old had driven a white Peugeot 405 for up to half a mile through the streets of Oldbury at speeds of up to 35mph, while a friend shouted instructions from the back seat.He became the first blind person to be found guilty of dangerous driving when he was convicted last week.Asked whether he noticed anything unusual about Aziz when he removed the sunglasses he had been wearing, Constable Glyn Austin told the court: "I did. He didn't have any eyes."Chairman of the bench Richard Knight said Aziz, of Darlaston, West Midlands, had chosen to risk other people's safety.Warley magistrates ordered Aziz to change out of a T-shirt bearing the text "B4D MO7H3R FU5K3R" that he wore to court today, but, despite putting on a blue T-shirt for his sentencing, he changed back into the original T-shirt to leave the court.He had lost his eyes along with hearing in one ear and several fingers in the bomb attack.His friend, who had himself been banned from driving, guided him through two roundabouts and round a corner before the car was pulled over.
