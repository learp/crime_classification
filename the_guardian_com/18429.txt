Leading homelessness and drugs charities have condemned the government's plan to crack down on begging by making it a criminal offence.The three main homelessness charities, Centrepoint, Crisis and Shelter, have warned that criminalising begging would only further alienate vulnerable people and not tackle the underlying causes of the problem.The plans set out yesterday in a white paper on antisocial behaviour would give courts the power, after three convictions for begging, to impose community sentences, including drug treatment.Currently beggars are subject to local bylaws, which vary across the country. Prosecution is rare and in practice does not lead to a criminal record, say charities.Announcing the battery of new powers to curb "yob culture", the home secretary, David Blunkett yesterday said "no one in this country should beg".Adam Sampson, director of Shelter, said it was "morally wrong to criminalise poverty".He said: "The government's argument that prosecuting beggars will provide a gateway into treatment and support for people with drug problems is simply bogus."Roger Howard, chief executive of the UK's leading drugs charity DrugScope, said that criminalisation was a "profoundly misplaced response" to the problems faced by homeless people.He said: "More than nine out of 10 homeless young people have used drugs, and for many of these young people begging will be their only way to survive on the streets."Crimalising these vulnerable young people, with major health and social problems, is a profoundly misplaced response."Thames Reach Bondway, one of London's leading homelessness agencies, said the government's proposals amounted to punishment without care.Its chief executive, Jeremy Swain, said: "The majority of those who beg in London do so to raise money to buy heroin and crack cocaine. "Unfortunately agencies such as Thames Reach Bondway, who work everyday with drug users on the streets of the capital, have to wait up to 10 weeks to access detoxification services for drug users when, to make a real impact, these facilities should be available within 24 hours."
