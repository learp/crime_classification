More women are being attacked in pubs, on the street and in other public places, particularly during the summer, according to researchers who studied casualty records at 33 hospitals in England and Wales.The increase coincided with a 16% fall in violence against women in the home reported by the British Crime Survey between 1995 to 1997.A significant rise in the number suffering injury from violence in public, especially a 7% increase among those in their 30s and 40s, was reported over three years by accident and emergency departments selected at random by doctors at the University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff. The Cardiff researchers suggest, in the latest edition of Emergency Medicine Journal, that their figures are a more reliable indicator of trends than either police investigation and prosecution records or other surveys because they reflect the actual treatment of patients, shortly after injury and when attacks are fresh in the minds of both victims and those who accompany them to casualty. They say a previous study in just one area had found that rates of injury from attacks in pubs and on the street were higher than those from domestic violence. Violent offences are often not reported to authorities because of difficulties in identifying attackers, or a continuing relationship with them, fear of reprisals or antipathy towards the police. The researchers also note few facilities or sometimes little encouragement to do so in the accident and emergency departments themselves. But their study suggests that more than 900 women attending the hospitals in July 1998 were victims of violent attack. Nevertheless nearly three-quarters of all victims of assault are men and nearly half those are between 18 and 30, reflecting the heavy drinking culture of that age group.
