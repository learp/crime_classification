People who beat their partners could escape with a community sentence if they apologise for their actions, under plans that were dismissed today as "ludicrous".In new advice to judges, issued in draft form yesterday, the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) said remorseful domestic violence could get a community order or suspended sentence.Cases which might lead to the offender avoiding a jail sentence could include those where the attacker "shows genuine signs of remorse", or where both partners wanted to stay together, the advice said.Offenders would also be forced to attend courses to curb their violent behaviour.The head of a domestic violence charity has dismissed the plan as a "travesty". Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, urged ministers to reject the proposals which have gone to consultation before a final version is drawn up.She told the Daily Mail: "The idea that sending domestic violence perpetrators on courses as an alternative to a custodial sentence is ludicrous and would put more lives at risk."The SGC proposals are a backward step and will make a mockery of government's commitments to address domestic violence which, after all, kills two women a week."We know that rigorous arrest, charging and sentences in custody for these crimes acts as an effective deterrent. We want this policy put into practice."Nearly half of all female murder victims are killed by their partners or ex-partners. According to the British Crime Survey, 26% of women and 17% of men aged 16 to 69 have experienced domestic violence.The survey estimated there were 15m separate incidents a year.The SGC, chaired by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, stressed that domestic violence cases should be treated as no less serious than other violent crimes.But its new guidelines also said: "If the court is satisfied that the offender genuinely intends to reform his/her behaviour, and there is a real prospect of rehabilitation being successful, it may be appropriate to impose a sentence that will allow the offender to be rehabilitated."Rather than the imposition of a short custodial sentence, an appropriate disposal in such situations might be a suspended sentence order or a community order, in either case with a requirement to attend a domestic violence programme."Domestic violence should be punished more severely by the courts if it was witnessed by children, or if they were aware of it taking place elsewhere in the home, said the document.It also stressed that any assertion that the victim had "provoked" an attack should be "treated with great care".If the victim expressed any pleas for mercy on their partner's behalf the courts should be sure that they were genuine views and were not expressed under duress or did not put them at risk of further violence, it added.The hadow home secretary David Davis said: "The tragic events of the last two years in the failure to assess violent criminals who are given early release, probation or parole and have gone on to commit violent crimes, even murder, demonstrate how easy it is to make a mistake."Discretion as proposed by the SGC should only ever be used with extreme caution. Mistakes in this area could result in the most appalling consequences."A Home Office spokesman said: "These are draft guidelines which the government will comment on in due course in the usual way."The government believes prison is for dangerous, violent or sexual offenders, which is why we have legislated to ensure that such offenders, which includes perpetrators of the most serious cases of domestic violence, will spend longer in prison and in some cases be detained indefinitely."New special domestic violence courts give both victims and witnesses a stronger platform to get their voices heard and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice."
